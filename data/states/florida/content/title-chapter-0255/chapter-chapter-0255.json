However, this section in no way prohibits the right of any such official board to compare the quality of materials proposed for purchase and to compare the qualifications, character, responsibility, and fitness of materialmen, contractors, builders, and architects proposed for employment in its consideration of the purchase of materials or employment of persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no county official, board of county commissioners, school board, city council or city council members, or other public official, state board, or state agency charged with the letting of contracts or purchase of materials for the construction, modification, alteration, or repair of any publicly owned facility may specify the use of materials or systems by a sole source, unless: (1) The governmental body, after consideration of all available alternative materials and systems, determines that the specification of a sole material or system is justifiable based upon its cost or interchangeability; (2) The sole source specification has been recommended by the architect or engineer of record; and (3) The consideration by, and the justifications of, the governmental body are documented, in writing, in the project file.

(2) Every officer, department, board, agency or commission of the state, or of the political subdivisions thereof, responsible for the preparation of, or contracting for, plans and specifications for new public buildings, or for the substantial modification of or additions to existing public buildings, may require that the architect, architect-engineer firm, or other person or persons involved in the design of such buildings, provide a minimum protection factor of 40-to-1 or such protection as is possible within available funds in such design, or provide for consideration at the same time as the basic plan, alternate plans affording this protection. (3) The Division of Emergency Management shall, in those cases in which the architect-engineer firm does not possess the specialized training required for the inclusion of fallout protection in building design and upon request from the architect-engineer concerned or the responsible state or local agency, provide, at no cost to the architect-engineer or agency, professional development service to increase fallout protection through shelter slanting and cost-reduction techniques. (4) Nothing in this section establishes a mandatory requirement for the incorporation of fallout shelter in the construction of, modification of, or addition to the public buildings concerned. It is mandatory, however, that the incorporation of such protection be given every consideration through acceptable shelter slanting and cost-reduction techniques. The responsible state or local official shall determine whether cost, or other related factors, precludes or makes impracticable the incorporation of fallout shelter in public buildings. Further, the Division of Emergency Management may waive the requirement for consideration of shelter in those cases where presently available shelter spaces equal or exceed the requirements of the area concerned. (5) Nothing in this act shall apply to school buildings erected by the school board.

(h) “Proposal” means a plan for a qualifying project with detail beyond a conceptual level for which terms such as fixing costs, payment schedules, financing, deliverables, and project schedule are defined. (i) “Qualifying project” means: 1. A facility or project that serves a public purpose, including, but not limited to, any ferry or mass transit facility, vehicle parking facility, airport or seaport facility, rail facility or project, fuel supply facility, oil or gas pipeline, medical or nursing care facility, recreational facility, sporting or cultural facility, or educational facility or other building or facility that is used or will be used by a public educational institution, or any other public facility or infrastructure that is used or will be used by the public at large or in support of an accepted public purpose or activity; 2.

(l) “Service contract” means a contract between a responsible public entity and the private entity which defines the terms of the services to be provided with respect to a qualifying project. (2) LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT.—The Legislature finds that there is a public need for the construction or upgrade of facilities that are used predominantly for public purposes and that it is in the public’s interest to provide for the construction or upgrade of such facilities. (a) The Legislature also finds that: 1. There is a public need for timely and cost-effective acquisition, design, construction, improvement, renovation, expansion, equipping, maintenance, operation, implementation, or installation of projects serving a public purpose, including educational facilities, transportation facilities, water or wastewater management facilities and infrastructure, technology infrastructure, roads, highways, bridges, and other public infrastructure and government facilities within the state which serve a public need and purpose, and that such public need may not be wholly satisfied by existing procurement methods. 2. There are inadequate resources to develop new educational facilities, transportation facilities, water or wastewater management facilities and infrastructure, technology infrastructure, roads, highways, bridges, and other public infrastructure and government facilities for the benefit of residents of this state, and that a public-private partnership has demonstrated that it can meet the needs by improving the schedule for delivery, lowering the cost, and providing other benefits to the public. 3. There may be state and federal tax incentives that promote partnerships between public and private entities to develop and operate qualifying projects. 4. A procurement under this section serves the public purpose of this section if such procurement facilitates the timely development or operation of a qualifying project. (b) It is the intent of the Legislature to encourage investment in the state by private entities; to facilitate various bond financing mechanisms, private capital, and other funding sources for the development and operation of qualifying projects, including expansion and acceleration of such financing to meet the public need; and to provide the greatest possible flexibility to public and private entities contracting for the provision of public services. (3) PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES.—A responsible public entity may receive unsolicited proposals or may solicit proposals for a qualifying project and may thereafter enter into a comprehensive agreement with a private entity, or a consortium of private entities, for the building, upgrading, operating, ownership, or financing of facilities. (a)1. The responsible public entity may establish a reasonable application fee for the submission of an unsolicited proposal under this section. 2. A private entity that submits an unsolicited proposal to a responsible public entity must concurrently pay an initial application fee, as determined by the responsible public entity. Payment must be made by cash, cashier’s check, or other noncancelable instrument. Personal checks may not be accepted. 3. If the initial application fee does not cover the responsible public entity’s costs to evaluate the unsolicited proposal, the responsible public entity must request in writing the additional amounts required. The private entity must pay the requested additional amounts within 30 days after receipt of the notice. The responsible public entity may stop its review of the unsolicited proposal if the private entity fails to pay the additional amounts. 4. If the responsible public entity does not evaluate the unsolicited proposal, the responsible public entity must return the application fee. 5. If the responsible public entity chooses to evaluate an unsolicited proposal involving architecture, engineering, or landscape architecture, it must ensure a professional review and evaluation of the design and construction proposed by the initial or subsequent proposers to assure material quality standards, interior space utilization, budget estimates, design and construction schedules, and sustainable design and construction standards consistent with public projects. Such review shall be performed by an architect, a landscape architect, or an engineer licensed in this state qualified to perform the review, and such professional shall advise the responsible public entity through completion of the design and construction of the project. (b)1. The responsible public entity may request a proposal from private entities for a qualifying project or, if the responsible public entity receives an unsolicited proposal for a qualifying project and the responsible public entity intends to enter into a comprehensive agreement for the project described in the unsolicited proposal, the responsible public entity may publish notice in the Florida Administrative Register and a newspaper of general circulation at least once a week for 2 weeks stating that the responsible public entity has received a proposal and will accept other proposals for the same project. 2. The timeframe within which the responsible public entity may accept other proposals shall be determined by the responsible public entity on a project-by-project basis based upon the complexity of the qualifying project and the public benefit to be gained by allowing a longer or shorter period of time within which other proposals may be received; however, the timeframe for allowing other proposals must be at least 21 days, but no more than 120 days, after the initial date of publication. If approved by a majority vote of the responsible public entity’s governing body, the responsible public entity may alter the timeframe for accepting proposals to more adequately suit the needs of the qualifying project. A copy of the notice must be mailed to each local government in the affected area. (c) The responsible public entity may proceed with an unsolicited proposal for a qualifying project without engaging in a public bidding process if the responsible public entity holds a duly noticed public meeting at which the proposal is presented and affected public entities and members of the public are able to provide comment and, at a second duly noticed public meeting, determines that the proposal is in the public’s interest. In making the public interest determination, the responsible public entity must consider all of the following factors: 1. The benefits to the public. 2. The financial structure of and the economic efficiencies achieved by the proposal. 3. The qualifications and experience of the private entity that submitted the proposal and such entity’s ability to perform the project. 4. The project’s compatibility with regional infrastructure plans. 5. Public comments submitted at the meeting. The responsible public entity must provide a statement that explains why the proposal should proceed and addresses such comments. (d) If the responsible public entity decides to proceed with an unsolicited proposal without engaging in a public bidding process, the responsible public entity must publish in the Florida Administrative Register for at least 7 days a report that includes all of the following: 1. The public interest determination required under paragraph (c). 2. The factors considered in making such public interest determination. 3. The responsible public entity’s findings based on each considered factor. (e) If the solicited qualifying project provided in paragraph (b) includes design work, the solicitation must include a design criteria package prepared by an architect, a landscape architect, or an engineer licensed in this state which is sufficient to allow private entities to prepare a bid or a response. The design criteria package must specify reasonably specific criteria for the qualifying project such as the legal description of the site, with survey information; interior space requirements; material quality standards; schematic layouts and conceptual design criteria for the qualifying project; cost or budget estimates; design and construction schedules; and site development and utility requirements. The licensed design professional who prepares the design criteria package shall be retained to serve the responsible public entity through completion of the design and construction of the project. (f) Before approving a comprehensive agreement, the responsible public entity must determine that the proposed project: 1. Is in the public’s best interest, if the proposal was solicited. If the proposal was unsolicited, the responsible public entity must determine that the proposed project has been determined to be in the public’s interest in accordance with paragraph (c). 2. Is for a facility that is owned by the responsible public entity or for a facility for which ownership will be conveyed to the responsible public entity. For a proposed project that was unsolicited, if ownership will not be conveyed to the responsible public entity within 10 years after initial public operation begins, the public benefits apart from ownership must be identified and stated by the responsible public entity in the public interest determination required under paragraph (c). 3. Has adequate safeguards in place to ensure that additional costs or service disruptions are not imposed on the public in the event of material default or cancellation of the comprehensive agreement by the responsible public entity. 4. Has adequate safeguards in place to ensure that the responsible public entity or private entity has the opportunity to add capacity to the proposed project or other facilities serving similar predominantly public purposes. 5. If the proposal was solicited, will be owned by the responsible public entity upon completion, expiration, or termination of the comprehensive agreement and upon payment of the amounts financed. (g) Before signing a comprehensive agreement, the responsible public entity must consider a reasonable finance plan that is consistent with subsection (9); the qualifying project cost; revenues by source; available financing; major assumptions; internal rate of return on private investments, if governmental funds are assumed in order to deliver a cost-feasible project; and a total cash-flow analysis beginning with the implementation of the project and extending for the term of the comprehensive agreement. (h) In considering an unsolicited proposal, the responsible public entity may require from the private entity a technical study prepared by a nationally recognized expert with experience in preparing analysis for bond rating agencies. In evaluating the technical study, the responsible public entity may rely upon internal staff reports prepared by personnel familiar with the operation of similar facilities or the advice of external advisors or consultants who have relevant experience. (4) PROJECT APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS.—An unsolicited proposal from a private entity for approval of a qualifying project must be accompanied by the following material and information, unless waived by the responsible public entity: (a) A description of the qualifying project, including the conceptual design of the facilities or a conceptual plan for the provision of services, and a schedule for the initiation and completion of the qualifying project. (b) A description of the method by which the private entity proposes to secure the necessary property interests that are required for the qualifying project. (c) A description of the private entity’s general plans for financing the qualifying project, including the sources of the private entity’s funds and the identity of any dedicated revenue source or proposed debt or equity investment on behalf of the private entity. (d) The name and address of a person who may be contacted for additional information concerning the proposal. (e) The proposed user fees, lease payments, or other service payments over the term of a comprehensive agreement, and the methodology for and circumstances that would allow changes to the user fees, lease payments, and other service payments over time. (f) Additional material or information that the responsible public entity reasonably requests. Any pricing or financial terms included in an unsolicited proposal must be specific as to when the pricing or terms expire. (5) PROJECT QUALIFICATION AND PROCESS.— (a) The private entity, or the applicable party or parties of the private entity’s team, must meet the minimum standards contained in the responsible public entity’s guidelines for qualifying professional services and contracts for traditional procurement projects. (b) The responsible public entity must: 1. Ensure that provision is made for the private entity’s performance and payment of subcontractors, including, but not limited to, surety bonds, letters of credit, parent company guarantees, and lender and equity partner guarantees. For the components of the qualifying project which involve construction performance and payment, bonds are required and are subject to the recordation, notice, suit limitation, and other requirements of s. 255.05. 2. Ensure the most efficient pricing of the security package that provides for the performance and payment of subcontractors. 3. Ensure that the comprehensive agreement addresses termination upon a material default of the comprehensive agreement. (c) After the public notification period has expired in the case of an unsolicited proposal that is submitted and noticed for public bidding, the responsible public entity shall rank the proposals received in order of preference. In ranking the proposals, the responsible public entity may consider factors that include, but are not limited to, professional qualifications, general business terms, innovative design techniques or cost-reduction terms, and finance plans. The responsible public entity may then begin negotiations for a comprehensive agreement with the highest-ranked firm. If the responsible public entity is not satisfied with the results of the negotiations, the responsible public entity may terminate negotiations with the proposer and negotiate with the second-ranked or subsequent-ranked firms, in the order consistent with this procedure. If only one proposal is received, the responsible public entity may negotiate in good faith, and if the responsible public entity is not satisfied with the results of the negotiations, the responsible public entity may terminate negotiations with the proposer. Notwithstanding this paragraph, the responsible public entity may reject all proposals at any point in the process until a contract with the proposer is executed. (d) The responsible public entity shall perform an independent analysis of the proposed public-private partnership which demonstrates the cost-effectiveness and overall public benefit before the procurement process is initiated or before the contract is awarded. (e) The responsible public entity may approve the development or operation of an educational facility, a transportation facility, a water or wastewater management facility or related infrastructure, a technology infrastructure or other public infrastructure, or a government facility needed by the responsible public entity as a qualifying project, or the design or equipping of a qualifying project that is developed or operated, if: 1. There is a public need for or benefit derived from a project of the type that the private entity proposes as the qualifying project. 2. The estimated cost of the qualifying project is reasonable in relation to similar facilities. 3. The private entity’s plans will result in the timely acquisition, design, construction, improvement, renovation, expansion, equipping, maintenance, or operation of the qualifying project. (f) The responsible public entity may charge a reasonable fee to cover the costs of processing, reviewing, and evaluating the request, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney fees and fees for financial and technical advisors or consultants and for other necessary advisors or consultants. (g) Upon approval of a qualifying project, the responsible public entity shall establish a date for the commencement of activities related to the qualifying project. The responsible public entity may extend the commencement date. (h) Approval of a qualifying project by the responsible public entity is subject to entering into a comprehensive agreement with the private entity. (6) INTERIM AGREEMENT.—Before or in connection with the negotiation of a comprehensive agreement, the responsible public entity may enter into an interim agreement with the private entity proposing the development or operation of the qualifying project. An interim agreement does not obligate the responsible public entity to enter into a comprehensive agreement. The interim agreement is discretionary with the parties and is not required on a qualifying project for which the parties may proceed directly to a comprehensive agreement without the need for an interim agreement. An interim agreement must be limited to provisions that: (a) Authorize the private entity to commence activities for which it may be compensated related to the proposed qualifying project, including, but not limited to, project planning and development, design, environmental analysis and mitigation, survey, other activities concerning any part of the proposed qualifying project, and ascertaining the availability of financing for the proposed facility or facilities. (b) Establish the process and timing of the negotiation of the comprehensive agreement. (c) Contain such other provisions related to an aspect of the development or operation of a qualifying project that the responsible public entity and the private entity deem appropriate. (7) COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT.— (a) Before developing or operating the qualifying project, the private entity must enter into a comprehensive agreement with the responsible public entity. The comprehensive agreement must provide for: 1. Delivery of performance and payment bonds, letters of credit, or other security acceptable to the responsible public entity in connection with the development or operation of the qualifying project in the form and amount satisfactory to the responsible public entity. For the components of the qualifying project which involve construction, the form and amount of the bonds must comply with s. 255.05. 2. Review of the design for the qualifying project by the responsible public entity and, if the design conforms to standards acceptable to the responsible public entity, the approval of the responsible public entity. This subparagraph does not require the private entity to complete the design of the qualifying project before the execution of the comprehensive agreement. 3. Inspection of the qualifying project by the responsible public entity to ensure that the private entity’s activities are acceptable to the responsible public entity in accordance with the comprehensive agreement. 4. Maintenance of a policy of public liability insurance, a copy of which must be filed with the responsible public entity and accompanied by proofs of coverage, or self-insurance, each in the form and amount satisfactory to the responsible public entity and reasonably sufficient to ensure coverage of tort liability to the public and employees and to enable the continued operation of the qualifying project. 5. Monitoring by the responsible public entity of the maintenance practices to be performed by the private entity to ensure that the qualifying project is properly maintained. 6. Periodic filing by the private entity of the appropriate financial statements that pertain to the qualifying project. 7. Procedures that govern the rights and responsibilities of the responsible public entity and the private entity in the course of the construction and operation of the qualifying project and in the event of the termination of the comprehensive agreement or a material default by the private entity. The procedures must include conditions that govern the assumption of the duties and responsibilities of the private entity by an entity that funded, in whole or part, the qualifying project or by the responsible public entity, and must provide for the transfer or purchase of property or other interests of the private entity by the responsible public entity. 8. Fees, lease payments, or service payments. In negotiating user fees, the fees must be the same for persons using the facility under like conditions and must not materially discourage use of the qualifying project. The execution of the comprehensive agreement or a subsequent amendment is conclusive evidence that the fees, lease payments, or service payments provided for in the comprehensive agreement comply with this section. Fees or lease payments established in the comprehensive agreement as a source of revenue may be in addition to, or in lieu of, service payments. 9. Duties of the private entity, including the terms and conditions that the responsible public entity determines serve the public purpose of this section. (b) The comprehensive agreement may include: 1. An agreement by the responsible public entity to make grants or loans to the private entity from amounts received from the federal, state, or local government or an agency or instrumentality thereof. 2. A provision under which each entity agrees to provide notice of default and cure rights for the benefit of the other entity, including, but not limited to, a provision regarding unavoidable delays. 3. A provision that terminates the authority and duties of the private entity under this section and dedicates the qualifying project to the responsible public entity or, if the qualifying project was initially dedicated by an affected local jurisdiction, to the affected local jurisdiction for public use. (8) FEES.—A comprehensive agreement entered into pursuant to this section may authorize the private entity to impose fees to members of the public for the use of the facility. The following provisions apply to the comprehensive agreement: (a) The responsible public entity may develop new facilities or increase capacity in existing facilities through a comprehensive agreement with a private entity. (b) The comprehensive agreement must ensure that the facility is properly operated, maintained, or improved in accordance with standards set forth in the comprehensive agreement. (c) The responsible public entity may lease existing fee-for-use facilities through a comprehensive agreement. (d) Any revenues must be authorized by and applied in the manner set forth in the comprehensive agreement. (e) A negotiated portion of revenues from fee-generating uses may be returned to the responsible public entity over the life of the comprehensive agreement. (9) FINANCING.— (a) A private entity may enter into a private-source financing agreement between financing sources and the private entity. A financing agreement and any liens on the property or facility must be paid in full at the applicable closing that transfers ownership or operation of the facility to the responsible public entity at the conclusion of the term of the comprehensive agreement. (b) The responsible public entity may lend funds to private entities that construct projects containing facilities that are approved under this section. (c) The responsible public entity may use innovative finance techniques associated with a public-private partnership under this section, including, but not limited to, federal loans as provided in Titles 23 and 49 C.F.R., commercial bank loans, and hedges against inflation from commercial banks or other private sources. In addition, the responsible public entity may provide its own capital or operating budget to support a qualifying project. The budget may be from any legally permissible funding sources of the responsible public entity, including the proceeds of debt issuances. A responsible public entity may use the model financing agreement provided in s. 489.145(6) for its financing of a facility owned by a responsible public entity. A financing agreement may not require the responsible public entity to indemnify the financing source, subject the responsible public entity’s facility to liens in violation of s. 11.066(5), or secure financing of the responsible public entity by a mortgage on, or security interest in, the real or tangible personal property of the responsible public entity in a manner that could result in the loss of the fee ownership of the property by the responsible public entity, and any such provision is void. (10) POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE PRIVATE ENTITY.— (a) The private entity shall: 1. Develop or operate the qualifying project in a manner that is acceptable to the responsible public entity in accordance with the provisions of the comprehensive agreement. 2. Maintain, or provide by contract for the maintenance or improvement of, the qualifying project if required by the comprehensive agreement. 3. Cooperate with the responsible public entity in making best efforts to establish interconnection between the qualifying project and any other facility or infrastructure as requested by the responsible public entity in accordance with the provisions of the comprehensive agreement. 4. Comply with the comprehensive agreement and any lease or service contract. (b) Each private facility that is constructed pursuant to this section must comply with the requirements of federal, state, and local laws; state, regional, and local comprehensive plans; the responsible public entity’s rules, procedures, and standards for facilities; and such other conditions that the responsible public entity determines to be in the public’s best interest and that are included in the comprehensive agreement. (c) The responsible public entity may provide services to the private entity. An agreement for maintenance and other services entered into pursuant to this section must provide for full reimbursement for services rendered for qualifying projects. (d) A private entity of a qualifying project may provide additional services for the qualifying project to the public or to other private entities if the provision of additional services does not impair the private entity’s ability to meet its commitments to the responsible public entity pursuant to the comprehensive agreement. (11) EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF AGREEMENTS.—Upon the expiration or termination of a comprehensive agreement, the responsible public entity may use revenues from the qualifying project to pay current operation and maintenance costs of the qualifying project. If the private entity materially defaults under the comprehensive agreement, the compensation that is otherwise due to the private entity is payable to satisfy all financial obligations to investors and lenders on the qualifying project in the same way that is provided in the comprehensive agreement or any other agreement involving the qualifying project, if the costs of operating and maintaining the qualifying project are paid in the normal course. Revenues in excess of the costs for operation and maintenance costs may be paid to the investors and lenders to satisfy payment obligations under their respective agreements. A responsible public entity may terminate with cause and without prejudice a comprehensive agreement and may exercise any other rights or remedies that may be available to it in accordance with the provisions of the comprehensive agreement. The full faith and credit of the responsible public entity may not be pledged to secure the financing of the private entity. The assumption of the development or operation of the qualifying project does not obligate the responsible public entity to pay any obligation of the private entity from sources other than revenues from the qualifying project unless stated otherwise in the comprehensive agreement. (12) SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY.—This section does not waive the sovereign immunity of a responsible public entity, an affected local jurisdiction, or an officer or employee thereof with respect to participation in, or approval of, any part of a qualifying project or its operation, including, but not limited to, interconnection of the qualifying project with any other infrastructure or project. A county or municipality in which a qualifying project is located possesses sovereign immunity with respect to the project, including, but not limited to, its design, construction, and operation. (13) DEPARTMENT OF MANAGEMENT SERVICES.— (a) A responsible public entity may provide a copy of its comprehensive agreement to the Department of Management Services. A responsible public entity must redact any confidential or exempt information from the copy of the comprehensive agreement before providing it to the Department of Management Services. (b) The Department of Management Services may accept and maintain copies of comprehensive agreements received from responsible public entities for the purpose of sharing comprehensive agreements with other responsible public entities. (c) This subsection does not require a responsible public entity to provide a copy of its comprehensive agreement to the Department of Management Services. (14) CONSTRUCTION.— (a) This section shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes of this section. (b) This section shall be construed as cumulative and supplemental to any other authority or power vested in or exercised by the governing body of a county, municipality, special district, or municipal hospital or health care system including those contained in acts of the Legislature. (c) This section does not affect any agreement or existing relationship with a supporting organization involving such governing body or system in effect as of January 1, 2013. (d) This section provides an alternative method and does not limit a county, municipality, special district, or other political subdivision of the state in the procurement or operation of a qualifying project pursuant to other statutory or constitutional authority. (e) Except as otherwise provided in this section, this section does not amend existing laws by granting additional powers to, or further restricting, a local governmental entity from regulating and entering into cooperative arrangements with the private sector for the planning, construction, or operation of a facility. (f) This section does not waive any requirement of s. 287.055. History.—s. 2, ch. 2013-223; s. 1, ch. 2016-153; s. 1, ch. 2016-154; s. 7, ch. 2022-5; s. 1, ch. 2024-96. Note.—Former s. 287.05712.

(2) If a public entity disputes a portion of a payment request, the undisputed portion must be paid by the date required under the contract or by 20 business days after receipt of the request, whichever is earlier. (3) When a contractor receives payment from a public entity for labor, services, or materials furnished by subcontractors and suppliers hired by the contractor, the contractor shall remit payment due to those subcontractors and suppliers within 10 days after the contractor’s receipt of payment. When a subcontractor receives payment from a contractor for labor, services, or materials furnished by subcontractors and suppliers hired by the subcontractor, the subcontractor shall remit payment due to those subcontractors and suppliers within 7 days after the subcontractor’s receipt of payment. This subsection does not prohibit a contractor or subcontractor from disputing, pursuant to the terms of the relevant contract, all or any portion of a payment alleged to be due to another party if the contractor or subcontractor notifies the party whose payment is disputed, in writing, of the amount in dispute and the actions required to cure the dispute. The contractor or subcontractor must pay all undisputed amounts due within the time limits imposed by this subsection. (4) All payments due for the purchase of construction services and not made within the applicable time limits shall bear interest at the rate of 2 percent per month.

The contract must specify the process for the development of the list and for determining the cost to complete each item on the list, and should include the responsibilities of the public entity and the contractor in developing and reviewing the list and a reasonable time for developing the list, as follows: (a) For construction projects having an estimated cost of less than $10 million, within 30 calendar days after reaching substantial completion of the construction services purchased as defined in the contract, or, if not defined in the contract, upon reaching beneficial occupancy or use; or (b) For construction projects having an estimated cost of $10 million or more, within 30 calendar days, unless otherwise extended by contract not to exceed 45 calendar days, after reaching substantial completion of the construction services purchased as defined in the contract, or, if not defined in the contract, upon reaching beneficial occupancy or use. (2) If the contract between the public entity and the contractor relates to the purchase of construction services on more than one building or structure, or involves a multiphased project, the contract must provide for the development of a list of items required to render complete, satisfactory, and acceptable all the construction services purchased pursuant to the contract for each building, structure, or phase of the project within the time limitations provided in subsection (1). (3) The failure to include any corrective work or pending items not yet completed on the list developed pursuant to subsection (1) or subsection (2) does not alter the responsibility of the contractor to complete all the construction services purchased pursuant to the contract. (4) Within 20 business days after developing the list, and after receipt of a proper invoice or payment request, the public entity must pay the contractor the remaining balance of the contract, including any remaining retainage withheld by the public entity pursuant to s. 255.078, less an amount equal to 150 percent of the estimated cost to complete the items on the list. (5) Upon completion of all items on the list, the contractor may submit a payment request for all remaining retainage withheld by the public entity pursuant to s. 255.078. If a good faith dispute exists as to whether one or more items identified on the list have been completed pursuant to the contract, the public entity may continue to withhold an amount not to exceed 150 percent of the total costs to complete such items. (6) All items that require correction under the contract and that are identified after the preparation and delivery of the list remain the obligation of the contractor as defined by the contract. (7) Warranty items may not affect the final payment of retainage as provided in this section or as provided in the contract between the contractor and its subcontractors and suppliers. (8) Retainage may not be held by a public entity or a contractor to secure payment of insurance premiums under a consolidated insurance program or series of insurance policies issued to a public entity or a contractor for a project or group of projects, and the final payment of retainage as provided in this section may not be delayed pending a final audit by the public entity’s or contractor’s insurance provider. (9) If a public entity fails to comply with its responsibilities to develop the list required under subsection (1) or subsection (2), as defined in the contract, within the time limitations provided in subsection (1), the contractor may submit a payment request for all remaining retainage withheld by the public entity pursuant to s. 255.078 and the public entity must pay the contractor all remaining retainage previously withheld within 20 days after receipt of the payment request. The public entity is not required to pay or process any payment request for retainage if the contractor has failed to cooperate with the public entity in the development of the list or failed to perform its contractual responsibilities, if any, with regard to the development of the list or if s. 255.078(3) applies.

(2) Except as required by federal or state law, the state or any political subdivision that contracts for a public works project may not take the following actions: (a) Prevent a certified, licensed, or registered contractor, subcontractor, or material supplier or carrier, from participating in the bidding process based on the geographic location of the company headquarters or offices of the contractor, subcontractor, or material supplier or carrier submitting a bid on a public works project or the residences of employees of such contractor, subcontractor, or material supplier or carrier. This paragraph does not apply to a county or municipality that contracts for a public works project for which the county or municipality is the sole source of funding.

(2) The Office of Supplier Diversity, in collaboration with the Board of Governors of the State University System, shall adopt rules to determine what is a “good faith effort” for purposes of contractor compliance with minority participation goals established for competitively awarded building and construction projects. Pro forma efforts shall not be considered good faith. Factors which shall be considered by the state agency in determining whether a contractor has made good faith efforts shall include, but not be limited to: (a) Whether the contractor attended any presolicitation or prebid meetings that were scheduled by the agency to inform minority business enterprises of contracting and subcontracting opportunities. (b) Whether the contractor advertised in general circulation, trade association, or minority-focus media concerning the subcontracting opportunities. (c) Whether the contractor provided written notice to all relevant subcontractors listed on the minority vendor list for that locality and statewide as provided by the agency as of the date of issuance of the invitation to bid, that their interest in the contract was being solicited in sufficient time to allow the minority business enterprises to participate effectively. (d) Whether the contractor followed up initial solicitations of interest by contacting minority business enterprises, the Office of Supplier Diversity, or minority persons who responded and provided detailed information about prebid meetings, access to plans, specifications, contractor’s project manager, subcontractor bonding, if any, payment schedule, bid addenda, and other assistance provided by the contractor to enhance minority business enterprise participation. (e) Whether the contractor selected portions of the work to be performed by minority business enterprises in order to increase the likelihood of meeting the minority business enterprise procurement goals, including, where appropriate, breaking down contracts into economically feasible units to facilitate minority business enterprise participation under reasonable and economical conditions of performance. (f) Whether the contractor provided the Office of Supplier Diversity as well as interested minority business enterprises or minority persons with adequate information about the plans, specifications, and requirements of the contract or the availability of jobs at a time no later than when such information was provided to other subcontractors. (g) Whether the contractor negotiated in good faith with interested minority business enterprises or minority persons, not rejecting minority business enterprises or minority persons as unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities or imposing implausible conditions of performance on the contract. (h) Whether the contractor diligently seeks to replace a minority business enterprise subcontractor that is unable to perform successfully with another minority business enterprise. (i) Whether the contractor effectively used the services of available minority community organizations; minority contractors’ groups; local, state, and federal minority business assistance offices; and other organizations that provide assistance in the recruitment and placement of minority business enterprises or minority persons. (3) If an agency considers any other criteria in determining whether a contractor has made a good faith effort, the agency shall adopt such criteria in accordance with s. 120.54, and, where required by that section, by rule, after May 31, 1994. In adopting such criteria, the agency shall identify the specific factors in as objective a manner as possible to be used to assess a contractor’s performance against said criteria.

(2) A governmental entity may select a construction management entity, pursuant to the process provided by s. 287.055, which is to be responsible for construction project scheduling and coordination in both preconstruction and construction phases and generally responsible for the successful, timely, and economical completion of the construction project. The construction management entity must consist of or contract with licensed or registered professionals for the specific fields or areas of construction to be performed, as required by law. The construction management entity may retain necessary design professionals selected under the process provided in s. 287.055. At the option of the governmental entity, the construction management entity, after having been selected and after competitive negotiations, may be required to offer a guaranteed maximum price and a guaranteed completion date or a lump-sum price and a guaranteed completion date, in which case, the construction management entity must secure an appropriate surety bond pursuant to s. 255.05 and must hold construction subcontracts. If a project, as defined in s. 287.055(2)(f), solicited by a governmental entity under the process provided in s. 287.055 includes a grouping of substantially similar construction, rehabilitation, or renovation activities as permitted under s. 287.055(2)(f), the governmental entity, after competitive negotiations, may require the construction management entity to provide for a separate guaranteed maximum price or a separate lump-sum price and a separate guaranteed completion date for each grouping of substantially similar construction, rehabilitation, or renovation activities included within the project. (3) A governmental entity may select a program management entity, pursuant to the process provided by s. 287.055, which is to be responsible for schedule control, cost control, and coordination in providing or procuring planning, design, and construction services. The program management entity must consist of or contract with licensed or registered professionals for the specific areas of design or construction to be performed as required by law. The program management entity may retain necessary design professionals selected under the process provided in s. 287.055. At the option of the governmental entity, the program management entity, after having been selected and after competitive negotiations, may be required to offer a guaranteed maximum price and a guaranteed completion date or a lump-sum price and guaranteed completion date, in which case the program management entity must secure an appropriate surety bond pursuant to s. 255.05 and must hold design and construction subcontracts. If a project, as defined in s. 287.055(2)(f), solicited by a governmental entity under the process provided in s. 287.055 includes a grouping of substantially similar construction, rehabilitation, or renovation activities as permitted under s. 287.055(2)(f), the governmental entity, after competitive negotiations, may require the program management entity to provide for a separate guaranteed maximum price or a lump-sum price and a separate guaranteed completion date for each grouping of substantially similar construction, rehabilitation, or renovation activities included within the project. (4) A governmental entity’s authority under subsections (2) and (3) includes entering into a continuing contract for construction projects, pursuant to the process provided in s. 287.055, in which the estimated construction cost of each individual project under the contract does not exceed $7.5 million. Beginning July 1, 2025, and each July 1 thereafter, the Department of Management Services shall adjust the maximum amount allowed on the preceding June 30 for each individual project in a continuing contract by using the change in the June-to-June Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. The Department of Management Services shall publish the adjusted amount on its website. For purposes of this subsection, the term “continuing contract” means a contract with a construction management or program management entity for work during a defined period on construction projects described by type which may or may not be identified at the time of entering into the contract. (5) This section does not prohibit a local government from procuring construction management services, including the services of a program management entity, pursuant to the requirements of s. 255.20.

      "text": "255.252 Findings and intent.— (1) Operating and maintenance expenditures associated with energy equipment and with energy consumed in state-financed and leased buildings represent a significant cost over the life of a building. Energy conserved by appropriate building design not only reduces the demand for energy but also reduces costs for building operation. The size, design, orientation, and operability of windows, the ratio of ventilating air to air heated or cooled, the level of lighting consonant with space-use requirements, the handling of occupancy loads, and the ability to zone off areas not requiring equivalent levels of heating or cooling are but a few of the considerations necessary to conserving energy. (2) Significant efforts are needed to build energy-efficient state-owned buildings that meet environmental standards and provide energy savings over the life of the building structure. With buildings lasting many decades and with energy costs escalating rapidly, it is essential that the costs of operation and maintenance for energy-using equipment and sustainable materials be included in all design proposals for state-owned buildings. (3) In order for energy-efficiency and sustainable materials considerations to become a function of building design and a model for future application in the private sector, it is the policy of the state that buildings constructed and financed by the state be designed and constructed to comply with a sustainable building rating or a national model green building code. It is further the policy of the state, if economically feasible, to retrofit existing state-owned buildings in a manner that minimizes the consumption of energy used in the operation and maintenance of such buildings. (4) In addition to designing and constructing new buildings to be energy-efficient, it is the policy of the state to operate and maintain state facilities in a manner that minimizes energy consumption and maximizes building sustainability and to operate facilities leased by the state so as to minimize energy use. It is further the policy of the state that the renovation of existing state facilities be in accordance with a sustainable building rating or a national model green building code. State agencies are encouraged to consider shared savings financing of energy-efficiency and conservation projects, using contracts that split the resulting savings for a specified period of time between the state agency and the private firm or cogeneration contracts and that otherwise permit the state to lower its net energy costs. Such energy contracts may be funded from the operating budget. The vendor for such energy contracts may be selected in accordance with s. 287.055. (5) Each state agency occupying space within buildings owned or managed by the Department of Management Services must identify and compile a list of projects determined to be suitable for a guaranteed energy, water, and wastewater performance savings contract pursuant to s. 489.145. The list of projects compiled by each state agency shall be submitted to the Department of Management Services by December 31, 2008, and must include all criteria used to determine suitability. The list of projects shall be developed from the list of state-owned facilities more than 5,000 square feet in area and for which the state agency is responsible for paying the expenses of utilities and other operating expenses as they relate to energy use. In consultation with the head of each state agency, by July 1, 2009, the department shall prioritize all projects deemed suitable by each state agency and shall develop an energy-efficiency project schedule based on factors such as project magnitude, efficiency and effectiveness of energy conservation measures to be implemented, and other factors that may prove to be advantageous to pursue. The schedule shall provide the deadline for guaranteed energy, water, and wastewater performance savings contract improvements to be made to the state-owned buildings.

These data will be used in the computation of the effectiveness of the state energy management plan and the effectiveness of the energy management program of each of the state agencies. Collected data shall be reported annually to the department in a format prescribed by the department. (2) ENERGY MANAGEMENT COORDINATORS.—Each state agency, the Florida Public Service Commission, the Department of Military Affairs, and the judicial branch shall appoint a coordinator whose responsibility shall be to advise the head of the state agency on matters relating to energy consumption in facilities under the control of that head or in space occupied by the various units comprising that state agency, in vehicles operated by that state agency, and in other energy-consuming activities of the state agency. The coordinator shall implement the energy management program agreed upon by the state agency concerned and assist the department in the development of the State Energy Management Plan. (3) CONTENTS OF THE STATE ENERGY MANAGEMENT PLAN.—The Department of Management Services, in coordination with the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, shall further develop the state energy management plan consisting of, but not limited to, the following elements: (a) Data-gathering requirements; (b) Building energy audit procedures; (c) Uniform data analysis and reporting procedures; (d) Employee energy education program measures; (e) Energy consumption reduction techniques; (f) Training program for state agency energy management coordinators; and (g) Guidelines for building managers. The plan shall include a description of actions that state agencies shall take to reduce consumption of electricity and nonrenewable energy sources used for space heating and cooling, ventilation, lighting, water heating, and transportation. (4) ADOPTION OF STANDARDS.— (a) Each state agency shall use a sustainable building rating system or a national model green building code for each new building and renovation to an existing building. (b) No state agency shall enter into new leasing agreements for office space that does not meet Energy Star building standards, except when the appropriate state agency head determines that no other viable or cost-effective alternative exists. (c) All state agencies shall develop energy conservation measures and guidelines for new and existing office space where state agencies occupy more than 5,000 square feet. These conservation measures shall focus on programs that may reduce energy consumption and, when established, provide a net reduction in occupancy costs.

The Legislature further finds that “Florida-friendly landscaping,” as defined in s. 373.185, can contribute significantly to water conservation and water quality protection and restoration. Finally, the Legislature finds that state government has the responsibility to promote Florida-friendly landscaping as a water conservation and water quality protection and restoration measure by using such landscaping on public property associated with publicly owned buildings or facilities. (2) As used in this section, “publicly owned buildings or facilities” means construction projects under the purview of the Department of Management Services. The term does not include environmentally endangered land or roads and highway construction under the purview of the Department of Transportation. (3) The Department of Management Services, in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, shall adopt rules and guidelines for the required use of Florida-friendly landscaping on public property associated with publicly owned buildings or facilities constructed after June 30, 2009. The Department of Management Services shall also develop a 5-year program for phasing in the use of Florida-friendly landscaping on public property associated with publicly owned buildings or facilities constructed before July 1, 2009. In accomplishing these tasks, the Department of Management Services shall take into account the standards provided in s. 373.185. The Department of Transportation shall implement Florida-friendly landscaping pursuant to s. 335.167. (4)(a) The Legislature finds that the use of Florida-friendly landscaping and other water use and pollution prevention measures to conserve or protect the state’s water resources serves a compelling public interest and that the participation of homeowners’ associations and local governments is essential to the state’s efforts in water conservation and water quality protection and restoration. (b) A deed restriction or covenant may not prohibit or be enforced so as to prohibit any property owner from implementing Florida-friendly landscaping on his or her land or create any requirement or limitation in conflict with any provision of part II of chapter 373 or a water shortage order, other order, consumptive use permit, or rule adopted or issued pursuant to part II of chapter 373. (c) A local government ordinance may not prohibit or be enforced so as to prohibit any property owner from implementing Florida-friendly landscaping on his or her land.
