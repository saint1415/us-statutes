However, if the recreational vehicle park gave a receipt for the property, which receipt had a statement of the property value on a form which stated, in type large enough to be clearly noticeable, that such park was not liable for a greater amount than $1,000 for any loss exceeding $1,000 and was only liable for an amount up to $1,000 if the loss was the proximate result of fault or negligence of the operator, the liability of the operator is limited to $1,000 for such loss. (2) The operator of a recreational vehicle park is not liable or responsible to any guest for the loss of wearing apparel, goods, or other property, except as provided in subsection (1), unless such loss occurred as the proximate result of fault or negligence of such operator; and, in case of fault or negligence, the operator is not liable for a greater sum than $500, unless the guest, prior to the loss or damage, filed with the operator an inventory of the guest’s effects and their value and the operator was given an opportunity to inspect such effects and check them against such inventory. The operator of a recreational vehicle park is not liable or responsible to any guest for a greater amount than $1,000 for the loss of effects listed in such inventory as having a value of a total amount exceeding $1,000.

(2) The operator of a recreational vehicle park may request that a transient guest or visitor who violates subsection (1) leave the premises immediately. A person who refuses to leave the premises commits the offense of trespass as provided in s. 810.08, and the operator may call a law enforcement officer to have the person and his or her property removed under the supervision of the officer. A law enforcement officer is not liable for any claim involving the removal of the person or property from the recreational vehicle park under this section, except as provided in s. 768.28.

The admission of a person to, or the removal of a person from, any recreational vehicle park may not be based upon race, color, national origin, sex, physical disability, or creed. (2) The operator of any recreational vehicle park shall notify such guest that the park no longer desires to entertain the guest and shall request that such guest immediately depart from the park. Such notice shall be given in writing, as follows: “You are hereby notified that this recreational vehicle park no longer desires to entertain you as its guest, and you are requested to leave at once. To remain after receipt of this notice is a misdemeanor under the laws of this state.” If such guest has paid in advance, the park shall, at the time such notice is given, tender to the guest the unused portion of the advance payment. Any guest who remains or attempts to remain in such park after being requested to leave commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (3) If a guest has accumulated an outstanding account in excess of an amount equivalent to 3 nights’ rent at a recreational vehicle park, the operator may disconnect all utilities of the recreational vehicle and notify the guest that the action is for the purpose of requiring the guest to confront the operator or permittee and arrange for the payment of the guest’s account. Such arrangement must be in writing, and a copy shall be furnished to the guest. Upon entering into such agreement, the operator shall reconnect the utilities of the recreational vehicle. (4) If any person is illegally on the premises of any recreational vehicle park, the operator of such park may call upon any law enforcement officer of this state for assistance. It is the duty of such law enforcement officer, upon the request of such operator, to remove from the premises or place under arrest any guest who, according to the park operator, violated subsection (1) or subsection (2). If a warrant has been issued by the proper judicial officer for the arrest of any guest who violates subsection (1) or subsection (2), the officer shall serve the warrant, arrest the guest, and take the guest into custody. Upon removal or arrest, with or without warrant, the guest is deemed to have abandoned or given up any right to occupancy of the premises of the recreational vehicle park; and the operator of the park shall employ all reasonable and proper means to care for any personal property left on the premises by such guest and shall refund any unused portion of moneys paid by such guest for the occupancy of such premises. If conditions do not allow for immediate removal of the guest’s property, he or she may arrange a reasonable time, not to exceed 48 hours, with the operator to come remove the property, accompanied by a law enforcement officer. (5) In addition to the grounds for ejection established by law, grounds for ejection may be established in a written lease agreement between a recreational vehicle park operator or permittee and a recreational vehicle park guest.
