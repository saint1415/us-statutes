The powers which may be granted by such charter include the following: (1) To sue and be sued and to have a corporate seal. (2) To contract and be contracted with. (3) To acquire, purchase, construct, improve, and equip recreational facilities of all types, including real and personal property, within the boundaries of the district; such acquisition may be by purchase, lease, gift, or exercise of the power of eminent domain. If the governing body of the municipality or county that created the recreation district for exclusive use by a condominium established under chapter 718 or a cooperative established under chapter 719 makes the finding described in s. 418.24(4), the governing body of the district may make the recreational facilities available exclusively for district residents and property owners, and may restrict any access to recreational facilities by nonresidents by rules adopted by the governing body of the district. Prior to any vote of the electors in the district adopting or amending a charter pursuant to s. 418.20, the governing body shall decide whether the criteria in s. 418.24(4) apply and whether the recreation district shall be available exclusively for the district residents. The recreation district may construct and maintain security buildings and other structures needed to regulate access to, and provide security for, the recreational facilities. (4) To issue bonds, secured by ad valorem taxes or by pledge of both such taxes and other revenues of the district, if approved at a referendum held in such district, and to levy and collect ad valorem taxes, without limitation or with such limitation as may be imposed by charter, on all real property subject to city taxation within such district in order to pay the principal of and interest on such bonds as the same respectively fall due or to accumulate a sinking fund for the payment of principal and interest. The referendum required by this section may be held on the same day as any other referendum related to the district; provided that such bonds shall bear interest at a rate pursuant to s. 215.84 and be sold at public sale. In the event an offer of an issue of bonds at public sale produces no bid, or in the event all bids received are rejected, the district is authorized to negotiate for the sale of such bonds under such rates and terms as are acceptable; provided that no such bonds shall be sold or delivered on terms less favorable than the terms contained in any bids rejected at the public sale thereof or the terms contained in the notice of public sale if no bids were received at such public sale. (5) To operate and maintain recreational facilities or to enter into arrangements with others for such operation and maintenance pursuant to contract, lease, or otherwise. (6) To establish, charge, and collect fees for admission to or use of recreational facilities and to apply such fees to the operation, maintenance, improvement, enlargement, or acquisition of recreational facilities or to the payment of bonds or revenue bonds of the district. (7) To issue revenue bonds payable solely from the revenues to be derived from recreational facilities owned or operated by such district if approved at a referendum held in such district; provided that such bonds shall bear interest at a rate pursuant to s. 215.84 and be sold at public sale. In the event an offer of an issue of bonds at public sale produces no bid, or in the event all bids received are rejected, the district is authorized to negotiate for the sale of such bonds under such rates and terms as are acceptable; provided that no such bonds shall be so sold or delivered on terms less favorable than the terms contained in any bids rejected at the public sale thereof or the terms contained in the notice of public sale if no bids were received at such public sale. (8) To adopt and enforce rules for the use of the recreational facilities owned or operated by the district. (9) To employ all personnel deemed necessary for the operation and maintenance of the facilities of the district. History.—s. 2, ch. 78-237; s. 29, ch. 83-215; s. 25, ch. 94-350.

The supervisor of elections shall be entitled to a reasonable reimbursement for conducting the election, payable out of the general funds of the district. (2) The ordinance creating the district shall specify the date of the election. Notice of the election, setting forth the names of the persons proposed as trustees of the district, shall be given by the supervisor of elections by mail addressed to each qualified elector not less than 15 days before the date of the election. Such notice shall also be published one time at least 10 days prior to the election in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county. If no such newspaper is published in the county, the supervisor of elections shall cause written or printed notices of the election to be posted in five public places within the district. Notwithstanding the provisions of s. 101.20, the publication of a sample ballot is not required. (3) In the election held to elect the first board of trustees for the district, the candidates receiving the first, third, fifth, seventh, and ninth highest number of votes shall be elected to serve for terms of 2 years each, and the candidates receiving the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth highest number of votes shall be elected to serve for terms of 1 year each. Thereafter, elections for the board of trustees shall be held annually on a date to be specified in the ordinance creating the district, and those persons elected after the initial election shall be elected to serve for terms of 2 years each. A trustee may succeed herself or himself in office. (4) After each election, the board of trustees shall organize itself by electing from its number a chair, two vice chairs, a secretary, and a treasurer. The trustees may not receive any compensation for their services, but shall be entitled to be reimbursed from funds of the district for any authorized disbursements they may properly incur in behalf of the district. Each trustee who is authorized to sign checks of the district or is otherwise designated to handle its funds shall, before she or he enters upon such duties, execute to the Governor, for the benefit of the district, a good and sufficient bond, approved by a circuit judge of the county in which the district is established, in the sum of $10,000 with a qualified corporate surety, conditioned to faithfully perform the duties of her or his office and to account for all funds which may come into her or his hands as such trustee. All premiums for the surety on such bonds shall be paid from the funds of the district. The trustees shall conduct their business as a public body and shall be subject to all laws of the state relating to open government, financial disclosure, avoidance of conflicts of interest, and ethics. (5) Any vacancy on the board of trustees shall be filled for the unexpired term by the appointment of a successor from among the qualified electors of the district by the remaining trustees. Any trustee who fails to discharge her or his duties may be removed for cause by the board of trustees after due notice and an opportunity to be heard upon charges of malfeasance or misfeasance. A trustee who is not guilty of malfeasance or misfeasance in office is relieved of any personal liability for acts done by her or him while holding office. Except with respect to matters wherein it is adjudged that the trustee is liable for gross negligence or misconduct in the performance of her or his duties, a trustee who is made a party to any action, suit, or proceeding solely by reason of her or his holding office in the district shall be indemnified by the district against reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by the trustee in defending such suit, action, or proceeding.
