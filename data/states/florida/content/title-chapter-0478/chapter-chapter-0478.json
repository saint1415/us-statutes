      "text": "478.41 Purpose and intent.—The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the licensure of persons who deliver electrolysis services and to ensure that they meet certain requirements. It is the finding of the Legislature that the practice of electrology by unskilled or incompetent persons presents a danger to the public health and safety. Because it is difficult for the public to make informed choices related to electrolysis services and since the consequences of wrong choices can harm the public health and safety, it is the intent of the Legislature to prohibit the delivery of electrolysis services by persons who do not possess the necessary skills or who otherwise present a danger to the public. However, restrictions may be imposed only to the extent necessary to protect the public and in a manner that will not unreasonably affect the competitive market for the delivery of such services.

Only one temporary permit shall be issued to an applicant, and it shall not be renewable. (2)(a) If the executive director of the board determines that an applicant is qualified for licensure by examination except for passage of the examination and has applied for the next scheduled examination, the executive director may issue the applicant a nonrenewable temporary permit to practice electrology under the supervision of a licensed electrologist until notification of the results of the examination. (b) The temporary permit of a person who fails such examination is automatically revoked upon notification of the examination results, and the applicant shall cease the practice of electrology immediately upon receipt of such notice. (c) An applicant with a temporary permit who passes such examination may continue to practice under such temporary permit until the next meeting of the board at which license applications are to be considered. (3) As used in subsection (2), “supervision” means responsible control by a licensed electrologist who provides the initial direction in developing a treatment plan and also periodically inspects the permittee’s implementation of such plan, which plan may not be altered by the permittee without the prior consultation and approval of the supervisor. A supervisor shall be available to consult with and direct a permittee in an emergency, although the supervisor does not have to be on the premises while the permittee is delivering electrolysis services.
