(3) “Opticianry” means the preparation and dispensing of lenses, spectacles, eyeglasses, contact lenses, and other optical devices to the intended user or agent thereof, upon the written prescription of a licensed allopathic or osteopathic physician or optometrist who is duly licensed to practice or upon presentation of a duplicate prescription. The selection of frame designs, the actual sales transaction, and the transfer of physical possession of lenses, spectacles, eyeglasses, contact lenses, and other optical devices subsequent to performance of all services of the optician shall not be considered the practice of opticianry; however, such physical possession shall not be transferred until the optician has completed the fitting of the optical device upon the customer. The practice of opticianry also includes the duplication of lenses accurately as to power, without prescription. A board-certified optician qualified and operating under rules established by the board may fill, fit, adapt, or dispense any soft contact lens prescription. Such optician may fill, fit, adapt, or dispense any extended wear or hard contact lens prescription to the extent authorized to do so by the prescribing allopathic or osteopathic physician or optometrist. (4) “Optician” means any person licensed to practice opticianry pursuant to this part.

(7) “Optical establishment” means any establishment in the state which offers, advertises, and performs opticianry services for the general public. (8) “Contact lenses” means a prescribed medical device intended to be worn directly against the cornea of the eye to correct vision conditions, act as a therapeutic device, or provide a cosmetic effect.

It recognizes that a poorly selected or fitted prescription hearing aid not only will give little satisfaction but may interfere with hearing ability and, therefore, deems it necessary in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare to regulate the dispensing of prescription hearing aids in this state. Restrictions on the fitting and selling of prescription hearing aids shall be imposed only to the extent necessary to protect the public from physical and economic harm, and restrictions shall not be imposed in a manner which will unreasonably affect the competitive market.

      "text": "484.059 Exemptions.— (1) The licensure requirements of this part do not apply to any person engaged in recommending prescription hearing aids as part of the academic curriculum of an accredited institution of higher education, or as part of a program conducted by a public charitable institution supported primarily by voluntary contribution, provided this organization does not dispense or sell prescription hearing aids or accessories. (2) The licensure requirements of this part do not apply to any person licensed to practice medicine in this state, except that such physician must comply with the requirement of periodic filing of the certificate of testing and calibration of audiometric equipment as provided in this part. A person employed by or working under the supervision of a person licensed to practice medicine may not perform any services or acts which would constitute the dispensing of prescription hearing aids as defined in s. 484.041, unless such person is a licensed hearing aid specialist. (3) The licensure requirements of this part do not apply to an audiologist licensed under part I of chapter 468. (4) Section 484.053(1)(a) does not apply to registered trainees operating in compliance with this part and board rules. (5) The licensure requirements of this part do not apply to a person who services, markets, sells, dispenses, provides customer support for, or distributes exclusively over-the-counter hearing aids, whether through in-person transactions, by mail, or online. For purposes of this subsection, over-the-counter hearing aids are those that are available without the supervision, prescription, or other order, involvement, or intervention of a licensed person to consumers through in-person transactions, by mail, or online. These devices allow the user to control the device and customize it to the user’s hearing needs through the use of tools, tests, or software, including, but not limited to, wireless technology or tests for self-assessment of hearing loss.
