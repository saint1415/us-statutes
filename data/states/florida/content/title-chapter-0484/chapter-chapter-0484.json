A person employed by or working under the supervision of a person licensed to practice medicine may not perform any services or acts which would constitute the dispensing of prescription hearing aids as defined in s. 484.041, unless such person is a licensed hearing aid specialist.(3)The licensure requirements of this part do not apply to an audiologist licensed under part I of chapter 468.(4)Section 484.053(1)(a) does not apply to registered trainees operating in compliance with this part and board rules.(5)The licensure requirements of this part do not apply to a person who services, markets, sells, dispenses, provides customer support for, or distributes exclusively over-the-counter hearing aids, whether through in-person transactions, by mail, or online. For purposes of this subsection, over-the-counter hearing aids are those that are available without the supervision, prescription, or other order, involvement, or intervention of a licensed person to consumers through in-person transactions, by mail, or online.
