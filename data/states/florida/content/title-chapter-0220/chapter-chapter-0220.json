(5) STRONG FAMILIES TAX CREDITS; APPLICATIONS, TRANSFERS, AND LIMITATIONS.— 1 (a) Beginning in fiscal year 2024-2025, the tax credit cap amount is $40 million in each state fiscal year. (b) A taxpayer may submit an application to the Department of Revenue for a tax credit or credits to be taken under one or more of s. 211.0253, s. 212.1834, s. 220.1877, s. 561.1213, or s. 624.51057, beginning at 9 a.m. on the first day of the calendar year that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. 1. The taxpayer shall specify in the application each tax for which the taxpayer requests a credit and the applicable taxable year for a credit under s. 220.1877 or s. 624.51057 or the applicable state fiscal year for a credit under s. 211.0253, s. 212.1834, or s. 561.1213. For purposes of s. 220.1877, a taxpayer may apply for a credit to be used for a prior taxable year before the date the taxpayer is required to file a return for that year pursuant to s. 220.222. For purposes of s. 624.51057, a taxpayer may apply for a credit to be used for a prior taxable year before the date the taxpayer is required to file a return for that prior taxable year pursuant to ss. 624.509 and 624.5092. The application must specify the eligible charitable organization to which the proposed contribution will be made. The Department of Revenue shall approve tax credits on a first-come, first-served basis and must obtain the division’s approval before approving a tax credit under s. 561.1213. 2. Within 10 days after approving or denying an application, the Department of Revenue shall provide a copy of its approval or denial letter to the eligible charitable organization specified by the taxpayer in the application. (c) If a tax credit approved under paragraph (b) is not fully used within the specified state fiscal year for credits under s. 211.0253, s. 212.1834, or s. 561.1213 or against taxes due for the specified taxable year for credits under s. 220.1877 or s. 624.51057 because of insufficient tax liability on the part of the taxpayer, the unused amount must be carried forward for a period not to exceed 10 years. For purposes of s. 220.1877, a credit carried forward may be used in a subsequent year after applying the other credits and unused carryovers in the order provided in s. 220.02(8). (d) A taxpayer may not convey, transfer, or assign an approved tax credit or a carryforward tax credit to another entity unless all of the assets of the taxpayer are conveyed, assigned, or transferred in the same transaction. However, a tax credit under s. 211.0253, s. 212.1834, s. 220.1877, s. 561.1213, or s. 624.51057 may be conveyed, transferred, or assigned between members of an affiliated group of corporations if the type of tax credit under s. 211.0253, s. 212.1834, s. 220.1877, s. 561.1213, or s. 624.51057 remains the same. A taxpayer shall notify the Department of Revenue of its intent to convey, transfer, or assign a tax credit to another member within an affiliated group of corporations. The amount conveyed, transferred, or assigned is available to another member of the affiliated group of corporations upon approval by the Department of Revenue. The Department of Revenue shall obtain the division’s approval before approving a conveyance, transfer, or assignment of a tax credit under s. 561.1213. (e) Within any state fiscal year, a taxpayer may rescind all or part of a tax credit approved under paragraph (b). The amount rescinded shall become available for that state fiscal year to another eligible taxpayer as approved by the Department of Revenue if the taxpayer receives notice from the Department of Revenue that the rescindment has been accepted by the Department of Revenue. The Department of Revenue must obtain the division’s approval before accepting the rescindment of a tax credit under s. 561.1213. Any amount rescinded under this paragraph must become available to an eligible taxpayer on a first-come, first-served basis based on tax credit applications received after the date the rescindment is accepted by the Department of Revenue. (f) Within 10 days after approving or denying the conveyance, transfer, or assignment of a tax credit under paragraph (d), or the rescindment of a tax credit under paragraph (e), the Department of Revenue shall provide a copy of its approval or denial letter to the eligible charitable organization specified by the taxpayer. The Department of Revenue shall also include the eligible charitable organization specified by the taxpayer on all letters or correspondence of acknowledgment for tax credits under s. 212.1834. (g) For purposes of calculating the underpayment of estimated corporate income taxes under s. 220.34 and tax installment payments for taxes on insurance premiums or assessments under s. 624.5092, the final amount due is the amount after credits earned under s. 220.1877 or s. 624.51057 for contributions to eligible charitable organizations are deducted. 1. For purposes of determining if a penalty or interest under s. 220.34(2)(d)1. will be imposed for underpayment of estimated corporate income tax, a taxpayer may, after earning a credit under s. 220.1877, reduce any estimated payment in that taxable year by the amount of the credit. 2. For purposes of determining if a penalty under s. 624.5092 will be imposed, an insurer, after earning a credit under s. 624.51057 for a taxable year, may reduce any installment payment for such taxable year of 27 percent of the amount of the net tax due as reported on the return for the preceding year under s. 624.5092(2)(b) by the amount of the credit. (6) PRESERVATION OF CREDIT.—If any provision or portion of this section, s. 211.0253, s. 212.1834, s. 220.1877, s. 561.1213, or s. 624.51057 or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held unconstitutional by any court or is otherwise declared invalid, the unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any credit earned under s. 211.0253, s. 212.1834, s. 220.1877, s. 561.1213, or s. 624.51057 by any taxpayer with respect to any contribution paid to an eligible charitable organization before the date of a determination of unconstitutionality or invalidity. The credit shall be allowed at such time and in such a manner as if a determination of unconstitutionality or invalidity had not been made, provided that nothing in this subsection by itself or in combination with any other provision of law may result in the allowance of any credit to any taxpayer in excess of one dollar of credit for each dollar paid to an eligible charitable organization. (7) ADMINISTRATION; RULES.— (a) The Department of Revenue, the division, and the Department of Children and Families may develop a cooperative agreement to assist in the administration of this section, as needed. (b) The Department of Revenue may adopt rules necessary to administer this section and ss. 211.0253, 212.1834, 220.1877, 561.1213, and 624.51057, including rules establishing application forms, procedures governing the approval of tax credits and carryforward tax credits under subsection (5), and procedures to be followed by taxpayers when claiming approved tax credits on their returns. (c) The division may adopt rules necessary to administer its responsibilities under this section and s. 561.1213. (d) The Department of Children and Families may adopt rules necessary to administer this section, including, but not limited to, rules establishing application forms for organizations seeking designation as eligible charitable organizations under this act. (e) Notwithstanding any provision of s. 213.053 to the contrary, sharing information with the division related to this tax credit is considered the conduct of the Department of Revenue’s official duties as contemplated in s. 213.053(8)(c), and the Department of Revenue and the division are specifically authorized to share information as needed to administer this program.

(5) HOME AWAY FROM HOME TAX CREDIT; APPLICATIONS, TRANSFERS, AND LIMITATIONS.— (a) Beginning in the 2026-2027 fiscal year, the tax credit cap amount is $13 million in each fiscal year. (b) A taxpayer may submit an application to the Department of Revenue for a tax credit or credits to be taken under one or more of s. 220.18775, s. 561.12135, or s. 624.51059, beginning at 9 a.m. on the first day of the calendar year which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. The Department of Revenue may not approve applications for a tax credit under this section for state fiscal years after the 2031-2032 fiscal year. 1. The taxpayer must specify in the application each tax for which the taxpayer requests a credit and the applicable taxable year for a credit under s. 220.18775 or s. 624.51059 or the applicable state fiscal year for a credit under s. 561.12135. For purposes of s. 220.18775, a taxpayer may apply for a credit to be used for a prior taxable year before the date the taxpayer is required to file a return for that year pursuant to s. 220.222. For purposes of s. 624.51059, a taxpayer may apply for a credit to be used for a prior taxable year before the date the taxpayer is required to file a return for that prior taxable year pursuant to ss. 624.509 and 624.5092. The application must specify the eligible charitable organization to which the proposed contribution will be made. The Department of Revenue shall approve tax credits on a first-come, first-served basis and must obtain the division’s approval before approving a tax credit under s. 561.12135. 2. Within 10 days after approving or denying an application, the Department of Revenue shall provide a copy of its approval or denial letter to the eligible charitable organization specified by the taxpayer in the application. (c) If a tax credit approved under paragraph (b) is not fully used within the specified state fiscal year for credits under s. 561.12135 or against taxes due for the specified taxable year for credits under s. 220.18775 or s. 624.51059 because of insufficient tax liability on the part of the taxpayer, the unused amount must be carried forward for a period not to exceed 10 years. For purposes of s. 220.18775, a credit carried forward may be used in a subsequent year after applying the other credits and unused carryovers in the order provided in s. 220.02(8). (d) A taxpayer may not convey, transfer, or assign an approved tax credit or a carryforward tax credit to another entity unless all of the assets of the taxpayer are conveyed, assigned, or transferred in the same transaction. However, a tax credit under s. 220.18775, s. 561.12135, or s. 624.51059 may be conveyed, transferred, or assigned between members of an affiliated group of corporations if the type of tax credit under s. 220.18775, s. 561.12135, or s. 624.51059 remains the same. A taxpayer shall notify the Department of Revenue of its intent to convey, transfer, or assign a tax credit to another member within an affiliated group of corporations. The amount conveyed, transferred, or assigned is available to another member of the affiliated group of corporations upon approval by the Department of Revenue. The Department of Revenue shall obtain the division’s approval before approving a conveyance, transfer, or assignment of a tax credit under s. 561.12135. (e) Within any state fiscal year, a taxpayer may rescind all or part of a tax credit approved under paragraph (b). The amount rescinded becomes available for that state fiscal year to another eligible taxpayer as approved by the Department of Revenue if the taxpayer receives notice from the Department of Revenue that the rescindment has been accepted by the Department of Revenue. The Department of Revenue must obtain the division’s approval before accepting the rescindment of a tax credit under s. 561.12135. Any amount rescinded under this paragraph must become available to an eligible taxpayer on a first-come, first-served basis based on tax credit applications received after the date the rescindment is accepted by the Department of Revenue. (f) Within 10 days after approving or denying the conveyance, transfer, or assignment of a tax credit under paragraph (d), or the rescindment of a tax credit under paragraph (e), the Department of Revenue shall provide a copy of its approval or denial letter to the eligible charitable organization specified by the taxpayer. The Department of Revenue shall also include the eligible charitable organization specified by the taxpayer on all letters or correspondence of acknowledgment for tax credits. (g) For purposes of calculating the underpayment of estimated corporate income taxes under s. 220.34 and tax installment payments for taxes on insurance premiums or assessments under s. 624.5092, the final amount due is the amount after credits earned under s. 220.18775 or s. 624.51059 for contributions to eligible charitable organizations are deducted. 1. For purposes of determining whether a penalty or interest under s. 220.34(2)(d)1. will be imposed for underpayment of estimated corporate income tax, a taxpayer may, after earning a credit under s. 220.18775, reduce any estimated payment in that taxable year by the amount of the credit. 2. For purposes of determining whether a penalty under s. 624.5092 will be imposed, an insurer may, after earning a credit under s. 624.51059 for a taxable year, reduce any installment payment for such taxable year by 27 percent of the amount of the net tax due as reported on the return for the preceding year under s. 624.5092(2)(b) by the amount of the credit. (6) PRESERVATION OF CREDIT.—If any provision or portion of this section, s. 220.18775, s. 561.12135, or s. 624.51059 or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held unconstitutional by any court or is otherwise declared invalid, the unconstitutionality or invalidity does not affect any credit earned under s. 220.18775, s. 561.12135, or s. 624.51059 by any taxpayer with respect to any contribution paid to an eligible charitable organization before the date of a determination of unconstitutionality or invalidity. The credit will be allowed at such time and in such a manner as if a determination of unconstitutionality or invalidity had not been made, provided that nothing in this subsection by itself or in combination with any other provision of law may result in the allowance of any credit to any taxpayer in excess of one dollar of credit for each dollar paid to an eligible charitable organization. (7) ADMINISTRATION; RULES.— (a) The Department of Revenue, the division, and the Department of Health may develop a cooperative agreement to assist in the administration of this section, as needed. (b) The Department of Revenue may adopt rules necessary to administer this section and ss. 220.18775, 561.12135, and 624.51059, including rules establishing application forms, procedures governing the approval of tax credits and carryforward tax credits under subsection (5), and procedures to be followed by taxpayers when claiming approved tax credits on their returns. (c) The division may adopt rules necessary to administer its responsibilities under this section and s. 561.12135. (d) The Department of Health may adopt rules necessary to administer this section, including, but not limited to, rules establishing application forms for organizations seeking designation as eligible charitable organizations under this act. (e) Notwithstanding any provision of s. 213.053, sharing information with the division related to a tax credit under this section is considered the conduct of the Department of Revenue’s official duties as contemplated in s. 213.053(8)(c), and the Department of Revenue and the division are specifically authorized to share information as needed to administer this section. History.—s. 79, ch. 2025-208. 1 Note.—Section 89, ch. 2025-208, provides that “[t]he Department of Revenue is authorized, and all conditions are deemed met, to adopt emergency rules under s. 120.54(4), Florida Statutes, for the purpose of implementing provisions related to the Home Away From Home Tax Credit.
