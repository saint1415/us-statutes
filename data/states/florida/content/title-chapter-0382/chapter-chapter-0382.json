(3) Each local registrar must make blank forms available if the department’s electronic registration system is unavailable, and must examine each paper certificate of live birth, death, or fetal death when presented for registration in order to ascertain whether it has been completed in accordance with this chapter and adopted rules. All paper birth, death, and fetal death certificates must be typewritten in permanent black ink, and a paper certificate is not complete and correct if it does not supply each item of information called for or satisfactorily account for its omission. (4) The local registrar or his or her deputy, if authorized by the department, shall sign as registrar in attestation of the date of registration of any paper records filed, and may also make and preserve a local paper record of each birth, death, and fetal death certificate registered by him or her, in such manner as directed by the department. The local registrar shall transmit daily to the department all original paper certificates registered. If no births, deaths, or fetal deaths occurred in any month, the local registrar or deputy shall, on the 7th day of the following month, report that fact to the department on a form provided for such purpose. (5) Each local registrar, immediately upon appointment, shall designate one or more deputy registrars to act on behalf of the local registrar.

The funeral director shall provide the electronic burial-transit permit generated from the electronic death registration system, or a manually produced permit, to the person in charge of the place of final disposition. (2) A burial-transit permit shall be issued by the department or the local registrar or subregistrar of the registration district in which the death occurred or the body was found. A burial-transit permit may not be issued: (a) Until a complete and satisfactory certificate of death or fetal death is filed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and adopted rules, unless the funeral director provides adequate assurance that a complete and satisfactory certificate will be so registered. (b) Except under conditions prescribed by the department, if the death occurred from some disease that is deemed by the department to be infectious, contagious, or communicable and dangerous to the public health. (3) The funeral director shall deliver the burial-transit permit to the person in charge of the place of final disposition, before interring or otherwise disposing of the dead body or fetus within this state; or when transported to a point outside the state, the permit shall accompany the dead body or fetus to its destination. (4) A burial-transit permit issued under the law of another state or country, or a certification of a death certificate issued under the law of a state or country that does not issue burial-transit permits, which accompanies a dead body or fetus brought into this state shall be authority for final disposition of the dead body or fetus in this state. (5) Rules of the department may provide for the issuance of a burial-transit permit prior to the filing of a certificate of death or fetal death upon conditions designed to assure compliance with the purposes of this chapter in cases in which compliance with the requirement that the certificate be filed prior to the issuance of the permit would result in undue hardship. (6) For manually filed paper death records, the subregistrar in the licensed funeral or direct disposal establishment is responsible for producing and maintaining death and fetal death certificates and burial-transit permits in accordance with this chapter.

      "text": "382.013 Birth registration.—A certificate for each live birth that occurs in this state shall be filed within 5 days after such birth in the department’s electronic registration system with the local registrar of the district in which the birth occurred and shall be registered by the local registrar if the certificate has been completed and filed in accordance with this chapter and adopted rules. The information regarding registered births shall be used for comparison with information in the state case registry, as defined in chapter 61. (1) FILING.— (a) If a birth occurs in a hospital, birth center, or other health care facility, or en route thereto, the person in charge of the facility is responsible for preparing the certificate, certifying the facts of the birth, and filing the certificate in the department’s electronic registration system with the local registrar. Within 48 hours after the birth, the physician, midwife, or person in attendance during or immediately after the delivery shall provide the facility with the medical information required by the birth certificate. (b) If a birth occurs outside a facility and a physician licensed in this state, a certified nurse midwife, a midwife licensed in this state, or a public health nurse employed by the department was in attendance during or immediately after the delivery, that person shall prepare and file the certificate. (c) If a birth occurs outside a facility and the delivery is not attended by one of the persons described in paragraph (b), the person in attendance, the mother, or the father shall report the birth to the registrar and provide proof of the facts of birth. The department may require such documents to be presented and such proof to be filed as it deems necessary and sufficient to establish the truth of the facts to be recorded by the certificate and may withhold registering the birth until its requirements are met. (d) If a birth occurs in a moving conveyance and the child is first removed from the conveyance in this state, the birth shall be filed and registered in this state and the place to which the child is first removed shall be considered the place of birth. (e) The mother or the father of the child shall attest to the accuracy of the personal data entered on the certificate in time to permit the timely registration of the certificate. (f) If a certificate of live birth is incomplete, the local registrar shall immediately notify the health care facility or person filing the certificate and shall require the completion of the missing items of information if they can be obtained before issuing certified copies of the birth certificate. (g) Regardless of any plan to place a child for adoption after birth, the information on the birth certificate as required by this section must be as to the child’s birth parents unless and until an application for a new birth record is made under s. 63.152. (h) The State Registrar may receive electronically a birth certificate for each live birth which is required to be filed with the registrar under this chapter through facsimile or other electronic transfer for the purpose of filing the birth certificate. The receipt of a birth certificate by electronic transfer constitutes delivery to the State Registrar as required by law. (2) PATERNITY.— (a) If the mother is married at the time of birth, the name of the husband shall be entered on the birth certificate as the father of the child, unless paternity has been determined otherwise by a court of competent jurisdiction. (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), if the husband of the mother dies while the mother is pregnant but before the birth of the child, the name of the deceased husband shall be entered on the birth certificate as the father of the child, unless paternity has been determined otherwise by a court of competent jurisdiction. (c) If the mother is not married at the time of the birth, the name of the father may not be entered on the birth certificate without the execution of an affidavit signed by both the mother and the person to be named as the father. The facility shall give notice orally or through the use of video or audio equipment, and in writing, of the alternatives to, the legal consequences of, and the rights, including, if one parent is a minor, any rights afforded due to minority status, and responsibilities that arise from signing an acknowledgment of paternity, as well as information provided by the Title IV-D agency established pursuant to s. 409.2557, regarding the benefits of voluntary establishment of paternity. Upon request of the mother and the person to be named as the father, the facility shall assist in the execution of the affidavit, a notarized voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, or a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity that is witnessed by two individuals and signed under penalty of perjury as specified by s. 92.525(2). (d) If the paternity of the child is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction as provided under s. 382.015 or there is a final judgment of dissolution of marriage which requires the former husband to pay child support for the child, the name of the father and the surname of the child shall be entered on the certificate in accordance with the finding and order of the court. If the court fails to specify a surname for the child, the surname shall be entered in accordance with subsection (3). (e) If the paternity of the child is determined pursuant to s. 409.256, the name of the father and the surname of the child shall be entered on the certificate in accordance with the finding and order of the Department of Revenue. (f) If the mother and father marry each other at any time after the child’s birth, upon receipt of a marriage license that identifies any such child, the department shall amend the certificate with regard to the parents’ marital status as though the parents were married at the time of birth. (g) If the father is not named on the certificate, no other information about the father shall be entered on the certificate. (3) NAME OF CHILD.— (a) If the mother is married at the time of birth, the mother and father whose names are entered on the birth certificate shall select the given names and surname of the child if both parents have custody of the child, otherwise the parent who has custody shall select the child’s name. (b) If the mother and father whose names are entered on the birth certificate disagree on the surname of the child and both parents have custody of the child, the surname selected by the father and the surname selected by the mother shall both be entered on the birth certificate, separated by a hyphen, with the selected names entered in alphabetical order. If the parents disagree on the selection of a given name, the given name may not be entered on the certificate until a joint agreement that lists the agreed upon given name and is notarized by both parents is submitted to the department, or until a given name is selected by a court. (c) If the mother is not married at the time of birth, the parent who will have custody of the child shall select the child’s given name and surname. (d) If multiple names of the child exceed the space provided on the face of the birth certificate they shall be listed on the back of the certificate. Names listed on the back of the certificate shall be part of the official record. (4) UNDETERMINED PARENTAGE.—The person having custody of a child of undetermined parentage shall register a birth certificate showing all known or approximate facts relating to the birth. To assist in later determination, information concerning the place and circumstances under which the child was found shall be included on the portion of the birth certificate relating to marital status and medical details. In the event the child is later identified, a new birth certificate shall be prepared which shall bear the same number as the original birth certificate, and the original certificate shall be sealed and filed, shall be confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1), and shall not be opened to inspection by, nor shall certified copies of the same be issued except by court order to, any person other than the registrant if of legal age. (5) DISCLOSURE.—The original certificate of live birth shall contain all the information required by the department for legal, social, and health research purposes. However, all information concerning parentage, marital status, and medical details shall be confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1), except for health research purposes as approved by the department, nor shall copies of the same be issued except as provided in s. 382.025.

(1) CERTIFICATE OF LIVE BIRTH AMENDMENT.— (a) Until a child’s first birthday, the child’s given name or surname may be amended upon receipt of the fees prescribed in s. 382.0255 and an affidavit signed by each parent named on the original birth certificate or by the registrant’s guardian. If both parents are named on the certificate but both are not willing or available to sign the affidavit, the registrant’s name may only be amended by court order. (b) Upon written request and receipt of an affidavit, a notarized voluntary acknowledgment of paternity signed by the mother and father acknowledging the paternity of a registrant born out of wedlock, or a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity that is witnessed by two individuals and signed under penalty of perjury as specified by s. 92.525(2), together with sufficient information to identify the original certificate of live birth, the department shall prepare a new birth certificate, which shall bear the same file number as the original birth certificate. The names and identifying information of the parents shall be entered as of the date of the registrant’s birth. The surname of the registrant may be changed from that shown on the original birth certificate at the request of the mother and father of the registrant, or the registrant if of legal age. If the mother and father marry each other at any time after the registrant’s birth, the department shall, upon receipt of a marriage license that identifies the registrant, or upon the request of the mother and father or registrant if of legal age and proof of the marriage, amend the certificate with regard to the parents’ marital status as though the parents were married at the time of birth. The department shall substitute the new certificate of birth for the original certificate on file. All copies of the original certificate of live birth in the custody of a local registrar or other state custodian of vital records shall be forwarded to the State Registrar. Thereafter, when a certified copy of the certificate of birth or portion thereof is issued, it shall be a copy of the new certificate of birth or portion thereof, except when a court order requires issuance of a certified copy of the original certificate of birth. Except for a birth certificate on which a father is listed pursuant to an affidavit, a notarized voluntary acknowledgment of paternity signed by the mother and father acknowledging the paternity of a registrant born out of wedlock, or a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity that is witnessed by two individuals and signed under penalty of perjury as specified by s. 92.525(2), the department shall place the original certificate of birth and all papers pertaining thereto under seal, not to be broken except by order of a court of competent jurisdiction or as otherwise provided by law. (c) If a father’s name is listed on the birth certificate, the birth certificate may only be amended to remove the father’s name or to add a different father’s name upon court order. If a change in the registrant’s surname is also desired, such change must be included in the court order or the name must be changed pursuant to s. 68.07. (d) For a child born in this state whose paternity is established in another state, the department shall amend the child’s birth certificate to include the name of the father upon receipt of: 1. A certified copy of an acknowledgment of paternity, final judgment, or judicial or administrative order from another state that determines the child’s paternity; or 2. A noncertified copy of an acknowledgment of paternity, final judgment, or judicial or administrative order from another state that determines the child’s paternity when provided with an affidavit or written declaration from the Department of Revenue that states the document was provided by or obtained from another state’s Title IV-D program. The department may not amend a child’s birth certificate to include the name of the child’s father if paternity was established by adoption and the father 1 would not be eligible to adopt under the laws of this state. (e) The Department of Revenue shall develop written educational materials for use and distribution by the Department of Children and Families, Department of Corrections, Department of Education, Department of Health, and Department of Juvenile Justice that describe how paternity is established and the benefits of establishing paternity. The Department of Children and Families, Department of Corrections, Department of Education, Department of Health, and Department of Juvenile Justice shall make the materials available to individuals to whom services are provided and are encouraged to provide additional education on how paternity is established and the benefits of establishing paternity. (2) CERTIFICATE OF DEATH AMENDMENTS.—Except for a misspelling or an omission on a death certificate with regard to the name of the surviving spouse, the department may not change the name of a surviving spouse on the certificate except by order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
