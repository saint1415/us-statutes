(2) “Adjusted admission” means the sum of acute and intensive care admissions divided by the ratio of inpatient revenues generated from acute, intensive, ambulatory, and ancillary patient services to gross revenues. If a hospital reports only subacute admissions, then “adjusted admission” means the sum of subacute admissions divided by the ratio of total inpatient revenues to gross revenues. (3) “Agency” means the Agency for Health Care Administration. (4) “Alcohol or chemical dependency treatment center” means an organization licensed under chapter 397. (5) “Ambulatory care center” means an organization which employs or contracts with licensed health care professionals to provide diagnosis or treatment services predominantly on a walk-in basis and the organization holds itself out as providing care on a walk-in basis. Such an organization is not an ambulatory care center if it is wholly owned and operated by five or fewer health care providers. (6) “Ambulatory surgical center” means a facility licensed as an ambulatory surgical center under chapter 395. (7) “Audited actual data” means information contained within financial statements examined by an independent, Florida-licensed, certified public accountant in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, but does not include data within a financial statement about which the certified public accountant does not express an opinion or issues a disclaimer.

Cross-subsidization results from the lack of a direct relationship between charges and the costs of providing a particular hospital service or type of service. (16) “Deductions from gross revenue” or “deductions from revenue” means reductions from gross revenue resulting from inability to collect payment of charges.

Population densities used in this subsection must be based upon the most recently completed United States census.

An acute care hospital that has not previously been designated as a rural hospital and that meets the criteria of this subsection shall be granted such designation upon application, including supporting documentation, to the Agency for Health Care Administration. (45) “Special study” means a nonrecurring data-gathering and analysis effort designed to aid the agency in meeting its responsibilities pursuant to this chapter.

The agency may also institute injunction proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction when a violation of this part, authorizing statutes, or applicable rules constitutes an emergency affecting the immediate health and safety of a client. (b) Enforce the provisions of this part, authorizing statutes, or any minimum standard, rule, or order issued or entered into pursuant thereto when the attempt by the agency to correct a violation through administrative sanctions has failed or when the violation materially affects the health, safety, or welfare of clients or involves any operation of an unlicensed provider. (c) Terminate the operation of a provider when a violation of any provision of this part, authorizing statutes, or any standard or rule adopted pursuant thereto exists that materially affects the health, safety, or welfare of a client. Such injunctive relief may be temporary or permanent. (2) If action is necessary to protect clients of providers from immediate, life-threatening situations, the court may allow a temporary injunction without bond upon proper proofs being made. If it appears by competent evidence or a sworn, substantiated affidavit that a temporary injunction should be issued, the court, pending the determination on final hearing, shall enjoin the operation of the provider.
