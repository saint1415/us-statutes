(2) The proceeds of charity performances shall be paid to qualified beneficiaries selected by the permitholders from an authorized list of charities on file with the commission. Eligible charities include any charity that provides evidence of compliance with the provisions of chapter 496 and evidence of possession of a valid exemption from federal taxation issued by the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, the authorized list must include the Racing Scholarship Trust Fund, the Historical Resources Operating Trust Fund, major state and private institutions of higher learning, and Florida community colleges. (3) The permitholder shall, within 120 days after the conclusion of its fiscal year, pay to the authorized charities the total of all profits derived from the operation of the charity day performances conducted. If charity days are operated on behalf of another permitholder pursuant to law, the permitholder entitled to distribute the proceeds shall distribute the proceeds to charity within 30 days after the actual receipt of the proceeds. (4) The total of all profits derived from the conduct of a charity day performance must include all revenues derived from the conduct of that performance, including all state taxes that would otherwise be due to the state, except that the daily license fee as provided in s. 550.0951(1) and the breaks for the promotional trust funds as provided in s. 550.2625(3), (4), (5), (7), and (8) shall be paid to the commission. All other revenues from the charity performance, including the commissions, breaks, and admissions and the revenues from parking, programs, and concessions, shall be included in the total of all profits. (5) In determining profit, the permitholder may elect to distribute as proceeds only the amount equal to the state tax that would otherwise be paid to the state if the charity day were conducted as a regular or matinee performance. (6)(a) The commission shall authorize one additional scholarship day for horseracing in addition to the regular racing days authorized by law and any additional days authorized by this section, to be conducted at all horse racetracks located in Hillsborough County. The permitholder shall conduct a full schedule of racing on the scholarship day. (b) The funds derived from the operation of the additional scholarship day shall be allocated as provided in this section and paid to Pasco-Hernando State College. (c) When a charity or scholarship performance is conducted as a matinee performance, the commission may authorize the permitholder to conduct the evening performances of that operation day as a regular performance in addition to the regular operating days authorized by law. (7) In addition to the eligible charities that meet the criteria set forth in this section, a jai alai permitholder is authorized to conduct two additional charity performances each fiscal year for a fund to benefit retired jai alai players. This performance shall be known as the “Retired Jai Alai Players Charity Day.” The administration of this fund shall be determined by rule by the commission.

      "text": "550.054 Application for permit to conduct pari-mutuel wagering.— (1) Any person who possesses the qualifications prescribed in this chapter may apply to the commission for a permit to conduct pari-mutuel operations under this chapter. Applications for a pari-mutuel permit are exempt from the 90-day licensing requirement of s. 120.60. Within 120 days after receipt of a complete application, the commission shall grant or deny the permit. A completed application that is not acted upon within 120 days after receipt is deemed approved, and the commission shall grant the permit. (2) Upon each application filed and approved, a permit shall be issued to the applicant setting forth the name of the permitholder, the location of the pari-mutuel facility, the type of pari-mutuel activity desired to be conducted, and a statement showing qualifications of the applicant to conduct pari-mutuel performances under this chapter; however, a permit is ineffectual to authorize any pari-mutuel performances until approved by a majority of the electors participating in a ratification election in the county in which the applicant proposes to conduct pari-mutuel wagering activities. In addition, an application may not be considered, nor may a permit be issued by the commission or be voted upon in any county, to conduct horseraces, harness horse races, or pari-mutuel wagering at a location within 100 miles of an existing pari-mutuel facility, or for jai alai within 50 miles of an existing pari-mutuel facility; this distance shall be measured on a straight line from the nearest property line of one pari-mutuel facility to the nearest property line of the other facility. (3) The commission shall require that each applicant submit an application setting forth: (a) The full name of the applicant. (b) If a corporation, the name of the state in which incorporated and the names and addresses of the officers, directors, and shareholders holding 5 percent or more equity or, if a business entity other than a corporation, the names and addresses of the principals, partners, or shareholders holding 5 percent or more equity. (c) The names and addresses of the ultimate equitable owners for a corporation or other business entity, if different from those provided under paragraph (b), unless the securities of the corporation or entity are registered pursuant to s. 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. ss. 78a-78kk; and if such corporation or entity files with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission the reports required by s. 13 of that act or if the securities of the corporation or entity are regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States. (d) The exact location where the applicant will conduct pari-mutuel performances. (e) Whether the pari-mutuel facility is owned or leased and, if leased, the name and residence of the fee owner or, if a corporation, the names and addresses of the directors and stockholders thereof. However, this chapter does not prevent a person from applying to the commission for a permit to conduct pari-mutuel operations, regardless of whether the pari-mutuel facility has been constructed or not, and having an election held in any county at the same time that elections are held for the ratification of any permit in that county. (f) A statement of the assets and liabilities of the applicant. (g) The names and addresses of any mortgagee of any pari-mutuel facility and any financial agreement between the parties. The commission may require the names and addresses of the officers and directors of the mortgagee, and of those stockholders who hold more than 10 percent of the stock of the mortgagee. (h) A business plan for the first year of operation. (i) For each individual listed in the application as an owner, partner, officer, or director, a complete set of fingerprints that has been taken by an authorized law enforcement officer. These sets of fingerprints must be submitted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for processing. Applicants who are foreign nationals shall submit such documents as necessary to allow the commission to conduct criminal history records checks in the applicant’s home country. The applicant must pay the cost of processing. The commission may charge a $2 handling fee for each set of fingerprint records. (j) The type of pari-mutuel activity to be conducted and the desired period of operation. (k) Other information the commission requires. (4) The commission shall require each applicant to deposit with the board of county commissioners of the county in which the election is to be held, a sufficient sum, in currency or by check certified by a bank licensed to do business in the state to pay the expenses of holding the election provided in s. 550.0651. (5) Upon receiving an application and any amendments properly made thereto, the commission shall further investigate the matters contained in the application. If the applicant meets all requirements, conditions, and qualifications set forth in this chapter and the rules of the commission, the commission shall grant the permit. (6) After initial approval of the permit and the source of financing, the terms and parties of any subsequent refinancing must be disclosed by the applicant or the permitholder to the commission. (7) If the commission refuses to grant the permit, the money deposited with the board of county commissioners for holding the election must be refunded to the applicant. If the commission grants the permit applied for, the board of county commissioners shall order an election in the county to decide whether the permit will be approved, as provided in s. 550.0651. (8)(a) The commission may charge the applicant for reasonable, anticipated costs incurred by the commission in determining the eligibility of any person or entity specified in s. 550.1815(1)(a) to hold any pari-mutuel permit, against such person or entity. (b) The commission may, by rule, determine the manner of paying its anticipated costs associated with determination of eligibility and the procedure for filing applications for determination of eligibility. (c) The commission shall furnish to the applicant an itemized statement of actual costs incurred during the investigation to determine eligibility. (d) If unused funds remain at the conclusion of such investigation, they must be returned to the applicant within 60 days after the determination of eligibility has been made. (e) If the actual costs of investigation exceed anticipated costs, the commission shall assess the applicant the amount necessary to recover all actual costs. (9)(a) After a permit has been granted by the commission and has been ratified and approved by the majority of the electors participating in the election in the county designated in the permit, the commission shall grant to the lawful permitholder, subject to the conditions of this chapter, a license to conduct pari-mutuel operations under this chapter, and, except as provided in s. 550.5251, the commission shall fix annually the time, place, and number of days during which pari-mutuel operations may be conducted by the permitholder at the location fixed in the permit and ratified in the election. After the first license has been issued to the holder of a ratified permit in any county, all subsequent annual applications for a license by that permitholder must be accompanied by proof, in such form as the commission requires, that the ratified permitholder still possesses all the qualifications prescribed by this chapter and that the permit has not been recalled at a later election held in the county. (b) The commission may revoke or suspend any permit or license issued under this chapter upon the willful violation by the permitholder or licensee of any provision of this chapter or of any rule adopted under this chapter. In lieu of suspending or revoking a permit or license, the commission may impose a civil penalty against the permitholder or licensee for a violation of this chapter or any rule adopted by the commission. The penalty so imposed may not exceed $1,000 for each count or separate offense. All penalties imposed and collected must be deposited with the Chief Financial Officer to the credit of the General Revenue Fund. (c) The commission shall revoke the permit of any permitholder, other than a permitholder issued a permit pursuant to s. 550.3345, who did not hold an operating license for the conduct of pari-mutuel wagering for fiscal year 2020-2021. A permit revoked under this paragraph is void and may not be reissued. (10) If a permitholder has failed to complete construction of at least 50 percent of the facilities necessary to conduct pari-mutuel operations within 12 months after approval by the voters of the permit, the commission shall revoke the permit upon adequate notice to the permitholder. However, the commission, upon good cause shown by the permitholder, may grant one extension of up to 12 months. (11)(a) A permit granted under this chapter may not be transferred or assigned except upon written approval by the commission pursuant to s. 550.1815, except that the holder of any permit that has been converted to a jai alai permit may lease or build anywhere within the county in which its permit is located. (b) If a permit to conduct pari-mutuel wagering is held by a corporation or business entity other than an individual, the transfer of 10 percent or more of the stock or other evidence of ownership or equity in the permitholder may not be made without the prior approval of the transferee by the commission pursuant to s. 550.1815. (12) Changes in ownership or interest of a pari-mutuel permit of 5 percent or more of the stock or other evidence of ownership or equity in the permitholder shall be approved by the commission prior to such change, unless the owner is an existing owner of that permit who was previously approved by the commission. Changes in ownership or interest of a pari-mutuel permit of less than 5 percent shall be reported to the commission within 20 days of the change. The commission may then conduct an investigation to ensure that the permit is properly updated to show the change in ownership or interest. (13)(a) Notwithstanding any provisions of this chapter, no thoroughbred horse racing permit or license issued under this chapter shall be transferred, or reissued when such reissuance is in the nature of a transfer so as to permit or authorize a licensee to change the location of a thoroughbred horse racetrack except upon proof in such form as the commission may prescribe that a referendum election has been held: 1. If the proposed new location is within the same county as the already licensed location, in the county where the licensee desires to conduct the race meeting and that a majority of the electors voting on that question in such election voted in favor of the transfer of such license. 2. If the proposed new location is not within the same county as the already licensed location, in the county where the licensee desires to conduct the race meeting and in the county where the licensee is already licensed to conduct the race meeting and that a majority of the electors voting on that question in each such election voted in favor of the transfer of such license. (b) Each referendum held under the provisions of this subsection shall be held in accordance with the electoral procedures for ratification of permits, as provided in s. 550.0651. The expense of each such referendum shall be borne by the licensee requesting the transfer. (14)(a) Any holder of a permit to conduct jai alai may apply to the commission to convert such permit to a permit to conduct greyhound racing in lieu of jai alai if: 1. Such permit is located in a county in which the commission has issued only two pari-mutuel permits pursuant to this section; 2. Such permit was not previously converted from any other class of permit; and 3. The holder of the permit has not conducted jai alai games during a period of 10 years immediately preceding his or her application for conversion under this subsection. (b) The commission, upon application from the holder of a jai alai permit meeting all conditions of this section, shall convert the permit and shall issue to the permitholder a permit to conduct greyhound racing. A permitholder of a permit converted under this section shall be required to apply for and conduct a full schedule of live racing each fiscal year to be eligible for any tax credit provided by this chapter. The holder of a permit converted pursuant to this subsection or any holder of a permit to conduct greyhound racing located in a county in which it is the only permit issued pursuant to this section who operates at a leased facility pursuant to s. 550.475 may move the location for which the permit has been issued to another location within a 30-mile radius of the location fixed in the permit issued in that county, provided the move does not cross the county boundary and such location is approved under the zoning regulations of the county or municipality in which the permit is located, and upon such relocation may use the permit for the conduct of pari-mutuel wagering and the operation of a cardroom. The provisions of s. 550.6305(9)(d) and (f) shall apply to any permit converted under this subsection and shall continue to apply to any permit which was previously included under and subject to such provisions before a conversion pursuant to this section occurred. (15)(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a permit for the conduct of pari-mutuel wagering and associated cardroom or slot machine licenses may only be held by a permitholder who held an operating license for the conduct of pari-mutuel wagering for fiscal year 2020-2021 or who holds a permit issued pursuant to s. 550.3345 or by a purchaser, transferee, or assignee of a valid permit for the conduct of pari-mutuel wagering if approved by the commission before such purchase, transfer, or assignment and provided that the commission does not approve or issue an additional permit for the conduct of pari-mutuel wagering; (b) All permits issued under this chapter held by permitholders on January 1, 2021, are deemed valid for the sole and exclusive purpose of satisfying all conditions for the valid issuance of the permits, if such permitholder held an operating license for the conduct of pari-mutuel wagering for fiscal year 2020-2021 or if such permitholder held a permit issued pursuant to s. 550.3345; (c) Additional permits for the conduct of pari-mutuel wagering may not be approved or issued by the commission or former Division of Pari-mutuel Wagering after January 1, 2021; and (d) A permit to conduct pari-mutuel wagering may not be converted to another class of permit.

In addition to the tax exemption specified in s. 550.09514(1) of $360,000 or $500,000 per greyhound permitholder per state fiscal year, each greyhound permitholder shall receive in the current state fiscal year a tax credit equal to the number of live greyhound races conducted in the previous state fiscal year times the daily license fee specified for each dograce in this subsection applicable for the previous state fiscal year. This tax credit and the exemption in s. 550.09514(1) apply to any tax imposed by this chapter or the daily license fees imposed by this chapter except during any charity or scholarship performances conducted pursuant to s. 550.0351. Each permitholder shall pay daily license fees not to exceed $500 per day on any simulcast races or games on which such permitholder accepts wagers regardless of the number of out-of-state events taken or the number of out-of-state locations from which such events are taken. This license fee shall be deposited with the Chief Financial Officer to the credit of the Pari-mutuel Wagering Trust Fund. (b) Each permitholder that cannot utilize the full amount of the exemption of $360,000 or $500,000 provided in s. 550.09514(1) or the daily license fee credit provided in this section may, after notifying the commission in writing, elect once per state fiscal year on a form provided by the commission to transfer such exemption or credit or any portion thereof to any greyhound permitholder which acts as a host track to such permitholder for the purpose of intertrack wagering. Once an election to transfer such exemption or credit is filed with the commission, it may not be rescinded. The commission shall disapprove the transfer when the amount of the exemption or credit or portion thereof is unavailable to the transferring permitholder or when the permitholder who is entitled to transfer the exemption or credit or who is entitled to receive the exemption or credit owes taxes to the state pursuant to a deficiency letter or administrative complaint issued by the commission. Upon approval of the transfer by the commission, the transferred tax exemption or credit is effective for the next payment period as specified in subsection (5). The exemption or credit transferred to such host track may be applied by such host track against any taxes imposed by this chapter or daily license fees imposed by this chapter. The greyhound permitholder host track to which such exemption or credit is transferred shall reimburse such permitholder the exact monetary value of such transferred exemption or credit as actually applied against the taxes and daily license fees of the host track. The commission shall ensure that all transfers of exemption or credit are made in accordance with this subsection and has the authority to adopt rules to ensure the implementation of this section. (2) ADMISSION TAX.— (a) An admission tax equal to 15 percent of the admission charge for entrance to the permitholder’s facility and grandstand area, or 10 cents, whichever is greater, is imposed on each person attending a horserace, dograce, or jai alai game. The permitholder shall be responsible for collecting the admission tax. (b) No admission tax under this chapter or chapter 212 shall be imposed on any free passes or complimentary cards issued to persons for which there is no cost to the person for admission to pari-mutuel events. (c) A permitholder may issue tax-free passes to its officers, officials, and employees or other persons actually engaged in working at the racetrack, including accredited press representatives such as reporters and editors, and may also issue tax-free passes to other permitholders for the use of their officers and officials. The permitholder shall file with the commission a list of all persons to whom tax-free passes are issued under this paragraph. (3) TAX ON HANDLE.—Each permitholder shall pay a tax on contributions to pari-mutuel pools, the aggregate of which is hereinafter referred to as “handle,” on races or games conducted by the permitholder. The tax is imposed daily and is based on the total contributions to all pari-mutuel pools conducted during the daily performance. If a permitholder conducts more than one performance daily, the tax is imposed on each performance separately. (a) The tax on handle for quarter horse racing is 1.0 percent of the handle. (b)1. The tax on handle for dogracing is 5.5 percent of the handle, except that for live charity performances held pursuant to s. 550.0351, and for intertrack wagering on such charity performances at a guest greyhound track within the market area of the host, the tax is 7.6 percent of the handle. 2. The tax on handle for jai alai is 7.1 percent of the handle. (c)1. The tax on handle for intertrack wagering is 2.0 percent of the handle if the host track is a horse track, 3.3 percent if the host track is a harness track, 5.5 percent if the host track is a dog track, and 7.1 percent if the host track is a jai alai fronton. The tax on handle for intertrack wagering is 0.5 percent if the host track and the guest track are thoroughbred permitholders or if the guest track is located outside the market area of the host track and within the market area of a thoroughbred permitholder that conducted a full schedule of live racing the preceding fiscal year. The tax on handle for intertrack wagering on rebroadcasts of simulcast thoroughbred horseraces is 2.4 percent of the handle and 1.5 percent of the handle for intertrack wagering on rebroadcasts of simulcast harness horseraces. The tax shall be deposited into the Pari-mutuel Wagering Trust Fund. 2. The tax on handle for intertrack wagers accepted by any dog track located in an area of the state in which there are only three permitholders, all of which are greyhound permitholders, located in three contiguous counties, from any greyhound permitholder also located within such area or any dog track or jai alai fronton located as specified in s. 550.615(6) or (9), on races or games received from the same class of permitholder located within the same market area is 3.9 percent if the host facility is a greyhound permitholder and, if the host facility is a jai alai permitholder, the rate shall be 6.1 percent except that it shall be 2.3 percent on handle at such time as the total tax on intertrack handle paid to the commission by the permitholder during the current state fiscal year exceeds the total tax on intertrack handle paid to the commission by the permitholder during the 1992-1993 state fiscal year. (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, in order to protect the Florida jai alai industry, effective July 1, 2000, a jai alai permitholder may not be taxed on live handle at a rate higher than 2 percent. (4) BREAKS TAX.—Effective October 1, 1996, each permitholder conducting jai alai performances shall pay a tax equal to the breaks. The “breaks” represents that portion of each pari-mutuel pool which is not redistributed to the contributors or withheld by the permitholder as commission. (5) PAYMENT AND DISPOSITION OF FEES AND TAXES.—Payments imposed by this section must be paid to the commission. The commission shall deposit these sums with the Chief Financial Officer, to the credit of the Pari-mutuel Wagering Trust Fund, hereby established. The permitholder shall remit to the commission payment for the daily license fee, the admission tax, the tax on handle, and the breaks tax. Such payments must be remitted by 3 p.m. on the 5th day of each calendar month for taxes imposed and collected for the preceding calendar month. If the 5th day of the calendar month falls on a weekend, payments must be remitted by 3 p.m. the first Monday following the weekend. Permitholders shall file a report under oath by the 5th day of each calendar month for all taxes remitted during the preceding calendar month. Such payments must be accompanied by a report under oath showing the total of all admissions, the pari-mutuel wagering activities for the preceding calendar month, and such other information as may be prescribed by the commission. (6) PENALTIES.— (a) The failure of any permitholder to make payments as prescribed in subsection (5) is a violation of this section, and the permitholder may be subjected by the commission to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each day the tax payment is not remitted. All penalties imposed and collected shall be deposited in the General Revenue Fund. If a permitholder fails to pay penalties imposed by order of the commission under this subsection, the commission may suspend or revoke the license of the permitholder, cancel the permit of the permitholder, or deny issuance of any further license or permit to the permitholder. (b) In addition to the civil penalty prescribed in paragraph (a), any willful or wanton failure by any permitholder to make payments of the daily license fee, admission tax, tax on handle, or breaks tax constitutes sufficient grounds for the commission to suspend or revoke the license of the permitholder, to cancel the permit of the permitholder, or to deny issuance of any further license or permit to the permitholder.

      "text": "550.09514 Greyhound dogracing taxes; purse requirements.— (1) Wagering on greyhound racing is subject to a tax on handle for live greyhound racing as specified in s. 550.0951(3). However, each permitholder shall pay no tax on handle until such time as this subsection has resulted in a tax savings per state fiscal year of $360,000. Thereafter, each permitholder shall pay the tax as specified in s. 550.0951(3) on all handle for the remainder of the permitholder’s current race meet. For the three permitholders that conducted a full schedule of live racing in 1995, and are closest to another state that authorizes greyhound pari-mutuel wagering, the maximum tax savings per state fiscal year shall be $500,000. The provisions of this subsection relating to tax exemptions shall not apply to any charity or scholarship performances conducted pursuant to s. 550.0351. (2)(a) The commission shall determine for each greyhound permitholder the annual purse percentage rate of live handle for the state fiscal year 1993-1994 by dividing total purses paid on live handle by the permitholder, exclusive of payments made from outside sources, during the 1993-1994 state fiscal year by the permitholder’s live handle for the 1993-1994 state fiscal year. Each permitholder shall pay as purses for live races conducted during its current race meet a percentage of its live handle not less than the percentage determined under this paragraph, exclusive of payments made by outside sources, for its 1993-1994 state fiscal year. (b) Except as otherwise set forth herein, in addition to the minimum purse percentage required by paragraph (a), each permitholder shall pay as purses an annual amount equal to 75 percent of the daily license fees paid by each permitholder for the 1994-1995 fiscal year. This purse supplement shall be disbursed weekly during the permitholder’s race meet in an amount determined by dividing the annual purse supplement by the number of performances approved for the permitholder pursuant to its annual license and multiplying that amount by the number of performances conducted each week. For the greyhound permitholders in the county where there are two greyhound permitholders located as specified in s. 550.615(6), such permitholders shall pay in the aggregate an amount equal to 75 percent of the daily license fees paid by such permitholders for the 1994-1995 fiscal year. These permitholders shall be jointly and severally liable for such purse payments. The additional purses provided by this paragraph must be used exclusively for purses other than stakes. The commission shall conduct audits necessary to ensure compliance with this section. (c)1. Each greyhound permitholder when conducting at least three live performances during any week shall pay purses in that week on wagers it accepts as a guest track on intertrack and simulcast greyhound races at the same rate as it pays on live races. Each greyhound permitholder when conducting at least three live performances during any week shall pay purses in that week, at the same rate as it pays on live races, on wagers accepted on greyhound races at a guest track which is not conducting live racing and is located within the same market area as the greyhound permitholder conducting at least three live performances during any week. 2. Each host greyhound permitholder shall pay purses on its simulcast and intertrack broadcasts of greyhound races to guest facilities that are located outside its market area in an amount equal to one quarter of an amount determined by subtracting the transmission costs of sending the simulcast or intertrack broadcasts from an amount determined by adding the fees received for greyhound simulcast races plus 3 percent of the greyhound intertrack handle at guest facilities that are located outside the market area of the host and that paid contractual fees to the host for such broadcasts of greyhound races. (d) The commission shall require sufficient documentation from each greyhound permitholder regarding purses paid on live racing to assure that the annual purse percentage rates paid by each permitholder on the live races are not reduced below those paid during the 1993-1994 state fiscal year. The commission shall require sufficient documentation from each greyhound permitholder to assure that the purses paid by each permitholder on the greyhound intertrack and simulcast broadcasts are in compliance with the requirements of paragraph (c). (e) In addition to the purse requirements of paragraphs (a)-(c), each greyhound permitholder shall pay as purses an amount equal to one-third of the amount of the tax reduction on live and simulcast handle applicable to such permitholder as a result of the reductions in tax rates provided by this act through the amendments to s. 550.0951(3). With respect to intertrack wagering when the host and guest tracks are greyhound permitholders not within the same market area, an amount equal to the tax reduction applicable to the guest track handle as a result of the reduction in tax rate provided by this act through the amendment to s. 550.0951(3) shall be distributed to the guest track, one-third of which amount shall be paid as purses at the guest track. However, if the guest track is a greyhound permitholder within the market area of the host or if the guest track is not a greyhound permitholder, an amount equal to such tax reduction applicable to the guest track handle shall be retained by the host track, one-third of which amount shall be paid as purses at the host track. These purse funds shall be disbursed in the week received if the permitholder conducts at least one live performance during that week. If the permitholder does not conduct at least one live performance during the week in which the purse funds are received, the purse funds shall be disbursed weekly during the permitholder’s next race meet in an amount determined by dividing the purse amount by the number of performances approved for the permitholder pursuant to its annual license, and multiplying that amount by the number of performances conducted each week. The commission shall conduct audits necessary to ensure compliance with this paragraph. (f) Each greyhound permitholder shall, during the permitholder’s race meet, supply kennel operators and the commission with a weekly report showing purses paid on live greyhound races and all greyhound intertrack and simulcast broadcasts, including both as a guest and a host together with the handle or commission calculations on which such purses were paid and the transmission costs of sending the simulcast or intertrack broadcasts, so that the kennel operators may determine statutory and contractual compliance. (g) Each greyhound permitholder shall make direct payment of purses to the greyhound owners who have filed with such permitholder appropriate federal taxpayer identification information based on the percentage amount agreed upon between the kennel operator and the greyhound owner. (h) At the request of a majority of kennel operators under contract with a greyhound permitholder, the permitholder shall make deductions from purses paid to each kennel operator electing such deduction and shall make a direct payment of such deductions to the local association of greyhound kennel operators formed by a majority of kennel operators under contract with the permitholder. The amount of the deduction shall be at least 1 percent of purses, as determined by the local association of greyhound kennel operators. No deductions may be taken pursuant to this paragraph without a kennel operator’s specific approval before or after the effective date of this act. (3) For the purpose of this section, the term “live handle” means the handle from wagers placed at the permitholder’s establishment on the live greyhound races conducted at the permitholder’s establishment.

(b) The commission shall adopt rules specifying the form and content of such reports, including, but not limited to, requirements for a statement of assets and liabilities, operating revenues and expenses, and net worth, which statement must be audited by a certified public accountant licensed to practice in this state, and any supporting informational schedule found necessary by the commission to verify the foregoing financial statement, which informational schedule must be attested to under oath by the permitholder or an officer of record, to permit the commission to: 1. Assess the profitability and financial soundness of permitholders, both individually and as an industry; 2. Plan and recommend measures necessary to preserve and protect the pari-mutuel revenues of the state; and 3.

(d) The commission shall annually review the books and records of each permitholder and verify that the breaks and unclaimed ticket payments made by each permitholder are true and correct. (3)(a) Each permitholder to which a license is granted under this chapter, at its own cost and expense, must, before the license is delivered, give a bond in the penal sum of $50,000 payable to the Governor of the state and her or his successors in office, with a surety or sureties to be approved by the commission and the Chief Financial Officer, conditioned to faithfully make the payments to the Chief Financial Officer in her or his capacity as treasurer of the commission; to keep its books and records and make reports as provided; and to conduct its racing in conformity with this chapter. When the greatest amount of tax owed during any month in the prior state fiscal year, in which a full schedule of live racing was conducted, is less than $50,000, the commission may assess a bond in a sum less than $50,000. The commission may review the bond for adequacy and require adjustments each fiscal year. The commission has the authority to adopt rules to implement this paragraph and establish guidelines for such bonds.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Florida permitholder who is to conduct a performance which is a part of the Jai Alai Tournament of Champions Meet shall not be required to apply for the license for said meet if it is to be run during the regular season for which such permitholder has a license. (2) Qualifying performances and the final performance of the tournament shall be held at different locations throughout the state, and the permitholders selected shall be under different ownership to the extent possible.

This credit shall be in the aggregate amount of $150,000, shall be prorated equally between the permitholders, and shall be utilized by the permitholders solely to supplement awards for the performance conducted during the Jai Alai Tournament of Champions Meet. All awards shall be paid to the tournament’s participating players no later than 30 days following the conclusion of said Jai Alai Tournament of Champions Meet.

The determination of the amount to be credited shall be made by the commission upon application of said permitholders. (6) The permitholder shall be entitled to said permitholder’s pro rata share of the $150,000 tax credit provided in subsection (5) without having to make application, so long as appropriate documentation to substantiate said expenditures thereunder is provided to the commission within 30 days following said Jai Alai Tournament of Champions Meet.

      "text": "550.375 Operation of certain harness tracks.— (1) The Legislature finds that the operation of harness tracks and legalized pari-mutuel and mutuel betting at harness tracks in this state will become a substantial business compatible with the best interests of the state, and the taxes derived therefrom will constitute an important and integral part of the tax structure of the state and counties. The Legislature further finds that the operation of harness tracks within the state will establish and encourage the acquisition and maintenance of breeding farms for the breeding of standardbred horses used in harness races, and that this exhibition sport will attract a large tourist business to the state. (2) Any permittee or licensee authorized under this section to transfer the location of its permit may conduct harness racing only between the hours of 7 p.m. and 2 a.m. A permit so transferred applies only to the locations provided in this section. The provisions of this chapter which prohibit the location and operation of a licensed harness track permittee and licensee within 100 air miles of the location of a racetrack authorized to conduct racing under this chapter and which prohibit the commission from granting any permit to a harness track at a location in the area in which there are three horse tracks located within 100 air miles thereof do not apply to a licensed harness track that is required by the terms of this section to race between the hours of 7 p.m. and 2 a.m. (3) A permit may not be issued by the commission for the operation of a harness track within 75 air miles of a location of a harness track licensed and operating under this chapter. (4) The permitholder conducting a harness horse race meet must pay the daily license fee, the admission tax, the tax on breaks, and the tax on pari-mutuel handle provided in s. 550.0951 and is subject to all penalties and sanctions provided in s. 550.0951(6). (5) Each licensed harness track in the state must schedule an average of one race per racing day in which horses bred in this state and duly registered as standardbred harness horses have preference as entries over non-Florida-bred horses. All licensed harness tracks must write the conditions for such races in which Florida-bred horses are preferred so as to assure that all Florida-bred horses available for racing at such tracks are given full opportunity to perform in the class races for which they are qualified, and the opportunity of performing must be afforded to each class of horses in the proportion that the number of horses in this class bears to the total number of Florida-bred horses available. However, a track is not required to write conditions for a race to accommodate a class of horses for which a race would otherwise not be scheduled at such track during its meeting. (6) If a permit has been transferred from a county under this section, no other transfer is permitted from such county.

(2)(a) Each totalisator company must apply to the commission for an annual business license. The application must include such information as the commission by rule requires. (b) As a part of its license application, each totalisator company must agree in writing to pay to the commission an amount equal to the loss of any state revenues from missed or canceled races, games, or performances due to acts of the totalisator company or its agents or employees or failures of the totalisator system, except for circumstances beyond the control of the totalisator company or agent or employee, as determined by the commission. (c) Each totalisator company must file with the commission a performance bond, acceptable to the commission, in the sum of $250,000 issued by a surety approved by the commission or must file proof of insurance, acceptable to the commission, against financial loss in the amount of $250,000, insuring the state against such a revenue loss. (d) In the event of a loss of state tax revenues, the commission shall determine: 1. The estimated revenue lost as a result of missed or canceled races, games, or performances; 2. The number of races, games, or performances which is practicable for the permitholder to conduct in an attempt to mitigate the revenue loss; and 3. The amount of the revenue loss which the makeup races, games, or performances will not recover and for which the totalisator company is liable. (e) Upon the making of such determinations, the commission shall issue to the totalisator company and to the affected permitholder an order setting forth the determinations of the commission. (f) If the order is contested by either the totalisator company or any affected permitholder, the provisions of chapter 120 apply. If the totalisator company contests the order on the grounds that the revenue loss was due to circumstances beyond its control, the totalisator company has the burden of proving that circumstances vary in fact beyond its control. For purposes of this paragraph, strikes and acts of God are beyond the control of the totalisator company. (g) Upon the failure of the totalisator company to make the payment found to be due the state, the commission may cause the forfeiture of the bond or may proceed against the insurance contract, and the proceeds of the bond or contract shall be deposited into the Pari-mutuel Wagering Trust Fund. If that bond was not posted or insurance obtained, the commission may proceed against any assets of the totalisator company to collect the amounts due under this subsection. (3) If the applicant meets the requirements of this section and commission rules and pays the license fee, the commission shall issue the license. (4) Each totalisator company shall conduct operations in accordance with rules adopted by the commission, in such form, content, and frequency as the commission by rule determines. (5) The commission and its representatives may enter and inspect any area of the premises of a licensed totalisator company, and may examine totalisator records, during the licensee’s regular business or operating hours.

(b) Subject to the requirements of this section, the commission is authorized to issue permits for the conduct of horseracing meets without pari-mutuel wagering or any other form of wagering being conducted in conjunction therewith. Such permits shall be known as nonwagering permits and may be issued only for horseracing meets. A horseracing permitholder need not obtain an additional permit from the commission for conducting nonwagering racing under this section, but must apply to the commission for the issuance of a license under this section. The holder of a nonwagering permit is prohibited from conducting pari-mutuel wagering or any other form of wagering in conjunction with racing conducted under the permit. Nothing in this subsection prohibits horseracing for any stake, purse, prize, or premium. (c) The holder of a nonwagering permit is exempt from the provisions of s. 550.105 and is exempt from the imposition of daily license fees and admission tax. (2)(a) Any person not prohibited from holding any type of pari-mutuel permit under s. 550.1815 shall be allowed to apply to the commission for a nonwagering permit. The applicant must demonstrate that the location or locations where the nonwagering permit will be used are available for such use and that the applicant has the financial ability to satisfy the reasonably anticipated operational expenses of the first racing year following final issuance of the nonwagering permit. If the racing facility is already built, the application must contain a statement, with reasonable supporting evidence, that the nonwagering permit will be used for horseracing within 1 year after the date on which it is granted. If the facility is not already built, the application must contain a statement, with reasonable supporting evidence, that substantial construction will be started within 1 year after the issuance of the nonwagering permit. (b) The commission may conduct an eligibility investigation to determine if the applicant meets the requirements of paragraph (a). (3)(a) Upon receipt of a nonwagering permit, the permitholder shall apply between January 15 and February 4 of each year for a nonwagering license for the next state fiscal year. Such application must set forth the days and locations at which the permitholder will conduct nonwagering horseracing, must demonstrate that any location to which the nonwagering license applies is available for such use, and must indicate any changes in ownership or management of the permitholder occurring since the date of application for the prior license. (b) On or before April 15 of each year, the commission shall issue a license authorizing the nonwagering permitholder to conduct nonwagering horseracing during the next state fiscal year during the period and for the number of days set forth in the application, subject to this section. (c) The commission may extend a nonwagering license for the 2024 calendar year through the 2024-2025 fiscal year upon application for such extension by the nonwagering permitholder. (4) Upon the approval of racing dates by the commission, the commission shall issue an annual nonwagering license to the nonwagering permitholder. (5) Only horses registered with an established breed registration organization, which organization shall be approved by the commission, shall be raced at any race meeting authorized by this section. (6) The commission may order any person participating in a nonwagering meet to cease and desist from participating in such meet if the commission determines the person to be not of good moral character in accordance with s. 550.1815. The commission may order the operators of a nonwagering meet to cease and desist from operating the meet if the commission determines the meet is being operated for any illegal purpose.

(2) Except as provided in subsection (1), a pari-mutuel permitholder that has met the applicable requirement for that permitholder to conduct live racing or games under s. 550.01215(1)(b), if any, for fiscal year 2020-2021 is qualified to, at any time, receive broadcasts of any class of pari-mutuel race or game and accept wagers on such races or games conducted by any class of permitholders licensed under this chapter. (3) If a permitholder elects to broadcast its signal to any permitholder in this state, any permitholder that is eligible to conduct intertrack wagering under the provisions of ss. 550.615-550.6345 is entitled to receive the broadcast and conduct intertrack wagering under this section; provided, however, that the host track may require a guest track within 25 miles of another permitholder to receive in any week at least 60 percent of the live races that the host track is making available on the days that the guest track is otherwise operating live races or games. A host track may require a guest track not operating live races or games and within 25 miles of another permitholder to accept within any week at least 60 percent of the live races that the host track is making available. A person may not restrain or attempt to restrain any permitholder that is otherwise authorized to conduct intertrack wagering from receiving the signal of any other permitholder or sending its signal to any permitholder. (4) In no event shall any intertrack wager be accepted on the same class of live races or games of any permitholder without the written consent of such operating permitholders conducting the same class of live races or games if the guest track is within the market area of such operating permitholder. (5) No permitholder within the market area of the host track shall take an intertrack wager on the host track without the consent of the host track. (6) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (3), in any area of the state where there are three or more horserace permitholders within 25 miles of each other, intertrack wagering between permitholders in said area of the state shall only be authorized under the following conditions: Any permitholder, other than a thoroughbred permitholder, may accept intertrack wagers on races or games conducted live by a permitholder of the same class or any harness permitholder located within such area and any harness permitholder may accept wagers on games conducted live by any jai alai permitholder located within its market area and from a jai alai permitholder located within the area specified in this subsection when no jai alai permitholder located within its market area is conducting live jai alai performances; any greyhound or jai alai permitholder may receive broadcasts of and accept wagers on any permitholder of the other class provided that a permitholder, other than the host track, of such other class is not operating a contemporaneous live performance within the market area. (7) In any county of the state where there are only two permits, one for dogracing and one for jai alai, no intertrack wager may be taken during the period of time when a permitholder is not licensed to conduct live races or games without the written consent of the other permitholder that is conducting live races or games. However, if neither permitholder is conducting live races or games, either permitholder may accept intertrack wagers on horseraces or on the same class of races or games, or on both horseraces and the same class of races or games as is authorized by its permit. (8) In any three contiguous counties of the state where there are only three permitholders, all of which are greyhound permitholders, if any permitholder leases the facility of another permitholder for all or any portion of the conduct of its live race meet pursuant to s. 550.475, such lessee may conduct intertrack wagering at its pre-lease permitted facility throughout the entire year. (9) In any two contiguous counties of the state in which there are located only four active permits, one for thoroughbred horse racing, two for greyhound dogracing, and one for jai alai games, no intertrack wager may be accepted on the same class of live races or games of any permitholder without the written consent of such operating permitholders conducting the same class of live races or games if the guest track is within the market area of such operating permitholder. (10) All costs of receiving the transmission of the broadcasts shall be borne by the guest track; and all costs of sending the broadcasts shall be borne by the host track.

(3) The payment to a breeders’ organization shall be combined with any other amounts received by the respective breeders’ and owners’ associations as so designated. Each breeders’ and owners’ association receiving these funds shall be allowed to withhold the same percentage as set forth in s. 550.2625 to be used for administering the payment of awards and for the general promotion of their respective industries.

In addition, an amount equal to 2 percent of the intertrack handle at the thoroughbred guest track shall be remitted by the host track to the guest thoroughbred track, which amount shall be deducted from the purses required to be paid by the host track. Such amount shall be paid by the guest thoroughbred track as purses during its current race meet. (b) If thoroughbred intertrack wagering is taken at any guest track, including a thoroughbred guest track, which is located within 25 miles of any thoroughbred permitholder that is not conducting live racing, the host track shall pay to such thoroughbred permitholder an amount equal to 2 percent of the intertrack handle at all such guest tracks, including the guest thoroughbred track, which amount shall be deducted from the purses otherwise required to be paid by the host track. This amount shall be used by the thoroughbred permitholder to pay purses during its next race meet. (2) For the purposes of calculation of odds and payoffs and distribution of the pari-mutuel pools, all intertrack wagers shall be combined with the pari-mutuel pools at the host track. (3) All forms of pari-mutuel wagering shall be allowed on all wagering authorized under s. 550.615 and this section. (4) The takeout on all intertrack wagering shall be the same as the takeout on similar pari-mutuel pools conducted at the host track. (5) The commission shall adopt rules providing an expedient accounting procedure for the transfer of the pari-mutuel pool in order to properly account for payment of state taxes, payment to the guest track, payment to the host track, payment of purses, payment to breeders’ associations, payment to horsemen’s associations, and payment to the public. (6) Each host track or guest track conducting intertrack wagering shall annually file an audit identifying the intertrack wagering conducted, from wagering conducted live, which audit shall be in compliance with s. 550.125. (7) No guest track shall make any payment to any patron on any pari-mutuel ticket purchased on any race broadcast until the stewards, judges, or panel of judges at the host track where the race or game originates has confirmed the race or game as official. (8) The entry and participation for a purse or other prize of any racing animal by the owner of the animal and the jockey or driver is tantamount to the acceptance of such purse or prize as full and complete remuneration and payment for such entry and participation, including the broadcast of such event. (9) A host track that has contracted with an out-of-state horse track to broadcast live races conducted at such out-of-state horse track pursuant to s. 550.3551(5) may broadcast such out-of-state races to any guest track and accept wagers thereon in the same manner as is provided in s. 550.3551. (a) For purposes of this section, “net proceeds” means the amount of takeout remaining after the payment of state taxes, purses required pursuant to s. 550.0951(3)(c)1., the cost to the permitholder required to be paid to the out-of-state horse track, and breeders’ awards paid to the Florida Thoroughbred Breeders’ Association and the Florida Standardbred Breeders and Owners Association, to be used as set forth in s. 550.625(2)(a) and (b). (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) and s. 550.625(1) and (2)(a), the distribution of the net proceeds that are retained by a thoroughbred host track from the takeout on an out-of-state race rebroadcast under this subsection shall be as follows: 1. One-third of the remainder of such proceeds shall be paid to the guest track; 2. One-third of the remainder of such proceeds shall be retained by the host track; and 3. One-third of the remainder of such proceeds shall be paid by the host track as purses at the host track. (c) All guest tracks other than thoroughbred permitholders that are eligible to receive wagers on out-of-state horseraces rebroadcast from a host track racing under a thoroughbred horse permit shall be subject to the distribution of the net proceeds as specified in paragraph (a) unless the host and guest permitholders and the recognized horseman’s group agree to a different distribution of their respective portions of the proceeds by contract. (d) Any permitholder located in any area of the state where there are only two permits, one for dogracing and one for jai alai, may accept wagers on rebroadcasts of out-of-state thoroughbred horse races from an in-state thoroughbred horse racing permitholder and shall not be subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) if such thoroughbred horse racing permitholder located within the area specified in this paragraph is both conducting live races and accepting wagers on out-of-state horseraces. In such case, the guest permitholder shall be entitled to 45 percent of the net proceeds on wagers accepted at the guest facility. The remaining proceeds shall be distributed as follows: one-half shall be retained by the host facility and one-half shall be paid by the host facility as purses at the host facility. (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) and s. 550.625(1) and (2)(b), the proceeds that are retained by a harness host facility from the takeout on a race broadcast under this subsection shall be distributed as follows: 1. Of the total intertrack handle on the broadcast, 1 percent shall be deducted from the proceeds and paid to the Florida Standardbred Breeders and Owners Association, Inc., to be used as set forth in s. 550.625(2)(b); 2. One-third of the remainder of such proceeds shall be paid to the guest facility; 3. One-third of the remainder of such proceeds shall be retained by the host facility; and 4. One-third of the remainder of said proceeds shall be paid by the host facility as purses at the host facility. (f) Any permitholder located in any area of the state where there are only two permits, one for dogracing and one for jai alai, may accept wagers on rebroadcasts of out-of-state harness horse races from an in-state harness horse racing permitholder and shall not be subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) if such harness horse racing permitholder located within the area specified in this paragraph is conducting live races. In such case, the guest permitholder shall be entitled to 45 percent of the net proceeds on wagers accepted at the guest facility. The remaining proceeds shall be distributed as follows: one-half shall be retained by the host facility and one-half shall be paid by the host facility as purses at the host facility. (g)1. Any thoroughbred permitholder which accepts wagers on a simulcast signal must make the signal available to any permitholder that is eligible to conduct intertrack wagering under the provisions of ss. 550.615-550.6345. 2. Any thoroughbred permitholder which accepts wagers on a simulcast signal received after 6 p.m. must make such signal available to any permitholder that is eligible to conduct intertrack wagering under the provisions of ss. 550.615-550.6345, including any permitholder located as specified in s. 550.615(6). Such guest permitholders are authorized to accept wagers on such simulcast signal, notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary. 3. Any thoroughbred permitholder which accepts wagers on a simulcast signal received after 6 p.m. must make such signal available to any permitholder that is eligible to conduct intertrack wagering under the provisions of ss. 550.615-550.6345, including any permitholder located as specified in 1 s. 550.615(9). Such guest permitholders are authorized to accept wagers on such simulcast signals for a number of performances not to exceed that which constitutes a full schedule of live races for a quarter horse permitholder pursuant to s. 550.002(10), notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, except that the restrictions provided in 1 s. 550.615(9)(a) apply to wagers on such simulcast signals. No thoroughbred permitholder shall be required to continue to rebroadcast a simulcast signal to any in-state permitholder if the average per performance gross receipts returned to the host permitholder over the preceding 30-day period were less than $100. Subject to the provisions of s. 550.615(4), as a condition of receiving rebroadcasts of thoroughbred simulcast signals under this paragraph, a guest permitholder must accept intertrack wagers on all live races conducted by all then-operating thoroughbred permitholders. (10) All races or games conducted at a permitholder’s facility, all broadcasts of such races or games, and all broadcast rights relating thereto are owned by the permitholder at whose facility such races or games are conducted and constitute the permitholder’s property as defined in s. 812.012(4). Transmission, reception of a transmission, exhibition, use, or other appropriation of such races or games, broadcasts of such races or games, or broadcast rights relating thereto without the written consent of the permitholder constitutes a theft of such property under s. 812.014; and in addition to the penal sanctions contained in s. 812.014, the permitholder has the right to avail itself of the civil remedies specified in ss. 772.104, 772.11, and 812.035 in addition to any other remedies available under applicable state or federal law. (11) To the extent that any rights, privileges, or immunities granted to pari-mutuel permitholders in this section conflict with any provision of any other law or affect any order or rule of the Florida Public Service Commission relating to the regulation of public utilities and the furnishing to others of any communication, wire service, or other similar service or equipment, the rights, privileges, and immunities granted under this section prevail over such conflicting provision.

(1) Upon application to the commission on or before January 31 of each year, any person that is licensed to conduct public sales of thoroughbred horses pursuant to s. 535.01 and that has conducted at least 8 days of thoroughbred horse sales at a permanent sales facility in this state for at least 3 consecutive years before such application shall be issued a license, subject to the conditions set forth in this section, to conduct intertrack wagering at such a permanent sales facility. No more than one such license may be issued, and no such license may be issued for a facility located within 50 miles of any thoroughbred permitholder’s track. (2) If more than one application is submitted for such license, the commission shall determine which applicant shall be granted the license. In making its determination, the commission shall grant the license to the applicant demonstrating superior capabilities, as measured by the length of time the applicant has been conducting thoroughbred sales within this state or elsewhere, the applicant’s total volume of thoroughbred horse sales, within this state or elsewhere, the length of time the applicant has maintained a permanent thoroughbred sales facility in this state, and the quality of the facility. (3) The applicant must comply with the provisions of ss. 550.125 and 550.1815. (4) The licensee shall be considered a guest track under this chapter.

(b) With regard to requests for criminal history record information on each applicant for a license, and with regard to the effect of a criminal record on the issuance or renewal of a license, determine for each category of participants in pari-mutuel wagering which licensure requirements for that category are, in its judgment, the most restrictive licensure requirements of any party state for that category and to adopt licensure requirements for that category which are, in its judgment, comparable to those most restrictive requirements. (2) Investigate applicants for licensure by the compact committee and, as permitted by federal and state law, gather information on such applicants, including criminal history record information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and relevant state and local law enforcement agencies, and, where appropriate, from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and law enforcement agencies of other countries, which is necessary to determine whether a license should be issued under the licensure requirements established by the committee under subsection (1). The fingerprints of each applicant for licensure by the compact committee shall be taken by the compact committee, its employees, or its designee, and, pursuant to Pub. L. No. 92-544 or Pub. L. No. 100-413, shall be forwarded to a state identification bureau or to the Association of Racing Commissioners International, Inc., for submission to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a criminal history record check. Such fingerprints may be submitted by electronic or other means authorized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation or other receiving law enforcement agency. (3) Issue licenses to, and renew the licenses of, participants in pari-mutuel wagering who are found by the committee to have met the licensure and renewal requirements established by the committee under subsection (1). The compact committee shall not have the power or authority to deny a license. If the compact committee determines that an applicant is not eligible for the issuance or renewal of a compact committee license, the compact committee shall notify the applicant that her or his application will not be processed further. Such notification does not constitute and shall not be considered to be the denial of a license. Any such applicant shall have the right to present additional evidence to, and be heard by, the compact committee, but the final decision on issuance or renewal of the license shall be made by the compact committee using the requirements established under subsection (1). (4) Enter into contracts or agreements with governmental agencies and nongovernmental persons to provide personal services for its activities and such other services as are necessary to effectuate the purposes of this compact. (5) Create, appoint, and abolish those offices, employments, and positions, including that of executive director, that it considers necessary for the purposes of this compact; prescribe the powers, duties, and qualifications of, and hire persons to fill, such offices, employments, and positions; and provide for the removal, term, tenure, compensation, fringe benefits, retirement benefits, and other conditions of employment of persons filling such offices, employments, and positions. (6) Borrow, accept, or contract for the services of personnel from any state, the United States, or any other governmental agency, or from any person, firm, association, corporation, or other entity. (7) Acquire, hold, and dispose of real and personal property by gift, purchase, lease, or license, or in other similar manner, in furtherance of the purposes of this compact. (8) Charge a fee to each applicant for an initial license or renewal of a license. (9) Receive other funds through gifts, grants, and appropriations.

(c) Reserves the right to: 1. Apply its own standards in determining whether, on the facts of a particular case, a compact committee license should be suspended or revoked. Any party state that suspends or revokes a compact committee license shall, through its racing commission or the equivalent thereof, or otherwise, promptly notify the compact committee of that suspension or revocation. 2. Apply its own standards in determining licensure eligibility, under the laws of that party state, for categories of participants in pari-mutuel wagering which the compact committee decides not to license and for individual participants in pari-mutuel wagering who do not meet the licensure requirements of the compact committee. 3. Establish its own licensure standards for those who are not covered by the compact committee license.
