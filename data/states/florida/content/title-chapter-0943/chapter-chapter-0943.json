(2) Upon specific direction by the Governor in writing to the executive director, the department shall investigate the misconduct, in connection with their official duties, of public officials and employees and of members of public corporations and authorities subject to suspension or removal by the Governor. All records related to such investigation, including any correspondence from the Governor, are confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) until such time as the investigation is completed or ceases to be active. For purposes of this subsection, an investigation is considered “active” while the investigation is being conducted by the department with a reasonable, good faith belief that it may lead to the filing of criminal proceedings or gubernatorial action. An investigation does not cease to be active if the department is proceeding with reasonable dispatch and there is a good faith belief that either gubernatorial action or action by the department or other administrative or law enforcement agency may be initiated. (3) The department shall employ such administrative, clerical, technical, and professional personnel, including directors, as are required, at salaries to be established by the department, to perform such duties as the department may prescribe. (4) The department shall adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 to implement the provisions of law conferring powers or duties upon it.

(6)(a) The department shall be governed by all laws regulating the purchase of supplies and equipment as other state agencies and may enter into contracts with other state agencies to make photographs and photocopies, to transmit information electronically, and to perform all those services consonant with the purpose of this chapter. (b) It may use without charge the technical personnel and equipment of any state agency. (7) The powers herein enumerated, or set forth in other parts of this chapter, shall be deemed an exercise of the state police power for the protection of the welfare, health, peace, safety, and morals of the people and shall be liberally construed. (8) The Department of Legal Affairs shall be the legal adviser to and shall represent the department. (9) The department may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this chapter any and all donations of property, real, personal, or mixed, and grants of money, from any governmental unit or public agency or from any institution, person, firm, or corporation. Such moneys shall be deposited, disbursed, and administered in a trust fund as provided by law. (10) The department shall make an annual report of its activities to the Governor and to the Legislature and include in such report its recommendations for additional legislation.

The department shall serve as custodial manager of the Criminal Justice Network developed and maintained as part of the information system authorized by this subsection. (14) The department, with respect to counter-terrorism efforts, responses to acts of terrorism within or affecting this state, coordinating with and providing assistance to the Federal Government in the enforcement of federal immigration laws, responses to immigration enforcement incidents within or affecting this state, and other matters related to the domestic security of Florida as it relates to terrorism and immigration enforcement incidents, shall coordinate and direct the law enforcement, initial emergency, and other initial responses. The department shall work closely with the Division of Emergency Management, other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, fire and rescue agencies, first-responder agencies, and others involved in preparation against acts of terrorism in or affecting this state, immigration enforcement incidents within or affecting this state, and in the response to such acts or incidents. The executive director of the department, or another member of the department designated by the director, shall serve as Chief of Domestic Security for the purpose of directing and coordinating such efforts. The department and Chief of Domestic Security shall use the regional domestic security task forces as established in this chapter to assist in such efforts. (15) The Department of Law Enforcement, in consultation with the Criminal and Juvenile Justice Information Systems Council established in s. 943.06, shall modify the existing statewide uniform statute table in its criminal history system to meet the business requirements of state and local criminal justice and law enforcement agencies. In order to accomplish this objective, the department shall: (a) Define the minimum business requirements necessary for successful implementation. (b) Consider the charging and booking requirements of sheriffs’ offices and police departments and the business requirements of state attorneys, public defenders, criminal conflict and civil regional counsel, clerks of court, judges, and state law enforcement agencies.

      "text": "943.0438 Athletic coaches for independent sanctioning authorities.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Athletic coach” means a person who: 1. Is authorized by an independent sanctioning authority to work as a coach, assistant coach, manager, or referee, whether for compensation or as a volunteer, for a youth athletic team based in this state; and 2. Has direct contact with one or more minors on the youth athletic team. (b) “Independent sanctioning authority” means a private, nongovernmental entity that organizes, operates, or coordinates a youth athletic team in this state if the team includes one or more minors and is not affiliated with a private school as defined in s. 1002.01. (2) An independent sanctioning authority shall: (a) Effective July 1, 2026, conduct a level 2 background screening under s. 435.04 of each current and prospective athletic coach. The authority may not delegate this responsibility to an individual team and may not authorize any person to act as an athletic coach unless a level 2 background screening is conducted and does not result in disqualification under paragraph (b). (b)1. Before January 1, 2026, or a later date as determined by the Agency for Health Care Administration for the participation of qualified entities in the Care Provider Background Screening Clearinghouse under s. 435.12, disqualify any person from acting as an athletic coach as provided in s. 435.04. The authority may allow a person disqualified under this subparagraph to act as an athletic coach if it determines that the person meets the requirements for an exemption from disqualification under s. 435.07. 2. On or after January 1, 2026, or a later date as determined by the Agency for Health Care Administration, not allow any person to act as an athletic coach if he or she does not pass the background screening qualifications in s. 435.04. The authority may allow a person disqualified under this subparagraph to act as an athletic coach if the person has successfully completed the exemption from the disqualification process under s. 435.07. (c) Provide, within 7 business days following the background screening under paragraph (a), written notice to a person disqualified under this section advising the person of the results and of his or her disqualification. (d) Maintain for at least 5 years documentation of: 1. The results for each person screened under paragraph (a); and 2. The written notice of disqualification provided to each person under paragraph (c). (e) Adopt guidelines to educate athletic coaches, officials, administrators, and youth athletes and their parents or guardians of the nature and risk of concussion and head injury. (f) Adopt bylaws or policies that require the parent or guardian of a youth who is participating in athletic competition or who is a candidate for an athletic team to sign and return an informed consent that explains the nature and risk of concussion and head injury, including the risk of continuing to play after concussion or head injury, each year before participating in athletic competition or engaging in any practice, tryout, workout, or other physical activity associated with the youth’s candidacy for an athletic team. (g) Adopt bylaws or policies that require each youth athlete who is suspected of sustaining a concussion or head injury in a practice or competition to be immediately removed from the activity. A youth athlete who has been removed from an activity may not return to practice or competition until the youth submits to the athletic coach a written medical clearance to return stating that the youth athlete no longer exhibits signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or other head injury. Medical clearance must be authorized by the appropriate health care practitioner trained in the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of concussions as defined by the Sports Medicine Advisory Committee of the Florida High School Athletic Association. (3) In a civil action for the death of, or injury or damage to, a third person caused by the intentional tort of an athletic coach that relates to alleged sexual misconduct by the athletic coach, there is a rebuttable presumption that the independent sanctioning authority was not negligent in authorizing the athletic coach if the authority complied with the background screening and disqualification requirements of subsection (2) prior to such authorization. (4) Independent sanctioning authorities for youth athletic teams must participate in the Volunteer and Employee Criminal History System, as authorized by the National Child Protection Act of 1993 and s. 943.0542.

(b)1. If the minor is not classified as a serious or habitual juvenile offender or committed to a maximum-risk residential facility under chapter 985, the program shall retain the minor’s criminal history record for 2 years after the date the minor reaches 19 years of age, at which time the record shall be expunged unless it meets the criteria of paragraph (2)(a) or paragraph (2)(b). 2. A minor described in subparagraph 1. may apply to the department to have his or her criminal history record expunged before the minor reaches 21 years of age. To be eligible for expunction under this subparagraph, the minor must be 18 years of age or older and less than 21 years of age and have not been charged by the state attorney with or found to have committed any criminal offense within the 5-year period before the application date. The only offenses eligible to be expunged under this subparagraph are those that the minor committed before the minor reached 18 years of age. A criminal history record expunged under this subparagraph requires the approval of the state attorney for each circuit in which an offense specified in the criminal history record occurred. A minor seeking to expunge a criminal history record under this subparagraph shall apply to the department for expunction in the manner prescribed by rule. An application for expunction under this subparagraph shall include: a. A processing fee of $75 to the department for placement in the Department of Law Enforcement Operating Trust Fund, unless such fee is waived by the executive director. b. A full set of fingerprints of the applicant taken by a law enforcement agency for purposes of identity verification. c. A sworn, written statement from the minor seeking relief that he or she is no longer under court supervision applicable to the disposition of the arrest or alleged criminal activity to which the application to expunge pertains and that he or she has not been charged with or found to have committed a criminal offense, in any jurisdiction of the state or within the United States, within the 5-year period before the application date. A person who knowingly provides false information on the sworn statement required by this sub-subparagraph commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. 3.

Such online access shall be provided without charge to the state courts system. Sealed records received by the courts under this section remain confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1).

Sealed records and confidential juvenile records received by the private entity under this section remain confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1). (9) Notwithstanding s. 943.0525, and any user agreements adopted pursuant thereto, and notwithstanding the confidentiality of sealed records as provided for in s. 943.059 and juvenile records as provided for in paragraph (3)(b), the Department of Corrections shall provide, in a timely manner, copies of the Florida criminal history records for inmates housed in a private state correctional facility to the private entity under contract to operate the facility pursuant to s. 944.105.

Sealed records and confidential juvenile records received by the private entity under this section remain confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1). (10) Notwithstanding s. 943.0525 and any user agreements adopted pursuant thereto, and notwithstanding the confidentiality of sealed records as provided for in s. 943.059 or of juvenile records as provided for in paragraph (3)(b), the Department of Juvenile Justice or any other state or local criminal justice agency may provide copies of the Florida criminal history records for juvenile offenders currently or formerly detained or housed in a contracted juvenile assessment center or detention facility or serviced in a contracted treatment program and for employees or other individuals who will have access to these facilities, only to the entity under direct contract with the Department of Juvenile Justice to operate these facilities or programs pursuant to s. 985.688. The criminal justice agency providing such data may assess a charge for the Florida criminal history records pursuant to chapter 119. Sealed records and confidential juvenile records received by the private entity under this section remain confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1). Information provided under this section shall be used only for the criminal justice purpose for which it was requested and may not be further disseminated. (11) A criminal justice agency that is authorized under federal rules or law to conduct a criminal history background check on an agency employee who is not certified by the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission under s. 943.12 may submit to the department the fingerprints of the noncertified employee to obtain state and national criminal history information. The fingerprints shall be retained and entered in the statewide automated biometric identification system authorized by s. 943.05 and shall be available for all purposes and uses authorized for arrest fingerprint submissions entered in the statewide automated biometric identification system pursuant to s. 943.051. The department shall search all arrest fingerprint submissions received pursuant to s. 943.051 against the fingerprints retained in the statewide automated biometric identification system pursuant to this section. In addition to all purposes and uses authorized for arrest fingerprint submissions for which submitted fingerprints may be used, any arrest record that is identified with the retained employee fingerprints must be reported to the submitting employing agency. (12) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when a criminal history check or a duty to disclose the absence of a criminal history check is mandated by state law, or when a privilege or benefit is conferred by state law in return for exercising an option of conducting a criminal history check, the referenced criminal history check, whether it is an initial or renewal check, shall include a Florida criminal history provided by the department as set forth in this section. Such Florida criminal history information may be provided by a private vendor only if that information is directly obtained from the department for each request. When a national criminal history check is required or authorized by state law, the national criminal history check shall be submitted by and through the department in the manner established by the department for such checks, unless otherwise required by federal law. The fee for criminal history information as established by state law or, in the case of national checks, by the Federal Government, shall be borne by the person or entity submitting the request, or as provided by law. Criminal history information provided by any other governmental entity of this state or any private entity shall not be substituted for criminal history information provided by the department when the criminal history check or a duty to disclose the absence of a criminal history check is required by statute or is made a condition of a privilege or benefit by law. When fingerprints are required or permitted to be used as a basis for identification in conducting such a criminal history check, the fingerprints must be taken by a law enforcement agency employee, a government agency employee, a qualified electronic fingerprint service provider, or a private employer. Fingerprints taken by the subject of the criminal history check may not be accepted or used for the purpose of identification in conducting the criminal history check. (13)(a) For the department to accept an electronic fingerprint submission from: 1. A private vendor engaged in the business of providing electronic fingerprint submission; or 2. A private entity or public agency that submits the fingerprints of its own employees, volunteers, contractors, associates, or applicants for the purpose of conducting a required or permitted criminal history background check, the vendor, entity, or agency submitting the fingerprints must enter into an agreement with the department that, at a minimum, obligates the vendor, entity, or agency to comply with certain specified standards to ensure that all persons having direct or indirect responsibility for verifying identification, taking fingerprints, and electronically submitting fingerprints are qualified to do so and will ensure the integrity and security of all personal information gathered from the persons whose fingerprints are submitted. (b) Such standards shall include, but need not be limited to, requiring that: 1. All persons responsible for taking fingerprints and collecting personal identifying information from the persons being fingerprinted to meet current written state and federal guidelines for identity verification and for recording legible fingerprints; 2. The department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s technical standards for the electronic submission of fingerprints are satisfied; 3. The fingerprint images electronically submitted satisfy the department’s and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s quality standards; and 4. A person may not take his or her own fingerprints for submission to the department. (c) The requirement for entering into an agreement with the department for this purpose does not apply to criminal justice agencies. (d) The agreement with the department must require the vendor, entity, or agency to collect from the person or entity on whose behalf the fingerprints are submitted the fees prescribed by state and federal law for processing the fingerprints for a criminal history check. The agreement must provide that such fees be timely remitted to the department by a payment mechanism approved by the department. If requested by the vendor, entity, or agency, and with the approval of the department, such fees may be timely remitted to the department by a vendor, entity, or agency upon receipt of an invoice for such fees from the department. Failure of a vendor, entity, or agency to pay the amount due on a timely basis or as invoiced by the department may result in the refusal by the department to accept future fingerprint submissions until all fees due and owing are paid. (14) Notwithstanding any other law, the department shall provide to the Sexually Violent Predator Program within the Department of Children and Families online access to the arrest notification program through the Florida Criminal Justice Network to be used solely in support of the duties of the Department of Children and Families as provided in s. 394.926(4).

(2) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Diversion program” means a program under s. 985.12, s. 985.125, s. 985.155, or s. 985.16 or a program to which a referral is made by a state attorney under s. 985.15. (b) “Expunction” has the same meaning ascribed in and effect as s. 943.0585, except that: 1. Section 943.0585(6)(b) does not apply, except that the criminal history record of a person whose record is expunged pursuant to this section shall be made available only to criminal justice agencies for the purpose of: a. Determining eligibility for diversion programs; b. A criminal investigation; or c. Making a prosecutorial decision under s. 985.15. 2. Records maintained by local criminal justice agencies in the county in which the arrest occurred that are eligible for expunction pursuant to this section shall be sealed as the term is used in s. 943.059. (3) The department shall expunge the nonjudicial arrest record of a minor who has successfully completed a diversion program if that minor: (a) Submits an application for diversion expunction, on a form prescribed by the department, signed by the minor’s parent or legal guardian, or by the minor if he or she has reached the age of majority at the time of applying. (b) Submits to the department, with the application, an official written statement from the state attorney for the county in which the arrest occurred certifying that the minor has successfully completed that county’s diversion program; that the minor’s participation in the program was based on an arrest for a misdemeanor offense or for a felony offense, other than a forcible felony as defined in s. 776.08 or a felony involving the manufacture, sale, purchase, transport, possession, or use of a firearm or weapon as those terms are defined in s. 790.001; and that the minor has not otherwise been charged by the state attorney with, or found to have committed, any criminal offense or comparable ordinance violation. (c) Has never been, before filing the application for expunction, charged by the state attorney with, or found to have committed, any criminal offense or comparable ordinance violation. (4) Expunction or sealing granted under this section does not prevent the minor who receives such relief from petitioning for the expunction or sealing of a later criminal history record as provided for in ss. 943.0583, 943.0585, and 943.059, if the minor is otherwise eligible under those sections. (5) A nonjudicial record of the arrest of a minor who has successfully completed a diversion program which is sealed or expunged under this section and which is retained by the department is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution, except that the record may be made available to criminal justice agencies only for the purposes specified in subparagraph (2)(b)1.

      "text": "943.0583 Human trafficking victim expunction.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Human trafficking” has the same meaning as provided in s. 787.06. (b) “Official documentation” means any documentation issued by a federal, state, or local agency tending to show a person’s status as a victim of human trafficking. (c) “Victim of human trafficking” means a person subjected to coercion, as defined in s. 787.06, for the purpose of being used in human trafficking, a child under 18 years of age subjected to human trafficking, or an individual subjected to human trafficking as defined by federal law. (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon the filing of a petition as provided in this section, any court in the circuit in which the petitioner was arrested, so long as the court has jurisdiction over the class of offense or offenses sought to be expunged, may order a criminal justice agency to expunge the criminal history record of a victim of human trafficking who complies with the requirements of this section. A petition need not be filed in the court where the petitioner’s criminal proceeding or proceedings originally occurred. This section does not confer any right to the expunction of any criminal history record, and any request for expunction of a criminal history record may be denied at the discretion of the court. The clerk of the court may not charge a filing fee, service charge, or copy fee or any other charge for a petition filed under this section. The clerk of the court shall treat a petition seeking to expunge more than one eligible case as a single petition. (3) A person who is a victim of human trafficking may petition for the expunction of a criminal history record resulting from the arrest or filing of charges for one or more offenses committed or reported to have been committed while the person was a victim of human trafficking, which offense was committed or reported to have been committed as a part of the human trafficking scheme of which the person was a victim or at the direction of an operator of the scheme, including, but not limited to, violations under chapters 796 and 847, without regard to the disposition of the arrest or of any charges. However, this section does not apply to any offense listed in s. 775.084(1)(b)1. Determination of the petition under this section should be by a preponderance of the evidence. A conviction expunged under this section is deemed to have been vacated due to a substantive defect in the underlying criminal proceedings. If a person is adjudicated not guilty by reason of insanity or is found to be incompetent to stand trial for any such charge, the expunction of the criminal history record may not prevent the entry of the judgment or finding in state and national databases for use in determining eligibility to purchase or possess a firearm or to carry a concealed firearm, as authorized in s. 790.065(2)(a)4.c. and 18 U.S.C. s. 922(t), nor shall it prevent any governmental agency that is authorized by state or federal law to determine eligibility to purchase or possess a firearm or to carry a concealed firearm from accessing or using the record of the judgment or finding in the course of such agency’s official duties. (4) A petition under this section must be initiated by the petitioner with due diligence after the victim has ceased to be a victim of human trafficking or has sought services for victims of human trafficking, subject to reasonable concerns for the safety of the victim, family members of the victim, or other victims of human trafficking that may be jeopardized by the bringing of such petition or for other reasons consistent with the purpose of this section. (5) Official documentation of the victim’s status creates a presumption that his or her participation in the offense was a result of having been a victim of human trafficking but is not required for granting a petition under this section. A determination made without such official documentation must be made by a showing of clear and convincing evidence. (6) Each petition to a court to expunge a criminal history record is complete only when accompanied by: (a) The petitioner’s sworn statement attesting that the petitioner is eligible for such an expunction to the best of his or her knowledge or belief. (b) Official documentation of the petitioner’s status as a victim of human trafficking, if any exists. Any person who knowingly provides false information on such sworn statement to the court commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. (7)(a) In judicial proceedings under this section, a copy of the completed petition to expunge shall be served upon the appropriate state attorney or the statewide prosecutor and upon the arresting agency; however, it is not necessary to make any agency other than the state a party. The appropriate state attorney or the statewide prosecutor and the arresting agency may respond to the court regarding the completed petition to expunge. (b) The petitioner or the petitioner’s attorney may appear at any hearing under this section telephonically, via video conference, or by other electronic means. (c) The court shall allow an advocate from a state attorney’s office, law enforcement agency, safe house or safe foster home as defined in s. 409.1678(1), or a residential facility offering services to adult victims of human trafficking to be present with the petitioner during any court proceedings or hearings under this section, if the petitioner has made such a request and the advocate is able to be present. (d) If relief is granted by the court, the clerk of the court shall certify copies of the order to the appropriate state attorney or the statewide prosecutor and the arresting agency. The arresting agency is responsible for forwarding the order to any other agency listed in the court order to which the arresting agency disseminated the criminal history record information to which the order pertains. The department shall forward the order to expunge to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The clerk of the court shall certify a copy of the order to any other agency that the records of the court reflect has received the criminal history record from the court. (8)(a) Any criminal history record of a minor or an adult that is ordered expunged pursuant to this section must be physically destroyed or obliterated by any criminal justice agency having custody of such record, except that any criminal history record in the custody of the department must be retained in all cases. (b) The person who is the subject of a criminal history record that is expunged under this section may lawfully deny or fail to acknowledge the arrests covered by the expunged record, except when the subject of the record is a candidate for employment with a criminal justice agency or is a defendant in a criminal prosecution. (c) Subject to the exceptions in paragraph (b), a person who has been granted an expunction under this section may not be held under any law of this state to commit perjury or to be otherwise liable for giving a false statement by reason of such person’s failure to recite or acknowledge an expunged criminal history record. (9) Any reference to any other chapter, section, or subdivision of the Florida Statutes in this section constitutes a general reference under the doctrine of incorporation by reference. (10)(a) A criminal history record ordered expunged under this section that is retained by the department is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution, except that the record shall be made available: 1. To criminal justice agencies for their respective criminal justice purposes. 2. To any governmental agency that is authorized by state or federal law to determine eligibility to purchase or possess a firearm or to carry a concealed firearm for use in the course of such agency’s official duties. 3. Upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction. (b) A criminal justice agency may retain a notation indicating compliance with an order to expunge. (11)(a) The following criminal intelligence information or criminal investigative information is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution: 1. Any information that reveals the identity of a person who is a victim of human trafficking whose criminal history record has been expunged under this section. 2. Any information that may reveal the identity of a person who is a victim of human trafficking whose criminal history record has been ordered expunged under this section. (b) Criminal investigative information and criminal intelligence information made confidential and exempt under this subsection may be disclosed by a law enforcement agency: 1. In the furtherance of its official duties and responsibilities. 2. For print, publication, or broadcast if the law enforcement agency determines that such release would assist in locating or identifying a person that the agency believes to be missing or endangered. The information provided should be limited to that needed to identify or locate the victim. 3. To another governmental agency in the furtherance of its official duties and responsibilities. (c) This exemption applies to such confidential and exempt criminal intelligence information or criminal investigative information held by a law enforcement agency before, on, or after the effective date of the exemption. (12)(a) A petition filed under this section and all pleadings and documents related to the petition are confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. (b) This subsection is subject to the Open Government Sunset Review Act in accordance with s. 119.15 and is repealed on October 2, 2028, unless reviewed and saved from repeal through reenactment by the Legislature.

(b) An indictment, information, or other charging document was filed or issued in the case giving rise to the criminal history record, was dismissed or nolle prosequi by the state attorney or statewide prosecutor, or was dismissed by a court of competent jurisdiction or a judgment of acquittal was rendered by a judge, or a verdict of not guilty was rendered by a judge or jury. (c) The person is not seeking to expunge a criminal history record that is ineligible for court-ordered expunction under s. 943.0584. (d) The person has never, as of the date the application for a certificate of expunction is filed, been adjudicated guilty in this state of a criminal offense or been adjudicated delinquent in this state for committing any felony or any of the following misdemeanors, unless the record of such adjudication of delinquency has been expunged pursuant to s. 943.0515: 1. Assault, as defined in s. 784.011; 2. Battery, as defined in s. 784.03; 3. Assault on a law enforcement officer, a firefighter, or other specified officers, as defined in s. 784.07(2)(a); 4. Carrying a concealed weapon, as defined in s. 790.01(2); 5. Open carrying of a weapon, as defined in s. 790.053; 6. Unlawful possession or discharge of a weapon or firearm at a school-sponsored event or on school property, as defined in s. 790.115; 7. Unlawful use of destructive devices or bombs, as defined in s. 790.1615(1); 8. Unlawful possession of a firearm, as defined in s. 790.22(5); 9. Exposure of sexual organs, as defined in s. 800.03; 10. Arson, as defined in s. 806.031(1); 11. Petit theft, as defined in s. 812.014(3); 12. Neglect of a child, as defined in s. 827.03(1)(e); or 13. Cruelty to animals, as defined in s. 828.12(1). (e) The person has not been adjudicated guilty of, or adjudicated delinquent for committing, any of the acts stemming from the arrest or alleged criminal activity to which the petition pertains. (f) The person is no longer under court supervision applicable to the disposition of arrest or alleged criminal activity to which the petition to expunge pertains. (g) The person has never secured a prior sealing or expunction of a criminal history record under this section, s. 943.059, former s. 893.14, former s. 901.33, or former s. 943.058, unless expunction is sought of a criminal history record previously sealed for 10 years pursuant to paragraph (h) and the record is otherwise eligible for expunction. (h) The person has previously obtained a court-ordered sealing the criminal history record under s. 943.059, former s. 893.14, former s. 901.33, or former s. 943.058 for a minimum of 10 years because adjudication was withheld or because all charges related to the arrest or alleged criminal activity to which the petition to expunge pertains were not dismissed before trial, without regard to whether the outcome of the trial was other than an adjudication of guilt. The requirement for the record to have previously been sealed for a minimum of 10 years does not apply if a plea was not entered or all charges related to the arrest or alleged criminal activity to which the petition to expunge pertains were dismissed before trial or a judgment of acquittal was rendered by a judge or a verdict of not guilty was rendered by a judge or jury. (2) CERTIFICATE OF ELIGIBILITY.—Before petitioning a court to expunge a criminal history record, a person seeking to expunge a criminal history record must apply to the department for a certificate of eligibility for expunction. The department shall adopt rules to establish procedures for applying for and issuing a certificate of eligibility for expunction. (a) The department shall issue a certificate of eligibility for expunction to a person who is the subject of a criminal history record if that person: 1. Satisfies the eligibility criteria in paragraphs (1)(a)-(h) and is not ineligible under s. 943.0584. 2. Has submitted to the department a written certified statement from the appropriate state attorney or statewide prosecutor which confirms the criminal history record complies with the criteria in paragraph (1)(a) or paragraphs (1)(b) and (c). 3. Has submitted to the department a certified copy of the disposition of the charge to which the petition to expunge pertains. 4. Remits a $75 processing fee to the department for placement in the Department of Law Enforcement Operating Trust Fund, unless the executive director waives such fee. (b) A certificate of eligibility for expunction is valid for 12 months after the date stamped on the certificate when issued by the department. After that time, the petitioner must reapply to the department for a new certificate of eligibility. The petitioner’s status and the law in effect at the time of the renewal application determine the petitioner’s eligibility. (3) PETITION.—Each petition to expunge a criminal history record must be accompanied by: (a) A valid certificate of eligibility issued by the department. (b) The petitioner’s sworn statement that he or she: 1. Satisfies the eligibility requirements for expunction in subsection (1). 2. Is eligible for expunction to the best of his or her knowledge and does not have any other petition to seal or expunge a criminal history record pending before any court. A person who knowingly provides false information on such sworn statement commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. (4) COURT AUTHORITY.— (a) The courts of this state have jurisdiction over their own procedures, including the maintenance, expunction, and correction of judicial records containing criminal history information to the extent that such procedures are not inconsistent with the conditions, responsibilities, and duties established by this section. (b) A court of competent jurisdiction may order a criminal justice agency to expunge the criminal history record of a minor or an adult who complies with the requirements of this section. The court may not order a criminal justice agency to expunge a criminal history record until the person seeking to expunge a criminal history record has applied for and received a certificate of eligibility under subsection (2). (c) The court may order expunction of a criminal history record pertaining to one arrest or one incident of alleged criminal activity only, except that the court may order the expunction of a criminal history record pertaining to more than one arrest if the additional arrests directly relate to the original arrest. If the court intends to order the expunction of records pertaining to such additional arrests, such intent must be specified in the order. A criminal justice agency may not expunge any record pertaining to such additional arrests if the order to expunge does not articulate the intention of the court to expunge a record pertaining to more than one arrest. This section does not prevent the court from ordering the expunction of only a portion of a criminal history record pertaining to one arrest or one incident of alleged criminal activity. (d) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a criminal justice agency may comply with laws, court orders, and official requests of other jurisdictions relating to expunction, correction, or confidential handling of criminal history records or information derived therefrom. (e) This section does not confer any right to expunction of any criminal history record, and any request for expunction of a criminal history record may be denied at the sole discretion of the court. (5) PROCESSING OF A PETITION OR AN ORDER.— (a) In judicial proceedings under this section, a copy of the completed petition to expunge shall be served upon the appropriate state attorney or the statewide prosecutor and upon the arresting agency; however, it is not necessary to make any agency other than the state a party. The appropriate state attorney or the statewide prosecutor and the arresting agency may respond to the court regarding the completed petition to expunge. (b) If relief is granted by the court, the clerk of the court shall certify copies of the order to the appropriate state attorney or the statewide prosecutor and the arresting agency. The arresting agency shall forward the order to any other agency to which the arresting agency disseminated the criminal history record information to which the order pertains. The department shall forward the order to expunge to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The clerk of the court shall certify a copy of the order to any other agency which the records of the court reflect has received the criminal history record from the court. (c) The department or any other criminal justice agency is not required to act on an order to expunge entered by a court when such order does not comply with the requirements of this section. Upon receipt of such an order, the department must notify the issuing court, the appropriate state attorney or statewide prosecutor, the petitioner or the petitioner’s attorney, and the arresting agency of the reason for noncompliance. The appropriate state attorney or statewide prosecutor shall take action within 60 days to correct the record and petition the court to void the order.

      "text": "943.059 Court-ordered sealing of criminal history records.— (1) ELIGIBILITY.—A person is eligible to petition a court to seal a criminal history record when: (a) The criminal history record is not ineligible for court-ordered sealing under s. 943.0584. (b) The person has never, before the date the application for a certificate of eligibility is filed, been adjudicated guilty in this state of a criminal offense, or been adjudicated delinquent in this state for committing any felony or any of the following misdemeanor offenses, unless the record of such adjudication of delinquency has been expunged pursuant to s. 943.0515: 1. Assault, as defined in s. 784.011; 2. Battery, as defined in s. 784.03; 3. Assault on a law enforcement officer, a firefighter, or other specified officers, as defined in s. 784.07(2)(a); 4.

Unlawful possession or discharge of a weapon or firearm at a school-sponsored event or on school property, as defined in s. 790.115; 7.

Cruelty to animals, as defined in s. 828.12(1). (c) The person has not been adjudicated guilty of, or adjudicated delinquent for committing, any of the acts stemming from the arrest or alleged criminal activity to which the petition to seal pertains. (d) The person is no longer under court supervision applicable to the disposition of arrest or alleged criminal activity to which the petition to seal pertains. (e) The person has never secured a prior sealing or expunction of a criminal history record under this section, s. 943.0585, former s. 893.14, former s. 901.33, or former s. 943.058. (2) CERTIFICATE OF ELIGIBILITY.—Before petitioning the court to seal a criminal history record, a person seeking to seal a criminal history record must apply to the department for a certificate of eligibility for sealing. The department shall adopt rules relating to the application for and issuance of certificates of eligibility for sealing. (a) The department shall issue a certificate of eligibility for sealing to a person who is the subject of a criminal history record if that person: 1. Satisfies the eligibility criteria in paragraphs (1)(a)-(e) and is not ineligible for court-ordered sealing under s. 943.0584. 2. Has submitted to the department a certified copy of the disposition of charge to which the petition pertains. 3. Remits a $75 processing fee to the department for placement in the Department of Law Enforcement Operating Trust Fund, unless the executive director waives such fee. (b) A certificate of eligibility for sealing is valid for 12 months after the date stamped on the certificate when issued by the department. After that time, the petitioner must reapply to the department for a new certificate of eligibility. The status of the applicant and the law in effect at the time of the renewal application determine the petitioner’s eligibility. (3) PETITION.—Each petition to a court to seal a criminal history record is complete only when accompanied by: (a) A valid certificate of eligibility issued by the department pursuant to this section. (b) The petitioner’s sworn statement that the petitioner: 1. Satisfies the eligibility requirements for sealing in subsection (1). 2. Is eligible for sealing to the best of his or her knowledge and does not have any other petition to seal or expunge a criminal history record pending before any court. Any person who knowingly provides false information on such sworn statement to the court commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. (4) COURT AUTHORITY.— (a) The courts of this state have jurisdiction over their own procedures, including the maintenance, sealing, and correction of judicial records containing criminal history information to the extent that such procedures are not inconsistent with the conditions, responsibilities, and duties established by this section. (b) Any court of competent jurisdiction may order a criminal justice agency to seal the criminal history record of a minor or an adult who complies with the requirements of this section. The court may not order a criminal justice agency to seal a criminal history record until the person seeking to seal a criminal history record has applied for and received a certificate of eligibility pursuant to subsection (2). (c) The court may order the sealing of a criminal history record pertaining to one arrest or one incident of alleged criminal activity only, except the court may order the sealing of a criminal history record pertaining to more than one arrest if the additional arrests directly relate to the original arrest. If the court intends to order the sealing of records pertaining to such additional arrests, such intent must be specified in the order. A criminal justice agency may not seal any record pertaining to such additional arrests if the order to seal does not articulate the intention of the court to seal a record pertaining to more than one arrest. This section does not prevent the court from ordering the sealing of only a portion of a criminal history record pertaining to one arrest or one incident of alleged criminal activity. (d) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a criminal justice agency may comply with laws, court orders, and official requests of other jurisdictions relating to sealing, correction, or confidential handling of criminal history records or information derived therefrom. (e) This section does not confer any right to the sealing of any criminal history record, and any request for sealing of a criminal history record may be denied at the sole discretion of the court. (5) PROCESSING OF A PETITION OR ORDER.— (a) In judicial proceedings under this section, a copy of the completed petition to seal shall be served upon the appropriate state attorney or the statewide prosecutor and upon the arresting agency; however, it is not necessary to make any agency other than the state a party. The appropriate state attorney or the statewide prosecutor and the arresting agency may respond to the court regarding the completed petition to seal. (b) If relief is granted by the court, the clerk of the court shall certify copies of the order to the appropriate state attorney or the statewide prosecutor and the arresting agency. The arresting agency is responsible for forwarding the order to any other agency to which the arresting agency disseminated the criminal history record information to which the order pertains. The department shall forward the order to seal to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The clerk of the court shall certify a copy of the order to any other agency that the records of the court reflect has received the criminal history record from the court. (c) The department or any other criminal justice agency is not required to act on an order to seal entered by a court when such order does not comply with the requirements of this section. Upon receipt of such an order, the department must notify the issuing court, the appropriate state attorney or statewide prosecutor, the petitioner or the petitioner’s attorney, and the arresting agency of the reason for noncompliance. The appropriate state attorney or statewide prosecutor shall take action within 60 days to correct the record and petition the court to void the order. No cause of action, including contempt of court, shall arise against any criminal justice agency for failure to comply with an order to seal when the petitioner for such order failed to obtain the certificate of eligibility as required by this section or such order does not otherwise comply with the requirements of this section. (6) EFFECT OF ORDER.— (a) A criminal history record of a minor or an adult which is ordered sealed by a court pursuant to this section is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution and is available only to the following persons: 1. The subject of the record; 2. The subject’s attorney; 3.

(c) Subject to the exceptions in paragraph (b), a person who has been granted a sealing under this section, former s. 893.14, former s. 901.33, or former s. 943.058 may not be held under any provision of law of this state to commit perjury or to be otherwise liable for giving a false statement by reason of such person’s failure to recite or acknowledge a sealed criminal history record. (d) Information relating to the existence of a sealed criminal history record provided in accordance with paragraph (b) is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art.

      "text": "943.082 School Safety Awareness Program.— (1) In collaboration with the Department of Legal Affairs, the department shall competitively procure a mobile suspicious activity reporting tool that allows students and the community to relay information anonymously concerning unsafe, potentially harmful, dangerous, violent, or criminal activities, or the threat of these activities, to appropriate public safety agencies and school officials. As recommended by students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the program shall be named “FortifyFL.” At a minimum, the department must receive reports electronically through the mobile suspicious activity reporting tool that is available on both Android and Apple devices. (2) The reporting tool must notify the reporting party of the following information: (a) That the reporting party may provide his or her report anonymously. (b) That if the reporting party chooses to disclose his or her identity, that information shall be shared with the appropriate law enforcement agency and school officials; however, the law enforcement agency and school officials shall be required to maintain the information as confidential. (c) That if, following an investigation, it is determined that a person knowingly submitted a false tip through FortifyFL, the Internet protocol (IP) address of the device on which the tip was submitted will be provided to law enforcement agencies for further investigation and the reporting party may be subject to criminal penalties under s. 837.05. In all other circumstances, unless the reporting party has chosen to disclose his or her identity, the report will remain anonymous. (3) Information reported using the tool must be promptly forwarded to the appropriate law enforcement agency or school official. (4)(a) Law enforcement dispatch centers, school districts, schools, and other entities identified by the department must be made aware of the mobile suspicious activity reporting tool. (b) The district school board shall promote the use of the mobile suspicious activity reporting tool by advertising it on the school district website, in newsletters, on school campuses, and in school publications, by installing it on all mobile devices issued to students, and by bookmarking the website on all computer devices issued to students. Within the first 5 days of each school year, each district school board and charter school governing board must ensure that instruction on the use of the mobile suspicious activity reporting tool known as FortifyFL is provided to students. The instruction must be age and developmentally appropriate and include the consequences for making a threat or false report as described in ss. 790.162 and 790.163, respectively, involving school or school personnel’s property, school transportation, or a school-sponsored activity. (5) The department, in collaboration with the Division of Victim Services within the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of Safe Schools within the Department of Education, shall develop and provide a comprehensive training and awareness program on the use of the mobile suspicious activity reporting tool. (6) The identity of the reporting party received through the mobile suspicious activity reporting tool and held by the department, the Department of Education, law enforcement agencies, or school officials is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. Any other information received through the mobile suspicious activity reporting tool and held by the department, the Department of Education, law enforcement agencies, or school officials is exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. These exemptions apply to any such records held by these agencies before, on, or after the effective date of this act. This subsection is subject to the Open Government Sunset Review Act in accordance with s. 119.15 and shall stand repealed on October 2, 2028, unless reviewed and saved from repeal through reenactment by the Legislature.

(2)(a) When a law enforcement officer, correctional officer, or correctional probation officer, or an agent thereof, is conducting a background investigation of an applicant for temporary or permanent employment or appointment as a full-time, part-time, or auxiliary law enforcement officer, correctional officer, or correctional probation officer with an employing agency, the applicant’s current or former employer, or the employer’s agent, shall provide to the officer or his or her agent conducting the background investigation employment information concerning the applicant. The investigating officer or his or her agent must present to the employer from whom the information is being sought credentials demonstrating the investigating officer’s employment with the employing agency and an authorization form for release of information which is designed and approved by the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission. (b) The authorization form for release of information must: 1. Be either the original authorization or a copy or facsimile of the original authorization; 2. Have been executed by the applicant no more than 1 year before the request; 3. Contain a statement that the authorization has been specifically furnished to the employing agency presenting the authorization; and 4. Bear the authorized signature of the applicant. (3) Each employing agency shall maintain employment information for a minimum of 5 years after the date of the officer’s termination, resignation, or retirement from the employing agency, unless the employing agency is otherwise required to retain such information for a longer time period. (4) If an employer refuses to disclose information to an employing agency in accordance with this section, the employing agency has grounds for a civil action for injunctive relief requiring disclosure by the employer. (5) An employer who discloses employment information under this section is immune from civil liability for such disclosure or its consequences as provided in s. 768.095. (6) An employer may charge a reasonable fee to cover the actual costs incurred by the employer in copying and furnishing documents to an employing agency as required by this section.

      "text": "943.135 Requirements for continued employment.— (1) The commission shall, by rule, adopt a program that requires all officers, as a condition of continued employment or appointment as officers, to receive periodic commission-approved continuing training or education. Such continuing training or education shall be required at the rate of 40 hours every 4 years. No officer shall be denied a reasonable opportunity by the employing agency to comply with this section. The employing agency must document that the continuing training or education is job-related and consistent with the needs of the employing agency. The employing agency must maintain and submit, or electronically transmit, the documentation to the commission, in a format approved by the commission. The rule shall also provide: (a) Assistance to an employing agency in identifying each affected officer, the date of his or her employment or appointment, and his or her most recent date for successful completion of continuing training or education; and (b) A procedure for reactivation of the certification of an officer who is not in compliance with this section. (2) Continuing training or education required under this section may not be used to qualify an officer for salary incentive payments provided under s. 943.22. (3) For the purposes of this section, the employing agency is responsible for notifying the commission of any omission of any approved training not included in the records of the commission. (4)(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person holding active certification from the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission as a law enforcement officer, correctional officer, or correctional probation officer, as defined in s. 943.10(1), (2), (3), (6), (7), (8), or (9), who resigns his or her position as law enforcement officer, correctional officer, or correctional probation officer for the sole purpose of serving in an office to which the person has been elected or appointed and to thereby avoid the prohibition against dual officeholding established in s. 5(a), Art. II of the State Constitution may be allowed to retain active certification in a special status during the tenure of the elected or appointed office if, at the time of resignation, the person: 1. Was employed by or associated with an employing agency in a manner authorized by this chapter; 2. Was not subject to an internal investigation or employment action to discipline or dismiss by the employing agency; 3. Was not subject to criminal investigation or prosecution by any state or federal authority; and 4. Was not subject to an investigation or action against his or her certification by the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission, and that subsequent to the resignation the person otherwise complies with this subsection. (b) Any person who qualifies under paragraph (a) may, for purposes of meeting the minimum mandatory continuing training or education requirements of this section, at the option of an employing agency, associate with that agency for the sole purpose of securing continuing training or education as required by this section and for allowing the agency to report completion of the education or training to the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission. The employing agency with which the person has associated shall submit proof of completion of any education or training so obtained for purposes of demonstrating compliance with this section and shall indicate that the person for whom the credits are reported has secured the training under the special status authorized by this section. An employing agency may require any person so associated to attend continuing training or education at the person’s own expense and may determine the courses or training that a person is to attend while associated with the agency. Any person who is permitted to associate with an employing agency for purposes of obtaining and reporting education or continuing training credits while serving in an elected or appointed public office shall not be considered to be employed by the employing agency or considered by the association with the employing agency to maintain an office under s. 5(a), Art. II of the State Constitution. (c) The period of time a person serves in an elected or appointed office and thereby maintains the special certification status authorized by this section may not be considered in calculating whether the person is considered to have incurred a break in service for purposes of maintaining active certification by the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission. (d) An employing agency that receives a resignation from a person for the purpose of avoiding the dual officeholding prohibition as discussed in this subsection shall verify that the person who has resigned is in fact serving in an elected or public office and report the verification, including an indication of the office in which the person is serving to the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission via the affidavit of separation of employment used by the commission. (e) Any person seeking the benefit of this subsection shall, upon request, provide to the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission any documentation or proof required by the commission to evaluate the person’s eligibility under this subsection, to evaluate a submission of continuing training or education credits as authorized by this subsection, or to determine the duration of any tenure in an elected or appointed public office, including any extension of the status by reason of reelection or reappointment or by election or appointment to a different office.

      "text": "943.325 DNA database.— (1) LEGISLATIVE INTENT.— (a) The Legislature finds that DNA databases are important tools in criminal investigations, in the exclusion of individuals who are the subject of criminal investigations or prosecutions and in detecting recidivist acts. It is the policy of this state to assist federal, state, and local criminal justice and law enforcement agencies in the identification and detection of individuals in criminal investigations and the identification and location of missing and unidentified persons. Therefore, it is in the best interests of the citizens of this state to establish a statewide DNA database containing DNA samples submitted by persons convicted of or arrested for felony offenses and convicted of certain misdemeanor offenses. Additionally, the statewide DNA database shall include DNA records and samples necessary for the identification of missing persons and unidentified human remains, including DNA samples voluntarily contributed by relatives of missing persons. (b) The Legislature also finds that upon establishment of the Florida DNA database, a match between casework evidence DNA samples from a criminal investigation and DNA samples from a state or federal DNA database of certain offenders may be used to find probable cause for the issuance of a warrant for arrest or to obtain the DNA sample from an offender. (2) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the term: (a) “Arrested” means apprehended or physically taken into custody, resulting in the submission of arrest fingerprints to the department, pursuant to s. 943.051. (b) “CODIS” means the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Combined DNA Index System that allows the storage and exchange of DNA records submitted by federal, state, and local forensic DNA laboratories. (c) “Convicted” means a finding of guilt by a court of competent jurisdiction, or entry of a plea of nolo contendere or guilty, or, in the case of a juvenile, the finding of delinquency, regardless of adjudication. (d) “DNA” means deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA is located in the cells and provides an individual’s personal genetic blueprint. DNA encodes genetic information that is the basis of human heredity and forensic identification. (e) “DNA record” means all information associated with the collection and analysis of a person’s DNA sample, including the distinguishing characteristics collectively referred to as a DNA profile. (f) “DNA sample” means a buccal or other approved biological specimen capable of undergoing DNA analysis. (g) “Qualifying offender” means any person, including juveniles and adults, who is: 1.a. Committed to a county jail; b. Committed to or under the supervision of the Department of Corrections, including persons incarcerated in a contractor-operated correctional institution operated under contract pursuant to s. 944.105; c. Committed to or under the supervision of the Department of Juvenile Justice; d. Transferred to this state under the Interstate Compact on Juveniles, part XIII of chapter 985; or e. Accepted under Article IV of the Interstate Corrections Compact, part III of chapter 941; and who is: 2.a. Convicted of any felony offense or attempted felony offense in this state or of a similar offense in another jurisdiction; b. Convicted of a misdemeanor violation of s. 784.048, s. 810.14, s. 847.011, s. 847.013, s. 847.0135, or s. 877.26, or an offense that was found, pursuant to s. 874.04, to have been committed for the purpose of benefiting, promoting, or furthering the interests of a criminal gang as defined in s. 874.03; c. Arrested for any felony offense or attempted felony offense in this state; or d. In the custody of a law enforcement agency and is subject to an immigration detainer issued by a federal immigration agency. (3) COLLECTION OF SAMPLES.— (a) Each qualifying offender shall submit a DNA sample at the time he or she is booked into a jail, correctional facility, or juvenile facility. A person who becomes a qualifying offender solely because of the issuance of an immigration detainer by a federal immigration agency must submit a DNA sample when the law enforcement agency having custody of the offender receives the detainer. (b) DNA samples collected under paragraph (a) from persons arrested for any felony offense or attempted felony offense in this state are subject to sufficient funding appropriations passed by the Legislature and approved by the Governor according to the following schedule: 1. Beginning January 1, 2011, all felonies defined by chapters 782, 784, 794, and 800. 2. Beginning January 1, 2013, all felonies defined by chapters 810 and 812. 3. Beginning January 1, 2015, all felonies defined by chapters 787 and 790. 4. Beginning January 1, 2017, all felonies defined by chapter 893. 5. Beginning January 1, 2019, all remaining felony offenses. The department may reject DNA samples submitted pursuant to this subsection if submitted before the funding of any phase or if received before the department issues an official notification to the submitting agency that the department is sufficiently prepared to receive the samples. (c) On or before February 1, 2010, and by February 1 of each even-numbered year thereafter through 2018, the department shall submit a report to the Legislature listing the funding, infrastructure, facility, and personnel requirements necessary to operate the DNA database and DNA evidentiary analysis for the expansion phase scheduled for the following year. (4) STATEWIDE DNA DATABASE.—The department, through the statewide criminal laboratory analysis system shall establish, implement, and maintain a statewide automated personal identification system capable of, but not limited to, classifying, matching, and storing analyses of DNA and other biological molecules and related data. The department shall be the administrator of the statewide DNA database. All accredited local government crime laboratories within the state shall have access through CODIS to the statewide DNA database in accordance with the rules and agreements established by the department.

(d) Participate in the national DNA database program administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. (e) Provide for liaison with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other criminal justice agencies relating to the state’s participation in the CODIS program and the national DNA index system. (f) Adopt rules specifying the proper procedure, including requisite identification information, for state and local law enforcement and correctional agencies to collect and submit DNA samples pursuant to this section. (6) SAMPLES.—The statewide DNA database may contain DNA data obtained from the following types of biological samples: (a) Crime scene samples. (b) Samples obtained from qualifying offenders required by this section to provide a biological sample for DNA analysis and inclusion in the statewide DNA database. (c) Samples lawfully obtained during the course of a criminal investigation. (d) Samples from deceased victims or suspects that were lawfully obtained during the course of a criminal investigation. (e) Samples from unidentified human remains. (f) Samples from persons reported missing. (g) Samples voluntarily contributed by relatives of missing persons. (h) Other samples approved by the department. (7) COLLECTION OF DNA SAMPLES FROM OFFENDERS.— (a) Any qualifying offender, who is: 1. Arrested in this state; 2. Incarcerated in this state; or 3. On probation, community control, parole, conditional release, control release, or any other type of court-ordered supervision in this state, shall be required to submit a DNA sample to a department-designated facility. (b) Arrested qualifying offenders must submit a DNA sample at the time they are booked into a jail, correctional facility, or juvenile facility. (c) Incarcerated persons and those in the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice must submit required DNA samples not less than 45 days before their presumptive date of release from such incarceration or commitment. (d) Upon the conviction of any qualifying offender which results in the commitment of the offender to a county jail, correctional facility, or juvenile facility, the entity responsible for the jail or facility shall ensure that a DNA sample is promptly secured and transmitted to the department. Personnel at the jail, correctional facility, or juvenile facility shall collect the DNA samples as part of the regular processing of qualifying offenders committed to the jail or facility. (e) If a qualifying offender is not incarcerated following conviction, that offender may not be released from the custody of the court at the time of sentencing or released pursuant to a bond or surety until the DNA sample required by this section has been taken by the sheriff or his or her designee. The sheriff shall secure, process, and transmit the DNA sample to the department in a timely manner. (f) A law enforcement agency having custody of a person who becomes a qualifying offender solely because of the issuance of an immigration detainer by a federal immigration agency shall ensure that a DNA sample is taken from the offender immediately after the agency receives the detainer and shall secure and transmit the sample to the department in a timely manner. (8) REASONABLE FORCE.—Duly authorized law enforcement and corrections personnel may employ reasonable force in cases where a qualifying offender refuses to provide a DNA sample required under this section, and no such employee shall be civilly or criminally liable for the use of such reasonable force. (9) OUT-OF-STATE OFFENDERS.—Any qualifying offender who is: (a) Transferred to this state under the Interstate Compact on Juveniles, part XIII of chapter 985, for a felony offense or attempted felony offense; or (b) Accepted under Article IV of the Interstate Corrections Compact, part III of chapter 941, for a felony offense or attempted felony offense, shall provide a DNA sample pursuant to this section to the entity responsible for supervision of the offender, who shall ensure that the DNA sample is collected in a manner approved by the department and promptly secured and transmitted to the department. (10) COLLECTION; LIABILITY.— (a) The collection of DNA samples may be performed by any person using a collection kit approved by the department as directed in the kit or pursuant to other procedures approved by or acceptable to the department. (b) Any person who collects or assists in the collection of a DNA sample is not civilly or criminally liable if a collection kit provided or approved by the department is used and the collection is done as directed in the kit, in a manner approved by the department, or is performed in an otherwise reasonable manner. (11) SAMPLES.—The department will provide the DNA sample collection kits, labels, or other appropriate containers and instructions for the collection of the DNA samples. After collection, the DNA samples shall be forwarded to the department for analysis to determine genetic markers and characteristics for the purpose of individual identification of the person submitting the sample. (a) At minimum, the following information must be included with each submission: 1. The qualifying offender’s last name, first name, date of birth, race, gender, and State Identification (SID) number if known. 2. The statute number of each offense charged. 3. The collecting agency’s name and address. 4. The name and telephone number of the person performing the collection of the DNA sample or witnessing the collection of the sample. (b) If a DNA sample submitted to the department under this section cannot be used by the department in the manner and for the purposes required by this section, the department may require that another DNA sample be obtained. (12) COURT ORDERS; COSTS.—The sentencing court shall include in the judgment order for a qualifying offender a provision requiring collection of a DNA sample from the defendant in a manner consistent with this section. (a) Unless a convicted person has been declared indigent by the court, the convicted person shall pay the actual costs of collecting the approved biological specimens required under this section. (b) If the order of a sentencing court fails to order a qualifying offender to submit a DNA sample as mandated by this section, the prosecutor may seek an amended order from the sentencing court requiring submission of a DNA sample in compliance with this section. In the alternative, the department, the Department of Corrections, a law enforcement agency, or a prosecutor may apply to the appropriate circuit court with jurisdiction for an order authorizing the seizure of the qualifying offender for the purpose of securing the required DNA sample. 1. The court shall issue the order upon a showing of probable cause. 2. Following issuance of the order, the DNA sample shall be collected in a reasonable manner and the qualifying offender shall be released unless there is cause to justify retaining the offender in custody. (c) Failure by a law enforcement agency or other entity involved in collection of DNA samples under this section to strictly comply with this section or to abide by a statewide protocol for collecting DNA samples is not grounds for challenging the validity of the collection or the use of a DNA sample in court and evidence based upon or derived from the collected DNA sample may not be excluded by a court. (d) The detention, arrest, or conviction of a person based upon a database match or database information may not be invalidated if it is later determined that the sample was obtained or placed in the database by mistake. (e) All DNA samples submitted to the department for any reason shall be retained in the statewide DNA database and may be used for all lawful purposes as provided in this section. (13) ANALYSIS OF DNA SAMPLES.— (a) The department shall specify procedures for the collection, submission, identification, analysis, storage, and disposition of the DNA samples and DNA records collected under this section. These procedures shall also ensure compliance with national quality assurance standards so that the DNA records may be accepted into the national DNA database. (b) The analyses of DNA samples collected under this section shall be used only for law enforcement identification purposes or to assist in the recovery or identification of human remains or missing persons and may not be used for identification of any medical or genetic condition. (c) When completed, the results of DNA analysis shall be entered into the statewide DNA database maintained and administered by the department for such purpose, as provided in this section. (14) RESULTS.—The results of a DNA analysis and the comparison of analytic results shall be released only to criminal justice agencies as defined in s. 943.045 at the request of the agency. Otherwise, such information is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. (15) OFFENSES AND PENALTIES.— (a) Any person subject to the requirements of this section who willfully refuses to provide a DNA sample commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (b) Any person who: 1. Knowingly or intentionally discloses a DNA record, including the results of a DNA analysis, to a person or agency other than one authorized to have access to such records under this section; 2. Knowingly or intentionally uses or receives DNA records, including the results of DNA analysis, for purposes other than those authorized under this section; or 3. Knowingly or intentionally tampers or attempts to tamper with any DNA sample, the result of any analysis of a DNA sample, or a DNA sample collection container, commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (16) PROCEDURES FOR REMOVAL.—Unless the department determines that a person is otherwise required by law to submit a DNA sample for inclusion in the statewide DNA database, the department shall, upon receipt and completion of such verification of the information noted below as may be required, promptly remove from the statewide DNA database the DNA analysis and any DNA biological samples that may have been retained of a person included therein: (a) On the basis of a conviction for a qualifying offense specified in subparagraph (2)(g)2., if the department receives, from the person seeking removal of DNA information from the statewide DNA database, for each qualifying offense, a certified copy of a final court order establishing that such conviction has been overturned on direct appeal or set aside in a postconviction proceeding; or (b) On the basis of an arrest, if the department receives from the person seeking removal of DNA information from the statewide DNA database, for each charge against the person on the basis of which the analysis was or could have been included in the statewide DNA database, a certified copy of the No Information or Nolle Prosequi filed by the state attorney, or final court order or other official documentation establishing that such charge has been dismissed or has resulted in an acquittal or that no charge was filed within the applicable time period. For purposes of this section, a court order is not final if time remains for an appeal or application for discretionary review with respect to the order, or if a case has been remanded for retrial or other proceedings and has not been resolved after remand, or time remains for appeal or discretionary review of the remanded case or any other such proceedings that have not concluded and rendered the case resolved with finality. (17) RULES.—The department shall, by rule, establish the procedure by which a person seeking removal of his or her DNA analysis and biological sample from the statewide DNA database shall submit the certified information required in subsection (16) to the department.

      "text": "943.61 Powers and duties of the Capitol Police.— (1) There is created the Capitol Police within the Department of Law Enforcement, to serve the safety and security needs of both the legislative and executive branches of state government. It is the intent of the Legislature that the Capitol Police serve as a specially trained and highly effective security and law enforcement agency serving the Capitol Complex and the state. It shall be the primary responsibility of the Capitol Police to protect the security of the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the members of the Cabinet, and the members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, and those employees assigned to assist such state officials in the performance of their official duties, and to ensure their access to buildings and premises within the Capitol Complex, thereby providing for the continuous operation of the government of the State of Florida. (2) The Capitol Police shall also provide security and protection for other state officials, employees, and visitors to the Capitol Complex and shall maintain a reasonable degree of safety and security within the Capitol Complex while ensuring reasonable access to buildings and premises within the Capitol Complex by state officials, employees, and visitors. The Capitol Police shall also ensure that adequate signs and personnel are in place to inform and assist the occupants of and visitors to buildings within the Capitol Complex. (3) Nothing herein limits the ability of the Capitol Police to provide mutual aid to other law enforcement agencies as authorized by law unless such a limitation is expressly included in the operational security plans provided for herein. (4) The Capitol Police shall have the following responsibilities, powers, and duties: (a) To develop, in consultation with the Governor, Cabinet officers, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, written operational plans for basic and enhanced security measures and actions related to the Capitol Complex. Such plans and any changes or amendments thereto shall not be implemented unless presented in writing in final form to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives and all three grant their approval in writing. The approval of any officer required herein shall expire 60 days after such officer vacates his or her office, and the written approval of the successor in office must be obtained prior to the continuation of operations under such plans. Upon the request of the Governor, a Cabinet officer, the President of the Senate, or the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Capitol Police shall activate previously approved enhanced security measures and actions in accordance with the approved operational plans specific to the requesting officer’s responsibilities and to the facilities occupied by such officer and employees responsible to such officer. Upon an emergency threatening the immediate safety and security of occupants of the Capitol Complex, so declared by the Governor, plans not approved as required by this paragraph may be implemented for a period not to exceed 15 days, provided such plans do not substantially interfere with the ability of the Senate and the House of Representatives to assemble for any constitutional purpose. (b) To provide and maintain the security of all property located in the Capitol Complex in a manner consistent with the security plans developed and approved under paragraph (a) and, in consultation with the State Fire Marshal, to provide for evacuations, information, and training required for firesafety on such property in a manner consistent with s. 633.218. (c) To develop plans for reporting incidents involving buildings and property within the Capitol Complex, emergency procedures and evacuation routes in the event of fire, security threats, incidents prompting a need for evacuation, acts of terrorism, or natural or manmade disaster and to make such procedures and routes known to those persons occupying such buildings. (d) To employ officers who hold certification as law enforcement officers in accordance with the minimum standards and qualifications as set forth in s. 943.13 and the provisions of chapter 110, and who have the authority to bear arms, make arrests, except as may be limited in the security plans established under paragraph (a), and apply for arrest warrants. (e) To hire guards and administrative, clerical, technical, and other personnel as may be required. (f) To train all officers and other employees in fire prevention, firesafety, emergency medical procedures, and preventing and responding to acts of terrorism. (g) To respond to all complaints relating to criminal activity or security threats within the Capitol Complex, or against the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, a member of the Cabinet, a member of the Senate or of the House of Representatives, or an employee assisting such official. (h) As provided by the security plans developed and approved under paragraph (a), upon request of the presiding officer of either house of the Legislature, the director may assign one or more officers for the protection of a member of the house served by such presiding officer. Per diem and subsistence allowance for department employees traveling with a member of the Legislature away from Tallahassee shall be computed by payment of a sum up to the amounts permitted in s. 112.061 for meals, plus actual expenses for lodging to be substantiated by paid bills therefor. (i) To enforce rules of the Department of Management Services governing the regulation of traffic and parking within the Capitol Complex and to impound illegally or wrongfully parked vehicles. (j) To establish policies for the organizational structure, principles of command, and internal operations of the Capitol Police, provided that such policies are not inconsistent with the provisions of ss. 943.61-943.68 or the security plans developed and approved under paragraph (a). (k) To carry out the transportation and protective services functions described in s. 943.68. (5) Officers of the Capitol Police may make lawful arrests, consistent with the purposes, responsibilities, and limitations set forth in ss. 943.60-943.68. However, except with the prior approval of the appropriate presiding officer, officers of the Capitol Police shall have no power to prevent the convening or continuation of any meeting of the Legislature, legislative committees, or staff, nor shall they have the power to interfere with the legislative duties or rights of a member of the Legislature, or to interfere with the constitutional duties or rights of the Governor or a member of the Cabinet, except as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of any person from a clear and present danger, or as may be otherwise provided in the security plans developed and approved for fire prevention, firesafety, and emergency medical procedures under paragraph (4)(a). No employee of the Capitol Police shall be permitted in either legislative chamber without the specific permission of the presiding officer of that house of the Legislature, but may enter in the case of an emergency when the presiding officer is not able or available to consent.

      "text": "943.69 Care for Retired Police Dogs Program.— (1) LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.—The Legislature finds that: (a) Police dogs are an integral part of many law enforcement and correctional efforts statewide, including the apprehension of suspects through tracking and searching, evidence location, drug and bomb detection, and search and rescue operations. (b) Law enforcement and correctional agencies agree that the use of police dogs is an extremely cost-effective means of crime control and that police dogs possess skills and abilities that frequently exceed those of existing technology. (c) The service of police dogs is often dangerous and can expose them to injury at a rate higher than that of nonservice dogs. (d) Police dogs provide significant contributions to the residents of this state. (2) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the term: (a) “Correctional agency” means a lawfully established state or local public agency having primary responsibility for the supervision, protection, care, custody, control, or investigation of inmates at a correctional institution.

These funds must be disbursed to the former handler or the adopter of a retired police dog that served for 5 years or more as a police dog upon receipt of: 1. Valid documentation from the law enforcement agency or correctional agency from which the dog retired which verifies that the dog was in the service of or employed by that agency; and a. That the dog served 5 years or more with that agency; b. Documentation showing that the dog served a total of 5 years or more with two or more law enforcement agencies or correctional agencies; or c. That, notwithstanding the length of service requirements elsewhere in this paragraph, the dog served 3 years or more with one or more law enforcement agencies or correctional agencies, was injured in the line of duty while serving with a law enforcement agency or correctional agency, and retired from the agency the dog was serving with at the time of the injury due to such injury; and 2. A valid invoice from a veterinarian for veterinary care provided in this state to a retired police dog and documentation establishing payment of the invoice by the former handler or the adopter of the retired police dog. (b) Annual disbursements to a former handler or an adopter to reimburse him or her for the cost of the retired police dog’s veterinary care may not exceed $5,000 per dog. A former handler or an adopter of a retired police dog may not accumulate unused funds from a current year for use in a future year. (c) A former handler or an adopter of a retired police dog who seeks reimbursement for veterinary care may not receive reimbursement if funds appropriated for the Care for Retired Police Dogs Program are depleted in the year for which the reimbursement is sought.
