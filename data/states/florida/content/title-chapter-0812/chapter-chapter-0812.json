      "text": "812.014 Theft.— (1) A person commits theft if he or she knowingly obtains or uses, or endeavors to obtain or to use, the property of another with intent to, either temporarily or permanently: (a) Deprive the other person of a right to the property or a benefit from the property. (b) Appropriate the property to his or her own use or to the use of any person not entitled to the use of the property. (2)(a)1. If the property stolen is valued at $100,000 or more or is a semitrailer that was deployed by a law enforcement officer; or 2. If the property stolen is cargo valued at $50,000 or more that has entered the stream of interstate or intrastate commerce from the shipper’s loading platform to the consignee’s receiving dock; or 3. If the offender commits any grand theft and: a. In the course of committing the offense the offender uses a motor vehicle as an instrumentality, other than merely as a getaway vehicle, to assist in committing the offense and thereby damages the real property of another; or b. In the course of committing the offense the offender causes damage to the real or personal property of another in excess of $1,000, the offender commits grand theft in the first degree, punishable as a felony of the first degree, as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. (b)1. If the property stolen is valued at $20,000 or more, but less than $100,000; 2. If the property stolen is cargo valued at less than $50,000 that has entered the stream of interstate or intrastate commerce from the shipper’s loading platform to the consignee’s receiving dock; 3. If the property stolen is emergency medical equipment, valued at $300 or more, that is taken from a facility licensed under chapter 395 or from an aircraft or vehicle permitted under chapter 401; or 4. If the property stolen is law enforcement equipment, valued at $300 or more, that is taken from an authorized emergency vehicle, as defined in s. 316.003, the offender commits grand theft in the second degree, punishable as a felony of the second degree, as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. Emergency medical equipment means mechanical or electronic apparatus used to provide emergency services and care as defined in s. 395.002(9) or to treat medical emergencies. Law enforcement equipment means any property, device, or apparatus used by any law enforcement officer as defined in s. 943.10 in the officer’s official business. However, if the property is stolen during a riot or an aggravated riot prohibited under s. 870.01 and the perpetration of the theft is facilitated by conditions arising from the riot; or within a county that is subject to a state of emergency declared by the Governor under chapter 252, the theft is committed after the declaration of emergency is made, and the perpetration of the theft is facilitated by conditions arising from the emergency, the theft is a felony of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. As used in this paragraph, the term “conditions arising from the riot” means civil unrest, power outages, curfews, or a reduction in the presence of or response time for first responders or homeland security personnel and the term “conditions arising from the emergency” means civil unrest, power outages, curfews, voluntary or mandatory evacuations, or a reduction in the presence of or response time for first responders or homeland security personnel. A person arrested for committing a theft during a riot or an aggravated riot or within a county that is subject to a state of emergency may not be released until the person appears before a committing magistrate at a first appearance hearing. For purposes of sentencing under chapter 921, a felony offense that is reclassified under this paragraph is ranked one level above the ranking under s. 921.0022 or s. 921.0023 of the offense committed. (c) It is grand theft of the third degree and a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if the property stolen is: 1. Valued at $750 or more, but less than $5,000. 2. Valued at $5,000 or more, but less than $10,000. 3. Valued at $10,000 or more, but less than $20,000. 4. A will, codicil, or other testamentary instrument. 5. A firearm, except as provided in paragraph (g). 6. A motor vehicle, except as provided in paragraph (a). 7. Any commercially farmed animal, including any animal of the equine, avian, bovine, or swine class or other grazing animal; a bee colony of a registered beekeeper; and aquaculture species raised at a certified aquaculture facility. If the property stolen is a commercially farmed animal, including an animal of the equine, avian, bovine, or swine class or other grazing animal; a bee colony of a registered beekeeper; or an aquaculture species raised at a certified aquaculture facility, a $10,000 fine shall be imposed. 8. Any fire extinguisher that, at the time of the taking, was installed in any building for the purpose of fire prevention and control. This subparagraph does not apply to a fire extinguisher taken from the inventory at a point-of-sale business. 9. Any amount of citrus fruit consisting of 2,000 or more individual pieces of fruit. 10. Taken from a designated construction site identified by the posting of a sign as provided for in s. 810.09(2)(c). 11. Any stop sign. 12. Anhydrous ammonia. 13. Any amount of a controlled substance as defined in s. 893.02. Notwithstanding any other law, separate judgments and sentences for theft of a controlled substance under this subparagraph and for any applicable possession of controlled substance offense under s. 893.13 or trafficking in controlled substance offense under s. 893.135 may be imposed when all such offenses involve the same amount or amounts of a controlled substance. However, if the property is stolen during a riot or an aggravated riot prohibited under s. 870.01 and the perpetration of the theft is facilitated by conditions arising from the riot; or within a county that is subject to a state of emergency declared by the Governor under chapter 252, the property is stolen after the declaration of emergency is made, and the perpetration of the theft is facilitated by conditions arising from the emergency, the offender commits a felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if the property is valued at $5,000 or more, but less than $10,000, as provided under subparagraph 2., or if the property is valued at $10,000 or more, but less than $20,000, as provided under subparagraph 3. As used in this paragraph, the terms “conditions arising from a riot” and “conditions arising from the emergency” have the same meanings as provided in paragraph (b). A person arrested for committing a theft during a riot or an aggravated riot or within a county that is subject to a state of emergency may not be released until the person appears before a committing magistrate at a first appearance hearing. For purposes of sentencing under chapter 921, a felony offense that is reclassified under this paragraph is ranked one level above the ranking under s. 921.0022 or s. 921.0023 of the offense committed.

An electronic record that contains the judge’s electronic signature as defined in s. 933.40 and is recorded by the clerk of the circuit court. 2. A judge shall cause the fingerprints of a defendant who is found guilty of petit theft to be manually taken or electronically captured. Such fingerprints must be certified and filed in the case in which the judgment of guilty is entered as provided in s. 921.241(3). 3.

(2) Except as provided in subsection (5), proof of possession of property recently stolen, unless satisfactorily explained, gives rise to an inference that the person in possession of the property knew or should have known that the property had been stolen. (3) Proof of the purchase or sale of stolen property at a price substantially below the fair market value, unless satisfactorily explained, gives rise to an inference that the person buying or selling the property knew or should have known that the property had been stolen. (4) Proof of the purchase or sale of stolen property by a dealer in property, out of the regular course of business or without the usual indicia of ownership other than mere possession, unless satisfactorily explained, gives rise to an inference that the person buying or selling the property knew or should have known that it had been stolen. (5) Proof that a dealer who regularly deals in used property possesses stolen property upon which a name and phone number of a person other than the offeror of the property are conspicuously displayed gives rise to an inference that the dealer possessing the property knew or should have known that the property was stolen. (a) If the name and phone number are for a business that rents property, the dealer avoids the inference by contacting such business, prior to accepting the property, to verify that the property was not stolen from such business. If the name and phone number are not for a business that rents property, the dealer avoids the inference by contacting the local law enforcement agency in the jurisdiction where the dealer is located, prior to accepting the property, to verify that the property has not been reported stolen. An accurate written record, which contains the number called, the date and time of such call, and the name and place of employment of the person who verified that the property was not stolen, is sufficient evidence to avoid the inference pursuant to this subsection. (b) This subsection does not apply to: 1. Persons, entities, or transactions exempt from chapter 538. 2. Used sports equipment that does not contain a serial number, printed or recorded materials, computer software, or videos or video games. 3. A dealer who implements, in a continuous and consistent manner, a program for identification and return of stolen property that meets the following criteria: a. When a dealer is offered property for pawn or purchase that contains conspicuous identifying information that includes a name and phone number, or a dealer is offered property for pawn or purchase that contains ownership information that is affixed to the property pursuant to a written agreement with a business entity or group of associated business entities, the dealer will promptly contact the individual or company whose name is affixed to the property by phone to confirm that the property has not been stolen. If the individual or business contacted indicates that the property has been stolen, the dealer shall not accept the property. b. If the dealer is unable to verify whether the property is stolen from the individual or business, and if the dealer accepts the property that is later determined to have been stolen, the dealer will voluntarily return the property at no cost and without the necessity of a replevin action, if the property owner files the appropriate theft reports with law enforcement and enters into an agreement with the dealer to actively participate in the prosecution of the person or persons who perpetrated the crime. c. If a dealer is required by law to complete and submit a transaction form to law enforcement, the dealer shall include all conspicuously displayed ownership information on the transaction form. (6) Proof that a person was in possession of a stolen motor vehicle and that the ignition mechanism of the motor vehicle had been bypassed or the steering wheel locking mechanism had been broken or bypassed, unless satisfactorily explained, gives rise to an inference that the person in possession of the stolen motor vehicle knew or should have known that the motor vehicle had been stolen.

(9) A violation of paragraph (2)(a) may be deemed to have been committed at any place where the defendant manufactures, develops, or assembles any communications devices involved in the violation, or assists others in these acts, or any place where the communications device is sold or delivered to a purchaser or recipient. It is not a defense to a violation of paragraph (2)(a) that some of the acts constituting the violation occurred outside the state. (10)(a) Any person aggrieved by any violation of this section may bring a civil action in a circuit court or in any other court of competent jurisdiction. (b) The court may: 1. Grant temporary and final injunctions on terms it finds reasonable to prevent or restrain violations of this section in conformity with the principles that govern the granting of injunctive relief from threatened loss or damage in other civil cases, except that a showing of special or irreparable damages to the person need not be made. 2. At any time while the action is pending, order the impounding, on reasonable terms, of any communications device that is in the custody or control of the violator and that the court has reasonable cause to believe was involved in the alleged violation of this section, and may grant other equitable relief, including the imposition of a constructive trust, as the court considers reasonable and necessary. 3. Award damages pursuant to paragraphs (c), (d), and (e). 4. Direct the recovery of full costs, including awarding reasonable attorney’s fees, to an aggrieved party who prevails. 5. As part of a final judgment or decree finding a violation of this section, order the remedial modification or destruction of any communications device, or any other device or equipment, involved in the violation which is in the custody or control of the violator or has been impounded under subparagraph 2. (c) Damages awarded by any court under this section shall be computed in accordance with subparagraph 1. or subparagraph 2.: 1. The party aggrieved may recover the actual damages suffered by him or her as a result of the violation and any profits of the violator that are attributable to the violation which are not taken into account in computing the actual damages. a. Actual damages include the retail value of all communications services to which the violator had unauthorized access as a result of the violation and the retail value of any communications service illegally available to each person to whom the violator directly or indirectly provided or distributed a communications device. In proving actual damages, the party aggrieved must prove only that the violator manufactured, distributed, or sold a communications device and is not required to prove that any such device was actually used in violation of this section. b. In determining the violator’s profits, the party aggrieved must prove only the violator’s gross revenue, and the violator must prove his or her deductible expenses and the elements of profit attributable to factors other than the violation. 2. Upon election of such damages at any time before final judgment is entered, the party aggrieved may recover an award of statutory damages for each communications device involved in the action, in a sum of not less than $250 or more than $10,000 for each such device, as the court considers just. (d) In any case in which the court finds that the violation was committed willfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or financial gain, the court in its discretion may increase the award of damages, whether actual or statutory under this section, by an amount of not more than $50,000 for each communications device involved in the action and for each day the defendant is in violation of this section.

In no event shall this exemption be interpreted to preclude full compliance with the security measures set forth in subsection (4) should any occurrence or incidence of the crimes identified by subsection (4) cause subsection (4) to be statutorily applicable. As of July 1, 2021, the Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco will provide notice to any convenience business to which a subsection (4) incident occurred between July 1, 2019, and July 1, 2021.

However, if the property is stolen during a riot or an aggravated riot prohibited under s. 870.01 and the perpetration of the theft is facilitated by conditions arising from the riot; or within a county that is subject to a state of emergency declared by the Governor under chapter 252, the property is stolen after the declaration of emergency is made, and the perpetration of the theft is facilitated by conditions arising from the emergency, the offender commits a felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if the property is valued at $5,000 or more, but less than $10,000, as provided under subparagraph 2., or if the property is valued at $10,000 or more, but less than $20,000, as provided under subparagraph 3. As used in this paragraph, the terms “conditions arising from a riot” and “conditions arising from the emergency” have the same meanings as provided in paragraph (b). A person arrested for committing a theft during a riot or an aggravated riot or within a county that is subject to a state of emergency may not be released until the person appears before a committing magistrate at a first appearance hearing. For purposes of sentencing under chapter 921, a felony offense that is reclassified under this paragraph is ranked one level above the ranking under s. 921.0022 or s. 921.0023 of the offense committed. (d)1. It is grand theft of the third degree and a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if the property stolen is valued at $40 or more, but less than $750, and is taken from a dwelling as defined in s. 810.011(2) or from the unenclosed curtilage of a dwelling pursuant to s. 810.09(1). 2.

A person who commits a violation of subparagraph 1. and who has previously been convicted of any theft commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. 3. A person who commits a violation of subparagraph 1. and who has previously been convicted two or more times of any theft commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (f) Except as provided in paragraph (d), if the property stolen is valued at $100 or more, but less than $750, the offender commits petit theft of the first degree, punishable as a misdemeanor of the first degree, as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (g) It is grand theft of the second degree and a felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if the property stolen is a firearm and the offender has previously been convicted of grand theft of a firearm under subparagraph (c)5. (3)(a) Theft of any property not specified in subsection (2) is petit theft of the second degree and a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083, and as provided in subsection (5), as applicable. (b) A person who commits petit theft and who has previously been convicted of any theft commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (c) A person who commits petit theft and who has previously been convicted two or more times of any theft commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.

An electronic record that contains the judge’s electronic signature as defined in s. 933.40 and is recorded by the clerk of the circuit court. 2. A judge shall cause the fingerprints of a defendant who is found guilty of petit theft to be manually taken or electronically captured. Such fingerprints must be certified and filed in the case in which the judgment of guilty is entered as provided in s. 921.241(3). 3. A written or an electronic judgment of guilty of a petit theft, or a certified copy thereof, is admissible in evidence in the courts of this state as provided in s. 921.241(4). (4) Failure to comply with the terms of a lease when the lease is for a term of 1 year or longer shall not constitute a violation of this section unless demand for the return of the property leased has been made in writing and the lessee has failed to return the property within 7 days of his or her receipt of the demand for return of the property. A demand mailed by certified or registered mail, evidenced by return receipt, to the last known address of the lessee shall be deemed sufficient and equivalent to the demand having been received by the lessee, whether such demand shall be returned undelivered or not. (5)(a) No person shall drive a motor vehicle so as to cause it to leave the premises of an establishment at which gasoline offered for retail sale was dispensed into the fuel tank of such motor vehicle unless the payment of authorized charge for the gasoline dispensed has been made. (b) In addition to the penalties prescribed in paragraph (3)(a), every judgment of guilty of a petit theft for property described in this subsection shall provide for the suspension of the convicted person’s driver license.

(7) The Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability (OPPAGA) shall perform a study every 5 years to determine the appropriateness of the threshold amounts included in this section. The study’s scope must include, but need not be limited to, the crime trends related to theft offenses, the theft threshold amounts of other states in effect at the time of the study, the fiscal impact of any modifications to this state’s threshold amounts, and the effect on economic factors, such as inflation. The study must include options for amending the threshold amounts if the study finds that such amounts are inconsistent with current trends. In conducting the study, OPPAGA shall consult with the Office of Economic and Demographic Research in addition to other interested entities. OPPAGA shall submit a report to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives by September 1 of every 5th year.
