      "text": "341.031 Definitions relating to Florida Public Transit Act.—As used in ss. 341.011-341.061, the term: (1) “Public transit provider” or “provider” means a public agency providing public transit service, including rail authorities created in chapter 343. (2) “Fixed-guideway transportation system” means a public transit system for the transporting of people by a conveyance, or a series of interconnected conveyances, which conveyance or series of conveyances is specifically designed for travel on a stationary rail or other guideway, whether located on, above, or under the ground. (3) “Eligible transit operating costs” means the total administrative, management, and operation costs directly incident to the provision of public transit services, excluding any depreciation or amortization of capital assets. (4) “Local revenue sources” means the sum of funds received from a local government entity to assist in paying transit operation costs, including tax funds, and revenue earned from fare box receipts, charter service, contract service, express service, and nontransportation activities. (5) “Paratransit” means those elements of public transit which provide service between specific origins and destinations selected by the individual user with such service being provided at a time that is agreed upon by the user and the provider of the service. Paratransit service is provided by taxis, limousines, “dial-a-ride” buses, and other demand-responsive operations that are characterized by their nonscheduled, nonfixed route nature. (6) “Public transit” means the transporting of people by conveyances, or systems of conveyances, traveling on land or water, local or regional in nature, and available for use by the public. Public transit systems may be either governmentally owned or privately owned. Public transit specifically includes those forms of transportation commonly known as “paratransit.” (7) “Public transit capital project” means a project undertaken by a public agency to provide public transit to its constituency, and is limited to acquisition, design, construction, reconstruction, or improvement of a governmentally owned or operated transit system. (8) “Public transit service development project” means a project undertaken by a public agency to determine whether a new or innovative technique or measure can be utilized to improve or expand public transit services to its constituency. The duration of the project shall be limited according to the type of the project in conformance with the provisions of s. 341.051(5)(e), but in no case shall exceed a period of 3 years. Public transit service development projects specifically include projects involving the utilization of new technologies, services, routes, or vehicle frequencies; the purchase of special transportation services; and other such techniques for increasing service to the riding public as are applicable to specific localities and transit user groups. (9) “Commuter assistance program” means financial and technical assistance by the department to promote alternatives to the use of automobiles by a single commuter. The term includes the following program areas: (a) “Ridesharing,” which means an arrangement between persons with a common destination, or destinations, within the same proximity, to share the use of a motor vehicle on a recurring basis for round-trip transportation to and from their place of employment or other common destination. For purposes of ridesharing, employment shall be deemed to commence when an employee arrives at the employer’s place of employment to report for work and shall be deemed to terminate when the employee leaves the employer’s place of employment, excluding areas not under the control of the employer. However, an employee shall be deemed to be within the course of employment when the employee is engaged in the performance of duties assigned or directed by the employer, or acting in the furtherance of the business of the employer, irrespective of location. (b) “Transportation demand management,” which means techniques that can be used to increase the efficiency of existing transportation systems by influencing demand on the systems and by reducing the number of automobile trips during peak hours of highway use.

(11) “Intercity bus service” means regularly scheduled bus service for the general public which operates with limited stops over fixed routes connecting two or more urban areas not in close proximity; has the capacity for transporting baggage carried by passengers; makes meaningful connections with scheduled intercity bus service to more distant points, if such service is available; maintains scheduled information in the National Official Bus Guide; and provides package express service incidental to passenger transportation. (12) “Eligible bus carrier” or “carrier” means a private company that has operated defined intercity bus service in the state, with formal authority in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the Surface Transportation Board of the Federal Department of Transportation, for a minimum of 2 years. (13) “Eligible intercity bus costs” means the total costs directly incident to the provision of intercity bus service, including any depreciation or amortization of capital assets purchased without public financial assistance. (14) “Intercity bus capital project” means a capital project undertaken by an intercity bus carrier to provide intercity bus service, and is limited to acquisition, design, construction, reconstruction, or improvement of a privately operated intercity bus service.

      "text": "341.041 Transit responsibilities of the department.—The department shall, within the resources provided pursuant to chapter 216: (1) Develop a statewide plan that provides for public transit and intercity bus service needs at least 5 years in advance. The plan shall be developed in a manner that will assure maximum use of existing facilities, and optimum integration and coordination of the various modes of transportation, including both governmentally owned and privately owned resources, in the most cost-effective manner possible. The plan shall also incorporate plans adopted by local and regional planning agencies which are consistent, to the maximum extent feasible, with adopted strategic policy plans and approved local government comprehensive plans for the region and units of local government covered by the plan and shall, insofar as practical, conform to federal planning requirements. The plan shall be consistent with the goals of the Florida Transportation Plan developed pursuant to s. 339.155. (2) Formulate a specific program of projects and project financing to respond to identified transit and intercity bus service needs as part of the work program. (3) Develop, publish, and administer state measures concerning system management, performance, productivity, cost distribution, and safety of governmentally owned public transit systems and privately owned or operated systems financed wholly or in part by state funding. Such measures shall be developed jointly with representatives of affected publicly owned transit systems and in coordination with affected privately owned systems, with full consideration given to nationwide industry norms. (4) Provide technical and financial assistance to units of local government and intercity bus carriers, based on an analysis of public transit and intercity bus service problems and needs, to assist in establishing and implementing effective transit systems and related support programs. In providing such assistance, the department may assist public agencies that provide public transit and intercity bus carriers that provide intercity bus services by making department-owned transit vehicles and appurtenances available for lease to such agencies for special needs of limited duration. (5) Coordinate activities between the public entities and private entities on matters relating to public transit and intercity bus services. (6) Assist in the development and implementation of marketing and passenger information programs for public transit and intercity bus services. (7) Provide transit service through contracts with existing publicly or privately owned transit systems, where such service represents the transit element of a corridor project designed to relieve urban traffic congestion. (8) Provide intercity bus service, as defined in s. 341.031, to support projects that serve to maintain and enhance statewide intercity bus service. The department shall use and dedicate federal funds apportioned to intercity bus service according to federal requirements to support a statewide intercity bus network. (9) Provide new transit service and equipment where a public need has been determined to exist pursuant to the transportation planning process and where all of the following conditions occur: (a) No other governmental entity of appropriate jurisdiction exists. (b) The service cannot be reasonably provided by a governmentally owned or privately owned public transit provider. (c) The cost of providing the service does not exceed the sum of revenues resulting from user fares, special transit services such as charter operations, local fund participation, and specific legislative appropriation for this purpose. The department may buy, sell, own, lease, and otherwise encumber facilities, transit vehicles, and appurtenances thereto, as necessary to provide such service; or the department may provide service by contracts with governmentally owned or privately owned service providers. (10) Provide public transportation service where emergency service is required, provided that no other private or public transportation operation is available to provide needed service and that such service is clearly in the best interests of the people or communities being served. Such service shall be provided by contractual services, actual operation of state-owned transit equipment and facilities, or any other means deemed appropriate by the department and shall be limited to a period not to exceed 2 years. (11) Administer federal and state commuter assistance programs and related federal-aid funds apportioned to the department, which promote the use of ridesharing arrangements and transportation demand management strategies, and the creation of transportation management associations. Public agencies, and private organizations established pursuant to chapter 617 and approved by the local government and the department as being consistent with local, regional, and state transportation plans, are eligible to receive funds under this program. The department shall establish adequate insurance requirements based on passenger capacity for each vehicle used in ridesharing. (12) Assist local governmental entities and other transit operators in the planning and development of transit programs and procedures and in the identification of alternatives for achieving the most effective use of available transportation resources and increasing revenue sources as needed so that Florida’s transit systems can move toward becoming fiscally self-sufficient. The department may also advance, on a matching basis, state funds for capital improvements to transit properties in accordance with the following: (a) Candidate programs may include, but are not limited to, the development of terminal facilities for lease by interfacing modes, the acquisition and development of adjacent land for lease or sale to public and private entities, and the acquisition and development of air rights. (b) The criteria to be utilized in determining whether or not to advance such funds shall be adopted by rule and shall include the demonstrated need of the transit system, administrative capability, and a system financial plan as approved by the department. (13) Assist local governmental entities in achieving a condition wherein transit systems are operated at a service level that is responsive to identified transit needs and in such a manner as to promote maximum transit usage and achieve the highest possible operating recovery ratio commensurate with the local government’s transit role and requirements. (14) Assist local governmental entities and other transit operators in the planning, development, and coordination of transit services for Temporary Cash Assistance Program participants as defined in s. 414.0252. (15) Create and maintain a common self-retention insurance fund to support fixed-guideway projects throughout the state when there is a contractual obligation to have the fund in existence in order to provide fixed-guideway services. The maximum limit of the fund is as required by any contractual obligation. (16) Unless otherwise provided by state or federal law, ensure that all grants and agreements between the department and entities providing paratransit services include, at a minimum, the following provisions: (a) Performance requirements for the delivery of services, including clear penalties for repeated or continuing violations; (b) Minimum liability insurance requirements for all transportation services purchased, provided, or coordinated for the transportation disadvantaged, as defined in s. 427.011(1), through the contracted vendor or subcontractor thereof; (c) Complaint and grievance processes for paratransit users, including a requirement that all reported complaints, grievances, and resolutions be reported to the department on a quarterly basis; and (d) A requirement that the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) must be included in any agreement between an entity receiving a grant or an agreement from the department and such entity’s contractors or subcontractors that provide paratransit services.

      "text": "341.3025 Multicounty public rail system fares and enforcement.— (1) Any entity that owns or operates a public rail system in two or more counties of the state may adopt rules and regulations relating to the operation and management of its rail system, including regulations relating to fares, fees, and charges for the use of the facilities and services of the system. (2) It is unlawful for any person to ride the rail system without payment of the appropriate fare or to cause goods or other items for which a fee is charged to be carried on the rail system without payment of the fee. (3)(a) Any person riding the rail system without paying the appropriate fare or causing goods or other items for which a fee is charged to be carried without paying such fee shall be subject to citation by an enforcement officer of the system and, in addition to any other penalty provided by law, is guilty of a noncriminal violation punishable by a fine of $50 per each such violation. (b) The citation issued to a person in violation of this section shall state the reason for the citation, the amount of the fine, and the court having jurisdiction of the offense. (c) Each enforcement officer issuing a citation for an alleged violation of this section shall deposit the original and one copy of the citation with a court having jurisdiction over the alleged offense within 5 days after issuance to the violator. (d) The entity operating the system shall maintain a copy of the citation. (e) Upon the deposit of the original and one copy of such citation with a court having jurisdiction over the alleged offense, the original or copy of such citation may be disposed of only by trial in the court or other official action by a judge of the court, including forfeiture of the bail, or by the deposit of sufficient bail with or payment of a fine to the entity by the person to whom such citation has been issued. (f) The entity shall maintain or cause to be maintained a record of the disposition of each citation issued. (4)(a) Any person cited for an offense under this section shall sign and accept a citation indicating a promise to appear. (b) Any person who does not elect to appear shall pay the fine either by mail or in person within 30 days of the date of receiving the citation. If the person cited follows the procedure provided in this paragraph, he or she shall be deemed to have admitted the infraction and to have waived his or her right to a trial on the issue of commission of the infraction. Such admission shall not be used as evidence in any other proceeding. (c) Any person electing to appear before the judge shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to pay the penalty. The judge, after a trial, shall make a determination as to whether an infraction has been proven and may impose a civil penalty not to exceed $500. If the judge determines that no infraction has been committed, no cost or penalties shall be imposed, and any cost or penalty which has been paid shall be returned. (d) Any person who fails to appear or otherwise properly respond to a citation issued under this section shall also be charged with the offense of failing to respond to such citation and, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. A written warning to this effect shall be provided at the time such citation is issued. (e) The commission of an offense must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt at any trial. (5) For the purpose of enforcing the payment of such fares, fees, and charges for use of the facilities and services of the system, such entity shall have the authority: (a) To employ enforcement officers or contract with a private firm or company to verify payment of appropriate fares or fees and to issue citations to persons traveling on the system without paying the appropriate fare or to persons who cause goods or other items for which a fee is charged to be carried without paying such fee. Such enforcement officers who are not licensed security officers shall not carry firearms or other weapons or have arrest authority; armed security officers performing fare inspection services shall not have arrest authority and shall be licensed as required by chapter 493 and all other applicable laws and regulations. (b) To maintain records of citations issued and to accept payment of fines and costs. (6) All fines and forfeitures received by any court from violations of this section shall be paid monthly, less any administrative costs, to the entity operating the system. (7)(a) The Legislature recognizes the importance of encouraging the seamless use of local and regional public transportation systems by residents of and visitors to the state wherever possible. The paramount concern is to encourage the implementation of fare collection systems that are interoperable and compatible with multiple public transportation systems throughout the state. (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, in order to facilitate the ease of transfer from one public transportation system to another, any new public rail system that is constructed after December 1, 2010, by the state, an agency of the state, a regional transportation authority, or one or more counties or municipalities shall use a universally accepted contactless fare media that is compatible with the American Public Transportation Association’s Contactless Fare Media System Standard or the applicable bankcard contactless media standards and allows users to purchase fares at a single point of sale with coin, cash, or credit card. Additionally, any existing public rail system that is adding a new fare media system or is upgrading its existing fare media system shall use a universally accepted contactless fare media that is compatible with the American Public Transportation Association’s Contactless Fare Media System Standard or the applicable bankcard contactless media standards and allows users to purchase fares at a single point of sale with coin, cash, or credit card. (8) Venue for prosecution or recovery for violations of rules or regulations adopted pursuant to this section shall be in the county where the entity which owns and operates the public rail system maintains its principal place of business.

The design, construction, operation, maintenance, and financing of a high-speed rail system by the enterprise, its agent, or the owner or lessee thereof, as herein authorized, constitutes the performance of an essential public function. (2)(a) For the purposes of this section, the term “enterprise” does not include agents of the enterprise other than contractors who qualify as such pursuant to subsection (7). (b) For the purposes of this section, any item or property that is within the definition of the term “associated development” in s. 341.8203(1) may not be considered part of the high-speed rail system as defined in s. 341.8203(4). (3)(a) Purchases or leases of tangible personal property or real property by the enterprise, excluding agents of the enterprise, are exempt from taxes imposed by chapter 212 as provided in s. 212.08(6). Purchases or leases of tangible personal property that is incorporated into the high-speed rail system as a component part thereof, as determined by the enterprise, by agents of the enterprise or the owner of the high-speed rail system are exempt from sales or use taxes imposed by chapter 212. The exemptions granted in this subsection do not apply to sales, leases, or licenses by the enterprise, agents of the enterprise, or the owner of the high-speed rail system. (b) The exemption granted in paragraph (a) to purchases or leases of tangible personal property by agents of the enterprise or by the owner of the high-speed rail system applies only to property that becomes a component part of such system. It does not apply to items, including, but not limited to, cranes, bulldozers, forklifts, other machinery and equipment, tools and supplies, or other items of tangible personal property used in the construction, operation, or maintenance of the high-speed rail system when such items are not incorporated into the high-speed rail system as a component part thereof. (4) Any bonds or other security, and all notes, mortgages, security agreements, letters of credit, or other instruments that arise out of or are given to secure the repayment of bonds or other security, issued by the enterprise, or on behalf of the enterprise, their transfer, and the income therefrom, including any profit made on the sale thereof, shall at all times be free from taxation of every kind by the state, the counties, and the municipalities and other political subdivisions in the state. This subsection, however, does not exempt from taxation or assessment the leasehold interest of a lessee in any project or any other property or interest owned by the lessee. The exemption granted by this subsection is not applicable to any tax imposed by chapter 220 on interest income or profits on the sale of debt obligations owned by corporations. (5) When property of the enterprise is leased to another person or entity, the property shall be exempt from ad valorem taxation only if the use by the lessee qualifies the property for exemption under s. 196.199. (6) A leasehold interest held by the enterprise is not subject to intangible tax. However, if a leasehold interest held by the enterprise is subleased to a nongovernmental lessee, such subleasehold interest shall be deemed to be an interest described in s. 199.023(1)(d), Florida Statutes 2005, and is subject to the intangible tax. (7)(a) In order to be considered an agent of the enterprise for purposes of the exemption from sales and use tax granted by subsection (3) for tangible personal property incorporated into the high-speed rail system, a contractor of the enterprise that purchases or fabricates such tangible personal property must be certified by the enterprise as provided in this subsection. (b)1. A contractor must apply for a renewal of the exemption not later than December 1 of each calendar year. 2. A contractor must apply to the enterprise on the application form adopted by the enterprise, which shall develop the form in consultation with the Department of Revenue. 3. The enterprise shall review each submitted application and determine whether it is complete. The enterprise shall notify the applicant of any deficiencies in the application within 30 days. Upon receipt of a completed application, the enterprise shall evaluate the application for exemption under this subsection and issue a certification that the contractor is qualified to act as an agent of the enterprise for purposes of this section or a denial of such certification within 30 days. The enterprise shall provide the Department of Revenue with a copy of each certification issued upon approval of an application. Upon receipt of a certification from the enterprise, the Department of Revenue shall issue an exemption permit to the contractor. (c)1. The contractor may extend a copy of its exemption permit to its vendors in lieu of paying sales tax on purchases of tangible personal property qualifying for exemption under this section. Possession of a copy of the exemption permit relieves the seller of the responsibility of collecting tax on the sale, and the Department of Revenue shall look solely to the contractor for recovery of tax upon a determination that the contractor was not entitled to the exemption. 2. The contractor may extend a copy of its exemption permit to real property subcontractors supplying and installing tangible personal property that is exempt under subsection (3). Any such subcontractor may extend a copy of the permit to the subcontractor’s vendors in order to purchase qualifying tangible personal property tax-exempt. If the subcontractor uses the exemption permit to purchase tangible personal property that is determined not to qualify for exemption under subsection (3), the Department of Revenue may assess and collect any tax, penalties, and interest that are due from either the contractor holding the exemption permit or the subcontractor that extended the exemption permit to the seller. (d) Any contractor authorized to act as an agent of the enterprise under this section shall maintain the necessary books and records to document the exempt status of purchases and fabrication costs made or incurred under the permit. In addition, an authorized contractor extending its exemption permit to its subcontractors shall maintain a copy of the subcontractor’s books, records, and invoices indicating all purchases made by the subcontractor under the authorized contractor’s permit. If, in an audit conducted by the Department of Revenue, it is determined that tangible personal property purchased or fabricated claiming exemption under this section does not meet the criteria for exemption, the amount of taxes not paid at the time of purchase or fabrication shall be immediately due and payable to the Department of Revenue, together with the appropriate interest and penalty, computed from the date of purchase, in the manner prescribed by chapter 212. (e) If a contractor fails to apply for a high-speed rail system exemption permit, or if a contractor initially determined by the enterprise to not qualify for exemption is subsequently determined to be eligible, the contractor shall receive the benefit of the exemption in this subsection through a refund of previously paid taxes for transactions that otherwise would have been exempt. A refund may not be made for such taxes without the issuance of a certification by the enterprise that the contractor was authorized to make purchases tax-exempt and a determination by the Department of Revenue that the purchases qualified for the exemption.
