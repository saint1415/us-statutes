(2) The governing body shall determine the form of the bonds including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and the manner of execution of the bonds, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds, and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state.

The issuance of such bonds shall not be subject to any limitations or conditions contained in any other law, and any bonds issued by a unit under this law shall not be considered in computing the amount of indebtedness which the unit may incur under any other law. (4) The governing body may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interests of the unit. Prior to the delivery of definitive bonds, the unit may issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery. (5) The governing body may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. Bonds may be issued under the provisions of this law without obtaining the consent of any commission, board, bureau or agency of the state, and without any other proceeding or the happening of any other condition or thing than those proceedings, conditions or things which are specifically required by this law.
