      "text": "159.34 Bonds.— (1) The local agency is authorized to provide for the issuance, at one time or from time to time, of industrial revenue bonds of the local agency for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of any project or projects. The bonds shall be designated, subject to such additions or changes as the local agency deems advisable, “ Industrial Development Revenue Bonds” (inserting in the blank space the name of the local agency which issues the bonds). The principal of, and the interest on, such bonds shall be payable solely from the funds herein provided for payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated; shall bear interest at such rate or rates, including variable rates, notwithstanding any limitation in other laws relating to the maximum interest rate permitted for bonds of any county, municipality, or of the state or any agency of the foregoing; and shall mature at such time or times from their date or dates as may be determined or provided for by the local agency; and may be made redeemable before maturity at the option of the local agency at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the local agency prior to the issuance of the bonds. The local agency shall determine the form and the manner of execution of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. In case any officer whose signature, or a facsimile of whose signature, shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be that officer before the delivery of the bonds, the signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he or she had remained in office until delivery. The local agency may also provide for the authentication of the bonds by a trustee or fiscal agent. The bonds may be issued in coupon form or in registered form, or both, as the local agency may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest; and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest; and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. The local agency may sell the bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price as it may determine will best effectuate the purpose of this part, notwithstanding any limitation in other laws relating to the maximum interest rate permitted for bonds of a county, a municipality, or the state or any agency of the foregoing. (2) Revenue bonds may be issued only if they are payable solely from revenue derived from the sale, operation, or leasing of any project or projects or other payments received under financing agreements with respect thereto. (3) The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, or portion or portions thereof, for which such bonds shall have been issued, and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the local agency may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement hereinafter mentioned securing the same. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by reason of increased construction costs or error in estimates or otherwise, shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficiency, and unless otherwise provided in the bond resolution or in the trust agreement, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed such cost, such excess shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for such bonds, or, if so provided in such resolution or trust agreement, may be applied to the payment of the cost of any additional project or projects. (4) Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the local agency may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The local agency may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost. (5) Bonds may be issued under the provisions of this part without obtaining, except as otherwise expressly provided in this part, the consent of any department, division, commission, board, body, bureau, or agency of the state, and without any other proceedings or the happening of any conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions, or things which are specifically required by this part and the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or the trust agreement securing the same. (6) A local agency may provide in any bond resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds, or trust agreement securing the same, and in any agreement of lease or other contract respecting the project, that if at any time after such bonds have been sold and delivered it is ascertained by the local agency or its designee that the interest on the bonds is no longer exempt under federal income tax laws, or that operation of the project is no longer economically or legally feasible by reason of the condemnation, damaging, or destruction of all or any part of the project or by changes in the law, measures deemed necessary by the local agency may be taken to protect the interest of the holders of its bonds, including the acceleration of the date or dates for calling the bonds for redemption, increasing the redemption premium and the rates of interest on the bonds, or increasing the rent under any such agreement of lease. The local agency may also require financial guarantees by guarantors acceptable to the local agency that obligations of any lessee under any such agreement of lease or contract shall be performed or otherwise satisfied.

The fees, rents, and charges and all other revenues and proceeds derived from the project or projects in connection with which the bonds of any issue shall have been issued, except such part thereof as may be necessary for such reserves or any expenditures as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be set aside, at the time or times as may be specified in the resolution or trust agreement, in a sinking fund which is hereby pledged to and charged with the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds as the same shall become due and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made.

Neither the resolution nor any trust agreement by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded, except in the records of the local agency. The use and disposition of money to the credit of the sinking fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or of such trust agreement.

      "text": "159.603 Definitions.—As used in this part, the following words and terms have the following meanings unless the context indicates another or different meaning or intent. (1) “Area of operation” means the area within the territorial boundaries of the county for which the housing finance authority is created, and any area outside the territorial boundaries of such county if the governing body of the county within which such outside area is located approves. The approval may be a general approval or an approval only for specified qualifying housing developments or only for a specified number of qualifying housing developments. (2) “Bonds” means any bonds, notes, debentures, interim certificates, or other evidences of financial indebtedness issued by a housing finance authority under and pursuant to this act. (3) “Housing finance authority” means a housing finance authority created pursuant to s. 159.604. (4) “Housing development” means any residential building, land, equipment, facility, or other real or personal property which may be necessary, convenient, or desirable in connection therewith, including streets, sewers, water and utility services, parks, gardening, administrative, community, health, recreational, and educational facilities, and other facilities related and subordinate to moderate, middle, or lesser income housing, and also includes site preparation, the planning of housing and improvements, the acquisition of property, the removal or demolition of existing structures, the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, and rehabilitation of housing and improvements, and all other work in connection therewith, and all costs of financing, including without limitation the cost of consultant and legal services, other expenses necessary or incident to determining the feasibility of the housing development, administrative and other expenses necessary or incident to the housing development and the financing thereof (including reimbursement to any municipality, county, or entity for expenditures made with the approval of the housing finance authority for the housing development), and interest accrued during construction and for a reasonable period thereafter. (5) “Lending institution” means any bank or trust company, mortgage banker, savings bank, credit union, national banking association, savings and loan association, building and loan association, insurance company, or other financial institution authorized to transact business in this state and which customarily provides service or otherwise aids in the financing of mortgages located in the state. (6) “Qualifying housing development” means any work or improvement located or to be located in this state, including real property, buildings, and any other real and personal property, designed or intended for the primary purpose of providing decent, safe, and sanitary residential housing for four or more families, at least 60 percent of whom are eligible persons, whether new construction, the acquisition of existing residential housing, or the remodeling, improvement, rehabilitation, or reconstruction of existing housing, together with such related nonhousing facilities as the authority determines to be necessary, convenient, or desirable. (a) The term includes a housing development that meets the definition of a “qualified low-income housing project” under s. 42(g) of the Internal Revenue Code, regardless of whether such development meets the 60-percent eligible persons requirement under this subsection. (b) The exception provided under paragraph (a) applies to all housing developments meeting the federal definition for “qualified low-income housing project” as well as all developments that previously qualified under the state definition for “qualifying housing development.” Housing finance authorities may enter into regulatory agreement amendments as necessary to accommodate housing developments that qualify under paragraph (a). (7) “Eligible persons” means one or more natural persons or a family, irrespective of race, creed, national origin, or sex, determined by the housing finance authority to be of low, moderate, or middle income. Such determination does not preclude any person or family earning up to 150 percent of the state or county median family income from participating in programs. Persons 65 years of age or older shall be defined as eligible persons regardless of their incomes. In determining the income standards of eligible persons for its various programs, the housing finance authority may consider the following factors: (a) Requirements mandated by federal law. (b) Variations in circumstances in different areas of the state. (c) Whether the determination is for rental housing or homeownership purposes. (d) The need for family-size adjustments to accomplish the purposes set forth in this act. History.—s. 3, ch. 78-89; s. 4, ch. 87-106; s. 1, ch. 2013-83.
