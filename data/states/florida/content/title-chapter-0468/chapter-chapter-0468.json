(a) For the purposes of this subsection: 1. “Activities of daily living” means functions and tasks for self-care which are performed on a daily or routine basis, including functional mobility, bathing, dressing, eating and swallowing, personal hygiene and grooming, toileting, and other similar tasks. 2. “Assessment” means the use of skilled observation or the administration and interpretation of standardized or nonstandardized tests and measurements to identify areas for occupational therapy services. 3. “Health management” means therapeutic services designed to develop, manage, and maintain health and wellness routines, including self-management, performed with the goal of improving or maintaining health to support participation in occupations. 4. “Instrumental activities of daily living” means daily or routine activities a person must perform to live independently within the home and community. 5. “Occupational performance” means the ability to perceive, desire, recall, plan, and carry out roles, routines, tasks, and subtasks for the purpose of self-maintenance, self-preservation, productivity, leisure, and rest, for oneself or for others, in response to internal or external demands of occupations and contexts. 6. “Occupational therapy services in mental health” means occupation-based interventions and services for individuals, groups, populations, families, or communities to improve participation in daily occupations for individuals who are experiencing, are in recovery from, or are identified as being at risk of developing mental health conditions. 7. “Occupations” means meaningful and purposeful everyday activities performed and engaged in by individuals, groups, populations, families, or communities which occur in contexts and over time, such as activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, health management, rest and sleep, education, work, play, leisure, and social participation. The term includes more specific occupations and the execution of multiple activities that are influenced by performance patterns, performance skills, and client factors, and that result in varied outcomes. (b) The practice of occupational therapy includes, but is not limited to, the following services: 1. Assessment, treatment, and education of or consultation with individuals, groups, and populations whose abilities to participate safely in occupations, including activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, rest and sleep, education, work, play, leisure, and social participation, are impaired or have been identified as being at risk of impairment due to issues related to, but not limited to, developmental deficiencies, the aging process, learning disabilities, physical environment and sociocultural context, physical injury or disease, cognitive impairments, or psychological and social disabilities. 2. Methods or approaches used to determine abilities and limitations related to performance of occupations, including, but not limited to, the identification of physical, sensory, cognitive, emotional, or social deficiencies. 3. Specific occupational therapy techniques used for treatment which include, but are not limited to, training in activities of daily living; environmental modification; assessment of the need for the use of interventions such as the design, fabrication, and application of orthotics or orthotic devices; selecting, applying, and training in the use of assistive technology and adaptive devices; sensory, motor, and cognitive activities; therapeutic exercises; manual techniques; physical agent modalities; and occupational therapy services in mental health. (c) The use of devices subject to 21 C.F.R. s. 801.109 and identified by the board is expressly prohibited except by an occupational therapist or occupational therapy assistant who has received training as specified by the board. The board shall adopt rules to carry out the purpose of this provision. (5) “Occupational therapy aide” means a person who assists in the practice of occupational therapy, who works under the direct supervision of a licensed occupational therapist or occupational therapy assistant, and whose activities require a general understanding of occupational therapy pursuant to board rules. (6) “Occupational therapy assistant” means a person licensed to assist in the practice of occupational therapy, who works under the supervision of an occupational therapist, and whose license is in good standing. (7) “Person” means any individual, partnership, unincorporated organization, or corporate body, except that only an individual may be licensed under this act. (8) “Supervision” means responsible supervision and control, with the licensed occupational therapist providing both initial direction in developing a plan of treatment and periodic inspection of the actual implementation of the plan. Such plan of treatment shall not be altered by the supervised individual without prior consultation with, and the approval of, the supervising occupational therapist. The supervising occupational therapist need not always be physically present or on the premises when the assistant is performing services; however, except in cases of emergency, supervision shall require the availability of the supervising occupational therapist for consultation with and direction of the supervised individual.

YOU MAY CANCEL THIS CONTRACT WITHIN 14 DAYS AFTER SIGNING IT. HOWEVER, CANCELLATION OF THIS CONTRACT MAY NOT REINSTATE YOUR ELIGIBILITY. (4) An agent contract that does not conform to this section is voidable by the student athlete.

The finding by the department of lack of good moral character is supported by clear and convincing evidence. (c) When an applicant is found to be unqualified for a license because of lack of good moral character, the department shall furnish the applicant a statement containing the findings of the department, a complete record of the evidence upon which the determination was based, and a notice of the rights of the applicant to a rehearing and appeal.
