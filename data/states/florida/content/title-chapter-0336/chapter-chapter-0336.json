To determine the feasibility of using certain recyclable materials for paving materials, the department may undertake demonstration projects using all of the following materials in road construction: (a) Ground rubber from automobile tires in road resurfacing or subbase materials for roads. (b) Ash residue from coal combustion byproducts for concrete and ash residue from waste incineration facilities and oil combustion byproducts for subbase material. (c) Recycled mixed-plastic material for guardrail posts or right-of-way fence posts. (d) Construction steel, including reinforcing rods and I-beams, manufactured from scrap metals disposed of in the state. (e) Glass and glass aggregates. (f) Phosphogypsum from phosphate production in road construction aggregate material. (3) The department shall review and revise existing bid procedures and specifications for the purchase or use of products and materials to eliminate any procedures and specifications that explicitly discriminate against products and materials with recycled content, except where such procedures and specifications are necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the people of this state. (4) The department shall review and revise its bid procedures and specifications on a continuing basis to encourage the use of products and materials with recycled content and shall, in developing new procedures and specifications, encourage the use of products and materials with recycled content. (5) Notwithstanding any law, rule, or ordinance to the contrary, a local governmental entity may not adopt standards or specifications that are contrary to the department standards or specifications for permissible use of reclaimed asphalt pavement material and may not deem reclaimed asphalt pavement material as solid waste. (6) All agencies shall cooperate with the department in carrying out the provisions of this section.

(b) Would only use county funds for portions of the project that will be part of the county road system. (c) Would have adequate safeguards to ensure that additional costs or unreasonable service disruptions are not realized by the traveling public and citizens of the state. (d) Upon completion, would be a part of the county road system owned by the county. (e) Would result in a financial benefit to the public by completing the subject project at a cost to the public significantly lower than if the project were constructed by the county using the normal procurement process. (2) The notice for the public hearing provided for in subsection (1) must be published at least 14 days before the date of the public meeting at which the governing board takes final action. The notice must identify the project and the estimated cost of the project and specify that the purpose for the public meeting is to consider whether it is in the public’s best interest to accept the proposal and enter into an agreement pursuant thereto. The determination of cost savings pursuant to paragraph (1)(e) must be supported by a professional engineer’s cost estimate made available to the public at least 14 days before the public meeting and placed in the record for that meeting. (3) If the process in subsection (1) is followed, the project and agreement are exempt from s. 255.20 pursuant to s. 255.20(1)(c)11. (4) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section, this section does not affect existing law by granting additional powers to or imposing further restrictions on local government entities.
