      "text": "44.1011 Definitions.—As used in this chapter: (1) “Arbitration” means a process whereby a neutral third person or panel, called an arbitrator or arbitration panel, considers the facts and arguments presented by the parties and renders a decision which may be binding or nonbinding as provided in this chapter. (2) “Mediation” means a process whereby a neutral third person called a mediator acts to encourage and facilitate the resolution of a dispute between two or more parties. It is an informal and nonadversarial process with the objective of helping the disputing parties reach a mutually acceptable and voluntary agreement. In mediation, decisionmaking authority rests with the parties. The role of the mediator includes, but is not limited to, assisting the parties in identifying issues, fostering joint problem solving, and exploring settlement alternatives. “Mediation” includes: (a) “Appellate court mediation,” which means mediation that occurs during the pendency of an appeal of a civil case. (b) “Circuit court mediation,” which means mediation of civil cases, other than family matters, in circuit court. If a party is represented by counsel, the counsel of record must appear unless stipulated to by the parties or otherwise ordered by the court. (c) “County court mediation,” which means mediation of civil cases within the jurisdiction of county courts, including small claims. Negotiations in county court mediation are primarily conducted by the parties. Counsel for each party may participate. However, presence of counsel is not required. (d) “Dependency or in need of services mediation,” which means mediation of dependency, child in need of services, or family in need of services matters. Negotiations in dependency or in need of services mediation are primarily conducted by the parties. Counsel for each party may attend the mediation conference and privately communicate with their clients. However, presence of counsel is not required and, in the discretion of the mediator and with the agreement of the parties, mediation may proceed in the absence of counsel unless otherwise ordered by the court. (e) “Family mediation” which means mediation of family matters, including married and unmarried persons, before and after judgments involving dissolution of marriage; property division; shared or sole parental responsibility; or child support, custody, and visitation involving emotional or financial considerations not usually present in other circuit civil cases. Negotiations in family mediation are primarily conducted by the parties. Counsel for each party may attend the mediation conference and privately communicate with their clients. However, presence of counsel is not required, and, in the discretion of the mediator, and with the agreement of the parties, mediation may proceed in the absence of counsel unless otherwise ordered by the court.

(2) A court, under rules adopted by the Supreme Court: (a) Must, upon request of one party, refer to mediation any filed civil action for monetary damages, provided the requesting party is willing and able to pay the costs of the mediation or the costs can be equitably divided between the parties, unless: 1. The action is a landlord and tenant dispute that does not include a claim for personal injury. 2. The action is filed for the purpose of collecting a debt. 3. The action is a claim of medical malpractice. 4. The action is governed by the Florida Small Claims Rules. 5. The court determines that the action is proper for referral to nonbinding arbitration under this chapter. 6. The parties have agreed to binding arbitration. 7. The parties have agreed to an expedited trial pursuant to s. 45.075. 8. The parties have agreed to voluntary trial resolution pursuant to s. 44.104. (b) May refer to mediation all or any part of a filed civil action for which mediation is not required under this section. (c) In circuits in which a family mediation program has been established and upon a court finding of a dispute, shall refer to mediation all or part of custody, visitation, or other parental responsibility issues as defined in s. 61.13. Upon motion or request of a party, a court shall not refer any case to mediation if it finds there has been a history of domestic violence that would compromise the mediation process. (d) In circuits in which a dependency or in need of services mediation program has been established, may refer to mediation all or any portion of a matter relating to dependency or to a child in need of services or a family in need of services. (3) All written communications in a mediation proceeding, other than an executed settlement agreement, shall be exempt from the requirements of chapter 119. (4) The chief judge of each judicial circuit shall maintain a list of mediators who have been certified by the Supreme Court and who have registered for appointment in that circuit. (a) Whenever possible, qualified individuals who have volunteered their time to serve as mediators shall be appointed. If a mediation program is funded pursuant to s. 44.108, volunteer mediators shall be entitled to reimbursement pursuant to s. 112.061 for all actual expenses necessitated by service as a mediator. (b) Nonvolunteer mediators shall be compensated according to rules adopted by the Supreme Court. If a mediation program is funded pursuant to s. 44.108, a mediator may be compensated by the county or by the parties. (5)(a) When an action is referred to mediation by court order, the time periods for responding to an offer of settlement pursuant to s. 45.061, or to an offer or demand for judgment pursuant to s. 768.79, respectively, shall be tolled until: 1. An impasse has been declared by the mediator; or 2. The mediator has reported to the court that no agreement was reached. (b) Sections 45.061 and 768.79 notwithstanding, an offer of settlement or an offer or demand for judgment may be made at any time after an impasse has been declared by the mediator, or the mediator has reported that no agreement was reached. An offer is deemed rejected as of commencement of trial.

      "text": "44.103 Court-ordered, nonbinding arbitration.— (1) Court-ordered, nonbinding arbitration shall be conducted according to the rules of practice and procedure adopted by the Supreme Court. (2) A court, pursuant to rules adopted by the Supreme Court, may refer any contested civil action filed in a circuit or county court to nonbinding arbitration. (3) Arbitrators shall be selected and compensated in accordance with rules adopted by the Supreme Court. Arbitrators shall be compensated by the parties, or, upon a finding by the court that a party is indigent, an arbitrator may be partially or fully compensated from state funds according to the party’s present ability to pay. Prior to approving the use of state funds to reimburse an arbitrator, the court must ensure that the party reimburses the portion of the total cost that the party is immediately able to pay and that the party has agreed to a payment plan established by the clerk of the court that will fully reimburse the state for the balance of all state costs for both the arbitrator and any costs of administering the payment plan and any collection efforts that may be necessary in the future. Whenever possible, qualified individuals who have volunteered their time to serve as arbitrators shall be appointed. If an arbitration program is funded pursuant to s. 44.108, volunteer arbitrators are entitled to be reimbursed pursuant to s. 112.061 for all actual expenses necessitated by service as an arbitrator. (4) An arbitrator or, in the case of a panel, the chief arbitrator, shall have such power to administer oaths or affirmations and to conduct the proceedings as the rules of court shall provide. The hearing shall be conducted informally. Presentation of testimony and evidence shall be kept to a minimum, and matters shall be presented to the arbitrators primarily through the statements and arguments of counsel. Any party to the arbitration may petition the court in the underlying action, for good cause shown, to authorize the arbitrator to issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, records, documents, and other evidence at the arbitration and may petition the court for orders compelling such attendance and production at the arbitration. Subpoenas shall be served and shall be enforceable in the manner provided by law. (5) The arbitration decision shall be presented to the parties in writing. An arbitration decision shall be final if a request for a trial de novo is not filed within the time provided by rules promulgated by the Supreme Court. The decision shall not be made known to the judge who may preside over the case unless no request for trial de novo is made as herein provided or unless otherwise provided by law. If no request for trial de novo is made within the time provided, the decision shall be referred to the presiding judge in the case who shall enter such orders and judgments as are required to carry out the terms of the decision, which orders shall be enforceable by the contempt powers of the court, and for which judgments execution shall issue on request of a party. (6) Upon motion made by either party within 30 days after entry of judgment, the court may assess costs against the party requesting a trial de novo, including arbitration costs, court costs, reasonable attorney’s fees, and other reasonable costs such as investigation expenses and expenses for expert or other testimony which were incurred after the arbitration hearing and continuing through the trial of the case in accordance with the guidelines for taxation of costs as adopted by the Supreme Court. Such costs may be assessed if: (a) The plaintiff, having filed for a trial de novo, obtains a judgment at trial which is at least 25 percent less than the arbitration award. In such instance, the costs and attorney’s fees pursuant to this section shall be set off against the award. When the costs and attorney’s fees pursuant to this section total more than the amount of the judgment, the court shall enter judgment for the defendant against the plaintiff for the amount of the costs and attorney’s fees, less the amount of the award to the plaintiff. For purposes of a determination under this paragraph, the term “judgment” means the amount of the net judgment entered, plus all taxable costs pursuant to the guidelines for taxation of costs as adopted by the Supreme Court, plus any postarbitration collateral source payments received or due as of the date of the judgment, and plus any postarbitration settlement amounts by which the verdict was reduced; or (b) The defendant, having filed for a trial de novo, has a judgment entered against the defendant which is at least 25 percent more than the arbitration award. For purposes of a determination under this paragraph, the term “judgment” means the amount of the net judgment entered, plus any postarbitration settlement amounts by which the verdict was reduced.

The clerk of the court shall forward the moneys collected to the Department of Revenue for deposit in the State Courts Revenue Trust Fund. (2) When court-ordered mediation services are provided by a circuit court’s mediation program, the following fees, unless otherwise established in the General Appropriations Act, shall be collected by the clerk of court: (a) One-hundred twenty dollars per person per scheduled session in family mediation when the parties’ combined income is greater than $50,000, but less than $100,000 per year; (b) Sixty dollars per person per scheduled session in family mediation when the parties’ combined income is less than $50,000; or (c) Sixty dollars per person per scheduled session in county court cases involving an amount in controversy not exceeding $15,000.

The commission of a crime during a mediation is not a mediation communication. (2) “Mediation participant” means a mediation party or a person who attends a mediation in person or by telephone, video conference, or other electronic means. (3) “Mediation party” or “party” means a person participating directly, or through a designated representative, in a mediation and a person who: (a) Is a named party; (b) Is a real party in interest; or (c) Would be a named party or real party in interest if an action relating to the subject matter of the mediation were brought in a court of law. (4) “Mediator” means a neutral, impartial third person who facilitates the mediation process. The mediator’s role is to reduce obstacles to communication, assist in identifying issues, explore alternatives, and otherwise facilitate voluntary agreements to resolve disputes, without prescribing what the resolution must be.

      "text": "44.407 Elder-focused dispute resolution process.— (1) LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.—The Legislature finds that: (a) Denying an elder a voice in decisions regarding himself or herself may negatively affect the elder’s health and well-being, as well as deprive the elder of his or her legal rights. Even if an elder is losing capacity to make major decisions for himself or herself, the elder is still entitled to the dignity of having his or her voice heard. (b) In conjunction with proceedings in court, it is in the best interest of an elder, his or her family members, and legally recognized decisionmakers to have access to a nonadversarial process to resolve disputes relating to the elder which focuses on the elder’s wants, needs, and best interests. Such a process will protect and preserve the elder’s exercisable rights. (c) By recognizing that every elder, including those whose capacity is being questioned, has unique needs, interests, and differing abilities, the Legislature intends for this section to promote the public welfare by establishing a unique dispute resolution option to complement and enhance, not replace, other services, such as the provision of legal information or legal representation; financial advice; individual or family therapy; medical, psychological, or psychiatric evaluation; or mediation, specifically for issues related to the care and needs of elders. The Legislature intends that this section be liberally construed to accomplish these goals. (2) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the term: (a) “Action,” for purposes of using eldercaring coordination solely to address disputes regarding the care and safety of the elder, means a proceeding in which a party sought or seeks a judgment or order from the court to: 1.
