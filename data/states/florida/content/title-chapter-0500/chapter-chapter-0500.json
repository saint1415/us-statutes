      "text": "500.11 Food deemed misbranded.— (1) A food is deemed to be misbranded: (a) If its labeling is false or misleading in any particular; however, corn meal shall not be considered misbranded because of its being labeled “Water Ground,” where such corn meal so labeled has been ground on rocks having a diameter of not less than 42 inches and which revolve during the grinding of same at a speed not greater than 186 revolutions per minute. (b) If it is offered for sale under the name of another food. (c) If it is an imitation of another food, unless its label bears, in type of uniform size and prominence, the words “imitation” and, immediately thereafter, the name of the food imitated. (d) If its container is so made, formed, or filled as to be misleading. (e) If in package form, unless it bears a label containing: 1. The name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor; 2. An accurate statement of the quantity of the contents in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count; however, under this subparagraph reasonable variations shall be permitted, and exemptions as to small packages shall be established, by regulations prescribed by the department. (f) If any word, statement, or other information required by or under authority of this chapter to appear on the label or labeling is not prominently placed thereon with such conspicuousness, as compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices, in the labeling, and in such terms as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use. (g) If it purports to be or is represented as a food for which a definition and standard of identity has been prescribed by statute or by rules as provided by s. 500.09, unless: 1. It conforms to such definition and standard; and 2. Its label bears the name of the food specified in the definition and standard and, insofar as may be required by such rules, the common names of optional ingredients (other than spices, flavoring, and coloring) present in such food. (h) If it purports to be or is represented as: 1. A food for which a standard of quality has been prescribed by rules as provided by s. 500.09 and its quality falls below such standard unless its label bears, in such manner and form as such rules specify, a statement that it falls below such standard; or 2. A food for which a standard or standards of fill of container have been prescribed by rule as provided by s. 500.09 and it falls below the standard of fill of container applicable thereto, unless its label bears, in such manner and form as such rules specify, a statement that it falls below such standard. (i) Unless its label bears: 1. The common or usual name of the food, if any; and 2. If it is fabricated from two or more ingredients, the common or usual name of each ingredient and, if the food purports to be a beverage containing vegetable or fruit juice, a statement placed with appropriate prominence on the information panel specifying the total percentage of such vegetable or fruit juice contained in the food; except that spices, flavorings, and color additives not required to be certified under 21 U.S.C. s. 379(e), other than those sold as such, may be designated as spices, flavorings, and color additives, without naming each; provided, that, to the extent that compliance with this paragraph is impractical or results in deception or unfair competition, exemptions shall be established by rules adopted by the department. (j) If it purports to be or is represented for special dietary uses, unless its label bears such information concerning its vitamin, mineral, and other dietary properties as the department determines to be, and by regulations prescribes as, necessary in order to fully inform purchasers as to its value for such uses. (k) If it bears or contains any artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservative, unless it bears labeling stating that fact; provided that, to the extent that compliance with the requirements of this paragraph is impracticable, exemptions shall be established by regulations promulgated by the department. (l) If it is a fresh fruit or vegetable or a package of honey or bee pollen not labeled in accordance with the provisions of s. 504.012 or not otherwise labeled in such a manner as to indicate to an ultimate purchaser the country of origin. (m) If it is offered for sale and its label or labeling does not comply with the requirements of 21 U.S.C. s. 343(q) or (w) pertaining to nutrition or allergen information. (n) If it is offered for sale and its label or labeling does not comply with the requirements of 21 U.S.C. s. 343(r) pertaining to nutritional content claims and health claims. (o) If it is bottled water and its label bears a corporate name, brand name, or trademark containing the word “spring,” “springs,” “well,” “artesian well,” “natural,” or any derivative of those words without stating on the label the source of the water in typeface at least equal to the size of the typeface of the corporate name, brand name, or trademark, if the source of the water is different from the source indicated in the corporate name, brand name, or trademark. (p) If it is an animal product that fails to have directly thereon or on its container the official inspection legend as required by the United States Department of Agriculture and, unrestricted by any other provision of this section, such other information as the department requires to ensure that it shall not have false or misleading labeling and that the public is informed of the manner of handling required to maintain the product in a wholesome condition. (2) When soft drinks are offered for sale in sanitary returnable or nonreturnable containers, sealed or securely capped, impervious to contamination by leakage or contact with foreign substances, and when the trade name, net content, and declaration of artificial flavor or color, when used, appear on the principal display panel, which may be the cap, crown, lid, or side of the container of such drinks, and when the manufacturer, at least once every year and oftener when required by the department, files with the department an affidavit stating the trade names of such drinks manufactured by him or her and the territorial limits in the state within which such drinks are offered for sale, the provisions of this chapter requiring additional labeling and branding of such drinks do not apply. However, nothing in this subsection shall in any manner otherwise restrict, modify, or impair the jurisdiction and authority of the department over such drinks as food products and the conditions pertaining to the manufacture of same.

Such bottles must contain a label listing the producer’s name and street address, all added ingredients, the net weight or volume of the product, and a statement that reads, “This product has not been produced in a facility permitted by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.” (b) Each food establishment regulated under this chapter must apply for and receive a food permit before operation begins. An application for a food permit from the department must be accompanied by a fee in an amount determined by department rule. The department shall adopt by rule a schedule of fees to be paid by each food establishment as a condition of issuance or renewal of a food permit. Such fees may not exceed $650 and must be used solely for the recovery of costs for the services provided, except that the fee accompanying an application for a food permit for operating a bottled water plant may not exceed $1,000 and the fee accompanying an application for a food permit for operating a packaged ice plant may not exceed $250. The fee for operating a bottled water plant or a packaged ice plant must be set by rule of the department. Food permits are not transferable from one person or physical location to another. Food permits must be renewed in accordance with subparagraphs 1.-3. If an application for renewal of a food permit is not received by the department on or before its due date, a late fee not exceeding $100 must be paid in addition to the food permit fee before the department may issue the food permit. The moneys collected must be deposited in the General Inspection Trust Fund. 1. A food permit issued to a new food establishment is valid for 1 calendar year after the date of issuance and must be renewed annually on or before that date thereafter. 2. A food permit issued before September 1, 2023, expires on the month and day the initial permit was issued to the food establishment and must be renewed annually on or before that date thereafter. The department may charge a prorated permit fee for purposes of this subparagraph. 3. The department may establish a single permit renewal date for multiple food establishments owned by the same entity. (c) For bottled water plants: 1. Water that is transported into the state and that is bottled before or after importation into the state must be bottled, labeled, handled, and otherwise processed and sold according to the provisions of this chapter. 2. An application for a food permit for operating a bottled water plant must state the location of the bottled water plant, the source of the water, and any other information considered necessary by the department to verify compliance with the safety, quality, and labeling requirements of this chapter. (d) For packaged ice plants: 1. Packaged ice that is transported into the state and that is packaged before or after importation into the state must be packaged, labeled, handled, and otherwise processed and sold according to the provisions of this chapter. 2. An application for a food permit for operating a packaged ice plant must state the location of the packaged ice plant, the source of the water, the treatment the water received prior to being made into ice and packaged, and any other information considered necessary by the department to verify compliance with the safety, quality, and labeling requirements of this chapter. (e) The department is the exclusive regulatory and permitting authority for all food establishments and minor food outlets in accordance with this section. Application for a food permit must be made on forms provided by the department, which forms must also contain provision for application for registrations and permits issued by other state agencies and for collection of the food permit fee and any other fees associated with registration, licensing, or applicable surcharges. The details of the application must be prescribed by department rule. (f) The department may by rule establish conditions for the manufacturing, processing, packing, holding, or preparing of food; the selling of food at wholesale or retail; or the transporting of food to protect the public health and promote public welfare by protecting the purchasing public from injury by merchandising deceit. (2) When any person applies for a building permit to construct, convert, or remodel any food establishment, the authority issuing such permit shall make available to the applicant a printed statement, provided by the department, regarding the applicable sanitation requirements for such establishments. A building permitting authority, or municipality or county under whose jurisdiction a building permitting authority operates, may not be held liable for a food establishment that does not comply with the applicable sanitation requirements due to failure of the building permitting authority to provide the information as provided in this subsection. (a) The department shall furnish, for distribution, a statement that includes the checklist to be used by the food inspector in any preoperational inspections to assure that the food establishment is constructed and equipped to meet the applicable sanitary guidelines. Such preoperational inspection is a prerequisite for obtaining a food permit in accordance with this section. (b) The department may provide assistance, when requested by the applicant, in the review of any construction or remodeling plans for food establishments. The department may charge a fee for such assistance which covers the cost of providing the assistance and which must be deposited in the General Inspection Trust Fund for use in funding the food safety program. (c) A building permitting authority or other subdivision of local government may not require the department to approve construction or remodeling plans for food establishments as a condition of any permit or license at the local level. (3) Any person selling or distributing for sale any candy containing more than 0.5 percent but less than 5 percent by volume of alcohol must apply for a food permit pursuant to subsection (1) and disclose to the department any intent to sell or distribute such candy. If the person already holds a permit, written disclosure of intent to sell or distribute such candy shall be provided to the department, and the person shall comply with all rules adopted by the department relating to such candy. If the product is sold by a person licensed under chapter 565, the Department of Business and Professional Regulation shall inspect, sample, and verify compliance with this chapter. The Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and the Department of Business and Professional Regulation shall enter into a cooperative agreement relative to the enforcement of this chapter, including delegation of authority under ss. 500.173-500.175 relating to seizure and condemnation of adulterated or misbranded products. (4)(a) The department may suspend immediately upon notice any permit issued under this section if it finds that any of the conditions of the permit have been violated. The holder of a permit so suspended may at any time apply for the reinstatement of such permit; and the department shall, immediately after prompt hearing and an inspection of the establishment, reinstate such permit if the department finds that adequate measures have been taken to comply with and maintain the conditions of the permit, as originally issued, or as amended. (b) The department shall have access to any food establishment for the purpose of ascertaining compliance with this section. Denial of access for such inspection is a ground for suspending the permit until access to the food establishment is freely given by the operator. (5) It is the intent of the Legislature to eliminate duplication of regulatory inspections of food. Regulatory and permitting authority over any food establishment is preempted to the department, except as provided in chapter 379. (a) Food establishments that have ancillary food service activities shall be permitted and inspected by the department. (b) Food service establishments, as defined in s. 381.0072, that have ancillary, prepackaged retail food sales shall be regulated by the Department of Health. (c) Public food service establishments, as defined in s. 509.013, which have ancillary, prepackaged retail food sales shall be licensed and inspected by the Department of Business and Professional Regulation. (d) The department and the Department of Business and Professional Regulation shall cooperate to assure equivalency of inspection and enforcement and to share information on those establishments identified in paragraphs (a) and (c) and to address any other areas of potential duplication. The department and the Department of Business and Professional Regulation are authorized to adopt rules to enforce statutory requirements under their purview regarding foods. (6) The department shall adopt rules for the training and certification of managers of food establishments and food service establishments regulated under this section and for the training and certification of department personnel. (7) In conducting any preoperational or other inspection, the department may enforce provisions of the Florida Building Code relating to food establishments. (8) A person who applies for or renews a local business tax certificate to engage in business as a food establishment must exhibit a current food permit or an active letter of exemption from the department before the local business tax certificate may be issued or renewed.

      "text": "500.121 Disciplinary procedures.— (1) In addition to the suspension procedures provided in s. 500.12, if applicable, the department may impose an administrative fine in the Class II category pursuant to s. 570.971 against any food establishment or cottage food operation that violates this chapter, which fine, when imposed and paid, must be deposited by the department into the General Inspection Trust Fund. The department may revoke or suspend the permit of any such food establishment if it is satisfied that the food establishment has: (a) Violated this chapter. (b) Violated or aided or abetted in the violation of any law of this state governing or applicable to food establishments or any lawful rules of the department. (c) Knowingly committed, or been a party to, any material fraud, misrepresentation, conspiracy, collusion, trick, scheme, or device whereby another person, lawfully relying upon the word, representation, or conduct of a food establishment, acts to her or his injury or damage. (d) Committed any act or conduct of the same or different character than that enumerated which constitutes fraudulent or dishonest dealing. (2) A manufacturer, processor, packer, or distributor who misrepresents or mislabels the country of origin of any food may, in addition to any penalty provided in this chapter, be subject to an additional administrative fine in the Class II category pursuant to s. 570.971 for each violation. (3) Any administrative order made and entered by the department imposing a fine pursuant to this section shall specify the amount of the fine and the time limit for payment thereof, not exceeding 21 days, and, upon failure of the permitholder to pay the fine within that time, the permit is subject to suspension or revocation. (4) In any court proceeding relating to administrative orders, the burden of proving violations of this chapter and of upholding administrative orders is with the department. (5) The department shall post a prominent closed-for-operation sign on any food establishment that has had its permit suspended or revoked. The department shall also post such a sign on any establishment judicially or administratively determined to be operating without a permit. It is a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083, for any person to deface or remove such closed-for-operation sign or for any food establishment to open for operation without a permit or to open for operation while its permit is suspended or revoked. The department may impose administrative sanctions for violations of this subsection. (6) If the department determines that a food offered in a food establishment is labeled with nutrient claims that are in violation of this chapter, the department shall retest or reexamine the product within 90 days after notification to the manufacturer and to the firm at which the product was collected. If the product is again found in violation, the department shall test or examine the product for a third time within 60 days after the second notification. The product manufacturer shall reimburse the department for the cost of the third test or examination. If the product is found in violation for a third time, the department shall exercise its authority under s. 500.172 and issue a stop-sale or stop-use order. The department may impose additional sanctions for violations of this subsection. (7) The department may determine that a food establishment regulated under this chapter requires immediate closure when the food establishment fails to comply with this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter and presents an imminent threat to the public health, safety, and welfare. The department may accept inspection results from other state and local building officials and other regulatory agencies as justification for such action. The department shall, upon such a determination, issue an immediate final order to close a food establishment as follows: (a) The division director or designee shall determine that the continued operation of a food establishment presents an immediate danger to the public health, safety, and welfare. (b) Upon such determination, the department shall issue an immediate final order directing the owner or operator of the food establishment to cease operation and close the food establishment. The department shall serve the order upon the owner, operator, or agent thereof of the food establishment. The department may attach a closed-for-operation sign to the food establishment while the order remains in place. (c) The department shall inspect the food establishment within 24 hours after the issuance of the order. Upon a determination that the food establishment has met the applicable requirements to resume operations, the department shall serve a release upon the owner, operator, or agent thereof of the food establishment. (d) A food establishment ordered by the department to cease operation and close under this section shall remain closed until released by the department or by a judicial order to reopen. (e) It is a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083, for a person to deface or remove a closed-for-operation sign placed on a food establishment by the department or for the owner or operator of a food establishment to resist closure of the establishment by the department. The department may impose administrative sanctions for violations of this paragraph. (f) The department may adopt rules to administer this subsection.

While such regulation relating to such substance is in effect, a food shall not, by reason of bearing or containing such substance in accordance with the regulation, be considered adulterated within the meaning of s. 500.10(1)(a). (2) The department, whenever public interest in the state so requires, is authorized to adopt, amend, or repeal regulations whether or not in accordance with regulations promulgated under the federal act, prescribing therein tolerances for any added poisonous or deleterious substances, for food additives, for pesticide chemicals in or on raw agricultural commodities or for color additives, including, but not limited to, zero tolerances, and exemptions from tolerances in the case of pesticide chemicals in or on raw agricultural commodities, and prescribing the conditions under which a food additive or color additive may be safely used and exemptions where such food additive or color additive is to be used solely for investigational or experimental purposes, upon his or her own motion or upon the petition of any interested party requesting that such a regulation be established, and it shall be incumbent upon such petitioner to establish by data submitted to the department that a necessity exists for such regulation, and that its effect will not be detrimental to the public health. If the data furnished by the petitioner is not sufficient to allow the department to determine whether such regulation should be promulgated, the department may require additional data to be submitted and a failure to comply with the request shall be sufficient grounds to deny the request. In adopting, amending or repealing regulations relating to such substances the department shall consider among other relevant factors, the following which the petitioner, if any, shall furnish: (a) The name and all pertinent information concerning such substance including where available, its chemical identity and composition, a statement of the conditions of the proposed use, including directions, recommendations and suggestions and including specimens of proposed labeling, all relevant data bearing on the physical or other technical effect and the quantity required to produce such effect.

(c) The probable consumption of such substance in the diet of humans and animals taking into account any chemically or pharmacologically related substance in such diet. (d) Safety factors which, in the opinion of experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of such substances for the use or uses for which they are proposed to be used, are generally recognized as appropriate for the use of animal experimentation data. (e) The availability of any needed practicable methods of analysis for determining the identity and quantity of such substance in or on an article, any substance formed in or on such article because of the use of such substance, and the pure substance and all intermediates and impurities. (f) Facts supporting a contention that the proposed use of such substance will serve a useful purpose.

(2) DEFINITIONS.— (a) “Sanitized” means treated in conformity with 21 C.F.R. s. 110.3 (1996). (b) “Vended water” means water dispensed by means of a water vending machine. (c) “Water vending machine” means a self-service device that, upon insertion of a coin or token or upon receipt of payment by other means, dispenses a serving of water into a container. (d) “Water vending machine operator” means a person who owns, leases, or manages, or is otherwise responsible for, the operation of a water vending machine. (3) PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS.— (a) Each person or public body that establishes, maintains, or operates any water vending machine in the state must secure an operating permit from the department each year. (b) An application for an operating permit must be made to the department on forms provided by the department and must be accompanied by a fee as provided in subsection (4). The application must state the location of each water vending machine, the source of the water to be vended, the treatment the water will receive prior to being vended, and any other information considered necessary by the department. (4) FEES.—A person seeking an operating permit must pay the department a fee not exceeding $200, which fee shall be set by rule of the department. Such fees shall be deposited in the General Inspection Trust Fund. (5) OPERATING STANDARDS.— (a) A water vending machine operator must obtain a permit prior to operating any water vending machine. (b) Each water vending machine must be located indoors or otherwise protected against tampering and vandalism and must be located in an area that can be maintained in a clean condition and in a manner that avoids insect and rodent harborage. The floor upon which the water vending machine is located should be smooth and of cleanable construction. (c) The source of water supply must be an approved public water system. (d) Each water vending machine must have a backflow prevention device that conforms with the applicable provision of the Florida Building Code and an adequate system for collecting and handling dripping, spillage, and overflow of water. (e) All parts and surfaces of a water vending machine with which water comes into contact must be made of nontoxic, corrosion-resistant, nonabsorbent material capable of withstanding repeated cleaning and sanitizing treatments. (f) Each water vending machine must be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition, free from rust, dirt, and vermin. (g) The vended water must receive treatment and postdisinfection according to approved methods established by rule of the department. Activated carbon, if used, must comply with specifications for granular activated carbon used in water treatment applications as established by rule of the department. (h) The vended water may not be described as “purified water” unless the water conforms to the definition of that term. Further, a water vending machine operator must not claim that the vended water has medicinal or health-giving properties and must not describe any vended water as “spring water.” (i) The operator shall place on each water vending machine, in a position clearly visible to customers, the following information: the name and address of the operator; the fact that the water is obtained from a public water supply; the method of treatment used; the method of postdisinfection used; and a local or toll-free telephone number that may be called for obtaining further information, reporting problems, or making complaints. (6) DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT.— (a) The department has authority to adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 to implement the provisions of this section conferring duties upon it. (b) If, considering the source of water and the treatment process provided by the water vending machine, the department finds that the vended water will not meet the primary and secondary drinking water quality standards as provided for in department rules, the permit shall be denied. Specific technical reasons for the denial shall be given by the department. (c) The water from each water vending machine shall be sampled and tested for compliance with the water quality standards established by rule of the department at regular intervals established by rule of the department. (d) The vended water from each water vending machine using silver-impregnated carbon filters in the treatment process shall be sampled for silver at regular intervals established by rule of the department. (e) The department shall order a water vending machine operator to discontinue the operation of any water vending machine the condition of which represents a threat to the life or health of any person, or when the vended water does not meet the standards provided in this section. Such water vending machine must not be returned to use or be used until the department determines that the condition that caused the discontinuance of operation no longer exists. (7) PENALTIES.— (a) The department may deny, suspend, or revoke a permit if it finds that there has been a substantial failure to comply with this section or rules adopted under this section. (b) Any person who operates a water vending machine without first obtaining an operating permit as required by subsection (3), who operates a water vending machine in violation of an order to discontinue operation, or who maintains or operates a water vending machine after revocation of the operating permit is guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.

(b) For purposes of this subsection, a cottage food operation’s annual gross sales include all sales of cottage food products at any location, regardless of the types of products sold or the number of persons involved in the operation. A cottage food operation must provide the department, upon request, with written documentation to verify the operation’s annual gross sales. (2) A cottage food operation may sell, offer for sale, and accept payment for cottage food products over the Internet or by mail order. Such products may be delivered in person directly to the consumer, to a specific event venue, or by United States Postal Service or commercial mail delivery service. A cottage food operation may not sell, offer for sale, or deliver cottage food products at wholesale. (3) A cottage food operation may only sell cottage food products which are prepackaged with a label affixed that contains the following information: (a) The name and address of the cottage food operation. (b) The name of the cottage food product. (c) The ingredients of the cottage food product, in descending order of predominance by weight. (d) The net weight or net volume of the cottage food product.

(5) This section does not exempt a cottage food operation from any state or federal tax law, rule, regulation, or certificate that applies to all cottage food operations. (6) The regulation of cottage food operations is preempted to the state. A local law, ordinance, or regulation may not prohibit a cottage food operation or regulate the preparation, processing, storage, or sale of cottage food products by a cottage food operation; however, a cottage food operation must comply with the conditions for the operation of a home-based business under s. 559.955. (7)(a) The department may investigate any complaint which alleges that a cottage food operation has violated an applicable provision of this chapter or rule adopted under this chapter. (b) Only upon receipt of a complaint, the department’s authorized officer or employee may enter and inspect the premises of a cottage food operation to determine compliance with this chapter and department rules, as applicable. A cottage food operation’s refusal to permit the department’s authorized officer or employee entry to the premises or to conduct the inspection is grounds for disciplinary action pursuant to s. 500.121.

      "text": "500.81 Healthy Food Financing Initiative.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Community facility” means a property owned by a nonprofit or for-profit entity in which health and human services are provided and space is offered in a manner that provides increased access to, or delivery or distribution of, food or other agricultural products to encourage public consumption and household purchases of fresh produce or other healthy food to improve the public health and well-being of low-income children, families, and older adults. (b) “Department” means the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. (c) “Independent grocery store or supermarket” means an independently owned grocery store or supermarket whose parent company does not own more than 40 grocery stores throughout the country based upon ownership conditions as identified in the latest Nielsen TDLinx Supermarket/Supercenter database. (d) “Low-income community” means a population census tract, as reported in the most recent United States Census Bureau American Community Survey, which meets one of the following criteria: 1. The poverty rate is at least 20 percent; 2. In the case of a low-income community located outside of a metropolitan area, the median family income does not exceed 80 percent of the statewide median family income; or 3. In the case of a low-income community located inside of a metropolitan area, the median family income does not exceed 80 percent of the statewide median family income or 80 percent of the metropolitan median family income, whichever is greater. (e) “Program” means the Healthy Food Financing Initiative established by the department. (f) “Underserved community” means a distressed urban, suburban, or rural geographic area where a substantial number of residents have low access to a full-service supermarket or grocery store. An area with limited supermarket access must be: 1. A census tract, as determined to be an area with low access by the United States Department of Agriculture, as identified in the Food Access Research Atlas; 2. Identified as a limited supermarket access area as recognized by the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund of the United States Department of the Treasury; or 3. Identified as an area with low access to a supermarket or grocery store through a methodology that has been adopted for use by another governmental initiative, or well-established or well-regarded philanthropic healthy food initiative. (2) The department shall establish a Healthy Food Financing Initiative program that is composed of and coordinates the use of grants from any source; federal, state, and private loans from a governmental entity or institutions regulated by a governmental entity; federal tax credits; and other types of financial assistance for the rehabilitation or expansion of independent grocery stores, supermarkets, community facilities, or other structures to increase access to fresh produce and other nutritious food in underserved communities. (3)(a) The department may contract with one or more qualified nonprofit organizations or Florida-based federally certified community development financial institutions to administer the program through a public-private partnership. Eligible community development financial institutions must be able to demonstrate: 1. Prior experience in healthy food financing. 2. Support from the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund of the United States Department of the Treasury. 3. The ability to successfully manage and operate lending and tax credit programs. 4. The ability to assume full financial risk for loans made under this initiative. (b) The department shall: 1. Establish program guidelines, raise matching funds, promote the program statewide, evaluate applicants, underwrite and disburse grants and loans, and monitor compliance and impact. The department may contract with a third-party administrator to carry out such duties. If the department contracts with a third-party administrator, funds shall be granted to the third-party administrator to create a revolving loan fund for the purpose of financing projects that meet the criteria of the program. The third-party administrator shall report to the department annually. 2. Create eligibility guidelines and provide financing through an application process. Eligible projects must: a. Be located in an underserved community; b. Primarily serve low-income communities; and c. Provide for the renovation or expansion of, including infrastructure upgrades to, existing independent grocery stores or supermarkets; or the renovation or expansion of, including infrastructure upgrades to, community facilities to improve the availability and quality of fresh produce and other healthy foods. 3. Report annually to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives on the projects funded, the geographic distribution of the projects, the costs of the program, and the outcomes, including the number and type of jobs created. (4)(a) The Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability shall review the program and data collected from the department after a term of 7 years and report to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The report shall include, but is not limited to, health impacts based on data collected by the state on diabetes, heart disease and other obesity-related diseases, and other factors as determined by the department. (b) If the report determines the program to be unsuccessful after 7 years, the department shall create guidelines for unused funds to be returned to the initial investor. (5) A for-profit entity, including a convenience store or a fueling station, or a not-for-profit entity, including, but not limited to, a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, cooperative, nonprofit organization, nonprofit community development entity, or private university, may apply for financing. An applicant for financing must: (a) Demonstrate the capacity to successfully implement the project and the likelihood that the project will be economically self-sustaining; (b) Demonstrate the ability to repay the loan; and (c) Agree, as an independent grocery store or supermarket, for at least 5 years, to: 1. Accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits; 2. Apply to accept Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children benefits and accept such benefits, if approved; 3. Allocate at least 30 percent of food retail space for the sale of perishable foods, which may include fresh or frozen dairy products, fresh produce, and fresh meats, poultry, and fish; 4. Comply with all data collection and reporting requirements established by the department; and 5. Promote the hiring of local residents. Projects including, but not limited to, corner stores, bodegas, or other types of nontraditional grocery stores that do not meet the 30 percent minimum in subparagraph 3. can still qualify for funding if such funding will be used for refrigeration, displays, or other one-time capital expenditures to promote the sale of fresh produce and other healthy foods. (6) In determining which qualified projects to finance, the department or third-party administrator shall: (a) Give preference to local Florida-based grocers or local business owners with experience in grocery stores and to grocers and business owners with a business plan model that includes written documentation of opportunities to purchase from Florida farmers and growers before seeking out-of-state purchases; (b) Consider the level of need in the area to be served; (c) Consider the degree to which the project will have a positive economic impact on the underserved community, including the creation or retention of jobs for local residents; (d) Consider the location of existing independent grocery stores, supermarkets, or other markets relevant to the applicant’s project and provide the established entity the right of first refusal for such project; and (e) Consider other criteria as determined by the department. (7) Financing for projects may be used for the following purposes: (a) Site acquisition and preparation. (b) Construction and build-out costs. (c) Equipment and furnishings. (d) Workforce training or security. (e) Predevelopment costs, such as market studies and appraisals. (f) Energy efficiency measures. (g) Working capital for first-time inventory and startup costs.
