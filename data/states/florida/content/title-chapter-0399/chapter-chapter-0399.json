The municipality or county may choose to require inspections be performed by its own inspectors or by private certified elevator inspectors. The municipality or county may assess a reasonable fee for inspections performed by its inspectors. Each agreement shall include a provision that the municipality or county shall maintain for inspection by the department copies of all applications for permits issued, a copy of each inspection report issued, and proper records showing the number of certificates of operation issued; shall include a provision that each required inspection be conducted by a certified elevator inspector; and may include other provisions as the department deems necessary. The county shall enforce the Florida Building Code as it applies to this chapter and may impose fees and assess and collect fines as part of its enforcement activities. A county or municipality may not issue or take disciplinary action against a certificate of competency, an elevator inspector certification, an elevator technician certification, or an elevator company registration. However, the department may initiate disciplinary action against a registration or certification at the request of a county or municipality. (2) The department may make inspections of elevators in the municipality or county for the purpose of determining that the provisions of this chapter are being met and may cancel the contract with any municipality or county that the department finds has failed to comply with the contract or this chapter. The amendments to chapter 399 by this act shall apply only to the installation, relocation, or alteration of an elevator for which a permit has been issued after October 1, 1990.

      "text": "399.15 Regional emergency elevator access.— (1) In order to provide emergency access to elevators: (a) For each building in this state which is six or more stories in height, including, but not limited to, hotels and condominiums, on which a building permit is issued after September 30, 2006, all of the keys for elevators that allow public access, including, but not limited to, service and freight elevators, must be keyed so as to allow all elevators within each of the seven state emergency response regions to operate in fire emergency situations with one master elevator key. (b) Any building in this state which is six or more stories in height and has undergone “substantial improvement” as defined in s. 161.54(12) must also comply with paragraph (a). (2) Each existing building in this state which is six or more stories in height must comply with subsection (1) before October 1, 2009. (3) In addition to elevator owners, owners’ agents, elevator contractors, state-certified inspectors, and state agency representatives, master elevator keys may be issued only to the fire department and may not be issued to any other emergency response agency. A person may not duplicate a master elevator key for issuance to, or issue such a key to, anyone other than authorized fire department personnel. Each master elevator key must be marked “DO NOT DUPLICATE.” (4) If it is technically, financially, or physically impossible to bring a building into compliance with this section, the local fire marshal may allow substitute emergency measures that will provide reasonable emergency elevator access. The local fire marshal’s decision regarding substitute measures may be appealed to the State Fire Marshal. (5) The Division of State Fire Marshal of the Department of Financial Services shall enforce this section. Any person who fails to comply with the requirements of this section is subject to an administrative fine of not more than $1,000, in addition to any other penalty provided by law. All administrative fines shall be deposited into the Insurance Regulatory Trust Fund. (6) Builders should make every effort to use new technology and developments in keying systems which make it possible to convert existing equipment so as to provide efficient regional emergency elevator access. (7) As an alternative to complying with the requirements of subsection (1), each building in this state which is required to meet the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) may instead provide for the installation of a uniform lock box that contains the keys to all elevators in the building allowing public access, including service and freight elevators. The uniform lock box must be keyed to allow all uniform lock boxes in each of the seven state emergency response regions to operate in fire emergency situations using one master key. The master key for the uniform lock shall be issued in accordance with subsection (3). The Division of State Fire Marshal of the Department of Financial Services shall enforce this subsection. (8) The Department of Financial Services shall adopt rules to implement this section, including rules to determine the master elevator key to be used within each of the emergency response regions.
