      "text": "1008.02 Definitions.—As used in this chapter, the term: (1) “Developmental education” means instruction through which a high school graduate who applies for any college credit program may attain the communication and computation skills necessary to successfully complete college credit instruction. Developmental education may be delivered through a variety of accelerated and corequisite strategies and includes any of the following: (a) Modularized instruction that is customized and targeted to address specific skills gaps. (b) Compressed course structures that accelerate student progression from developmental instruction to college-level coursework. (c) Contextualized developmental instruction that is related to meta-majors. (d) Corequisite developmental instruction or tutoring that supplements credit instruction while a student is concurrently enrolled in a credit-bearing course. (2) “Gateway course” means the first course that provides transferable, college-level credit allowing a student to progress in his or her program of study. (3) “Meta-major” means a collection of programs of study or academic discipline groupings that share common foundational skills. History.—s. 18, ch. 2013-51.
