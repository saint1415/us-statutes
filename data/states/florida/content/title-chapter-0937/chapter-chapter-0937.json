      "text": "937.0205 Purple Alert.— (1) The Legislature finds that a standardized state system is necessary to aid in the search for a missing adult identified in subsection (4). The Legislature also finds that a coordinated local law enforcement and state agency response with prompt and widespread sharing of information will improve the chances of finding the person. (2) It is the intent of the Legislature to establish the Purple Alert, to be implemented in a manner that, to the extent practicable, safeguards the privacy rights and related health and diagnostic information of such missing adults. (3) The Department of Law Enforcement, in cooperation with the Department of Transportation, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the Department of the Lottery, and local law enforcement agencies, shall establish and implement the Purple Alert. At a minimum, the Purple Alert must: (a) Be the only viable means by which the missing adult is likely to be returned to safety; (b) Provide, to the greatest extent possible, for the protection of the privacy, dignity, and independence of the missing adult by including standards aimed at safeguarding these civil liberties by preventing the inadvertent or unnecessary broadcasting or dissemination of sensitive health and diagnostic information; (c) Limit the broadcasting and dissemination of alerts and related information to the geographic areas where the missing adult could reasonably be, considering his or her circumstances and physical and mental condition, the potential modes of transportation available to him or her or suspected to be involved, and the known or suspected circumstances of his or her disappearance; and (d) Be activated only when there is sufficient descriptive information about the missing adult and the circumstances surrounding his or her disappearance to indicate that activating the alert is likely to help locate the missing adult. (4) Under a Purple Alert, a missing adult is deemed to be an adult: (a) Who has a mental or cognitive disability that is not Alzheimer’s disease or a dementia-related disorder; an intellectual disability or a developmental disability, as those terms are defined in s. 393.063; a brain injury; another physical, mental, or emotional disability that is not related to substance abuse; or a combination of any of these; (b) Whose disappearance indicates a credible threat of immediate danger or serious bodily harm to himself or herself, as determined by the local law enforcement agency; (c) Who cannot be returned to safety without law enforcement intervention; and (d) Who does not meet the criteria for activation of a local Silver Alert or the Silver Alert Plan of the Department of Law Enforcement. (5) For a missing adult on foot or in an unidentified vehicle, local law enforcement agencies shall develop their own policies for activation of a local Purple Alert that meets the requirements set forth in s. 937.021 and shall: (a) Contact media outlets in the affected area or surrounding jurisdictions; (b) Inform all on-duty law enforcement officers of the missing adult report; and (c) Communicate the report to any other law enforcement agency in the county of jurisdiction. (6) A state Purple Alert may be requested from the Department of Law Enforcement’s Missing Endangered Persons Information Clearinghouse when the investigation indicates that there is a motor vehicle with an identified license plate or other vehicle information. The clearinghouse shall: (a) Coordinate with the Department of Transportation and the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles for the activation of dynamic message signs on state highways and the immediate distribution of critical information to the public regarding the missing adult in accordance with the alert; (b) Coordinate with the Department of the Lottery to have the state Purple Alert broadcast on lottery terminals, including, but not limited to, lottery terminals in gas stations, convenience stores, and supermarkets; and (c) Notify subscribers. (7) If a local or state Purple Alert is determined to be necessary and appropriate, the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction may also request that a case be opened with the Department of Law Enforcement’s Missing Endangered Persons Information Clearinghouse. (8) The state Purple Alert process must include procedures to monitor the use, activation, and results of alerts and a strategy for informing and educating law enforcement, the media, and other stakeholders concerning the alert. (9) The Department of Law Enforcement may adopt rules to implement and administer this section. History.—s. 3, ch. 2021-93; s. 1, ch. 2024-82.

      "text": "937.021 Missing child and missing adult reports.— (1) Law enforcement agencies in this state shall adopt written policies that specify the procedures to be used to investigate reports of missing children and missing adults. The policies must ensure that cases involving missing children and adults are investigated promptly using appropriate resources. The policies must include: (a) Requirements for accepting missing child and missing adult reports; (b) Procedures for initiating, maintaining, closing, or referring a missing child or missing adult investigation; and (c) Standards for maintaining and clearing computer data of information concerning a missing child or missing adult which is stored in the Florida Crime Information Center, the National Crime Information Center, and the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System. The standards must require, at a minimum, a monthly review of each case entered into the Florida Crime Information Center and the National Crime Information Center, an annual review of each case entered into the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, and a determination of whether the case should be maintained in the databases. (2) An entry concerning a missing child or missing adult may not be removed from the Florida Crime Information Center, the National Crime Information Center, or the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System databases based solely on the age of the missing child or missing adult. (3) A report that a child or adult is missing must be accepted by and filed with the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction in the county or municipality in which the child or adult was last seen. The filing and acceptance of the report imposes the duties specified in this section upon the law enforcement agency receiving the report. This subsection does not preclude a law enforcement agency from accepting a missing child or missing adult report when agency jurisdiction cannot be determined. (4)(a) Upon the filing of a police report that a child is missing by the parent or guardian, the Department of Children and Families, or a community-based care provider, the law enforcement agency receiving the report shall immediately inform all on-duty law enforcement officers of the missing child report, communicate the report to every other law enforcement agency having jurisdiction in the county, and within 2 hours after receipt of the report, transmit the report for inclusion within the Florida Crime Information Center and the National Crime Information Center databases, and shall, within 90 days after receipt of the report, transmit the report to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System. A law enforcement agency may not require a reporter to present an order that a child be taken into custody or any other such order before accepting a report that a child is missing. (b) Upon the filing of a credible police report that an adult is missing, the law enforcement agency receiving the report shall, within 2 hours after receipt of the report, transmit the report for inclusion within the Florida Crime Information Center and the National Crime Information Center databases, and shall, within 90 days after receipt of the report, transmit the report to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System. (5)(a) Upon receiving a request to record, report, transmit, display, or release Amber Alert or Missing Child Alert information from the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the missing child, the Department of Law Enforcement as the state Amber Alert coordinator, any state or local law enforcement agency, and the personnel of these agencies; any radio or television network, broadcaster, or other media representative; any dealer of communications services as defined in s. 202.11; or any agency, employee, individual, or entity is immune from civil liability for damages for complying in good faith with the request and is presumed to have acted in good faith in recording, reporting, transmitting, displaying, or releasing Amber Alert or Missing Child Alert information pertaining to the child. (b) Upon receiving a request to record, report, transmit, display, or release information and photographs pertaining to a missing adult or missing child from the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the missing adult or missing child, the department, a state or local law enforcement agency, and the personnel of these agencies; any radio or television network, broadcaster, or other media representative; any dealer of communications services as defined in s. 202.11; or any agency, employee, individual, or person is immune from civil liability for damages for complying in good faith with the request to provide information and is presumed to have acted in good faith in recording, reporting, transmitting, displaying, or releasing information or photographs pertaining to the missing adult or missing child. (c) Upon receiving a request to record, report, transmit, display, or release Silver Alert or Purple Alert information from the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the missing adult, the Department of Law Enforcement as the state Silver Alert and Purple Alert coordinator, any state or local law enforcement agency, and the personnel of these agencies; any radio or television network, broadcaster, or other media representative; any dealer of communications services as defined in s. 202.11; or any agency, employee, individual, or entity is immune from civil liability for damages for complying in good faith with the request and is presumed to have acted in good faith in recording, reporting, transmitting, displaying, or releasing Silver Alert or Purple Alert information pertaining to the missing adult. (d) The presumption of good faith is not overcome if a technical or clerical error is made by any agency, employee, individual, or entity acting at the request of the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction, or if the Amber Alert, Missing Child Alert, missing child information, missing adult information, or Silver Alert or Purple Alert information is incomplete or incorrect because the information received from the local law enforcement agency was incomplete or incorrect. (e) Neither this subsection nor any other law creates a duty of the agency, employee, individual, or entity to record, report, transmit, display, or release the Amber Alert, Missing Child Alert, missing child information, missing adult information, or Silver Alert or Purple Alert information received from the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction. The decision to record, report, transmit, display, or release information is discretionary with the agency, employee, individual, or entity receiving the information. (6) If a missing child or missing adult is not located within 90 days after the missing child or missing adult report is filed, the law enforcement agency that accepted the report shall attempt to obtain a biological specimen for DNA analysis from the missing child or missing adult or from appropriate family members in addition to obtaining necessary documentation. This subsection does not prevent a law enforcement agency from attempting to obtain information or approved biological specimens for DNA analysis before the expiration of the 90-day period. (7) The department shall adopt rules specific to cases involving missing children and missing adults which will: (a) Identify biological specimens that are approved by the department for DNA analysis. (b) Identify the documentation necessary for the department to use the biological specimens for DNA analysis. (c) Establish procedures for the collection of biological specimens by law enforcement agencies. (d) Establish procedures for forwarding biological specimens by law enforcement agencies to the department. (8) Subsections (6) and (7) are contingent upon the availability of federal funding for the submission and processing of approved biological specimens for DNA analysis.

      "text": "937.0401 Spectrum Alert.— (1) The Legislature finds that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) significantly affects children in this country, creating unique challenges that can lead to critical safety risks, such as elopement or wandering behaviors in children. Children with ASD are prone to wander from safe environments at a higher rate than their non-autistic peers. Elopement frequently results in severe consequences, including fatal traffic accidents and drownings. Notably, drowning is the leading cause of death of children with ASD in this country, with Florida ranking fifth in the nation. The high propensity for elopement and the ineffectiveness of traditional search and response methods necessitate a robust system that will swiftly locate and ensure the safety of missing children with ASD. The Legislature finds that a standardized system is necessary to aid in the search for a missing child with ASD. (2) By July 1, 2026, the Department of Law Enforcement, in cooperation with the Department of Transportation, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the Department of the Lottery, and local law enforcement agencies, shall establish and implement the Spectrum Alert to enhance the safety and well-being of children with ASD through immediate and effective community and emergency response. (3) By July 1, 2026, the Department of Law Enforcement, in cooperation with the Department of Transportation, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the Department of the Lottery, and local law enforcement agencies, shall: (a) Develop a training program and alert system for missing children with ASD which is compatible with existing alert systems. The training program must implement crisis intervention team training to equip law enforcement officers with the skills to understand ASD and other mental illnesses, to de-escalate interactions with children in crisis, to facilitate appropriate interventions, and to respond effectively to a reported missing child emergency when the child has ASD. (b) Establish policies and procedures for responding to a reported missing child emergency when the child has ASD. The policies and procedures must, at a minimum, provide for all of the following: 1. Immediate and widespread dissemination of critical information when a child with ASD is reported missing. 2. Enhancement of emergency response teams’ competence by informing them of the unique behaviors and needs of children with ASD. 3. Measures to increase public awareness and understanding of the risks associated with autism-related elopement, to foster community support for children with ASD. (c) Require a law enforcement agency, at a minimum, to do all of the following upon receiving such a report: 1. Contact media outlets in the affected area or surrounding jurisdictions. 2. Inform all on-duty law enforcement officers of the reported missing child with ASD. 3. Communicate the report to all other law enforcement agencies in the counties surrounding the county in which the report was filed. (4) The Department of Law Enforcement may adopt rules to implement and administer this section. History.—s. 1, ch. 2025-123.
