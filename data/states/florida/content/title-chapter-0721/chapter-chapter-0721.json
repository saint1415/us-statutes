Each timeshare unit shall be equipped with an approved listed single-station smoke detector meeting the minimum requirements of NFPA-74 (1984), “Standards for the Installation, Maintenance and Use of Household Fire Warning Equipment,” powered from the building electrical service, notwithstanding the number of stories in the structure, if the contract for construction is let after September 30, 1983. Single-station smoke detection is not required when a timeshare unit’s smoke detectors are connected to a central alarm system which also alarms locally.(2)Any timeshare unit of a timeshare plan, as defined in this chapter, chapter 718, or chapter 719 which is of three stories or more and for which the construction contract was let before October 1, 1983, shall be equipped with:(a)A system which complies with subsection (1); or(b)An approved sprinkler system for all interior corridors, public areas, storage rooms, closets, kitchen areas, and laundry rooms, less individual timeshare units, if the following conditions are met:1.There is a minimum 1-hour separation between each timeshare unit and between each timeshare unit and a corridor.2.The building is constructed of noncombustible materials.3.The egress conditions meet the requirements of s. 5-3 of the Life Safety Code, NFPA 101 (1985).4.The building has a complete automatic fire detection system which meets the requirements of NFPA-72A (1987) and NFPA-72E (1984), including smoke detectors in each timeshare unit individually annunciating to a panel at a supervised location.(3)The Division of State Fire Marshal of the Department of Financial Services may prescribe uniform standards for firesafety equipment for timeshare units of timeshare plans for which the construction contracts were let before October 1, 1983.

The entire system must be installed and operational by October 1, 1994. The Division of State Fire Marshal shall not grant an extension for the approved sprinkler system unless a written request for the extension and a construction work schedule is submitted. The Division of State Fire Marshal may grant an extension upon demonstration that compliance with this section by the date required would impose an extreme hardship and a disproportionate financial impact. Any establishment that has been granted an extension by the Division of State Fire Marshal shall post, in a conspicuous place on the premises, a public notice stating that the establishment has not yet installed the approved sprinkler system required by law.(4)The provisions for installation of single-station smoke detectors required in subsection (1) and subparagraph (2)(b)4. shall be waived by the Division of State Fire Marshal for any establishment for which the construction contract was let before October 1, 1983, and which is under three stories in height, if each individual timeshare unit is equipped with a smoke detector approved by the Division of State Fire Marshal.(5)The Division of State Fire Marshal shall adopt, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 120, any rules necessary for the implementation and enforcement of this section.
