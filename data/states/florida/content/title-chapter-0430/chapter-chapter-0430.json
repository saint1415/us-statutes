The provider shall forward the volunteer information to the Department of Elderly Affairs if the volunteer is not listed in either database specified in subparagraph 1. The department must then perform a check of the clearinghouse. If a disqualification is identified in the clearinghouse, the volunteer must undergo level 2 background screening pursuant to chapter 435 and this section. (3) Refusal on the part of an employer to dismiss a manager, supervisor, or direct service provider who has been found to be in noncompliance with standards of this section shall result in the automatic denial, termination, or revocation of the license or certification, rate agreement, purchase order, or contract, in addition to any other remedies authorized by law. (4) An employer of a direct service provider who previously qualified for employment or volunteer work under Level 1 screening standards or an individual who is required to be screened according to the level 2 screening standards contained in chapter 435, pursuant to this section, shall be rescreened every 5 years following the date of his or her last background screening or exemption, unless such individual’s fingerprints are continuously retained and monitored by the Department of Law Enforcement in the federal fingerprint retention program according to the procedures specified in s. 943.05.

      "text": "430.071 Respite for elders living in everyday families.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Family unit” means one or more individuals whose primary residence is with a homebound elderly individual specifically for the purpose of providing care for that homebound elderly individual. The family does not necessarily need to be related by blood or marriage to the homebound elderly individual. (b) “Respite” means in-home assistance for a homebound elderly individual from someone who is not a member of the family unit, which allows the family unit the ability to leave the homebound elderly individual for a period of time. (c) “Stipend” means an allotment of funds to enable a diverse population of volunteers to provide services. The allotment of funds is for a maximum hourly rate that shall not exceed an amount equal to the federal minimum wage. (d) “Volunteer service system” means an organized network of volunteers and agencies engaged in supporting volunteers to assist a family unit that requires respite. (2) The “Respite for Elders Living in Everyday Families” (RELIEF) program will provide in-home respite that is an expansion of respite that is currently available through other programs, specifically including evening and weekend respite. The purpose of this service is to increase the ability of a family unit to continue to care for a homebound elderly individual by providing in-home respite beyond the basic provisions of current public programs. (3) Respite services shall be provided through a multigenerational corps of volunteers, volunteers who receive a stipend, and any other appropriate personnel as determined by the department. (a) Volunteers shall be screened, selected, trained, and registered according to standards developed by the Office of Volunteer and Community Services in the Department of Elderly Affairs. These standards must be developed to ensure, at a minimum, the safety of a homebound elderly individual who will receive the respite service. (b) Volunteers may be recruited from a variety of sources, including, but not limited to, volunteer centers, religious organizations, college campuses, corporations, families, Retired Senior Volunteer Programs, Senior Companion Programs, and AmeriCorps Programs. (4) To receive assistance from the RELIEF program, the family unit must be assessed according to the following guidelines developed by the department to determine the need for respite services. This assessment must determine, at a minimum, that: (a) The family unit is unable to pay for respite without jeopardizing other basic needs, including, but not limited to, food, shelter, and medications. (b) The homebound elderly individual for whom the family unit is caring is 60 years of age or older, requires assistance to remain in the home, and, without this assistance, would need to move to an assisted living facility or a nursing facility. (5) A family unit that receives respite services from the RELIEF program is not excluded from receiving assistance from other governmental programs. (6) The Office of Volunteer and Community Services shall: (a) Systematically develop a volunteer service system in order to provide respite services under the RELIEF program. The office shall also implement, monitor, and evaluate the delivery of respite services under this program. (b) Work collaboratively with local, state, and national organizations, including, but not limited to, the Florida Commission on Community Service, to promote the use of volunteers offering respite under this program. (c) Encourage contributions and grants through public and private sources to promote the delivery of respite to assist family units providing care for homebound elderly individuals.

      "text": "430.203 Community care for the elderly; definitions.—As used in ss. 430.201-430.207, the term: (1) “Area agency on aging” means a public or nonprofit private agency or office designated by the department to coordinate and administer the department’s programs and to provide, through contracting agencies, services within a planning and service area. An area agency on aging serves as both the advocate and the visible focal point in its planning and service area to foster the development of comprehensive and coordinated service systems to serve older individuals. (2) “Community care service area” means a service area within a planning and service area. (3) “Community care service system” means a service network comprising a variety of home-delivered services, day care services, and other basic services, hereinafter referred to as “core services,” for functionally impaired elderly persons which are provided by or through a single lead agency. Its purpose is to provide a continuum of care encompassing a full range of preventive, maintenance, and restorative services for functionally impaired elderly persons. (4) “Contracting agency” means an area agency on aging, a lead agency, or any other agency contracting to provide program administration or to provide services. (5) “Core services” means a variety of home-delivered services, day care services, and other basic services that may be provided by several entities. Core services are those services that are most needed to prevent unnecessary institutionalization. The area agency on aging shall not directly provide core services. (6) “Department” means the Department of Elderly Affairs. (7) “Functionally impaired elderly person” means any person, 60 years of age or older, having physical or mental limitations that restrict individual ability to perform the normal activities of daily living and that impede individual capacity to live independently without the provision of core services. Functional impairment shall be determined through a functional assessment administered to each applicant for community-care-for-the-elderly core services. The functional assessment shall be developed by the department. (8) “Health maintenance services” means those routine health services that are necessary to help maintain the health of a functionally impaired elderly person, but that are limited to medical therapeutic services, nonmedical prevention services, personal care services, home health aide services, home nursing services, and emergency response systems. (9) “Lead agency” means an agency designated at least once every 6 years by an area agency on aging as the result of a competitive procurement conducted through a request for proposal. (a) The request for proposal must be developed by the area agency on aging and include requirements for the assurance of quality and cost-efficiency of services, minimum personnel standards, and employee benefits. The department shall adopt a rule creating a dispute resolution mechanism. The rule, which shall be adopted no later than August 1, 2009, and which all area agencies on aging shall be required to follow, shall create standards for a bid protest and a procedure for resolution. The dispute resolution mechanism established in the rule shall include a provision for a qualified, impartial decisionmaker who shall conduct a hearing to determine whether the area agency’s proposed action is contrary to the area agency’s governing statutes or rules or to the solicitation specifications. The standard of proof for the protestor shall be whether the area agency’s action was clearly erroneous, contrary to competition, arbitrary, or capricious. The dispute resolution mechanism shall also provide a mechanism for review of the decisionmaker’s determination by a qualified and impartial reviewer, if review is requested. The standards for the bid protest shall include: 1. A provision requiring notice of an area agency’s proposed contract award and a clear point of entry for any substantially affected entity to challenge the proposed award. 2. A provision for an automatic stay of the contract award process upon the filing of a bid protest that shall not be lifted until the protest is resolved. 3. Provisions permitting all substantially affected entities to have an opportunity to participate in the hearing, to conduct discovery, to obtain subpoenas compelling the appearance of witnesses, to present evidence and argument on all issues involved, to conduct cross-examination, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. 4. Provisions for expeditious resolution of the bid protest, including a requirement that once the area agency on aging refers a bid protest petition to the decisionmaker, a hearing shall be conducted within 30 days, unless that timeframe is waived by all parties. (b) For any lead agency designation conducted prior to the effective date of this subsection that is the subject matter of litigation on the date on which this subsection becomes law, the litigants shall be entitled to proceed with discovery under the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure immediately upon the date on which this subsection becomes law, and the litigants shall further be entitled to participate in the bid protest procedures enacted by rule pursuant to this subsection. (c) In each community care service system the lead agency must be given the authority and responsibility to coordinate some or all of the services, either directly or through subcontracts, for functionally impaired elderly persons. These services must include case management, homemaker and chore services, respite care, adult day care, personal care services, home-delivered meals, counseling, information and referral, and emergency home repair services. The lead agency must compile community care statistics and monitor, when applicable, subcontracts with agencies providing core services. (10) “Personal care services” means services to assist with bathing, dressing, ambulation, housekeeping, supervision, emotional security, eating, supervision of self-administered medications, and assistance in securing health care from appropriate sources. Personal care services does not include medical services. (11) “Planning and service area” means a geographic service area established by the department, in which the programs of the department are administered and services are delivered. (12) “State Plan on Aging” means the service plan developed by the department which evaluates service needs of the elderly, identifies priority services and target client groups, provides for periodic evaluation of activities and services funded under the plan, and provides for administration of funds available through the federal Older Americans Act. The state plan on aging must be based upon area plans on aging developed by the area agencies on aging in order that the priorities and conditions of local communities are taken into consideration.

      "text": "430.205 Community care service system.— (1)(a) The department, through the area agency on aging, shall fund in each planning and service area at least one community care service system that provides case management and other in-home and community services as needed to help the older person maintain independence and prevent or delay more costly institutional care. (b) The department shall fund, through the area agency on aging in each county as defined in s. 125.011(1), more than one community care service system that provides case management and other in-home and community services as needed to help elderly persons maintain independence and prevent or delay more costly institutional care. (2) Core services and other support services may be furnished by public or private agencies or organizations. Each community care service system must be under the direction of a lead agency that coordinates the activities of individual contracting agencies providing community-care-for-the-elderly services. When practicable, the activities of a community care service area may be directed from a multiservice senior center, as defined in s. 430.901, and coordinated with other services offered therein. This subsection does not require programs in existence prior to the effective date of this act to be relocated. (3) The department shall define each core service that is to be provided or coordinated within a community care service area and establish rules and minimum standards for the delivery of core services. The department may conduct or contract for demonstration projects to determine the desirability of new concepts of organization, administration, or service delivery designed to prevent the institutionalization of functionally impaired elderly persons. Evaluations shall be made of the cost-avoidance of such demonstration projects, the ability of the projects to reduce the rate of placement of functionally impaired elderly persons in institutions, and the impact of projects on the use of institutional services and facilities. (4) A preservice and inservice training program for community-care-for-the-elderly service providers and staff may be designed and implemented to help assure the delivery of quality services. The department shall specify in rules the training standards and requirements for the community-care-for-the-elderly service providers and staff. Training must be sufficient to ensure that quality services are provided to clients and that appropriate skills are developed to conduct the program. (5) Any person who has been classified as a functionally impaired elderly person is eligible to receive community-care-for-the-elderly core services. (a) Those elderly persons who are determined by protective investigations to be vulnerable adults in need of services, pursuant to s. 415.104(3)(b), or to be victims of abuse, neglect, or exploitation who are in need of immediate services to prevent further harm and are referred by the adult protective services program, shall be given primary consideration for receiving community-care-for-the-elderly services. As used in this paragraph, “primary consideration” means that an assessment and services must commence within 72 hours after referral to the department or as established in accordance with department contracts by local protocols developed between department service providers and the adult protective services program. Regardless, a community-care-for-the-elderly services provider may dispute a referral under this paragraph by requesting that adult protective services negotiate the referral placement of, and the services to be provided to, a vulnerable adult or victim of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. If an agreement cannot be reached with adult protective services for modification of the referral decision, the determination by adult protective services shall prevail. (b) The department shall determine an order of prioritization for all other functionally impaired elderly persons seeking community-care-for-the-elderly services which is based upon the potential recipient’s frailty level and likelihood of institutional placement without such services. After determining such frailty level and likelihood of institutional placement, should the list of potential recipients require further prioritization, another factor that must be considered is the potential recipient’s ability to pay for such services. Those who are less able to pay for such services must receive higher priority than those who are better able to pay for such services. A potential recipient’s ability to pay may be determined by the department based on the potential recipient’s self-declared statement of income and expenses. (6) Notwithstanding other requirements of this chapter, the Department of Elderly Affairs and the Agency for Health Care Administration shall develop an integrated long-term-care delivery system. The duties of the integrated system shall include organizing and administering service delivery for the elderly, obtaining contracts for services with providers in each service area, monitoring the quality of services provided, determining levels of need and disability for payment purposes, and other activities determined by the department and the agency in order to operate an integrated system.

      "text": "430.2053 Aging resource centers.— (1) The department, in consultation with the Agency for Health Care Administration and the Department of Children and Families, shall develop pilot projects for aging resource centers. (2) The purposes of an aging resource center shall be: (a) To provide Florida’s elders and their families with a locally focused, coordinated approach to integrating information and referral for all available services for elders with the eligibility determination entities for state and federally funded long-term-care services. (b) To provide for easier access to long-term-care services by Florida’s elders and their families by creating multiple access points to the long-term-care network that flow through one established entity with wide community recognition. (3) The duties of an aging resource center are to: (a) Develop referral agreements with local community service organizations, such as senior centers, existing elder service providers, volunteer associations, and other similar organizations, to better assist clients who do not need or do not wish to enroll in programs funded by the department or the agency. The referral agreements must also include a protocol, developed and approved by the department, which provides specific actions that an aging resource center and local community service organizations must take when an elder or an elder’s representative seeking information on long-term-care services contacts a local community service organization prior to contacting the aging resource center. The protocol shall be designed to ensure that elders and their families are able to access information and services in the most efficient and least cumbersome manner possible. (b) Provide an initial screening of all clients who request long-term-care services to determine whether the person would be most appropriately served through any combination of federally funded programs, state-funded programs, locally funded or community volunteer programs, or private funding for services. (c) Determine eligibility for the programs and services listed in subsection (9) for persons residing within the geographic area served by the aging resource center and determine a priority ranking for services which is based upon the potential recipient’s frailty level and likelihood of institutional placement without such services. (d) Manage the availability of financial resources for the programs and services listed in subsection (9) for persons residing within the geographic area served by the aging resource center. (e) When financial resources become available, refer a client to the most appropriate entity to begin receiving services. The aging resource center shall make referrals to lead agencies for service provision that ensure that individuals who are vulnerable adults in need of services pursuant to s. 415.104(3)(b), or who are victims of abuse, neglect, or exploitation in need of immediate services to prevent further harm and are referred by the adult protective services program, are given primary consideration for receiving community-care-for-the-elderly services in compliance with the requirements of s. 430.205(5)(a) and that other referrals for services are in compliance with s. 430.205(5)(b). (f) Convene a work group to advise in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of the aging resource center. The work group shall be comprised of representatives of local service providers, Alzheimer’s Association chapters, housing authorities, social service organizations, advocacy groups, representatives of clients receiving services through the aging resource center, and any other persons or groups as determined by the department. The aging resource center, in consultation with the work group, must develop annual program improvement plans that shall be submitted to the department for consideration. The department shall review each annual improvement plan and make recommendations on how to implement the components of the plan. (g) Enhance the existing area agency on aging in each planning and service area by integrating, either physically or virtually, the staff and services of the area agency on aging with the staff of the department’s local CARES Medicaid preadmission screening unit and a sufficient number of staff from the Department of Children and Families’ Economic Self-Sufficiency Unit necessary to determine the financial eligibility for all persons age 60 and older residing within the area served by the aging resource center that are seeking Medicaid services, Supplemental Security Income, and food assistance. (h) Assist clients who request long-term care services in being evaluated for eligibility for enrollment in the Medicaid long-term care managed care program as eligible plans become available in each of the regions pursuant to s. 409.981(2). (i) Provide enrollment and coverage information to Medicaid managed long-term care enrollees as qualified plans become available in each of the regions pursuant to s. 409.981(2). (j) Assist Medicaid recipients enrolled in the Medicaid long-term care managed care program with informally resolving grievances with a managed care network and assist Medicaid recipients in accessing the managed care network’s formal grievance process as eligible plans become available in each of the regions defined in s. 409.981(2). (4) The department shall select the entities to become aging resource centers based on each entity’s readiness and ability to perform the duties listed in subsection (3) and the entity’s: (a) Expertise in the needs of each target population the center proposes to serve and a thorough knowledge of the providers that serve these populations. (b) Strong connections to service providers, volunteer agencies, and community institutions. (c) Expertise in information and referral activities. (d) Knowledge of long-term-care resources, including resources designed to provide services in the least restrictive setting. (e) Financial solvency and stability. (f) Ability to collect, monitor, and analyze data in a timely and accurate manner, along with systems that meet the department’s standards. (g) Commitment to adequate staffing by qualified personnel to effectively perform all functions. (h) Ability to meet all performance standards established by the department. (5) The aging resource center shall have a governing body which shall be the same entity described in s. 20.41(7), and an executive director who may be the same person as described in s. 20.41(7). The governing body shall annually evaluate the performance of the executive director. (6) The aging resource center may not be a provider of direct services other than information and referral services, and screening. (7) The aging resource center must agree to allow the department to review any financial information the department determines is necessary for monitoring or reporting purposes, including financial relationships. (8) The duties and responsibilities of the community care for the elderly lead agencies within each area served by an aging resource center shall be to: (a) Develop strong community partnerships to maximize the use of community resources for the purpose of assisting elders to remain in their community settings for as long as it is safely possible. (b) Conduct comprehensive assessments of clients that have been determined eligible and develop a care plan consistent with established protocols that ensures that the unique needs of each client are met. (9) The services to be administered through the aging resource center shall include those funded by the following programs: (a) Community care for the elderly. (b) Home care for the elderly. (c) Contracted services. (d) Alzheimer’s disease initiative. (e) Older Americans Act. (10) The department shall, prior to designation of an aging resource center, develop by rule operational and quality assurance standards and outcome measures to ensure that clients receiving services through all long-term-care programs administered through an aging resource center are receiving the appropriate care they require and that contractors and subcontractors are adhering to the terms of their contracts and are acting in the best interests of the clients they are serving, consistent with the intent of the Legislature to reduce the use of and cost of nursing home care. The department shall by rule provide operating procedures for aging resource centers, which shall include: (a) Minimum standards for financial operation, including audit procedures. (b) Procedures for monitoring and sanctioning of service providers. (c) Minimum standards for technology utilized by the aging resource center. (d) Minimum staff requirements which shall ensure that the aging resource center employs sufficient quality and quantity of staff to adequately meet the needs of the elders residing within the area served by the aging resource center. (e) Minimum accessibility standards, including hours of operation. (f) Minimum oversight standards for the governing body of the aging resource center to ensure its continuous involvement in, and accountability for, all matters related to the development, implementation, staffing, administration, and operations of the aging resource center. (g) Minimum education and experience requirements for executive directors and other executive staff positions of aging resource centers. (h) Minimum requirements regarding any executive staff positions that the aging resource center must employ and minimum requirements that a candidate must meet in order to be eligible for appointment to such positions. (11) In an area in which the department has designated an area agency on aging as an aging resource center, the department and the agency shall not make payments for the services listed in subsection (9) and the Long-Term Care Community Diversion Project for such persons who were not screened and enrolled through the aging resource center. The department shall cease making payments for recipients in eligible plans as eligible plans become available in each of the regions defined in s. 409.981(2). (12) Each aging resource center shall enter into a memorandum of understanding with the department for collaboration with the CARES unit staff. The memorandum of understanding shall outline the staff person responsible for each function and shall provide the staffing levels necessary to carry out the functions of the aging resource center. (13) Each aging resource center shall enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Children and Families for collaboration with the Economic Self-Sufficiency Unit staff. The memorandum of understanding shall outline which staff persons are responsible for which functions and shall provide the staffing levels necessary to carry out the functions of the aging resource center. (14) If any of the state activities described in this section are outsourced, either in part or in whole, the contract executing the outsourcing shall mandate that the contractor or its subcontractors shall, either physically or virtually, execute the provisions of the memorandum of understanding instead of the state entity whose function the contractor or subcontractor now performs. (15) In order to be eligible to begin transitioning to an aging resource center, an area agency on aging board must ensure that the area agency on aging which it oversees meets all of the minimum requirements set by law and in rule. (16)(a) Once an aging resource center is operational, the department, in consultation with the agency, may develop capitation rates for any of the programs administered through the aging resource center. Capitation rates for programs shall be based on the historical cost experience of the state in providing those same services to the population age 60 or older residing within each area served by an aging resource center. Each capitated rate may vary by geographic area as determined by the department. (b) The department and the agency may determine for each area served by an aging resource center whether it is appropriate, consistent with federal and state laws and regulations, to develop and pay separate capitated rates for each program administered through the aging resource center or to develop and pay capitated rates for service packages which include more than one program or service administered through the aging resource center. (c) Once capitation rates have been developed and certified as actuarially sound, the department and the agency may pay service providers the capitated rates for services when appropriate. (d) The department, in consultation with the agency, shall annually reevaluate and recertify the capitation rates, adjusting forward to account for inflation, programmatic changes. (17) This section shall not be construed to allow an aging resource center to restrict, manage, or impede the local fundraising activities of service providers.

The program shall be established as a pilot project and shall be administered at the nursing home facility and other appropriate settings. (b) The agency shall develop criteria for designating teaching nursing homes in consultation with advocates of the elderly, advocates of persons with disabilities, representatives of the nursing home industry, and representatives of the State University System. (3) To be designated as a teaching nursing home, a nursing home licensee must, at a minimum: (a) Provide a comprehensive program of integrated senior services that include institutional services and community-based services; (b) Participate in a nationally recognized accrediting program and hold a valid accreditation, such as the accreditation awarded by the Joint Commission, or, at the time of initial designation, possess a Gold Seal Award as conferred by the state on its licensed nursing home; (c) Have been in business in this state for a minimum of 10 consecutive years; (d) Demonstrate an active program in multidisciplinary education and research that relates to gerontology; (e) Have a formalized contractual relationship with at least one accredited health profession education program located in this state; (f) Have senior staff members who hold formal faculty appointments at universities, which must include at least one accredited health profession education program; and (g) Maintain insurance coverage pursuant to s. 400.141(1)(q) or proof of financial responsibility in a minimum amount of $750,000.

The purpose of such affiliations is to foster the development of methods for improving and expanding the capability of health care facilities to respond to the medical, psychological, and social needs of frail and elderly persons by providing the most effective and appropriate services. A teaching nursing home shall serve as a resource for research and for training health care professionals in providing health care services in institutional settings to frail and older persons. (5) The Legislature may provide an annual appropriation to the nursing home facility designated as a teaching nursing home. (6) In order for a nursing home to qualify as a teaching nursing home under this section and to be entitled to the benefits provided under this section, the nursing home must: (a) Be primarily operated and established to offer, afford, and render a comprehensive multidisciplinary program of geriatric education and research to residents of the state; and (b) Certify to the Agency for Health Care Administration each school year the name, address, and educational history of each trainee approved and accepted for enrollment in the institution.

(a) A prospective PACE organization shall submit application documents to the agency before requesting program funding. Application documents submitted to and reviewed by the agency, in consultation with the department, must include all of the following: 1. Evidence that the applicant has the ability to meet all of the applicable federal regulations and requirements, established by the CMS, for participation as a PACE organization by the proposed implementation date. 2. Market studies, including an estimate of the number of potential participants and the geographic service area in which the applicant proposes to serve. 3. A business plan of operation, including pro forma financial statements and projections, based on the proposed implementation date. (b) Each applicant must propose to serve a unique and defined geographic service area. In designating a service area under a contract with a PACE organization, the state administering agency may exclude from designation an area that is already covered under another PACE organization contract in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of services and avoid impairing the financial service viability of an existing PACE organization. However, if a new applicant submits a letter of intent to provide PACE services in an area where an existing PACE organization is under contract and has been operating for at least 10 years, the state shall determine whether there is an unmet need that could be provided by the new PACE organization and the applicant must satisfactorily demonstrate to the state administering agency that there is justification for the proposed PACE organization in such service area. All applicants must demonstrate in the application that the PACE services provided by the proposed PACE organization will be comprehensive and organized to meet all state and CMS requirements. (c) Upon agency approval, a PACE organization that is authorized to provide and has received funding for PACE slots in a given geographic area may use such slots and funding to serve the needs of participants in a contiguous geographic area if such PACE organization is authorized to provide PACE services in that area. (d) An existing PACE organization seeking authority to serve an additional geographic service area not previously authorized by the agency or Legislature shall meet the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b). (e) Any prospective PACE organization that is granted initial state approval by the agency, in consultation with the department, shall submit its complete federal PACE application, in accordance with the application process and guidelines established by the CMS, to the agency and the CMS within 12 months after the date of initial state approval, or such approval is void. (4) ACCOUNTABILITY.—All PACE organizations must meet specific quality and performance standards established by the CMS and the state administering agency for the PACE program. The agency shall oversee and monitor the PACE program and organizations based upon data and reports periodically submitted by PACE organizations to the agency and the CMS. A PACE organization is exempt from the requirements of chapter 641. History.—s. 1, ch. 2021-149; s. 19, ch. 2025-204.
