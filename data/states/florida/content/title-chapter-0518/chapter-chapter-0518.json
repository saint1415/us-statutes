      "heading": "Investments by fiduciaries; prudent investor rule.",
      "text": "518.11 Investments by fiduciaries; prudent investor rule.— (1) A fiduciary has a duty to invest and manage investment assets as follows: (a) The fiduciary has a duty to invest and manage investment assets as a prudent investor would considering the purposes, terms, distribution requirements, and other circumstances of the trust. This standard requires the exercise of reasonable care and caution and is to be applied to investments not in isolation, but in the context of the investment portfolio as a whole and as a part of an overall investment strategy that should incorporate risk and return objectives reasonably suitable to the trust, guardianship, or probate estate. If the fiduciary has special skills, or is named fiduciary on the basis of representations of special skills or expertise, the fiduciary is under a duty to use those skills. (b) No specific investment or course of action is, taken alone, prudent or imprudent. The fiduciary may invest in every kind of property and type of investment, subject to this section. The fiduciary’s investment decisions and actions are to be judged in terms of the fiduciary’s reasonable business judgment regarding the anticipated effect on the investment portfolio as a whole under the facts and circumstances prevailing at the time of the decision or action. The prudent investor rule is a test of conduct and not of resulting performance. (c) The fiduciary has a duty to diversify the investments unless, under the circumstances, the fiduciary believes reasonably it is in the interests of the beneficiaries and furthers the purposes of the trust, guardianship, or estate not to diversify. (d) The fiduciary has a duty, within a reasonable time after acceptance of the trust, estate, or guardianship, to review the investment portfolio and to make and implement decisions concerning the retention and disposition of original preexisting investments in order to conform to the provisions of this section. The fiduciary’s decision to retain or dispose of an asset may be influenced properly by the asset’s special relationship or value to the purposes of the trust, estate, or guardianship, or to some or all of the beneficiaries, consistent with the trustee’s duty of impartiality, or to the ward. (e) The fiduciary has a duty to pursue an investment strategy that considers both the reasonable production of income and safety of capital, consistent with the fiduciary’s duty of impartiality and the purposes of the trust, estate, or guardianship. Whether investments are underproductive or overproductive of income shall be judged by the portfolio as a whole and not as to any particular asset. (f) The circumstances that the fiduciary may consider in making investment decisions include, without limitation, the general economic conditions, the possible effect of inflation, the expected tax consequences of investment decisions or strategies, the role each investment or course of action plays within the overall portfolio, the expected total return, including both income yield and appreciation of capital, and the duty to incur only reasonable and appropriate costs. The fiduciary may, but need not, consider related trusts, estates, and guardianships, and the income available from other sources to, and the assets of, beneficiaries when making investment decisions. (2) The provisions of this section may be expanded, restricted, eliminated, or otherwise altered by express provisions of the governing instrument, whether the instrument was executed before or after the effective date of this section. An express provision need not refer specifically to this statute. The fiduciary is not liable to any person for the fiduciary’s reasonable reliance on those express provisions. (3) Nothing in this section abrogates or restricts the power of an appropriate court in proper cases: (a) To direct or permit the trustee to deviate from the terms of the governing instrument; or (b) To direct or permit the fiduciary to take, or to restrain the fiduciary from taking, any action regarding the making or retention of investments. (4) The following terms or comparable language in the investment powers and related provisions of a governing instrument shall be construed as authorizing any investment or strategy permitted under this section: “investments permissible by law for investment of trust funds,” “legal investments,” “authorized investments,” “using the judgment and care under the circumstances then prevailing that persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not in regard to speculation but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable income as well as the probable safety of their capital,” “prudent trustee rule,” “prudent person rule,” and “prudent investor rule.” (5) This section applies to all existing and future fiduciary relationships subject to this section, but only as to acts or omissions occurring after October 1, 1993.

      "text": "518.112 Delegation of investment functions.— (1) A fiduciary may delegate any part or all of the investment functions, with regard to acts constituting investment functions that a prudent investor of comparable skills might delegate under the circumstances, to an investment agent as provided in subsection (3), if the fiduciary exercises reasonable care, judgment, and caution in selecting the investment agent, in establishing the scope and specific terms of any delegation, and in reviewing periodically the agent’s actions in order to monitor overall performance and compliance with the scope and specific terms of the delegation. (2)(a) The requirements of subsection (1) notwithstanding, a fiduciary that administers an insurance contract on the life or lives of one or more persons may delegate without any continuing obligation to review the agent’s actions, certain investment functions with respect to any such contract as provided in subsection (3), to any one or more of the following persons as investment agents: 1. The trust’s settlor if the trust is one described in s. 733.707(3); 2. Beneficiaries of the trust or estate, regardless of the beneficiary’s interest therein, whether vested or contingent; 3. The spouse, ancestor, or descendant of any person described in subparagraph 1. or subparagraph 2.; 4. Any person or entity nominated by a majority of the beneficiaries entitled to receive notice under paragraph (3)(b); or 5. An investment agent if the fiduciary exercises reasonable care, judgment, and caution in selecting the investment agent and in establishing the scope and specific terms of any delegation. (b) The delegable investment functions under this subsection include: 1. A determination of whether the insurance contract was procured or effected in compliance with s. 627.404; 2. A determination of whether any insurance contract is or remains a proper investment; 3. The investigation of the financial strength of the life insurance company; 4. A determination of whether or not to exercise any policy option available under any insurance contracts; 5. A determination of whether or not to diversify such contracts relative to one another or to other assets, if any, administered by the fiduciary; or 6. An inquiry about changes in the health or financial condition of the insured or insureds relative to any such contract. (c) Until the contract matures and the policy proceeds are received, a fiduciary that administers insurance contracts under this subsection is not obligated to diversify nor allocate other assets, if any, relative to such insurance contracts. (3) A fiduciary may delegate investment functions to an investment agent under subsection (1) or subsection (2), if: (a) In the case of a guardianship, the fiduciary has obtained court approval. (b) In the case of a trust or estate, the fiduciary has given written notice, of its intention to begin delegating investment functions under this section, to all beneficiaries, or their legal representative, eligible to receive distributions from the trust or estate within 30 days of the delegation unless such notice is waived by the eligible beneficiaries entitled to receive such notice. This notice shall thereafter, until or unless the beneficiaries eligible to receive income from the trust or distributions from the estate at the time are notified to the contrary, authorize the trustee or legal representative to delegate investment functions pursuant to this subsection. This discretion to revoke the delegation does not imply under subsection (2) any continuing obligation to review the agent’s actions. 1. Notice to beneficiaries eligible to receive distributions from the trust from the estate, or their legal representatives shall be sufficient notice to all persons who may join the eligible class of beneficiaries in the future. 2. Additionally, as used herein, legal representative includes one described in s. 731.303, without any requirement of a court order, an attorney-in-fact under a durable power of attorney sufficient to grant such authority, a legally appointed guardian, or equivalent under applicable law, any living, natural guardian of a minor child, or a guardian ad litem. 3. Written notice shall be given as provided in part III of chapter 731 as to an estate, and as provided in s. 736.0109 and part III of chapter 736 as to a trust. (4) If all requirements of subsection (3) are satisfied, the fiduciary shall not be responsible otherwise for the investment decisions nor actions or omissions of the investment agent to which the investment functions are delegated. (5) The investment agent shall, by virtue of acceptance of its appointment, be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state. (6) In performing a delegated function, the investment agent shall be subject to the same standards as the fiduciary. History.—s. 3, ch. 93-257; s. 8, ch. 97-240; s. 2, ch. 2010-172.
