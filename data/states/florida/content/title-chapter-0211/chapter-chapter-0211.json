      "text": "211.01 Definitions.—As used in this part: (1) “Barrel” means a unit of measurement for oil production and is 42 U.S. gallons of 231 cubic inches per gallon, computed at a temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit, after deduction for the full percent of basic sediment, water, and other impurities as ascertained by centrifugal or other recognized and customary tests. (2) “Casinghead gas” means gas produced with oil from oil wells, the gas being taken from the well through the casinghead, or the liquid hydrocarbons in solution which may be separated in part by a reduction in pressure at the wellhead and separated more completely in a separator or absorption plant or by another manufacturing process. (3) “Completion date” means the day, month, and year that a new productive well, a previously shut-in well, or a temporarily abandoned well is completed, repaired, or recompleted and the operator begins producing oil or gas in commercial quantities. (4) “Cubic foot” means a unit of measurement for gas production and is the volume of gas contained in one cubic foot of space at a base temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit and a base pressure of 14.65 pounds per square inch absolute, pressure and specific gravity corrections to be made according to Boyle’s Law and a test made by the balance method, respectively. (5) “Day” means the standard calendar period of 24 consecutive hours ending at 12 o’clock midnight. (6) “Department” means the Department of Revenue. (7) “Gas” means all natural gas, including casinghead gas, and all hydrocarbons not defined as oil, but excludes any hydrogen sulfide gas or sulfur contained, produced, or recovered from such hydrogen sulfide gas. (8) “Horizontal well” means a well completed with the wellbore in a horizontal or nearly horizontal orientation within 10 degrees of horizontal within the producing formation. (9) “Long ton” means 2240 pounds and is the unit of measurement in the production of sulfur. (10) “Mcf” means 1000 cubic feet and is the unit of measurement in the production of gas. (11) “Month” means a calendar month. (12) “New field well” means an oil or gas well completed after July 1, 1997, in a new field as designated by the Department of Environmental Protection. (13) “Oil” means crude petroleum oil or other hydrocarbon, regardless of gravity, which is produced at the well in liquid form by ordinary production methods and which is not the result of condensation of gas after it leaves the reservoir. (14) “Operator” means the person in charge of a production operation by which taxable oil, gas, or sulfur products are severed. (15) “Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint adventure, syndicate, association, business trust, estate, trust, fiduciary, corporation, group, or combination. (16) “Producer” means any person who owns, controls, manages, or leases any oil or gas property or oil or gas well or any person who produces in any manner any taxable product, including any person owning any royalty or other interest in any taxable product or its value, whether the taxable product is produced by, or on behalf of, such person under a lease contract or otherwise. (17) “Production” means the total gross quantity of each taxable product severed during a month, measured as required by this part. (18) “Purchaser” means any person who directly or indirectly buys, takes, transports, or otherwise removes any production of a taxable oil, gas, or sulfur product to his or her account from a well, lease, or source of supply. (19) “Sever” means to extract or withdraw any taxable oil, gas, or sulfur product from below the surface of the soil or water of this state by natural or mechanically enforced flow; to produce or recover sulfur from hydrogen sulfide gas; to withdraw from any natural or artificial surface reservoir or water surface, by any means whatsoever, any taxable product upon which tax imposed under this part has not been paid; or to recover any escaped taxable product upon which tax imposed under this part has not been paid. (20) “Shut-in well” means an oil or gas well that has been taken out of service for economic reasons or mechanical repairs. (21) “Small well oil” means oil produced from a well from which less than 100 barrels of oil per day are severed, considering only those days of the month during which production of oil from the well actually occurred. (22) “Sulfur” means any sulfur produced or recovered from hydrogen sulfide gas contained in oil or gas production. (23) “Taxable product” means the oil, gas, or sulfur severed by a producer during a month. (24) “Taxable production” means the quantity of a taxable product severed during a month by a producer, measured as required by this part. (25) “Taxpayer” means the person liable for any tax imposed under this part. (26) “Temporarily abandoned well” means a permitted well or wellbore that has been abandoned by plugging in a manner that allows reentry and redevelopment in accordance with oil or gas rules of the Department of Environmental Protection.

      "text": "211.30 Definitions.—In addition to the definitions contained in s. 211.01, the following words and terms shall have the definition and meaning ascribed to them in this section, unless the intention to give a more limited meaning is disclosed by the context: (1) “Solid mineral” means all solid minerals, including, but not limited to, clay, gravel, phosphate rock, lime, shells (excluding live shellfish), stone, sand, heavy minerals, and any rare earths which have heretofore been discovered or may be discovered in the future, which are contained in the soils or waters of this state. (2) “Severed” means the extraction or withdrawal from the soil or water of this state, either on or below the surface, of any solid minerals. (3) “Producer” means any person severing solid minerals from the soils and waters of this state. (4) “Production,” for measuring solid minerals, means the total gross amount severed from the soils and waters of this state from any type of production unit, including, but not limited to, mines, quarries, pits, or other sites of extraction. (5) “Value” means the sales price or true market price of the solid mineral at the point of severance. (6) “Point of severance” means that point at which the solid mineral being severed is identifiable as to kind and quality and is capable of being transported for use or further processing. For phosphate rock, “point of severance” is the wet rock bin. For heavy minerals, “point of severance” is the discharge pump of the production dredge. (7) “Site of severance” means the mine, quarry, pit, or other geographical location at which a solid mineral is actually being severed from the soils and waters of this state. (8) “Taxable year” means calendar year. (9) “Phosphate rock” means a variable mixture of calcium phosphates and other minerals that have fluorapatite as the dominant phosphatic mineral, found in bedded deposits of marine origin. This term includes the forms of land-pebble and river-pebble phosphates and the phosphate concentrates derived from beneficiation of these forms. This term does not include colloidal phosphatic clays. (10) “Heavy minerals” means those minerals found in conjunction with sand deposits which have a specific gravity of not less than 2.8. “Heavy minerals” is a term applied to an admixture of such minerals as zircon, staurolite, and titanium minerals as generally mined in Florida. (11) “Producer price index” means: (a) For phosphate rock, the unadjusted annual phosphate rock-primary products index as calculated and published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. (b) For heavy minerals, the unadjusted annual titanium dioxide index as calculated and published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. (12) “Five-year moving average” means a simple average which is recomputed for each period by eliminating the data for the fifth prior year for the previous period and adding the data for the first prior year of the current period. (13) “Period” means the 5 calendar years immediately preceding the taxable year. (14) “Previous period” means the period for the prior taxable year. (15) “Base year” means the year used by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, in an index as the reference year on which all other index numbers are computed, or the year designated as “100” in an index. (16) “Base period” means the 5 years immediately preceding the 1981 tax year, or the years 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, and 1980. (17) “Bone dry” means a condition which indicates the substantial absence of water as determined by generally accepted measurements of water content used within the industry. (18) “Colloidal phosphatic clay” means that material produced as a waste byproduct of hard rock phosphate mining and severed solely for direct application in agricultural uses. (19) “Ton” means 2,000 pounds. History.—s. 1, ch. 71-105; s. 1, ch. 75-40; s. 1, ch. 81-35; s. 5, ch. 87-96.
