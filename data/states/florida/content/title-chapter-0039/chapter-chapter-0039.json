In determining whether harm has occurred, the following factors must be considered in evaluating any physical, mental, or emotional injury to a child: the age of the child; any prior history of injuries to the child; the location of the injury on the body of the child; the multiplicity of the injury; and the type of trauma inflicted. Such injury includes, but is not limited to:1.Willful acts that produce the following specific injuries:a.Sprains, dislocations, or cartilage damage.b.Bone or skull fractures.c.Brain or spinal cord damage.d.Intracranial hemorrhage or injury to other internal organs.e.Asphyxiation, suffocation, or drowning.f.Injury resulting from the use of a deadly weapon.g.Burns or scalding.h.Cuts, lacerations, punctures, or bites.i.Permanent or temporary disfigurement.j.Permanent or temporary loss or impairment of a body part or function.As used in this subparagraph, the term “willful” refers to the intent to perform an action, not to the intent to achieve a result or to cause an injury.2.Purposely giving a child poison, alcohol, drugs, or other substances that substantially affect the child’s behavior, motor coordination, or judgment or that result in sickness or internal injury. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term “drugs” means prescription drugs not prescribed for the child or not administered as prescribed, and controlled substances as outlined in Schedule I or Schedule II of s. 893.03.3.Leaving a child without adult supervision or arrangement appropriate for the child’s age or mental or physical condition, so that the child is unable to care for the child’s own needs, is subjected to obvious danger of which the child’s caregiver knew or should have known, or is unable to exercise reasonable judgment to avoid serious harm to himself or others in responding to any kind of physical or emotional crisis. This subparagraph may not be construed to restrict a caregiver from allowing a child of sufficient maturity and physical condition from engaging in independent unsupervised activities, including, but not limited to, traveling to or from school or nearby locations by bicycle or on foot, playing outdoors, or remaining at home or any other location for a reasonable period of time, unless allowing such activities constitutes conduct that is so reckless as to endanger the health or safety of the child.4.Inappropriate or excessively harsh disciplinary action that is likely to result in physical injury, mental injury as defined in this section, or emotional injury. The significance of any injury must be evaluated in light of the following factors: the age of the child; any prior history of injuries to the child; the location of the injury on the body of the child; the multiplicity of the injury; and the type of trauma inflicted. Corporal discipline may be considered excessive or abusive when it results in any of the following or other similar injuries:a.Sprains, dislocations, or cartilage damage.b.Bone or skull fractures.c.Brain or spinal cord damage.d.Intracranial hemorrhage or injury to other internal organs.e.Asphyxiation, suffocation, or drowning.f.Injury resulting from the use of a deadly weapon.g.Burns or scalding.h.Cuts, lacerations, punctures, or bites.i.Permanent or temporary disfigurement.j.Permanent or temporary loss or impairment of a body part or function.k.Significant bruises or welts.(b)Commits, or allows to be committed, sexual battery, as defined in chapter 794, or lewd or lascivious acts, as defined in chapter 800, against the child.(c)Allows, encourages, or forces the sexual exploitation of a child, which includes allowing, encouraging, or forcing a child to:1.Solicit for or engage in prostitution; or2.Engage in a sexual performance, as defined by chapter 827.(d)Exploits a child, or allows a child to be exploited, as provided in s. 450.151.(e)Abandons the child. Within the context of the definition of “harm,” the term “abandoned the child” or “abandonment of the child” means a situation in which the parent or legal custodian of a child or, in the absence of a parent or legal custodian, the caregiver, while being able, has made no significant contribution to the child’s care and maintenance or has failed to establish or maintain a substantial and positive relationship with the child, or both. For purposes of this paragraph, “establish or maintain a substantial and positive relationship” includes, but is not limited to, frequent and regular contact with the child through frequent and regular visitation or frequent and regular communication to or with the child, and the exercise of parental rights and responsibilities. Marginal efforts and incidental or token visits or communications are not sufficient to establish or maintain a substantial and positive relationship with a child. The term “abandoned” does not include a surrendered infant as described in s. 383.50, a child in need of services as defined in chapter 984, or a family in need of services as defined in chapter 984. The incarceration, repeated incarceration, or extended incarceration of a parent, legal custodian, or caregiver responsible for a child’s welfare may support a finding of abandonment.(f)Neglects the child. Within the context of the definition of “harm,” the term “neglects the child” means that the parent or other person responsible for the child’s welfare fails to supply the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or health care, although financially able to do so or although offered financial or other means to do so; however, the term does not include a caregiver allowing a child to engage in independent and unsupervised activities unless allowing such activities constitutes reckless conduct that endangers the health or safety of the child. Such independent and unsupervised activities include, but are not limited to, traveling to or from school or nearby locations by bicycle or on foot, playing outdoors, or remaining at home or any other location for a reasonable period of time. A parent or legal custodian who, by reason of the legitimate practice of religious beliefs, does not provide specified medical treatment for a child may not be considered abusive or neglectful for that reason alone, but such an exception does not:1.Eliminate the requirement that such a case be reported to the department;2.Prevent the department from investigating such a case; or3.Preclude a court from ordering, when the health of the child requires it, the provision of medical services by a physician, as defined in this section, or treatment by a duly accredited practitioner who relies solely on spiritual means for healing in accordance with the tenets and practices of a well-recognized church or religious organization.(g)Exposes a child to a controlled substance or alcohol.
