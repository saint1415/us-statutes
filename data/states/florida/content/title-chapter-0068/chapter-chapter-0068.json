It may issue in any case in equity, including support as defined in s. 409.2554, when the issuance is just. (2) JUDGE TO FIX PENALTY OF BOND.—In granting the writ the court shall fix the penalty and conditions of the bond with surety to be approved by the clerk to be required of plaintiff in favor of defendant. The writ shall not issue until the bond is given. (3) ABSENCE FROM STATE UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS PERMITTED.—An absence of the defendant from the state from which he or she returns before a personal appearance is necessary or before it is necessary to perform any order of the court is not a breach of the condition of the bond. (4) SURRENDER OF DEFENDANT BY SURETIES.—The surety of defendant has the right personally or by attorney at any time before the bond is forfeited to take the body of the principal and surrender him or her in open court or deliver him or her to the executive officer of the court, who shall detain the principal as in cases of the surrender of the principal by special bail. At the time of delivery to the officer, the surety shall take a receipt for the body and file it with the clerk. If done before the bond is forfeited, the surrender or delivery discharges the surety from his or her undertaking.

If the department finds that a person has violated or is violating s. 68.082, the department may bring a civil action under the Florida False Claims Act against the person. The Department of Financial Services may bring a civil action under this section if the action arises from an investigation by that department and the Department of Legal Affairs has not filed an action under this act. (2) A person may bring a civil action for a violation of s. 68.082 for the person and for the affected agency. Civil actions instituted under this act shall be governed by the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure and shall be brought in the name of the State of Florida. Prior to the court unsealing the complaint under subsection (3), the action may be voluntarily dismissed by the person bringing the action only if the department gives written consent to the dismissal and its reasons for such consent. (3) The complaint shall be identified on its face as a qui tam action and shall be filed in the circuit court of the Second Judicial Circuit, in and for Leon County. Immediately upon the filing of the complaint, a copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses shall be served on the Attorney General, as head of the department, and on the Chief Financial Officer, as head of the Department of Financial Services, by registered mail, return receipt requested. The department, or the Department of Financial Services under the circumstances specified in subsection (4), may elect to intervene and proceed with the action, on behalf of the state, within 60 days after it receives both the complaint and the material evidence and information. (4) If a person brings an action under subsection (2) and the action is based upon the facts underlying a pending investigation by the Department of Financial Services, the Department of Financial Services, instead of the department, may take over the action on behalf of the state. In order to take over the action, the Department of Financial Services must give the department written notification within 20 days after the action is filed that the Department of Financial Services is conducting an investigation of the facts of the action and that the Department of Financial Services, instead of the department, will take over the action filed under subsection (2). If the Department of Financial Services takes over the action under this subsection, the word “department” as used in this act means the Department of Financial Services, and that department, for purposes of that action, shall have all rights and standing granted the department under this act. (5) The department may, for good cause shown, request the court to extend the time during which the complaint remains under seal under subsection (2). Any such motion may be supported by affidavits or other submissions in camera. The defendant is not required to respond to any complaint filed under this section until 20 days after the complaint is unsealed and served upon the defendant in accordance with law. (6) Before the expiration of the 60-day period or any extensions obtained under subsection (5), the department shall: (a) Proceed with the action, in which case the action is conducted by the department on behalf of the state; or (b) Notify the court that it declines to take over the action, in which case the person bringing the action has the right to conduct the action. (7) When a person files an action under this section, no person other than the department may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action. (8)(a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the complaint and information held by the department pursuant to an investigation of a violation of s. 68.082 is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. (b) Information made confidential and exempt under paragraph (a) may be disclosed by the department to a law enforcement agency or another administrative agency in the performance of its official duties and responsibilities. (c) Information made confidential and exempt under paragraph (a) is no longer confidential and exempt once the investigation is completed, unless the information is otherwise protected by law. (d) For purposes of this subsection, an investigation is considered complete: 1. Under subsection (1) once the department either files its own action or closes its investigation without filing an action. 2. Under subsection (2) upon the unsealing of the qui tam action or its voluntary dismissal prior to any unsealing.

(d) Prescribe a date and time at which the person must appear to testify, under oath or affirmation, or by which the person must answer written interrogatories or produce the documentary material for inspection or copying; however, such date shall not be earlier than 30 days after the date of service of the subpoena. (e) Specify a place for the taking of testimony or for the submission of answers to interrogatories and identify the person who is to take custody of any documentary material. Inspection and copying of documentary material shall be carried out at the place where the documentary material is located or at such other place as may be thereafter agreed to by the person and such designated custodian. Upon written agreement between the person and the designated custodian, copies may be substituted for original documents. (4) Such subpoena may not require the production of any documentary material, the submission of any answers to written interrogatories, or the giving of any oral testimony if such material, answers, or testimony would be protected from disclosure under: (a) The standards applicable to subpoenas or subpoenas duces tecum issued by a court of this state in aid of a grand jury investigation; or (b) The standards applicable to a discovery request under the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, to the extent that the application of such standards to any such subpoena is appropriate and consistent with the provisions and purposes of this act. (5) This section does not limit the power of the department to require the appearance of witnesses or production of documents or other tangible evidence located outside the state. (6) Within 30 days after the service of a subpoena upon any person or at any time before the return date specified therein, whichever period is longer, the person served may file, and serve on the department, a petition for an order of the court modifying or setting aside the subpoena. Any such petition shall be filed in the circuit court of the Second Judicial Circuit in and for Leon County. The time allowed for compliance in whole or in part with the subpoena as deemed proper and ordered by the court shall not run while the petition is pending before the court. The petition shall specify each ground upon which the petitioner relies in seeking relief and may be based upon the failure of the subpoena to comply with this section or upon any constitutional or other legal right or privilege of such person. (7) In case of the failure of any person to comply in whole or in part with a subpoena and when such person has not filed a petition under subsection (6), the circuit court of the Second Judicial Circuit in and for Leon County, upon application of the department, may issue an order requiring compliance. The failure to obey the order of the court shall be punishable as a contempt of court. (8) The examination of all witnesses under this section shall be conducted by the department before an officer authorized to administer oaths in this state. The testimony shall be taken stenographically or by a sound-recording device. Any person compelled to appear under a subpoena for oral testimony pursuant to this section may be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel. Counsel may advise such person, in confidence, either upon the request of such person or upon counsel’s own initiative, with respect to any question asked of such person. Such person or counsel may object on the record to any question, in whole or in part, and shall briefly state for the record the reason for any such objection. If such person refuses to answer any question, the person conducting the examination may petition the circuit court as provided by subsection (11). (9) When the testimony is fully transcribed, the person conducting the deposition shall afford the witness, and counsel, if any, a reasonable opportunity to examine the transcript, and the transcript shall be read to or by the witness, unless such examination and reading is waived by the witness. Any changes in form or substance that the witness desires to make shall be entered and identified upon the transcript by the officer or the department, with a statement of the reasons given by the witness for making such changes. The transcript shall then be signed by the witness unless the witness waives the signing in writing, is ill, cannot be found, or refuses to sign. If the transcript is not signed by the witness within 30 days after his or her being afforded a reasonable opportunity to examine it, the person conducting the examination shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver, illness, absence, or refusal to sign, together with the reason, if any, given therefor. Any person required to testify or to submit documentary evidence is entitled, on payment of reasonable costs, to procure a copy of any document produced by such person and of his or her own testimony as stenographically reported or, in the case of a deposition, as reduced to writing by or under the direction of the person taking the deposition. (10) The department shall have the authority to stipulate to protective orders with respect to documents and information submitted in response to a subpoena under this section. (11) The department may request that any natural person who refuses to comply with this section on the ground that the testimony or documents may incriminate him or her be ordered by the circuit court to provide the testimony or the documents. Except in a prosecution for perjury, a natural person who complies with a court order to provide testimony or documents after asserting a privilege against self-incrimination to which he or she is entitled by law may not be subject to a criminal proceeding with respect to the transaction to which he or she is required to testify or produce documents. Any natural person who fails to comply with such a court order to testify or produce documents may be adjudged in contempt and imprisoned until the time the person purges himself or herself of the contempt. (12) While in the possession of the custodian, documentary material, answers to interrogatories, and transcripts of oral testimony shall be available, under such reasonable terms and conditions as the department shall prescribe, for examination by the person who produced such materials or answers or that person’s duly authorized representative. (13) This section does not impair the authority of the department to: (a) Institute a civil proceeding under s. 68.083; (b) Invoke the power of a court to compel the production of evidence before a grand jury; or (c) Maintain the confidential and exempt status of the complaint and any other information as provided in s. 68.083(8). (14)(a) A person who knows or has reason to believe that a subpoena pursuant to this section is pending shall not: 1. Alter, destroy, conceal, or remove any record, document, or thing with the purpose of impairing its verity or availability in such proceeding or investigation; or 2. Make, present, or use any record, document, or thing knowing it to be false. (b) Any natural person who violates this subsection is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $100,000, reasonable attorney fees, and costs. Any other person who violates this subsection is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $1 million, reasonable attorney fees, and costs. History.—s. 4, ch. 2013-104.

      "text": "68.084 Rights of the parties in civil actions.— (1) If the department, on behalf of the state, proceeds with the action, it has the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, and is not bound by any act of the person bringing the action. The person bringing the action has the right to continue as a party to the action, subject to the limitations specified in subsection (2). (2)(a) The department may at any point voluntarily dismiss the action notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action. (b) Subject to s. 17.04, nothing in this act shall be construed to limit the authority of the department or the qui tam plaintiff to compromise a claim brought in a complaint filed under this act if the court determines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable under all the circumstances. (c) Upon a showing by the department that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would interfere with or unduly delay the department’s prosecution of the case, or would be repetitious, irrelevant, or for purposes of harassment, the court may, in its discretion, impose limitations on the person’s participation, including, but not limited to: 1. Limiting the number of witnesses the person may call; 2. Limiting the length of the testimony of the person’s witnesses; 3. Limiting the person’s cross-examination of witnesses; or 4. Otherwise limiting the participation by the person in the litigation. (d) Upon a showing by the defendant that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would be for purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense, the court may limit the participation by the person in the litigation. (3) If the department elects not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action has the right to conduct the action. If the Attorney General, as head of the department, or the Chief Financial Officer, as head of the Department of Financial Services, so requests, it shall be served with copies of all pleadings and motions filed in the action along with copies of all deposition transcripts at the requesting department’s expense. When a person proceeds with the action, the court, without limiting the rights of the person initiating the action, may nevertheless permit the department to intervene and take over the action on behalf of the state at a later date upon showing of good cause. (4) Regardless of whether the department proceeds with the action, upon a showing by the department that certain actions of discovery by the person initiating the action would interfere with an investigation by the state or the prosecution of a criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts, the court may stay such discovery for a period of not more than 60 days. Such a showing shall be conducted in camera. The court may extend the 60-day period upon a further showing in camera by the department that the criminal or civil investigation or proceeding has been pursued with reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the civil action will interfere with an ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceeding. (5) Notwithstanding paragraph (2)(b), the state may elect to pursue its claim through any available alternate remedy, including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil money penalty. If any such alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding, the person initiating the action shall have the same rights in such proceeding as the person would have had if the action had continued under this section. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under this section. For purposes of this subsection, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court, if all time for filing such an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review. (6) The Department of Financial Services, or the department, may intervene on its own behalf as a matter of right.

(b) If the court finds the action to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information, other than information provided by the person bringing the action, relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing; a legislative, administrative, inspector general, or auditor general report, hearing, audit, or investigation; or from the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation. (c) Any payment to a person under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) shall be made from the proceeds. The person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses that the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorney fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant. (2) If the department does not proceed with an action under this section, the person bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an amount that the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. The amount shall be not less than 25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of such proceeds. The person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses that the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorney fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant. (3) Following any distributions under subsection (1) or subsection (2), the state entity injured by the submission of a false or fraudulent claim shall be awarded an amount not to exceed its compensatory damages. If the action was based on a claim of funds from the state Medicaid program, 10 percent of any remaining proceeds shall be deposited into the Operating Trust Fund to fund rewards for persons who report and provide information relating to Medicaid fraud pursuant to s. 409.9203. Any remaining proceeds, including civil penalties awarded under s. 68.082, shall be deposited in the General Revenue Fund. (4) Regardless of whether the department proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a person who planned and initiated the violation of s. 68.082 upon which the action was brought, the court may, to the extent the court considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action that the person would otherwise receive under this section, taking into account the role of the person in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation. If the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of s. 68.082, the person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action. Such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the department to continue the action.

For purposes of this subsection, the term “senior executive branch official” means any person employed in the executive branch of government holding a position in the Senior Management Service as defined in s. 110.402. (2) In no event may a person bring an action under s. 68.083(2) based upon allegations or transactions that are the subject of a civil action or an administrative proceeding in which the state is already a party. (3) The court shall dismiss an action brought under this act unless opposed by the department, if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action were publicly disclosed: (a) In a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing in which the state is a party; (b) In a legislative, administrative, inspector general, or other state report, hearing, audit, or investigation; or (c) From the news media, unless the action is brought by the department or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information. For purposes of this subsection, the term “original source” means an individual who, before a public disclosure under this subsection, has voluntarily disclosed to the department the information on which allegations or transactions in a claim are based, or who has knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions and has voluntarily provided the information to the department before filing an action under this section. (4) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action where the person bringing the action under s. 68.083(2) is: (a) Acting as an attorney for state government; or (b) An employee or former employee of state government, and the action is based, in whole or in part, upon information obtained in the course or scope of government employment.

(c) “Vexatious litigant” means a person, as defined in s. 1.01(3), proceeding pro se, who: 1. In the immediately preceding 7-year period, has commenced, prosecuted, or maintained, pro se, five or more actions in any court that have been finally and adversely determined against such person, except that an action may not be included for purposes of this subparagraph if the court finds that the action was commenced, prosecuted, or maintained in good faith; 2. After an action has been finally and adversely determined against the person, repeatedly relitigates or attempts to relitigate either the validity of the determination against the same party as to whom the action was finally determined or the cause of action, claim, controversy, or any of the issues of fact or law determined by the final and adverse determination against the same party as to whom the action was finally determined; 3. Repeatedly files pleadings, requests for relief, or other documents that have been the subject of previous rulings by the court in the same action; 4. Repeatedly files unmeritorious pleadings, requests for relief, or other documents; conducts unnecessary discovery; or engages in other tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay in any action; or 5. Has been previously found to be a vexatious litigant pursuant to this section or by another state court or a federal court. An action is not deemed to be “finally and adversely determined” if an appeal in that action is pending. (3)(a) In any action pending in any court of this state, any party may move the court, upon notice and hearing, for an order requiring an opposing party to furnish security. The motion shall be based on the grounds, and supported by a showing, that the opposing party subject to the motion is a vexatious litigant and is not reasonably likely to prevail on the merits of the action against the moving party. (b) At the hearing for an order to post security, the court shall consider any evidence, written or oral, by witness or affidavit, which may be relevant to the consideration of the motion. No determination made by the court in such a hearing shall be admissible on the merits of the action or deemed to be a determination of any issue in the action. If, after hearing the evidence, the court determines that the opposing party subject to the motion is a vexatious litigant and is not reasonably likely to prevail on the merits of the action against the moving party, the court shall order the vexatious litigant to furnish security to the moving party in an amount and within such time as the court deems appropriate. (c) If the vexatious litigant fails to post security required by an order of the court under this section and the vexatious litigant is: 1. A plaintiff or petitioner, the court shall immediately issue an order dismissing the action with prejudice as to the moving party for whose benefit the security was ordered; or 2. A defendant or respondent, the court may immediately issue an order imposing one or more of the following sanctions, as appropriate: a. Denial of the vexatious litigant’s request for relief; b. Striking of the vexatious litigant’s pleading or other document or part thereof; or c. Rendition of a judgment by default against the vexatious litigant. (d) If the motion for an order to post security is filed before the trial in an action, the action shall be automatically stayed and the moving party need not plead or otherwise respond to the vexatious litigant’s complaint, pleading, request for relief, or other document until 10 days after the motion for an order to post security is denied. If the motion for an order to post security is granted, the moving party shall respond or plead no later than 10 days after the required security has been furnished. (4) In addition to any other relief provided in this section, the court in any judicial circuit may, on its own motion or on the motion of any party, enter a prefiling order prohibiting a vexatious litigant from commencing, pro se, any new action in the courts of that circuit without first obtaining leave of the court. Disobedience of such an order may be punished as contempt of court. Leave of court shall be granted by the court only upon a showing that the proposed action is meritorious and is not being filed for the purpose of delay or harassment. The court may condition the filing of the proposed action upon the furnishing of security as provided in this section. (5) The clerk of the court may not file any new action by a pro se vexatious litigant against whom a prefiling order has been entered unless the vexatious litigant has obtained an order from the court allowing such filing. If the clerk of the court mistakenly allows a pro se vexatious litigant to file any new action in contravention of a prefiling order, any party to that action may file with the clerk and serve on the vexatious litigant and all other parties a notice stating that the vexatious litigant is subject to a prefiling order. The filing of such a notice shall automatically stay the litigation against all parties to the action. The court shall automatically dismiss the action with prejudice within 10 days after the filing of such notice unless the vexatious litigant files a motion for leave to file the new action. If the court issues an order granting leave, the pleadings or other responses to the complaint need not be filed until 10 days after the date of service by the vexatious litigant of a copy of the order granting leave. (6) The clerk of a court must provide copies of all prefiling orders to the Clerk of the Florida Supreme Court, who must maintain a registry of all vexatious litigants. (7) An automatic stay imposed under this section remains in effect until the court: (a) In its discretion, vacates the stay; (b) Rules, as applicable, on the motion for an order to post security under paragraph (3)(d) or the motion for leave under subsection (5); or (c) Dismisses the action under subsection (5). (8) The relief provided under this section shall be cumulative to any other relief or remedy available under the laws of this state or the rules of court, including, but not limited to, the relief provided under s. 57.105.
