      "text": "212.04 Admissions tax; rate, procedure, enforcement.— (1)(a) It is hereby declared to be the legislative intent that every person is exercising a taxable privilege who sells or receives anything of value by way of admissions. (b) For the exercise of such privilege, a tax is levied at the rate of 6 percent of sales price, or the actual value received from such admissions, which 6 percent shall be added to and collected with all such admissions from the purchaser thereof, and such tax shall be paid for the exercise of the privilege as defined in the preceding paragraph. Each ticket must show on its face the actual sales price of the admission, or each dealer selling the admission must prominently display at the box office or other place where the admission charge is made a notice disclosing the price of the admission, and the tax shall be computed and collected on the basis of the actual price of the admission charged by the dealer. The sale price or actual value of admission shall, for the purpose of this chapter, be that price remaining after deduction of federal taxes and state or locally imposed or authorized seat surcharges, taxes, or fees, if any, imposed upon such admission. The sale price or actual value does not include separately stated ticket service charges that are imposed by a facility ticket office or a ticketing service and added to a separately stated, established ticket price. The rate of tax on each admission shall be according to the algorithm provided in s. 212.12. (c)1. The provisions of this chapter that authorize a tax-exempt sale for resale do not apply to sales of admissions. However, if a purchaser of an admission subsequently resells the admission for more than the amount paid, the purchaser shall collect tax on the full sales price and may take credit for the amount of tax previously paid. If the purchaser of the admission subsequently resells it for an amount equal to or less than the amount paid, the purchaser may not collect any additional tax, nor shall the purchaser be allowed to take credit for the amount of tax previously paid. 2.a. If a purchaser resells an admission to an entity that is exempt from sales and use tax under this chapter for any reason other than sale for resale, the purchaser may seek a refund or credit from the department for the amount of tax it paid on its purchase. b. For a refund, the purchaser shall provide proof of the exempt entity’s qualification for the exemption, as prescribed by rules of the department, and a copy of the ticket, invoice, or other documentation that provides evidence of the tax it paid on the admission with its refund application, whereupon the department shall issue a refund to the purchaser. c. For a credit, the purchaser shall retain proof of the exempt entity’s qualification for the exemption, as prescribed by rules of the department, and a copy of the ticket, invoice, or other documentation that provides evidence of the tax it paid on the admission as long as required under s. 212.13. d. The department shall look solely to the entity that provided exemption documentation for recovery of tax, if it determines that the entity was not entitled to the exemption. 3.a. If a purchaser of an admission from a related dealer who is a member of the same controlled group of corporations for federal income tax purposes as the purchaser resells such admission to an entity that is exempt from sales and use tax under this chapter for any reason other than sale for resale, the purchaser may seek a refund or credit for the amount of tax it paid on its purchase from the related dealer if it provides that related dealer with proof of the exempt entity’s qualification for the exemption, as prescribed by rules of the department. b. Upon the purchaser’s request, a related dealer receiving the exempt entity’s documentation shall refund or credit the tax paid by the purchaser. If the related dealer has already remitted such tax to the department, it may then seek a refund or credit of the tax from the department. If the related dealer has not yet remitted such tax to the department, the related dealer may not seek a refund or credit of such tax, but may retain the exemption documentation in lieu of remitting the tax to the department. c. The department shall look solely to the entity that provided exemption documentation for recovery of tax if it determines that the entity was not entitled to the exemption. (d) No additional tax is due on components incorporated as part of a package sold by a travel agent if the package includes two or more components such as admissions, transient rentals, transportation, or meals; if all of the components were purchased by the travel agent from other parties and any sales tax due on such purchases was paid; and if there is no separate itemization of the admission, transient rental, transportation, meal, or other components in the sales price of the package. This paragraph does not apply if the actual price charged for a component by the dealer to a travel agent is less than the price charged to unrelated parties under normal industry practices and the dealer and the travel agent are members of the same controlled group of corporations for federal income tax purposes. (2)(a) A tax may not be levied on: 1. Admissions to athletic or other events sponsored by elementary schools, junior high schools, middle schools, high schools, community colleges, public or private colleges and universities, deaf and blind schools, facilities of the youth services programs of the Department of Children and Families, and state correctional institutions if only student, faculty, or inmate talent is used. However, this exemption does not apply to admission to athletic events sponsored by a state university, and the proceeds of the tax collected on such admissions shall be retained and used by each institution to support women’s athletics as provided in s. 1006.71(2)(c). 2. Dues, membership fees, and admission charges imposed by not-for-profit sponsoring organizations. To receive this exemption, the sponsoring organization must qualify as a not-for-profit entity under s. 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended. 3. Admission charges to an event sponsored by a governmental entity, sports authority, or sports commission if held in a convention hall, exhibition hall, auditorium, stadium, theater, arena, civic center, performing arts center, or publicly owned recreational facility and if 100 percent of the risk of success or failure lies with the sponsor of the event and 100 percent of the funds at risk for the event belong to the sponsor, and student or faculty talent is not exclusively used. As used in this subparagraph, the terms “sports authority” and “sports commission” mean a nonprofit organization that is exempt from federal income tax under s. 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and that contracts with a county or municipal government for the purpose of promoting and attracting sports-tourism events to the community with which it contracts. 4. An admission paid by a student, or on the student’s behalf, to any required place of sport or recreation if the student’s participation in the sport or recreational activity is required as a part of a program or activity sponsored by, and under the jurisdiction of, the student’s educational institution if his or her attendance is as a participant and not as a spectator. 5. Admissions to the National Football League championship game or Pro Bowl; admissions to any semifinal game or championship game of a national collegiate tournament; admissions to a Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, National Basketball Association, or National Hockey League all-star game; admissions to the Major League Baseball Home Run Derby held before the Major League Baseball All-Star Game; admissions to any FIFA World Cup match sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), including any qualifying match held up to 12 months before the FIFA World Cup matches; admissions to any Formula One Grand Prix race sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile, including any qualifying or support races held at the circuit up to 72 hours before the grand prix race; admissions to the Daytona 500 sanctioned by the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR), including any qualifying or support races held at the same track up to 72 hours before the race; admissions to the NASCAR Cup Series Championship Race, sanctioned by NASCAR, when held at the Homestead-Miami Speedway, including any qualifying or support races held at the same track up to 72 hours before the race; or admissions to National Basketball Association all-star events produced by the National Basketball Association and held at a facility such as an arena, convention center, or municipal facility. 6. A participation fee or sponsorship fee imposed by a governmental entity as described in s. 212.08(6) for an athletic or recreational program if the governmental entity by itself, or in conjunction with an organization exempt under s. 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, sponsors, administers, plans, supervises, directs, and controls the athletic or recreational program. 7. Admissions to live theater, live opera, or live ballet productions in this state which are sponsored by an organization that has received a determination from the Internal Revenue Service that the organization is exempt from federal income tax under s. 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, if the organization actively participates in planning and conducting the event; is responsible for the safety and success of the event; is organized for the purpose of sponsoring live theater, live opera, or live ballet productions in this state; has more than 10,000 subscribing members and has among the stated purposes in its charter the promotion of arts education in the communities it serves; and will receive at least 20 percent of the net profits, if any, of the events the organization sponsors and will bear the risk of at least 20 percent of the losses, if any, from the events it sponsors if the organization employs other persons as agents to provide services in connection with a sponsored event. Before March 1 of each year, such organization may apply to the department for a certificate of exemption for admissions to such events sponsored in this state by the organization during the immediately following state fiscal year. The application must state the total dollar amount of admissions receipts collected by the organization or its agents from such events in this state sponsored by the organization or its agents in the year immediately preceding the year in which the organization applies for the exemption. Such organization shall receive the exemption only to the extent of $1.5 million multiplied by the ratio that such receipts bear to the total of such receipts of all organizations applying for the exemption in such year; however, such exemption granted to any organization may not exceed 6 percent of such admissions receipts collected by the organization or its agents in the year immediately preceding the year in which the organization applies for the exemption. Each organization receiving the exemption shall report each month to the department the total admissions receipts collected from such events sponsored by the organization during the preceding month and shall remit to the department an amount equal to 6 percent of such receipts reduced by any amount remaining under the exemption. Tickets for such events sold by such organizations may not reflect the tax otherwise imposed under this section. 8. Entry fees for participation in freshwater fishing tournaments. 9. Participation or entry fees charged to participants in a game, race, or other sport or recreational event if spectators are charged a taxable admission to such event. 10. Admissions to any postseason collegiate football game sanctioned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. 11. Admissions to and membership fees for gun clubs. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “gun club” means an organization whose primary purpose is to offer its members access to one or more shooting ranges for target or skeet shooting. 12. Fees for admission to state parks, including annual entrance passes. (b) No municipality of the state shall levy an excise tax on admissions. (c) The taxes imposed by this section shall be collected in addition to the admission tax collected pursuant to s. 550.0951, but the amount collected under s. 550.0951 shall not be subject to taxation under this chapter. (3) Such taxes shall be paid and remitted at the same time and in the same manner as provided for remitting taxes on sales of tangible personal property, as hereinafter provided. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the tax on admission to an event at a convention hall, exhibition hall, auditorium, stadium, theater, arena, civic center, performing arts center, or publicly owned recreational facility shall be collected at the time of payment for the admission but is not due to the department until the first day of the month following the actual date of the event for which the admission is sold and becomes delinquent on the 21st day of that month. (4) Each person who exercises the privilege of charging admission taxes, as herein defined, shall apply for, and at that time shall furnish the information and comply with the provisions of s. 212.18 not inconsistent herewith and receive from the department, a certificate of right to exercise such privilege, which certificate shall apply to each place of business where such privilege is exercised and shall be in the manner and form prescribed by the department. Such certificate shall be issued upon payment to the department of a registration fee of $5 by the applicant. Each person exercising the privilege of charging such admission taxes as herein defined shall cause to be kept records and accounts showing the admission which shall be in the form as the department may from time to time prescribe, inclusive of records of all tickets numbered and issued for a period of not less than the time within which the department may, as permitted by s. 95.091(3), make an assessment with respect to any admission evidenced by such records and accounts, and inclusive of all bills or checks of customers who are charged any of the taxes defined herein, showing the charge made to each for that period. The department is empowered to use each and every one of the powers granted herein to the department to discover the amount of tax to be paid by each such person and to enforce the payment thereof as are hereby granted the department for the discovery and enforcement of the payment of taxes hereinafter levied on the sales of tangible personal property. (5) All of the provisions of this chapter relating to collection, investigation, discovery, and aids to collection of taxes upon sales of tangible personal property shall likewise apply to all privileges described or referred to in this section, and the obligations imposed in this chapter upon retailers are hereby imposed upon the seller of such admissions. All penalties applicable to a dealer in tangible personal property for failure to meet any such obligation, including, but not limited to, any failure related to the filing of returns, the payment of taxes, or the maintenance and production of records, are applicable to the seller of admissions. When tickets or admissions are sold and not used but returned and credited by the seller, the seller may apply to the department for a credit allowance for such returned tickets or admissions if advance payments have been made by the buyer and have been returned by the seller, upon such form and in such manner as the department may from time to time prescribe. The department may, upon obtaining satisfactory proof of the refunds on the part of the seller, credit the seller for taxes paid upon admissions that have been returned unused to the purchaser of those admissions. The seller of admissions, upon the payment of the taxes before they become delinquent and the rendering of the returns in accordance with the requirement of the department and as provided in this law, shall be entitled to a discount of 2.5 percent of the amount of taxes upon the payment thereof before such taxes become delinquent, in the same manner as permitted the sellers of tangible personal property in this chapter. However, if the amount of the tax due and remitted to the department for the reporting period exceeds $1,200, no discount shall be allowed for all amounts in excess of $1,200. (6) Admission taxes required to be paid by this chapter shall be paid to the department by the owner or the collector of such admission. When any place of business is sold or transferred by any owner, wherein such admission taxes have accrued or are accruing, such owner shall be obligated before such sale becomes effective to notify the department of such pending sale and secure from the department a certificate of registration as prescribed in this section, and the purchaser shall become obligated to withhold from the sales price such sum of money as will safely be required to discharge all accrued admission taxes upon such places of business. Upon the failure of any such purchaser to withhold, he or she shall become obligated to pay all accrued admission taxes, and the same shall become a lien upon all of the purchaser’s assets until the same have been paid and fully discharged. (7) The taxes under this section shall become a lien upon the assets of the owner of any business exercising the privilege of selling admissions, and the collection of such admissions, as defined hereunder, and shall remain a lien until fully paid and discharged. Such lien may be enforced in the manner provided hereinafter for the enforcement of the collection of taxes imposed upon the sales of tangible personal property. (8) The word “owners” as used in this chapter shall be taken to include and mean all persons obligated to collect and pay over to the state the tax imposed under this section, inclusive of all holders of certificates of registration issued as herein provided. Wherever the word “owner” or “owners” is used herein, it shall be taken to mean and include all persons liable for such admission taxes unless it appears from the context that the words are descriptive of property owners.

      "text": "212.0506 Taxation of service warranties.— (1) It is the intent of the Legislature that every person is exercising a taxable privilege who engages in this state in the business of soliciting, offering, providing, entering into, issuing, or delivering any service warranty. (2) For exercising such privilege, a tax is levied on each taxable transaction or incident, which tax is due and payable at the rate of 6 percent on the total consideration received or to be received by any person for issuing and delivering any service warranty. (3) For purposes of this section, “service warranty” means any contract or agreement which indemnifies the holder of the contract or agreement for the cost of maintaining, repairing, or replacing tangible personal property. The term “service warranty” does not include contracts or agreements to repair, maintain, or replace tangible personal property if such property when sold at retail in this state would not be subject to the tax imposed by this chapter or if the parts and labor to repair tangible personal property qualify for an exemption under this chapter, nor does it include such contracts or agreements covering tangible personal property which becomes a part of real property. (4) Such tax shall be in addition to the total amount of the consideration for the service warranty, shall be charged by the person receiving such consideration from the service warranty agreement holder, and shall be due and payable by such person at the time he or she receives such consideration. Such person shall remit the tax to the department at the times and in the manner provided for dealers to remit taxes on tangible personal property under this chapter. (5) This tax is in addition to all other taxes, whether levied in the form of excise, license, or privilege taxes, and is in addition to all other fees and taxes levied. (6) This tax shall be due and payable according to the algorithm provided in s. 212.12. (7) This tax shall not apply to any portion of the consideration received by any person in connection with the issuance of any service warranty contract upon which such person is required to pay any premium tax imposed under the Florida Insurance Code or under s. 634.313(1). (8) If a transaction involves both the issuance of a service warranty that is subject to such tax and the issuance of a warranty, guaranty, extended warranty or extended guaranty, contract, agreement, or other written promise that is not subject to such tax, the consideration shall be separately identified and stated with respect to the taxable and nontaxable portions of the transaction. If the consideration is separately apportioned and identified in good faith, such tax shall apply to the transaction to the extent that the consideration received or to be received in connection with the transaction is payment for a service warranty subject to such tax. If the consideration is not apportioned in good faith, the department may reform the contract; such reformation by the department is to be considered prima facie correct, and the burden to show the contrary rests upon the dealer. If the consideration for such a transaction is not separately identified and stated, the entire transaction is taxable. (9) Any claim which arises under a service warranty taxable under this section, which claim is paid directly by the person issuing such warranty, is not subject to any tax imposed under this chapter. (10) Materials and supplies used in the performance of a factory or manufacturer’s warranty are exempt if the contract is furnished at no extra charge with the equipment guaranteed thereunder and such materials and supplies are paid for by the factory or manufacturer. (11) Any duties imposed by this chapter upon dealers of tangible personal property with respect to collecting and remitting taxes; making returns; keeping books, records, and accounts; and complying with the rules and regulations of the department apply to all dealers as defined in s. 212.06(2)(l).

The term does not include a person who is a delivery network company unless the delivery network company is a registered dealer for purposes of this chapter and the delivery network company notifies all local merchants that sell through the delivery network company’s website or mobile application that the delivery network company is subject to the requirements of a marketplace provider under this section. As used in this subparagraph, the term: a. “Delivery network company” means a person who maintains a website or mobile application used to facilitate delivery services, the sale of local products, or both. b. “Delivery network courier” means a person who provides delivery services through a delivery network company website or mobile application using a personal means of transportation, such as a motor vehicle as defined in s. 320.01(1), bicycle, scooter, or other similar means of transportation; using public transportation; or by walking. c. “Delivery services” means the pickup and delivery by a delivery network courier of one or more local products from a local merchant to a customer, which may include the selection, collection, and purchase of the local product in connection with the delivery.

(2) A marketplace provider that has a physical presence in this state or who is making or facilitating through a marketplace a substantial number of remote sales as defined in s. 212.0596(1) is a dealer for purposes of this chapter. (3) A marketplace provider that is a dealer under this chapter shall certify to its marketplace sellers that it will collect and remit the tax imposed under this chapter on taxable retail sales made through the marketplace. Such certification may be included in the agreement between the marketplace provider and the marketplace seller. (4)(a) A marketplace seller may not collect and remit the tax under this chapter on a taxable retail sale when the sale is made through the marketplace and the marketplace provider certifies, as required under subsection (3), that it will collect and remit such tax. A marketplace seller shall exclude such sales made through the marketplace from the marketplace seller’s tax return under s. 212.11. (b)1. A marketplace seller who has a physical presence in this state shall register and shall collect and remit the tax imposed under this chapter on all taxable retail sales made outside of the marketplace. 2. A marketplace seller who is not described under subparagraph 1. but who makes a substantial number of remote sales as defined in s. 212.0596(1) shall register and shall collect and remit the tax imposed under this chapter on all taxable retail sales made outside of the marketplace. For the purpose of determining whether a marketplace seller made a substantial number of remote sales, the marketplace seller shall consider only those sales made outside of a marketplace. (5)(a) A marketplace provider that is a dealer under this chapter shall allow the department to examine and audit its books and records pursuant to s. 212.13. For retail sales facilitated through a marketplace, the department may not examine or audit the books and records of marketplace sellers, nor may the department assess marketplace sellers except to the extent that the marketplace provider seeks relief under paragraph (b).

(b) The marketplace provider is relieved of liability for the tax on the retail sale and the marketplace seller or customer is liable for the tax imposed under this chapter if the marketplace provider demonstrates to the department’s satisfaction that the marketplace provider made a reasonable effort to obtain accurate information related to the retail sales facilitated through the marketplace from the marketplace seller, but that the failure to collect and remit the correct amount of tax imposed under this chapter was due to the provision of incorrect or incomplete information to the marketplace provider by the marketplace seller. This paragraph does not apply to a retail sale for which the marketplace provider is the seller if the marketplace provider and the marketplace seller are related parties or if transactions between a marketplace seller and marketplace buyer are not conducted at arm’s length. (6) For purposes of registration pursuant to s. 212.18, a marketplace is deemed a separate place of business. (7) A marketplace provider and a marketplace seller may agree by contract or otherwise that if a marketplace provider pays the tax imposed under this chapter on a retail sale facilitated through a marketplace for a marketplace seller as a result of an audit or otherwise, the marketplace provider has the right to recover such tax and any associated interest and penalties from the marketplace seller. (8) This section may not be construed to authorize the state to collect sales tax from both the marketplace provider and the marketplace seller on the same retail sale. (9) Chapter 213 applies to the administration of this section to the extent that chapter does not conflict with this section. (10) Notwithstanding any other law, the marketplace provider is also responsible for collecting and remitting any prepaid wireless public safety emergency communications systems fee under s. 365.172, waste tire fee under s. 403.718, and lead-acid battery fee under s. 403.7185 at the time of sale for taxable retail sales made through its marketplace. (11) Notwithstanding paragraph (4)(a), the marketplace provider and the marketplace seller may contractually agree to have the marketplace seller collect and remit all applicable taxes and fees if the marketplace seller: (a) Has annual United States gross sales of more than $1 billion, including the gross sales of any related entities, and in the case of franchised entities, including the combined sales of all franchisees of a single franchisor; (b) Provides evidence to the marketplace provider that it is registered under s. 212.18; and (c) Notifies the department in a manner prescribed by the department that the marketplace seller will collect and remit all applicable taxes and fees on its sales through the marketplace and is liable for failure to collect or remit applicable taxes and fees on its sales.

Only at locations that are not staffed by car-sharing service personnel employed solely for the purpose of interacting with car-sharing service members; 2. Twenty-four hours per day, 7 days per week; 3. Only through automated means, including, but not limited to, a smartphone application or an electronic membership card; 4. On an hourly basis or for a shorter increment of time; 5. Without a separate fee for refueling the motor vehicle; 6. Without a separate fee for minimum financial responsibility liability insurance; and 7. Owned or controlled by the car-sharing service or its affiliates. (b) “Motor vehicle rental company” means an entity that is in the business of providing, for financial consideration, motor vehicles to the public under a rental agreement. (c) “Peer-to-peer car-sharing program” has the same meaning as in s. 627.7483(1). (2) Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4), a surcharge of $2 per day or any part of a day is imposed upon the lease or rental by a motor vehicle rental company of a motor vehicle that is licensed for hire and designed to carry fewer than nine passengers, regardless of whether the motor vehicle is licensed in this state, for financial consideration and without transfer of the title of the motor vehicle. The surcharge is imposed regardless of whether the lease or rental occurs in person or through digital means. The surcharge applies to only the first 30 days of the term of a lease or rental and must be collected by the motor vehicle rental company. The surcharge is subject to all applicable taxes imposed by this chapter. (3) A surcharge of $1 per day or any part of a day is imposed upon each peer-to-peer car-sharing program agreement involving a shared vehicle that is registered in this state and designed to carry fewer than nine passengers for financial consideration and without transfer of the title of the shared vehicle. If the duration of the car-sharing period for a peer-to-peer car-sharing program agreement subject to the surcharge established pursuant to this section is less than 24 hours, the applicable surcharge will be $1 per usage. The surcharge applies to the first 30 days only of a car-sharing period for any peer-to-peer car-sharing program agreement to which the surcharge applies and must be collected by the peer-to-peer car-sharing program. The surcharge is subject to all applicable taxes imposed by this chapter. (4) A member of a car-sharing service who uses a motor vehicle as described in subsection (2) for less than 24 hours pursuant to an agreement with the car-sharing service shall pay a surcharge of $1 per usage. A member of a car-sharing service who uses the same motor vehicle for 24 hours or more shall pay a surcharge of $2 per day or any part of a day as provided in subsection (2). The car-sharing service shall collect the surcharge. The surcharge imposed under this subsection does not apply to the lease, rental, or use of a motor vehicle from a location owned, operated, or leased by or for the benefit of an airport or airport authority. (5)(a) Notwithstanding s. 212.20, and less the costs of administration, 80 percent of the proceeds of this surcharge shall be deposited in the State Transportation Trust Fund, 15.75 percent of the proceeds of this surcharge shall be deposited in the Tourism Promotional Trust Fund created in s. 288.122, and 4.25 percent of the proceeds of this surcharge shall be deposited in the Florida International Trade and Promotion Trust Fund. For the purposes of this subsection, the term “proceeds of this surcharge” means all funds collected and received by the department under this section, including interest and penalties on delinquent surcharges. The department shall provide the Department of Transportation rental car surcharge revenue information for the previous state fiscal year by September 1 of each year. (b) Notwithstanding any other law, the proceeds deposited in the State Transportation Trust Fund shall be allocated on an annual basis in the Department of Transportation’s work program to each department district, except the Turnpike District. The amount allocated to each district shall be based on the amount of proceeds attributed to the counties within each respective district. (6)(a) Except as provided in this section, the department shall administer, collect, and enforce the surcharges as provided in this chapter. (b) The department shall require a dealer to report surcharge collections according to the county to which the surcharge was attributed. For purposes of this section, the surcharge shall be attributed to the county in which the rental agreement was entered into, except that, for peer-to-peer car-sharing, the surcharge shall be attributable to the county corresponding to the location of the motor vehicle at the car-sharing start time.

The provisions of this chapter which apply to interest and penalties on delinquent taxes apply to the surcharge. The surcharge shall not be included in the calculation of estimated taxes pursuant to s. 212.11. The dealer’s credit provided in s. 212.12 does not apply to any amount collected under this section.

      "text": "212.097 Urban High-Crime Area Job Tax Credit Program.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Eligible business” means any sole proprietorship, firm, partnership, or corporation that is located in a qualified county and is predominantly engaged in, or is headquarters for a business predominantly engaged in, activities usually provided for consideration by firms classified within the following standard industrial classifications: SIC 01-SIC 09 (agriculture, forestry, and fishing); SIC 20-SIC 39 (manufacturing); SIC 52-SIC 57 and SIC 59 (retail); SIC 422 (public warehousing and storage); SIC 70 (hotels and other lodging places); SIC 7391 (research and development); SIC 781 (motion picture production and allied services); SIC 7992 (public golf courses); and SIC 7996 (amusement parks). A call center or similar customer service operation that services a multistate market or international market is also an eligible business. In addition, the Department of Commerce may, as part of its final budget request submitted pursuant to s. 216.023, recommend additions to or deletions from the list of standard industrial classifications used to determine an eligible business, and the Legislature may implement such recommendations. Excluded from eligible receipts are receipts from retail sales, except such receipts for SIC 52-SIC 57 and SIC 59 (retail) hotels and other lodging places classified in SIC 70, public golf courses in SIC 7992, and amusement parks in SIC 7996. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “predominantly” means that more than 50 percent of the business’s gross receipts from all sources is generated by those activities usually provided for consideration by firms in the specified standard industrial classification. The determination of whether the business is located in a qualified high-crime area and the tier ranking of that area must be based on the date of application for the credit under this section. Commonly owned and controlled entities are to be considered a single business entity. (b) “Qualified employee” means any employee of an eligible business who performs duties in connection with the operations of the business on a regular, full-time basis for an average of at least 36 hours per week for at least 3 months within the qualified high-crime area in which the eligible business is located. An owner or partner of the eligible business is not a qualified employee. The term also includes an employee leased from an employee leasing company licensed under chapter 468, if such employee has been continuously leased to the employer for an average of at least 36 hours per week for more than 6 months. (c) “New business” means any eligible business first beginning operation on a site in a qualified high-crime area and clearly separate from any other commercial or business operation of the business entity within a qualified high-crime area. A business entity that operated an eligible business within a qualified high-crime area within the 48 months before the period provided for application by subsection (2) is not considered a new business. (d) “Existing business” means any eligible business that does not meet the criteria for a new business. (e) “Qualified high-crime area” means an area selected by the Department of Commerce in the following manner: every third year, the Department of Commerce shall rank and tier those areas nominated under subsection (7), according to the following prioritized criteria: 1. Highest arrest rates within the geographic area for violent crime and for such other crimes as drug sale, drug possession, prostitution, vandalism, and civil disturbances; 2. Highest reported crime volume and rate of specific property crimes such as business and residential burglary, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism; 3. Highest percentage of reported index crimes that are violent in nature; 4. Highest overall index crime volume for the area; and 5. Highest overall index crime rate for the geographic area. Tier-one areas are ranked 1 through 5 and represent the highest crime areas according to this ranking. Tier-two areas are ranked 6 through 10 according to this ranking. Tier-three areas are ranked 11 through 15. Notwithstanding this definition, “qualified high-crime area” also means an area that has been designated as a federal Empowerment Zone pursuant to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Such a designated area is ranked in tier three until the areas are reevaluated by the Department of Commerce. (2) A new eligible business may apply for a tax credit under this subsection once at any time during its first year of operation. A new eligible business in a tier-one qualified high-crime area which has at least 10 qualified employees on the date of application shall receive a $1,500 tax credit for each such employee. A new eligible business in a tier-two qualified high-crime area which has at least 20 qualified employees on the date of application shall receive a $1,000 tax credit for each such employee. A new eligible business in a tier-three qualified high-crime area which has at least 30 qualified employees on the date of application shall receive a $500 tax credit for each such employee. (3)(a) An existing eligible business may apply for a tax credit under this subsection at any time it is entitled to such credit, except as restricted by this subsection. An existing eligible business in a tier-one qualified high-crime area which on the date of application has at least 5 more qualified employees than it had 1 year prior to its date of application shall receive a $1,500 tax credit for each such additional employee. An existing eligible business in a tier-two qualified high-crime area which on the date of application has at least 10 more qualified employees than it had 1 year prior to its date of application shall receive a $1,000 credit for each such additional employee. An existing business in a tier-three qualified high-crime area which on the date of application has at least 15 more qualified employees than it had 1 year prior to its date of application shall receive a $500 tax credit for each such additional employee. An existing eligible business may apply for the credit under this subsection no more than once in any 12-month period. Any existing eligible business that received a credit under subsection (2) may not apply for the credit under this subsection sooner than 12 months after the application date for the credit under subsection (2). (b) An existing eligible business that filed an application for a tax credit under this subsection on or after January 1, 2009, and was denied because of the limitation set forth in subsection (5) at the time of such application, may refile the application on or before December 31, 2012, if the number of qualified employees employed on the day the denied application is refiled is no lower than the number of qualified employees on the day the denied application was initially filed. Any credit resulting from the refiled application is subject to the aggregate limitation set forth in subsection (10) for the calendar year 2012. For purposes of applying the tax credit eligibility determination required by this section to the refiled application, the terms “date of application” and “application date” mean the date the denied application was initially filed. (4) For any new eligible business receiving a credit pursuant to subsection (2), an additional $500 credit shall be provided for any qualified employee who is a welfare transition program participant. For any existing eligible business receiving a credit pursuant to subsection (3), an additional $500 credit shall be provided for any qualified employee who is a welfare transition program participant. Such employee must be employed on the application date and have been employed less than 1 year. This credit shall be in addition to other credits pursuant to this section regardless of the tier-level of the high-crime area. Appropriate documentation concerning the eligibility of an employee for this credit must be submitted as determined by the Department of Revenue. (5) To be eligible for a tax credit under subsection (3), the number of qualified employees employed 1 year before the application date must be no lower than the number of qualified employees on January 1, 2009, or on the application date on which a credit under this section was based for any previous application, including an application under subsection (2). (6) Any county or municipality, or a county and one or more municipalities together, may apply to the Department of Commerce for the designation of an area as a high-crime area after the adoption by the governing body or bodies of a resolution that: (a) Finds that a high-crime area exists in such county or municipality, or in both the county and one or more municipalities, which chronically exhibits extreme and unacceptable levels of poverty, unemployment, physical deterioration, and economic disinvestment; (b) Determines that the rehabilitation, conservation, or redevelopment, or a combination thereof, of such a high-crime area is necessary in the interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of such county or municipality, or such county and one or more municipalities; and (c) Determines that the revitalization of such a high-crime area can occur if the public sector or private sector can be induced to invest its own resources in productive enterprises that build or rebuild the economic viability of the area. (7) The governing body of the entity nominating the area shall provide to the Department of Commerce the following: (a) The overall index crime rate for the geographic area; (b) The overall index crime volume for the area; (c) The percentage of reported index crimes that are violent in nature; (d) The reported crime volume and rate of specific property crimes such as business and residential burglary, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism; and (e) The arrest rates within the geographic area for violent crime and for such other crimes as drug sale, drug possession, prostitution, disorderly conduct, vandalism, and other public-order offenses. (8) A municipality, or a county and one or more municipalities together, may not nominate more than one high-crime area. However, any county as defined by s. 125.011(1) may nominate no more than three high-crime areas. (9) An area nominated by a county or municipality, or a county and one or more municipalities together, for designation as a high-crime area shall be eligible only if it meets the following criteria: (a) The selected area does not exceed 20 square miles and either has a continuous boundary or consists of not more than three noncontiguous parcels; (b) The selected area does not exceed the following mileage limitation: 1. For communities having a total population of 150,000 persons or more, the selected area does not exceed 20 square miles. 2. For communities having a total population of 50,000 persons or more, but fewer than 150,000 persons, the selected area does not exceed 10 square miles. 3. For communities having a total population of 20,000 persons or more, but fewer than 50,000 persons, the selected area does not exceed 5 square miles. 4. For communities having a total population of fewer than 20,000 persons, the selected area does not exceed 3 square miles. (10)(a) In order to claim this credit, an eligible business must file under oath with the Department of Commerce a statement that includes the name and address of the eligible business and any other information that is required to process the application. (b) Applications shall be reviewed and certified pursuant to s. 288.061. (c) The maximum credit amount that may be approved during any calendar year is $5 million, of which $1 million shall be exclusively reserved for tier-one areas. The Department of Revenue, in conjunction with the Department of Commerce, shall notify the governing bodies in areas designated as urban high-crime areas when the $5 million maximum amount has been reached. Applications must be considered for approval in the order in which they are received without regard to whether the credit is for a new or existing business. This limitation applies to the value of the credit as contained in approved applications. Approved credits may be taken in the time and manner allowed pursuant to this section. (11) If the application is insufficient to support the credit authorized in this section, the Department of Commerce shall deny the credit and notify the business of that fact. The business may reapply for this credit within 3 months after such notification. (12) If the credit under this section is greater than can be taken on a single tax return, excess amounts may be taken as credits on any tax return submitted within 12 months after the approval of the application by the department. (13) It is the responsibility of each business to affirmatively demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department of Revenue that it meets the requirements of this section. (14) Any person who fraudulently claims this credit is liable for repayment of the credit plus a mandatory penalty of 100 percent of the credit and is guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (15) A corporation may take the credit under this section against its corporate income tax liability, as provided in s. 220.1895. However, a corporation that applies its job tax credit against the tax imposed by chapter 220 may not receive the credit provided for in this section. A credit may be taken against only one tax.

In addition, the Department of Commerce may, as part of its final budget request submitted pursuant to s. 216.023, recommend additions to or deletions from the list of standard industrial classifications used to determine an eligible business, and the Legislature may implement such recommendations. Excluded from eligible receipts are receipts from retail sales, except such receipts for hotels and other lodging places classified in SIC 70, public golf courses in SIC 7992, and amusement parks in SIC 7996. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “predominantly” means that more than 50 percent of the business’s gross receipts from all sources is generated by those activities usually provided for consideration by firms in the specified standard industrial classification. The determination of whether the business is located in a qualified county and the tier ranking of that county must be based on the date of application for the credit under this section. Commonly owned and controlled entities are to be considered a single business entity. (b) “Qualified employee” means any employee of an eligible business who performs duties in connection with the operations of the business on a regular, full-time basis for an average of at least 36 hours per week for at least 3 months within the qualified county in which the eligible business is located. The term also includes an employee leased from an employee leasing company licensed under chapter 468, if such employee has been continuously leased to the employer for an average of at least 36 hours per week for more than 6 months. An owner or partner of the eligible business is not a qualified employee. (c) “Qualified area” means any area that is contained within a rural area of opportunity designated under s. 288.0656, a county that has a population of fewer than 75,000 persons, or a county that has a population of 125,000 or less and is contiguous to a county that has a population of less than 75,000, selected in the following manner: every third year, the Department of Commerce shall rank and tier the state’s counties according to the following four factors: 1. Highest unemployment rate for the most recent 36-month period. 2. Lowest per capita income for the most recent 36-month period. 3. Highest percentage of residents whose incomes are below the poverty level, based upon the most recent data available. 4. Average weekly manufacturing wage, based upon the most recent data available. (d) “New business” means any eligible business first beginning operation on a site in a qualified county and clearly separate from any other commercial or business operation of the business entity within a qualified county. A business entity that operated an eligible business within a qualified county within the 48 months before the period provided for application by subsection (2) is not considered a new business. (e) “Existing business” means any eligible business that does not meet the criteria for a new business. (2) A new eligible business may apply for a tax credit under this subsection once at any time during its first year of operation. A new eligible business in a qualified area that has at least 10 qualified employees on the date of application shall receive a $1,000 tax credit for each such employee. (3) An existing eligible business may apply for a tax credit under this subsection at any time it is entitled to such credit, except as restricted by this subsection. An existing eligible business with fewer than 50 employees in a qualified area that on the date of application has at least 20 percent more qualified employees than it had 1 year prior to its date of application shall receive a $1,000 tax credit for each such additional employee. An existing eligible business that has 50 employees or more in a qualified area that, on the date of application, has at least 10 more qualified employees than it had 1 year prior to its date of application shall receive a $1,000 tax credit for each additional employee. Any existing eligible business that received a credit under subsection (2) may not apply for the credit under this subsection sooner than 12 months after the application date for the credit under subsection (2). (4) For any new eligible business receiving a credit pursuant to subsection (2), an additional $500 credit shall be provided for any qualified employee who is a welfare transition program participant. For any existing eligible business receiving a credit pursuant to subsection (3), an additional $500 credit shall be provided for any qualified employee who is a welfare transition program participant. Such employee must be employed on the application date and have been employed less than 1 year. This credit shall be in addition to other credits pursuant to this section regardless of the tier-level of the county. Appropriate documentation concerning the eligibility of an employee for this credit must be submitted as determined by the department. (5) To be eligible for a tax credit under subsection (3), the number of qualified employees employed 1 year prior to the application date must be no lower than the number of qualified employees on the application date on which a credit under this section was based for any previous application, including an application under subsection (2). (6)(a) In order to claim this credit, an eligible business must file under oath with the Department of Commerce a statement that includes the name and address of the eligible business, the starting salary or hourly wages paid to the new employee, and any other information that the Department of Revenue requires. (b) Pursuant to the incentive review process under s. 288.061, the Department of Commerce shall review the application to determine whether it contains all the information required by this subsection and meets the criteria set out in this section. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c), the Department of Commerce shall approve all applications that contain the information required by this subsection and meet the criteria set out in this section as eligible to receive a credit. (c) The maximum credit amount that may be approved during any calendar year is $5 million. The Department of Revenue, in conjunction with the Department of Commerce, shall notify the governing bodies in areas designated as qualified counties when the $5 million maximum amount has been reached. Applications must be considered for approval in the order in which they are received without regard to whether the credit is for a new or existing business. This limitation applies to the value of the credit as contained in approved applications. Approved credits may be taken in the time and manner allowed pursuant to this section. (d) A business may not receive more than $500,000 of tax credits under this section during any one calendar year. (7) If the application is insufficient to support the credit authorized in this section, the Department of Commerce shall deny the credit and notify the business of that fact. The business may reapply for this credit within 3 months after such notification. (8) If the credit under this section is greater than can be taken on a single tax return, excess amounts may be taken as credits on any tax return submitted within 12 months after the approval of the application by the department. (9) It is the responsibility of each business to affirmatively demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department of Revenue that it meets the requirements of this section. (10) Any person who fraudulently claims this credit is liable for repayment of the credit plus a mandatory penalty of 100 percent of the credit and is guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (11) A corporation may take the credit under this section against its corporate income tax liability, as provided in s. 220.1895. However, a corporation that uses its job tax credit against the tax imposed by chapter 220 may not receive the credit provided for in this section. A credit may be taken against only one tax. (12) A new or existing eligible business that receives a tax credit under subsection (2) or subsection (3) is eligible for a tax refund of up to 50 percent of the amount of sales tax on purchases of electricity paid by the business during the 1-year period after the date the credit is received. The total amount of tax refunds approved pursuant to this subsection may not exceed $600,000 during any calendar year. The department may adopt rules to administer this subsection.

      "text": "212.11 Tax returns and regulations.— (1)(a) Each dealer shall calculate his or her estimated tax liability for any month by one of the following methods: 1. Sixty percent of the current month’s liability pursuant to this chapter as shown on the tax return; 2. Sixty percent of the tax reported on the tax return pursuant to this chapter by a dealer for the taxable transactions occurring during the corresponding month of the preceding calendar year; or 3. Sixty percent of the average tax liability pursuant to this chapter for those months during the preceding calendar year in which the dealer reported taxable transactions. (b)1. For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of tax payable under this chapter, it shall be the duty of all dealers to file a return and remit the tax, on or before the 20th day of the month, to the department, upon forms prepared and furnished by it or in a format prescribed by it. Such return must show the rentals, admissions, gross sales, or purchases, as the case may be, arising from all leases, rentals, admissions, sales, or purchases taxable under this chapter during the preceding calendar month. 2. Notwithstanding subparagraph 1. and in addition to any extension or waiver ordered pursuant to s. 213.055, and except as provided in subparagraph 3., a dealer with a certificate of registration issued under s. 212.18 to engage in or conduct business in a county to which an emergency declaration applies in sub-subparagraph b. is granted an automatic 10-calendar-day extension after the due date for filing a return and remitting the tax if all of the following conditions are met: a. The Governor has ordered or proclaimed a declaration of a state of emergency pursuant to s. 252.36. b. The declaration is the first declaration for the event giving rise to the state of emergency or expands the counties covered by the initial state of emergency without extending or renewing the period of time covered by the first declaration of a state of emergency. c. The first day of the period covered by the first declaration for the event giving rise to the state of emergency is within 5 business days before the 20th day of the month. 3. For purposes of subparagraph 2., a dealer who files a consolidated sales and use tax return will be considered to have a certificate of registration in a county to which an emergency declaration applies when the central or main office of the consolidated account is in a county to which an emergency declaration applies. (c) However, the department may require: 1. A quarterly return and payment when the tax remitted by the dealer for the preceding four calendar quarters did not exceed $1,000. 2. A semiannual return and payment when the tax remitted by the dealer for the preceding four calendar quarters did not exceed $500. 3. An annual return and payment when the tax remitted by the dealer for the preceding four calendar quarters did not exceed $100. 4. A quarterly return and monthly payment when the tax remitted by the dealer for the preceding four calendar quarters exceeded $1,000 but did not exceed $12,000. The department is authorized to allow a dealer filing returns and paying tax under subparagraph 1., subparagraph 2., subparagraph 3., or subparagraph 4. to continue to use the same filing frequency, even though the dealer has paid tax in a filing period that is greater than the maximum amount allowed for such period. The dealer must submit a written request to the department to be continued on the same filing frequency, and such request must be based on an explanation that the tax amount submitted represents nonrecurring business activity. (d) The department may authorize dealers who are newly required to file returns and pay tax quarterly to file returns and remit the tax for the 3-month periods ending in February, May, August, and November, and may authorize dealers who are newly required to file returns and pay tax semiannually to file returns and remit the tax for the 6-month periods ending in May and November. (e) The department shall accept returns, except those required to be initiated through an electronic data interchange, as timely if postmarked on or before the 20th day of the month; if the 20th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or state legal holiday, returns shall be accepted as timely if postmarked on the next succeeding workday. Any dealer who operates two or more places of business for which returns are required to be filed with the department and maintains records for such places of business in a central office or place shall have the privilege on each reporting date of filing a consolidated return for all such places of business in lieu of separate returns for each such place of business; however, such consolidated returns must clearly indicate the amounts collected within each county of the state. Any dealer who files a consolidated return shall calculate his or her estimated tax liability for each county by the same method the dealer uses to calculate his or her estimated tax liability on the consolidated return as a whole. Each dealer shall file a return for each tax period even though no tax is due for such period. (f)1. A taxpayer who is required to remit taxes by electronic funds transfer shall make a return in a manner that is initiated through an electronic data interchange. The acceptable method of transfer, the method, form, and content of the electronic data interchange, giving due regard to developing uniform standards for formats as adopted by the American National Standards Institute, the circumstances under which an electronic data interchange shall serve as a substitute for the filing of another form of return, and the means, if any, by which taxpayers will be provided with acknowledgments, shall be as prescribed by the department. The department must accept such returns as timely if initiated and accepted on or before the 20th day of the month. If the 20th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or state legal holiday, returns must be accepted as timely if initiated and accepted on the next succeeding workday. 2. The department may waive the requirement to make a return through an electronic data interchange due to problems arising from the taxpayer’s computer capabilities, data systems changes, and taxpayer operating procedures. To obtain a waiver, the taxpayer shall demonstrate in writing to the department that such circumstances exist. (2) Gross proceeds from rentals or leases of tangible personal property shall be reported and the tax shall be paid with respect thereto in accordance with such rules and regulations as the department may prescribe. (3) Except as otherwise expressly provided for herein, it is hereby declared to be the intention of this chapter to impose a tax on the gross proceeds of all leases and rentals of tangible personal property in this state when the lease or rental is a part of the regularly established business, or the same is incidental or germane thereto. (4)(a) Each dealer who is subject to the tax imposed by this chapter and who paid such tax for the preceding state fiscal year in an amount greater than or equal to $200,000 shall calculate the amount of estimated tax due pursuant to this section for any month as provided in paragraph (1)(a). (b)1. The amount of any estimated tax shall be due, payable, and remitted by electronic funds transfer by the 20th day of the month for which it is estimated. The difference between the amount of estimated tax paid and the actual amount of tax due under this chapter for such month shall be due and payable by the first day of the following month and remitted by electronic funds transfer by the 20th day thereof. 2. Notwithstanding subparagraph 1. and in addition to any extension or waiver ordered pursuant to s. 213.055, and except as provided in subparagraph 3., a dealer with a certificate of registration issued under s. 212.18 to engage in or conduct business in a county to which an emergency declaration applies in sub-subparagraph b. is granted an automatic 10-calendar-day extension after the due date for filing a return and remitting the tax if all of the following conditions are met: a. The Governor has ordered or proclaimed a declaration of a state of emergency pursuant to s. 252.36. b. The declaration is the first declaration for the event giving rise to the state of emergency or expands the counties covered by the initial state of emergency without extending or renewing the period of time covered by the first declaration of a state of emergency. c. The first day of the period covered by the first declaration for the event giving rise to the state of emergency is within 5 business days before the 20th day of the month. 3. For purposes of subparagraph 2., a dealer who files a consolidated sales and use tax return will be considered to have a certificate of registration in a county to which an emergency declaration applies when the central or main office of the consolidated account is in a county to which an emergency declaration applies. (c) Any dealer who is eligible to file a consolidated return and who paid the tax imposed by this chapter for the immediately preceding state fiscal year in an amount greater than or equal to $200,000 or would have paid the tax in such amount if he or she had filed a consolidated return shall be subject to the provisions of this subsection notwithstanding an election by the dealer in any month to file a separate return. (d) A dealer engaged in the business of selling boats, motor vehicles, or aircraft who made at least one sale of a boat, motor vehicle, or aircraft with a sales price of $200,000 or greater in the previous state fiscal year may qualify for payment of estimated sales tax pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph. To qualify, a dealer must apply annually to the department prior to October 1, and, if qualified, the department must grant the application for payment of estimated sales tax pursuant to this paragraph for the following calendar year. In lieu of the method for calculating estimated sales tax liability pursuant to subparagraph (1)(a)3., a qualified dealer must calculate that option as 60 percent of the average tax liability pursuant to this chapter for all sales excluding the sale of each boat, motor vehicle, or aircraft with a sales price of $200,000 or greater during the state fiscal year ending the year in which the application is made. A qualified dealer must also remit the sales tax for each sale of a boat, motor vehicle, or aircraft with a sales price of $200,000 or greater by either electronic funds transfer on the date of the sale or on a form prescribed by the department and postmarked on the date of the sale. (e) The penalty provisions of this chapter, except s. 212.12(2)(f), apply to the provisions of this subsection. (f) A marketplace provider that is a dealer under this chapter or a person who is required to collect and remit sales tax on remote sales shall file returns and pay taxes by electronic means under s. 213.755. (5)(a) Each dealer that claims any credits granted in this chapter against that dealer’s sales and use tax liabilities shall submit to the department, upon request, documentation that provides all of the information required to verify the dealer’s entitlement to such credits, excluding credits authorized pursuant to the provisions of s. 212.17. All information must be broken down as prescribed by the department and shall be submitted in a manner that enables the department to verify that the credits are allowable by law. With respect to any credit that is granted in the form of a refund of previously paid taxes, supporting documentation must be provided with the application for refund and the penalty provisions of paragraph (c) do not apply. (b) The department shall adopt rules regarding the forms and documentation required to verify credits against sales and use tax liabilities and the format in which documentation is to be submitted, which format may include magnetic tape or other means of electronic transmission. (c) The department shall disallow any credit that is not supported by the information required under this subsection. In addition, the disallowed credit or any part of the credit disallowed is subject to a mandatory penalty of 25 percent and interest as provided for in s. 212.12. A specific penalty of 25 percent of the otherwise available credit shall be applied to any credit for which the required information report is not received within 30 days after a written request from the department.

(b) A registered dealer that purchases property for the dealer’s own use, pays tax on acquisition, and sells the property subsequent to acquisition without having used the property is entitled to reimbursement, in the manner prescribed by the department, of the amount of tax paid on the property’s acquisition. (c) If the tax has not been remitted by a dealer to the department, the dealer may deduct the same in submitting his or her return upon receipt of a signed statement by the dealer as to the gross amount of such refunds during the period covered by the signed statement, which may not be longer than 90 days. The department shall issue to the dealer an official credit memorandum equal to the net amount remitted by the dealer for such tax collected or paid. Such memorandum shall be accepted by the department at full face value from the dealer to whom it is issued upon the remittance of subsequent taxes accrued under this chapter. If a dealer has retired from business and filed a final return, a refund of tax may be made if it can be established to the satisfaction of the department that the tax was not due. (2) A dealer who has paid the tax imposed by this chapter on tangible personal property sold under a retained title, conditional sale, or similar contract, or under a contract in which the dealer retains a security interest in the property pursuant to chapter 679, may take credit or obtain a refund for the tax paid by the dealer on the unpaid balance due him or her when he or she repossesses the property, with or without judicial process, within 12 months after the month in which the property was repossessed. If such repossessed property is resold, the sale is subject in all respects to the tax imposed by this chapter. (3) Except as provided in subsection (4), a dealer who has paid the tax imposed by this chapter on tangible personal property or services may take a credit or obtain a refund for any tax paid by the dealer on the unpaid balance due on worthless accounts within 12 months after the month in which the bad debt has been charged off for federal income tax purposes. If any accounts so charged off for which a credit or refund has been obtained are subsequently, in whole or in part, paid to the dealer, the amount so paid shall be included in the first return filed after such collection and the tax paid accordingly. (4) With respect to the payment of taxes on purchases made through a private-label credit card program: (a) If consumer accounts or receivables are found to be worthless or uncollectible, the dealer may claim a credit for, or obtain a refund of, the tax remitted by the dealer on the unpaid balance due if: 1. The accounts or receivables have been charged off as bad debt on the lender’s books and records on or after January 1, 2014; 2. A credit was not previously claimed and a refund was not previously allowed on any portion of the accounts or receivables; and 3. The credit or refund is claimed within 12 months after the month in which the bad debt has been charged off by the lender for federal income tax purposes. (b) If the dealer or the lender subsequently collects, in whole or in part, the accounts or receivables for which a credit or refund has been granted under paragraph (a), the dealer shall include the taxable percentage of the amount collected in the first return filed after the collection and pay the tax on the portion of that amount for which a credit or refund was granted. (c) The credit or refund allowed includes all credit sale transaction amounts that are outstanding in the specific private-label credit card account or receivable at the time the account or receivable is charged off, regardless of the date on which the credit sale transaction actually occurred. (d) A dealer must use one of the following methods to determine the amount of the credit or refund: 1. An apportionment method to substantiate the amount of tax imposed under this chapter which is included in the bad debt to which the credit or refund applies. The method must use the dealer’s Florida and non-Florida sales, the dealer’s taxable and nontaxable sales, and the amount of tax the dealer remitted to this state; or 2. A specified percentage of the accounts or receivables giving rise to the credit or refund, which is derived from a sampling of the dealer’s or lender’s records in accordance with a methodology agreed upon by the department and the dealer. (e) For purposes of computing the credit or refund, payments on the accounts or receivables shall be allocated based on the terms and conditions of the contract between the dealer or lender and the consumer. (f) The credit or refund for tax on bad debt may be claimed on any return filed by an entity related by a direct or indirect common ownership of 50 percent or more. (g) The amount of the credit or refund that a dealer is eligible to recover under this subsection is limited to 64.4 percent of the tax paid to the department which is attributable to bad debt. (h) As used in this subsection, the term: 1. “Dealer’s affiliates” means an entity affiliated with the dealer under 26 U.S.C. s. 1504 or an entity that would be an affiliate under that section if the entity were a corporation. 2. “Lender” means a person who owns or has owned a private-label credit card account or an interest in a private-label credit card receivable that: a. The person purchased directly from a dealer who remitted the tax imposed under this chapter or from the dealer’s affiliates, or that was transferred from a third party; b. The person originated pursuant to that person’s contract with a dealer who remitted the tax imposed under this chapter or with the dealer’s affiliates; or c. Is affiliated in the manner described under 26 U.S.C. s. 1504, regardless of whether the different entities are corporations, with a person described in sub-subparagraph a. or sub-subparagraph b. or with an assignee or other transferee of such person. 3. “Private-label credit card” means a charge card or credit card that carries, refers to, or is branded with the name or logo of a dealer and can be used for purchases from the dealer whose name or logo appears on the card or for purchases from the dealer’s affiliates or franchises. (5) If admissions, license fees, rental payments, or payments for services are made and returned to payors after the taxes have been paid, the department shall return or credit the taxpayer for taxes paid on the moneys returned in the same manner as provided for returns or credits of taxes if purchases or tangible personal property are returnable to a dealer. (6) The department shall: (a) Design, prepare, print and furnish to all dealers, except dealers filing through electronic data interchange, or make available or prescribe to the dealers, all necessary forms for filing returns and instructions to ensure a full collection from dealers and an accounting for the taxes due. The failure of a dealer to secure such forms does not relieve the dealer from the payment of the tax at the time and in the manner provided. (b) Prescribe the format and instructions necessary for filing returns in a manner that is initiated through an electronic data interchange to ensure a full collection from dealers and an accounting for the taxes due. The failure of a dealer to use such format does not relieve the dealer from the payment of the tax at the time and in the manner provided. (7) The department and its assistants are authorized and empowered to administer the oath for the purpose of enforcing and administering this chapter. (8) The department may adopt rules to administer and enforce this section.

(2) The department shall administer and enforce the assessment and collection of the taxes, interest, and penalties imposed by this chapter. It has authority to adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 to enforce the provisions of this chapter in order that there shall not be collected on the average more than the rate levied herein. The department is authorized to and it shall provide by rule a method for accomplishing this end. It shall prepare instructions to all persons required by this chapter to collect and remit the tax to guide such persons in the proper collection and remission of such tax and to instruct such persons in the practices that may be necessary for the purpose of enforcement of this chapter and the collection of the tax imposed hereby. The use of tokens in the collection of this tax is hereby expressly forbidden and prohibited. (3)(a) A person desiring to engage in or conduct business in this state as a dealer, or to lease, rent, or let or grant licenses in living quarters or sleeping or housekeeping accommodations in hotels, apartment houses, roominghouses, or tourist or trailer camps that are subject to tax under s. 212.03, and a person who sells or receives anything of value by way of admissions, must file with the department an application for a certificate of registration for each place of business. The application must include the names of the persons who have interests in such business and their residences, the address of the business, and other data reasonably required by the department. However, owners and operators of vending machines or newspaper rack machines are required to obtain only one certificate of registration for each county in which such machines are located. The department, by rule, may authorize a dealer that uses independent sellers to sell its merchandise to remit tax on the retail sales price charged to the ultimate consumer in lieu of having the independent seller register as a dealer and remit the tax. The department may appoint the county tax collector as the department’s agent to accept applications for registrations. The application must be submitted to the department before the person, firm, copartnership, or corporation may engage in such business. (b) The department, upon receipt of such application, shall grant to the applicant a separate certificate of registration for each place of business, which may be canceled by the department or its designated assistants for any failure by the certificateholder to comply with this chapter. The certificate is not assignable and is valid only for the person, firm, copartnership, or corporation to which it is issued. The certificate must be placed in a conspicuous place in the business or businesses for which it is issued and must be displayed at all times. Except as provided in this subsection, a person may not engage in business as a dealer or in leasing, renting, or letting of or granting licenses in living quarters or sleeping or housekeeping accommodations in hotels, apartment houses, roominghouses, or tourist or trailer camps, or sell or receive anything of value by way of admissions, without a valid certificate. A person may not receive a license from any authority within the state to engage in any such business without a valid certificate. A person may not engage in the business of selling or leasing tangible personal property or services as a dealer; engage in leasing, renting, or letting of or granting licenses in living quarters or sleeping or housekeeping accommodations in hotels, apartment houses, roominghouses, or tourist or trailer camps that are taxable under this chapter; or engage in the business of selling or receiving anything of value by way of admissions without a valid certificate. (c) A marketplace provider that is a dealer under this chapter or a person who is required to collect and remit sales tax on remote sales must file with the department an application for a certificate of registration electronically. (d)1. A person who engages in acts requiring a certificate of registration under this subsection and who fails or refuses to register commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. Such acts are subject to injunctive proceedings as provided by law. A person who engages in acts requiring a certificate of registration and who fails or refuses to register is also subject to a $100 registration fee. However, the department may waive the registration fee if it finds that the failure to register was due to reasonable cause and not to willful negligence, willful neglect, or fraud. 2.a. A person who willfully fails to register after the department provides notice of the duty to register as a dealer commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. b. The department shall provide written notice of the duty to register to the person by personal service or by sending notice by registered mail to the person’s last known address. The department may provide written notice by both methods described in this sub-subparagraph. (e) In addition to the certificate of registration, the department shall provide to each newly registered dealer an initial resale certificate that will be valid for the remainder of the period of issuance. The department shall provide each active dealer with an annual resale certificate. For purposes of this section, the term “active dealer” means a person who is currently registered with the department and who is required to file at least once during each applicable reporting period. (f) The department may revoke a dealer’s certificate of registration if the dealer fails to comply with this chapter. Before revocation of a dealer’s certificate of registration, the department must schedule an informal conference at which the dealer may present evidence regarding the department’s intended revocation or enter into a compliance agreement with the department. The department must notify the dealer of its intended action and the time, place, and date of the scheduled informal conference by written notification sent by United States mail to the dealer’s last known address of record furnished by the dealer on a form prescribed by the department. The dealer is required to attend the informal conference and present evidence refuting the department’s intended revocation or enter into a compliance agreement with the department which resolves the dealer’s failure to comply with this chapter. The department shall issue an administrative complaint under s. 120.60 if the dealer fails to attend the department’s informal conference, fails to enter into a compliance agreement with the department resolving the dealer’s noncompliance with this chapter, or fails to comply with the executed compliance agreement. (g) As used in this paragraph, the term “exhibitor” means a person who enters into an agreement authorizing the display of tangible personal property or services at a convention or a trade show. The following provisions apply to the registration of exhibitors as dealers under this chapter: 1. An exhibitor whose agreement prohibits the sale of tangible personal property or services subject to the tax imposed in this chapter is not required to register as a dealer. 2. An exhibitor whose agreement provides for the sale at wholesale only of tangible personal property or services subject to the tax imposed by this chapter must obtain a resale certificate from the purchasing dealer but is not required to register as a dealer. 3. An exhibitor whose agreement authorizes the retail sale of tangible personal property or services subject to the tax imposed by this chapter must register as a dealer and collect the tax on such sales. 4. An exhibitor who makes a remote sale pursuant to s. 212.0596 must register as a dealer. A person who conducts a convention or a trade show must make his or her exhibitor’s agreements available to the department for inspection and copying. (4) The department is hereby given the authority to purchase such supplies and equipment as may be necessary and incur any other necessary expenses as are proper for the enforcement and administration of this chapter.
