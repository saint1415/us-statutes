(7) Pending results of the first licensing examination taken and upon submission of an application for licensure that includes proof of successful completion of the educational requirements specified in this chapter and payment of the applicable licensure fees, a person is eligible to practice as a barber, provided such person practices under the supervision of a licensed barber in a licensed barbershop. A person who fails the examination may continue to practice under the supervision of a licensed barber in a licensed barbershop, provided the person applies for the next available examination, and may continue such practice until receipt of the results of that second examination are received by the person. No person may continue to practice as a barber under this subsection upon failure to pass the examination on the second attempt.
