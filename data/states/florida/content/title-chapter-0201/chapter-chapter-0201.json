      "text": "201.0201 Interpretation of s. 201.02.— (1) The Legislature finds that the Florida Supreme Court opinion in Crescent Miami Center, LLC v. Florida Department of Revenue, 903 So. 2d 913 (Fla. 2005), interprets s. 201.02 in a manner that permits tax avoidance inconsistent with the intent of the Legislature at the time the statute was amended in 1990. (2) The Legislature finds that the opinion of the District Court of Appeal for the Third District of Florida in Crescent Miami Center, LLC v. Florida Department of Revenue, 857 So. 2d 904 (Fla. 3d D.C.A. 2003), interprets s. 201.02 in a manner that prevents tax avoidance consistent with the intent of the Legislature at the time the statute was amended in 1990. (3) The Legislature recognizes that the Supreme Court’s opinion in Crescent is limited to the facts of the case and accepts the court’s interpretation of s. 201.02 that no consideration exists when owners of real property unencumbered by a mortgage convey an interest in such property to an artificial entity whose ownership is identical to the ownership of the real property before conveyance. The Legislature expressly rejects any application of the court’s interpretation where the facts are not comparable to the facts in Crescent. However, because the Supreme Court’s interpretation, combined with other settled law regarding the application of s. 201.02, allows for the tax-free transfer of ownership interests in real property from one owner to another through the use of artificial entities, it is the Legislature’s intent by this act to impose the documentary stamp tax when the beneficial ownership of real property is transferred to a new owner or owners by the use of techniques that apply the Supreme Court’s decision in Crescent in combination with transfers of ownership of, or distributions from, artificial entities.

The Department of Revenue may enter upon the premises of any taxpayer, and examine or cause to be examined by any agent or representative designated by it for that purpose, any books, papers, records, or memoranda bearing upon the amount of taxes payable, and secure other information directly or indirectly concerned in the enforcement of this chapter. Any person, subject to this tax, who shall by any practice or evasion make it difficult to enforce the provisions of this chapter by inspection, or any person, agent or officer, who shall, after demand by the department or any agent or representative designated by it for that purpose, refuse to allow full inspection of the premises or any part thereof, or any books, records, documents, or other instruments in any way relating to the liability of the taxpayer for the tax herein imposed, or shall hinder or in anywise delay or prevent such inspection, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (2) The county comptroller or, if there be none, then the clerk of the circuit court, shall serve ex officio, and the Department of Revenue may appoint others, as agents for the collection of the tax imposed by this chapter. The department may adopt rules and regulations requiring the agents to meet certain standards, including, without limitation, a demonstrated volume of business or a geographical distribution. All agents shall be subject to audit and shall post a bond as may be required by the Department of Revenue. The Department of Revenue may purchase a blanket bond; however, all costs associated with such a bond shall be allocated by department regulation to those agents so bonded. An agent shall be compensated 0.5 percent of the tax collected as collection costs in the form of a deduction from the amount of the tax due and remitted by the agent, and the department shall allow the said deduction to the agent paying and remitting the tax in the manner as provided for by the department. However, no deduction or allowance shall be granted when there is a manifest failure to maintain proper records or make proper reports.

Such pledge and availability for the payment of these bonds shall have priority over any requirement for the payment of service charges or costs of collection and enforcement under this section. All taxes collected under this chapter, except taxes distributed to the Land Acquisition Trust Fund pursuant to subsections (1) and (2), are subject to the service charge imposed in s. 215.20(1). Before distribution pursuant to this section, the Department of Revenue shall deduct amounts necessary to pay the costs of the collection and enforcement of the tax levied by this chapter. The costs and service charge may not be levied against any portion of taxes pledged to debt service on bonds to the extent that the costs and service charge are required to pay any amounts relating to the bonds. All of the costs of the collection and enforcement of the tax levied by this chapter and service charge shall be available and transferred to the extent necessary to pay debt service and any other amounts payable with respect to bonds authorized before January 1, 2017, secured by revenues distributed pursuant to this section. All taxes remaining after deduction of costs shall be distributed as follows: (1) Amounts necessary to make payments on bonds issued pursuant to s. 215.618 or s. 215.619, as provided under paragraphs (3)(a) and (b), or on any other bonds authorized to be issued on a parity basis with such bonds shall be deposited into the Land Acquisition Trust Fund. (2) If the amounts deposited pursuant to subsection (1) are less than 33 percent of all taxes collected after first deducting the costs of collection, an amount equal to 33 percent of all taxes collected after first deducting the costs of collection, minus the amounts deposited pursuant to subsection (1), shall be deposited into the Land Acquisition Trust Fund. (3) Amounts on deposit in the Land Acquisition Trust Fund shall be used in the following order: (a) Payment of debt service or funding of debt service reserve funds, rebate obligations, or other amounts payable with respect to Florida Forever bonds issued pursuant to s. 215.618. The amount used for such purposes may not exceed $300 million in each fiscal year. It is the intent of the Legislature that all bonds issued to fund the Florida Forever Act be retired by December 31, 2040. Except for bonds issued to refund previously issued bonds, no series of bonds may be issued pursuant to this paragraph unless such bonds are approved and the debt service for the remainder of the fiscal year in which the bonds are issued is specifically appropriated in the General Appropriations Act or other law with respect to bonds issued for the purposes of s. 373.4598. (b) Payment of debt service or funding of debt service reserve funds, rebate obligations, or other amounts due with respect to Everglades restoration bonds issued pursuant to s. 215.619. Taxes distributed under paragraph (a) and this paragraph must be collectively distributed on a pro rata basis when the available moneys under this subsection are not sufficient to cover the amounts required under paragraph (a) and this paragraph. Bonds issued pursuant to s. 215.618 or s. 215.619 are equally and ratably secured by moneys distributable to the Land Acquisition Trust Fund. (4) After the required distributions to the Land Acquisition Trust Fund pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) and deduction of the service charge imposed pursuant to s. 215.20(1), the remainder shall be distributed as follows: (a) The lesser of 20.5453 percent of the remainder or $360.08 million in each fiscal year shall be paid into the State Treasury to the credit of the State Transportation Trust Fund. Notwithstanding any other law, the amount credited to the State Transportation Trust Fund shall be used for: 1. The Small County Outreach Program specified in s. 339.2818, in the amount of 13 percent of the funds; 2. The Strategic Intermodal System specified in ss. 339.61, 339.62, 339.63, and 339.64, in the amount of 78 percent of the funds; and 3. The Transportation Regional Incentive Program specified in s. 339.2819, in the amount of 9 percent of the funds. (b) The lesser of 0.1456 percent of the remainder or $3.25 million in each fiscal year shall be paid into the State Treasury to the credit of the Grants and Donations Trust Fund in the Department of Commerce to fund technical assistance to local governments. Moneys distributed pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) may not be pledged for debt service unless such pledge is approved by referendum of the voters. (c) An amount equaling 4.5 percent of the remainder in each fiscal year shall be paid into the State Treasury to the credit of the State Housing Trust Fund. The funds shall be used as follows: 1. Half of that amount shall be used for the purposes for which the State Housing Trust Fund was created and exists by law. 2. Half of that amount shall be paid into the State Treasury to the credit of the Local Government Housing Trust Fund and used for the purposes for which the Local Government Housing Trust Fund was created and exists by law. (d) An amount equaling 5.20254 percent of the remainder in each fiscal year shall be paid into the State Treasury to the credit of the State Housing Trust Fund. Of such funds: 1. Twelve and one-half percent of that amount shall be deposited into the State Housing Trust Fund and expended by the Department of Commerce and the Florida Housing Finance Corporation for the purposes for which the State Housing Trust Fund was created and exists by law. 2. Eighty-seven and one-half percent of that amount shall be distributed to the Local Government Housing Trust Fund and used for the purposes for which the Local Government Housing Trust Fund was created and exists by law. Funds from this category may also be used to provide for state and local services to assist the homeless. (e) The lesser of 0.017 percent of the remainder or $300,000 in each fiscal year shall be paid into the State Treasury to the credit of the General Inspection Trust Fund to be used to fund oyster management and restoration programs as provided in s. 379.362(3). (f) A total of $75 million shall be paid into the State Treasury to the credit of the State Economic Enhancement and Development Trust Fund within the Department of Commerce. (g) An amount equaling 5.4175 percent of the remainder shall be paid into the Resilient Florida Trust Fund to be used for the purposes for which the Resilient Florida Trust Fund was created and exists by law. Funds may be used for planning and project grants. (h) An amount equaling 5.4175 percent of the remainder shall be paid into the Water Protection and Sustainability Program Trust Fund to be used to fund water quality improvement grants as specified in s. 403.0673.
