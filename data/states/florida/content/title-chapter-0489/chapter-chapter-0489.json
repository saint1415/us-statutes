      "heading": "Exemptions",
      "text": "489.103 Exemptions.—This part does not apply to: (1) Contractors in work on bridges, roads, streets, highways, or railroads, and services incidental thereto. The board, in agreement with the Department of Transportation, shall, by rule, define “services incidental thereto” for the purposes of this subsection only. (2) Any employee of a certificateholder or registrant who is acting within the scope of the license held by that certificateholder or registrant and with the knowledge and permission of the licenseholder. However: (a) If the employer is not a certificateholder or registrant in that type of contracting, and the employee performs any of the following, the employee is not exempt: 1. Holds himself or herself or his or her employer out to be licensed or qualified by a licensee; 2. Leads the consumer to believe that the employee has an ownership or management interest in the company; or 3. Performs any of the acts which constitute contracting. (b) The legislative intent of this subsection is to place equal responsibility on the unlicensed business and its employees for the protection of the consumers in contracting transactions. For the purpose of this part, “employee” is defined as a person who receives compensation from and is under the supervision and control of an employer who regularly deducts the F.I.C.A. and withholding tax and provides workers’ compensation, all as prescribed by law. (3) An authorized employee of the United States, this state, or any municipality, county, irrigation district, reclamation district, or any other municipal or political subdivision, except school boards, state university boards of trustees, and community college boards of trustees, unless for the purpose of performing routine maintenance or repair or construction not exceeding $200,000 to existing installations, if the employee does not hold himself or herself out for hire or otherwise engage in contracting except in accordance with his or her employment. If the construction, remodeling, or improvement exceeds $200,000, school boards, state university boards of trustees, and community college boards of trustees shall not divide the project into separate components for the purpose of evading this section. (4) An officer appointed by a court when he or she is acting within the scope of his or her office as defined by law or court order. When construction projects which were not underway at the time of appointment of the officer are undertaken, the officer shall employ or contract with a licensee. (5) Public utilities, including municipal gas utilities and special gas districts as defined in chapter 189, telecommunications companies as defined in s. 364.02(13), and natural gas transmission companies as defined in s. 368.103(4), on construction, maintenance, and development work performed by their employees. (6) The sale or installation of any finished products, materials, or articles of merchandise that are not fabricated into and do not become a permanent fixed part of the structure, such as awnings. However, this subsection does not exempt in-ground spas and swimming pools that involve excavation, plumbing, chemicals, or wiring of any appliance without a factory-installed electrical cord and plug. This subsection does not limit the exemptions provided in subsection (7). (7)(a) Owners of property when acting as their own contractor and providing direct, onsite supervision themselves of all work not performed by licensed contractors: 1. When building or improving farm outbuildings or one-family or two-family residences on such property for the occupancy or use of such owners and not offered for sale or lease, or building or improving commercial buildings, at a cost not to exceed $75,000, on such property for the occupancy or use of such owners and not offered for sale or lease. In an action brought under this part, proof of the sale or lease, or offering for sale or lease, of any such structure by the owner-builder within 1 year after completion of same creates a presumption that the construction was undertaken for purposes of sale or lease. 2. When repairing or replacing wood shakes or asphalt or fiberglass shingles on one-family, two-family, or three-family residences for the occupancy or use of such owner or tenant of the owner and not offered for sale within 1 year after completion of the work and when the property has been damaged by natural causes from an event recognized as an emergency situation designated by executive order issued by the Governor declaring the existence of a state of emergency as a result and consequence of a serious threat posed to the public health, safety, and property in this state. 3. When installing, uninstalling, or replacing solar panels on one-family, two-family, or three-family residences, and the local permitting agency’s county or municipal government is participating in a “United States Department of Energy SunShot Initiative: Rooftop Solar Challenge” grant. However, an owner must utilize a licensed electrical contractor to effectuate the wiring of the solar panels, including any interconnection to the customer’s residential electrical wiring. The limitations of this exemption shall be expressly stated in the building permit approved and issued by the permitting agency for such project. 4. When completing the requirements of a building permit, where the contractor listed on the permit substantially completed the project as determined by the local permitting agency, for a one-family or two-family residence, townhome, or an accessory structure of a one-family or two-family residence or townhome or an individual residential condominium unit or cooperative unit. Prior to qualifying for the exemption, the owner must receive approval from the local permitting agency, and the local permitting agency must determine that the contractor listed on the permit substantially completed the project. An owner who qualifies for the exemption under this subparagraph is not required to occupy the dwelling or unit for at least 1 year after the completion of the project. (b) This subsection does not exempt any person who is employed by or has a contract with such owner and who acts in the capacity of a contractor. The owner may not delegate the owner’s responsibility to directly supervise all work to any other person unless that person is registered or certified under this part and the work being performed is within the scope of that person’s license. For the purposes of this subsection, the term “owners of property” includes the owner of a mobile home situated on a leased lot. (c) To qualify for exemption under this subsection, an owner must personally appear and sign the building permit application and must satisfy local permitting agency requirements, if any, proving that the owner has a complete understanding of the owner’s obligations under the law as specified in the disclosure statement in this section. However, for purposes of implementing a “United States Department of Energy SunShot Initiative: Rooftop Solar Challenge” grant and the participation of county and municipal governments, including local permitting agencies under the jurisdiction of such county and municipal governments, an owner’s notarized signature or personal appearance to sign the permit application is not required for a solar project, as described in subparagraph (a)3., if the building permit application is submitted electronically to the permitting agency and the owner certifies the application and disclosure statement using the permitting agency’s electronic confirmation system. If any person violates the requirements of this subsection, the local permitting agency shall withhold final approval, revoke the permit, or pursue any action or remedy for unlicensed activity against the owner and any person performing work that requires licensure under the permit issued. The local permitting agency shall provide the person with a disclosure statement in substantially the following form: DISCLOSURE STATEMENT 1. I understand that state law requires construction to be done by a licensed contractor and have applied for an owner-builder permit under an exemption from the law. The exemption specifies that I, as the owner of the property listed, may act as my own contractor with certain restrictions even though I do not have a license. 2. I understand that building permits are not required to be signed by a property owner unless he or she is responsible for the construction and is not hiring a licensed contractor to assume responsibility. 3. I understand that, as an owner-builder, I am the responsible party of record on a permit. I understand that I may protect myself from potential financial risk by hiring a licensed contractor and having the permit filed in his or her name instead of my own name. I also understand that a contractor is required by law to be licensed in Florida and to list his or her license numbers on permits and contracts. 4. I understand that I may build or improve a one-family or two-family residence or a farm outbuilding. I may also build or improve a commercial building if the costs do not exceed $75,000. The building or residence must be for my own use or occupancy. It may not be built or substantially improved for sale or lease, unless I am completing the requirements of a building permit where the contractor listed on the permit substantially completed the project. If a building or residence that I have built or substantially improved myself is sold or leased within 1 year after the construction is complete, the law will presume that I built or substantially improved it for sale or lease, which violates the exemption. 5. I understand that, as the owner-builder, I must provide direct, onsite supervision of the construction. 6. I understand that I may not hire an unlicensed person to act as my contractor or to supervise persons working on my building or residence. It is my responsibility to ensure that the persons whom I employ have the licenses required by law and by county or municipal ordinance. 7. I understand that it is a frequent practice of unlicensed persons to have the property owner obtain an owner-builder permit that erroneously implies that the property owner is providing his or her own labor and materials. I, as an owner-builder, may be held liable and subjected to serious financial risk for any injuries sustained by an unlicensed person or his or her employees while working on my property. My homeowner’s insurance may not provide coverage for those injuries. I am willfully acting as an owner-builder and am aware of the limits of my insurance coverage for injuries to workers on my property. 8. I understand that I may not delegate the responsibility for supervising work to a licensed contractor who is not licensed to perform the work being done. Any person working on my building who is not licensed must work under my direct supervision and must be employed by me, which means that I must comply with laws requiring the withholding of federal income tax and social security contributions under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and must provide workers’ compensation for the employee. I understand that my failure to follow these laws may subject me to serious financial risk. 9. I agree that, as the party legally and financially responsible for this proposed construction activity, I will abide by all applicable laws and requirements that govern owner-builders as well as employers. I also understand that the construction must comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, building codes, and zoning regulations. 10. I understand that I may obtain more information regarding my obligations as an employer from the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Small Business Administration, the Florida Department of Financial Services, and the Florida Department of Revenue. I also understand that I may contact the Florida Construction Industry Licensing Board at (telephone number) or (Internet website address) for more information about licensed contractors. 11. I am aware of, and consent to, an owner-builder building permit applied for in my name and understand that I am the party legally and financially responsible for the proposed construction activity at the following address: (address of property) . 12. I agree to notify (issuer of disclosure statements) immediately of any additions, deletions, or changes to any of the information that I have provided on this disclosure. Licensed contractors are regulated by laws designed to protect the public. If you contract with a person who does not have a license, the Construction Industry Licensing Board and Department of Business and Professional Regulation may be unable to assist you with any financial loss that you sustain as a result of a complaint. Your only remedy against an unlicensed contractor may be in civil court. It is also important for you to understand that, if an unlicensed contractor or employee of an individual or firm is injured while working on your property, you may be held liable for damages. If you obtain an owner-builder permit and wish to hire a licensed contractor, you will be responsible for verifying whether the contractor is properly licensed and the status of the contractor’s workers’ compensation coverage. Before a building permit can be issued, this disclosure statement must be completed and signed by the property owner and returned to the local permitting agency responsible for issuing the permit. A copy of the property owner’s driver license, the notarized signature of the property owner, or other type of verification acceptable to the local permitting agency is required when the permit is issued. Signature: (signature of property owner) . Date: (date) . (d) A building permit application and disclosure statement electronically submitted by an owner to the authority for a solar project, as described in subparagraph (a)3., must also contain the following additional statement: OWNER’S ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION STATEMENT: Under penalty of perjury, I declare that all the information contained in this building permit application and the representations made in the required disclosure statement are true and correct. (e) A permitting authority that accepts a building permit application and disclosure statement in an electronic format from an owner who is exempt pursuant to this subsection and who applies for a permit relating to a solar project, as described in subparagraph (a)3., is not liable in any civil action for inaccurate information submitted by the owner using the authority’s electronic confirmation system. (8) Any construction, alteration, improvement, or repair carried on within the limits of any site the title to which is in the United States or with respect to which federal law supersedes this part. (9) Any work or operation of a casual, minor, or inconsequential nature in which the aggregate contract price for labor, materials, and all other items is less than $2,500, but this exemption does not apply: (a) If the construction, repair, remodeling, or improvement is a part of a larger or major operation, whether undertaken by the same or a different contractor, or in which a division of the operation is made in contracts of amounts less than $2,500 for the purpose of evading this part or otherwise. (b) To a person who advertises that he or she is a contractor or otherwise represents that he or she is qualified to engage in contracting. (10)(a) Any construction or operation incidental to the construction or repair of irrigation and drainage ditches; (b) Regularly constituted irrigation districts or reclamation districts; or (c) Clearing or other work on the land in rural districts for fire prevention purposes or otherwise except when performed by a licensee.

(12) Any person who only furnishes materials or supplies without fabricating them into, or consuming them in the performance of, the work of the contractor. (13) Any person who is licensed pursuant to chapter 527 when such person is performing the work authorized by such license. (14) Any person who sells, services, or installs heating or air-conditioning units which have a capacity no greater than 3 tons or 36,000 Btu, which have no ducts, and which have a factory-installed electrical cord and plug. (15) The installation and maintenance of water conditioning units for domestic, commercial, or industrial purposes by operators of water conditioning services. No municipality or county may adopt an ordinance, rule, or regulation which requires such an operator to become licensed, certified, or registered as a plumber or which otherwise prevents the installation and maintenance of such water conditioning units by an operator. (16) An architect or landscape architect licensed pursuant to chapter 481 or an engineer licensed pursuant to chapter 471 who offers or renders design-build services which may require the services of a contractor certified or registered pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, as long as the contractor services to be performed under the terms of the design-build contract are offered and rendered by a certified or registered general contractor in accordance with this chapter. (17) Contracting for repair, maintenance, remodeling, or improvement by any person licensed under part I of chapter 475 while acting as the owner’s agent pursuant to that license, where all work requiring a contractor is performed by a contractor who has a current, valid certificate or registration issued under this part to perform such work, and where the aggregate contract for labor, materials, and all other items is less than $5,000; however, this exemption does not apply: (a) If the maintenance, repair, remodeling, or improvement is a part of a larger or major operation, whether undertaken by the same or a different contractor, or in which a division of the operation is made in contracts of amounts less than $5,000 for the purpose of evading this part or otherwise. (b) To a person who advertises that he or she is qualified to engage in contracting.

(20) The sale, delivery, assembly, or tie-down of prefabricated portable sheds that are not more than 250 square feet in interior size and are not intended for use as a residence or as living quarters. This exemption may not be construed to interfere with the Florida Building Code or any applicable local technical amendment to the Florida Building Code, local licensure requirements, or other local ordinance provisions. (21) The sale, delivery, assembly, or tie-down of lawn storage buildings and storage buildings not exceeding 400 square feet and bearing the insignia of approval from the department showing compliance with the Florida Building Code.

For purposes of this paragraph, an individual repair may not be part of a larger or major project that is divided into parts to avoid this restriction. (d) The property owned by the apartment community or managed by the apartment community management company includes at least 100 apartments.

(c) Where a business organization has a certified or registered financially responsible officer, the primary qualifying agent shall be responsible for all construction activities of the business organization, both in general and for each specific job. (d) The board shall adopt rules prescribing the qualifications for financially responsible officers, including net worth, cash, and bonding requirements. These qualifications must be at least as extensive as the requirements for the financial responsibility of qualifying agents. (2)(a) One of the qualifying agents for a business organization that has more than one qualifying agent may be designated as the sole primary qualifying agent for the business organization by a joint agreement that is executed, on a form provided by the board, by all qualifying agents for the business organization. (b) The joint agreement must be submitted to the board for approval. If the board determines that the joint agreement is in good order, it shall approve the designation and immediately notify the qualifying agents of such approval. The designation made by the joint agreement is effective upon receipt of the notice by the qualifying agents. (c) The qualifying agent designated for a business organization by a joint agreement is the sole primary qualifying agent for the business organization, and all other qualifying agents for the business organization are secondary qualifying agents. (d) A designated sole primary qualifying agent has all the responsibilities and duties of a primary qualifying agent, notwithstanding that there are secondary qualifying agents for specified jobs. The designated sole primary qualifying agent is jointly and equally responsible with secondary qualifying agents for field work supervision. (e) A secondary qualifying agent is responsible only for: 1. The supervision of field work at sites where his or her license was used to obtain the building permit; and 2. Any other work for which he or she accepts responsibility. A secondary qualifying agent is not responsible for supervision of financial matters. (3)(a) A qualifying agent who has been designated by a joint agreement as the sole primary qualifying agent for a business organization may terminate this status as such by giving actual notice to the business organization, to the board, and to all secondary qualifying agents of his or her intention to terminate this status. The notice to the board must include proof satisfactory to the board that he or she has given the notice required in this paragraph. (b) The status of the qualifying agent shall cease upon the designation of a new primary qualifying agent or 60 days after satisfactory notice of termination has been provided to the board, whichever first occurs. (c) If no new primary qualifying agent has been designated within 60 days, all secondary qualifying agents for the business organization shall become primary qualifying agents unless the joint agreement specifies that one or more of them shall become sole qualifying agents under such circumstances, in which case only they shall become sole qualifying agents. (d) Any change in the status of a qualifying agent is prospective only. A qualifying agent is not responsible for his or her predecessor’s actions but is responsible, even after a change in status, for matters for which he or she was responsible while in a particular status.

      "heading": "Applicability",
      "text": "489.131 Applicability.— (1) This part applies to all contractors, including, but not limited to, those performing work for the state or any county or municipality. Officers of the state or any county or municipality shall determine compliance with this part before awarding any contract for construction, improvement, remodeling, or repair. (2) The state or any county or municipality shall require that bids submitted for construction, improvement, remodeling, or repair on public projects be accompanied by evidence that the bidder holds an appropriate certificate or registration, unless the work to be performed is exempt under s. 489.103. (3) Nothing in this part limits the power of a municipality or county: (a) To regulate the quality and character of work performed by contractors through a system of permits, fees, and inspections which is designed to secure compliance with and aid in the implementation of state and local building laws. (b) To enforce other laws for the protection of the public health and safety. (c) To collect business taxes, subject to s. 205.065, and inspection fees for engaging in contracting or examination fees from persons who are registered with the board pursuant to local examination requirements and issue business tax receipts. However, nothing in this part shall be construed to require general contractors, building contractors, or residential contractors to obtain additional business tax receipts for specialty work when such specialty work is performed by employees of such contractors on projects for which they have substantially full responsibility and such contractors do not hold themselves out to the public as being specialty contractors. (d) To adopt any system of permits requiring submission to and approval by the municipality or county of plans and specifications for work to be performed by contractors before commencement of the work. (e) To require one bond for each contractor in an amount not to exceed $5,000, which bond shall be conditioned only upon compliance with the Florida Building Code adopted pursuant to s. 553.73. Any such bond must be equally available to all contractors without regard to the period of time a contractor has been certified or registered and without regard to any financial responsibility requirements. Any such bonds shall be payable to the Florida Homeowners’ Construction Recovery Fund and filed in each county or municipality in which a building permit is requested. Bond reciprocity shall be granted statewide. All such bonds shall be included in meeting any financial responsibility requirements imposed by any statute or rule. Any contractor who provides a third party insured warranty policy in connection with a new building or structure for the benefit of the purchaser or owner shall be exempt from the bond requirements under this subsection with respect to such building or structure. (f) To refuse to issue permits or issue permits with specific conditions to a contractor who has committed multiple violations, when he or she has been disciplined for each of them by the board and when each disciplinary action has involved revocation or suspension of a license, imposition of an administrative fine of at least $1,000, or probation; or to issue permits with specific conditions to a contractor who, within the previous 12 months, has had disciplinary action other than a citation or letter of guidance taken against him or her by the department or by a local board or agency which licenses contractors and has reported the action pursuant to paragraph (6)(c), for engaging in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor without a license. However, this subsection does not supersede the provisions of s. 489.113(4), and no county or municipality may require any certificateholder to obtain a local professional license or pay a local professional license fee as a condition of performing any services within the scope of the certificateholder’s statewide license as established under this part. (4) Nothing in this part shall be construed to waive any requirement of any ordinance or resolution existing on October 1, 1979, of a board of county commissioners regulating the type of work required to be performed by a specialty contractor. (5) Any official authorized to issue building or other related permits shall, before issuing a permit, ascertain that the applicant contractor is certified or is registered in the area where the construction is to take place. (6)(a) No municipality or county may require the holder of a certificate issued pursuant to this part to sit for examination to operate within the scope of such certificate. (b) To engage in contracting in the territorial area, an applicant shall also be registered with the board, as required by s. 489.117. (c) Each local board or agency that licenses contractors must transmit quarterly to the board a report of any disciplinary action taken against contractors and of any administrative or disciplinary action taken against unlicensed persons for engaging in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor including any cease and desist orders issued pursuant to s. 489.113(2)(b) and any fine issued pursuant to s. 489.127(5). (7)(a) It is the policy of the state that the purpose of regulation is to protect the public by attaining compliance with the policies established in law. Fines and other penalties are provided in order to ensure compliance with state laws and local jurisdiction ordinances. (b) The local governing body of a county or municipality, or its local enforcement body, is authorized to enforce the provisions of this part as well as its local ordinances against locally licensed or registered contractors, as appropriate. The local jurisdiction enforcement body may conduct disciplinary proceedings against a locally licensed or registered contractor and may require restitution, impose a suspension or revocation of his or her local license, or a fine not to exceed $5,000, or a combination thereof, against the locally licensed or registered contractor, according to ordinances which a local jurisdiction may enact. In addition, the local jurisdiction may assess reasonable investigative and legal costs for the prosecution of the violation against the violator, according to such ordinances as the local jurisdiction may enact. (c) In addition to any action the local jurisdiction enforcement body may take against the individual’s local license, and any fine the local jurisdiction may impose, the local jurisdiction enforcement body shall issue a recommended penalty for board action. This recommended penalty may include a recommendation for no further action, or a recommendation for suspension, restitution, revocation, or restriction of the registration, or a fine to be levied by the board, or a combination thereof. The recommended penalty must specify the violations of this chapter upon which the recommendation is based. The local jurisdiction enforcement body shall inform the disciplined contractor and the complainant of the local license penalty imposed, the board penalty recommended, his or her rights to appeal, and the consequences should he or she decide not to appeal. The local jurisdiction enforcement body shall, upon having reached adjudication or having accepted a plea of nolo contendere, immediately inform the board of its action and the recommended board penalty. (d) The department, the disciplined contractor, or the complainant may challenge the local jurisdiction enforcement body’s recommended penalty for board action to the Construction Industry Licensing Board. A challenge shall be filed within 60 days after the issuance of the recommended penalty to the board. If challenged, there is a presumptive finding of probable cause and the case may proceed without the need for a probable cause hearing. (e) Failure of the department, the disciplined contractor, or the complainant to challenge the local jurisdiction’s recommended penalty within the time period set forth in this subsection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing before the board. A waiver of the right to a hearing before the board shall be deemed an admission of the violation, and the penalty recommended shall become a final order according to procedures developed by board rule without further board action. The disciplined contractor may appeal this board action to the district court. (f)1. The department may investigate any complaint which is made with the department. However, the department may not initiate or pursue any complaint against a registered contractor who is not also a certified contractor where a local jurisdiction enforcement body has jurisdiction over the complaint, unless summary procedures are initiated by the secretary pursuant to s. 455.225(8), or unless the local jurisdiction enforcement body has failed to investigate and prosecute a complaint, or make a finding of no violation, within 6 months of receiving the complaint. The department shall refer the complaint to the local jurisdiction enforcement body for investigation, and if appropriate, prosecution. However, the department may investigate such complaints to the extent necessary to determine whether summary procedures should be initiated. 2. Upon a recommendation by the department, the board may make conditional, suspend, or rescind its determination of the adequacy of the local government enforcement body’s disciplinary procedures granted under s. 489.117(2). (g) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to allow local jurisdictions to exercise disciplinary authority over certified contractors. (8) A local enforcement board may petition the secretary of the department for issuance of a summary order against a certificateholder or registrant for any violation of this part. (9) The right to create local boards in the future by any municipality or county is preserved. (10) No municipal or county government may issue any certificate of competency or license for any contractor defined in s. 489.105(3)(a)-(o) after July 1, 1993, unless such local government exercises disciplinary control and oversight over such locally licensed contractors, including forwarding a recommended order in each action to the board as provided in subsection (7). Each local board that licenses and disciplines contractors must have at least two consumer representatives on that board. If the board has seven or more members, at least three of those members must be consumer representatives. The consumer representative may be any resident of the local jurisdiction who is not, and has never been, a member or practitioner of a profession regulated by the board or a member of any closely related profession. (11) Any municipal or county government which enters or has in place a reciprocal agreement which accepts a certificate of competency or license issued by another municipal or county government in lieu of its own certificate of competency or license allowing contractors defined in s. 489.105(3)(a)-(o), shall file a certified copy of such agreement with the board not later than 60 days after July 1, 1993, or 30 days after the effective date of such agreement. (12) Unless specifically provided, the provisions of this part shall not be construed to create a civil cause of action.

      "text": "489.503 Exemptions.—This part does not apply to: (1) Any employee of a certificateholder, registrant, or business organization authorized to engage in contracting who is acting within the scope of the license held by that certificateholder or registrant and with the knowledge and permission of the licenseholder. However: (a) If the employer is not a certificateholder or registrant in that type of contracting, and the employee performs any of the following, the employee is not exempt: 1. Holds himself or herself or his or her employer out to be licensed or qualified by a licensee; 2. Leads the consumer to believe that the employee has an ownership or management interest in the company; or 3. Performs any of the acts which constitute contracting. (b) The legislative intent of this subsection is to place equal responsibility on the unlicensed business and its employees for the protection of the consumers in contracting transactions. For the purpose of this part, “employee” is defined as a person who receives compensation from, and is under the supervision and control of, an employer who regularly deducts the F.I.C.A. and withholding tax and provides workers’ compensation, all as prescribed by law. (2) An authorized employee of the United States, this state, or any municipality, county, irrigation district, reclamation district, or any other municipal or political subdivision of this state, except school boards, state university boards of trustees, and community college boards of trustees, unless for the purpose of performing routine maintenance or repair or construction not exceeding $200,000 to existing installations, as long as the employee does not hold himself or herself out for hire or otherwise engage in contracting except in accordance with his or her employment. If the construction, remodeling, or improvement exceeds $200,000, school boards, state university boards of trustees, and community college boards of trustees shall not divide the project into separate components for the purpose of evading this section. (3) An officer appointed by a court when he or she is acting within the scope of his or her office as defined by law or court order. (4) Public utilities, on construction, maintenance, and development work performed by their forces and incidental to their business. (5) The sale or installation of any finished products, materials, or articles of merchandise which are not actually fabricated into, and do not become a permanent fixed part of, the structure. This subsection shall not be construed to limit the exemptions provided in subsection (6). (6)(a) An owner of property making application for permit, supervising, and doing the work in connection with the construction, maintenance, repair, and alteration of and addition to a single-family or duplex residence for his or her own use and occupancy and not intended for sale or an owner of property when acting as his or her own electrical contractor and providing all material supervision himself or herself, when building or improving a farm outbuilding or a single-family or duplex residence on such property for the occupancy or use of such owner and not offered for sale or lease, or building or improving a commercial building with aggregate construction costs of under $75,000 on such property for the occupancy or use of such owner and not offered for sale or lease. In an action brought under this subsection, proof of the sale or lease, or offering for sale or lease, of more than one such structure by the owner-builder within 1 year after completion of same is prima facie evidence that the construction was undertaken for purposes of sale or lease. (b) An owner of property completing the requirements of a building permit, where the contractor listed on the permit substantially completed the project as determined by the local permitting agency, for a one-family or two family residence, townhome, accessory structure of a one-family or two-family residence or townhome or individual residential condominium unit or cooperative unit. Prior to the owner qualifying for the exemption, the owner must receive approval from the local permitting agency, and the local permitting agency must determine that the contractor substantially completed the project. An owner who qualifies for the exemption under this paragraph is not required to occupy the dwelling or unit for at least 1 year after the completion of the project. (c) This subsection does not exempt any person who is employed by such owner and who acts in the capacity of a contractor. For the purpose of this subsection, the term “owner of property” includes the owner of a mobile home situated on a leased lot. To qualify for exemption under this subsection, an owner shall personally appear and sign the building permit application and must satisfy local permitting agency requirements, if any, proving that the owner has a complete understanding of the owner’s obligations under the law as specified in the disclosure statement in this section. If any person violates the requirements of this subsection, the local permitting agency shall withhold final approval, revoke the permit, or pursue any action or remedy for unlicensed activity against the owner and any person performing work that requires licensure under the permit issued. The local permitting agency shall provide the owner with a disclosure statement in substantially the following form: Disclosure Statement State law requires electrical contracting to be done by licensed electrical contractors. You have applied for a permit under an exemption to that law. The exemption allows you, as the owner of your property, to act as your own electrical contractor even though you do not have a license. You may install electrical wiring for a farm outbuilding or a single-family or duplex residence. You may install electrical wiring in a commercial building the aggregate construction costs of which are under $75,000. The home or building must be for your own use and occupancy. It may not be built for sale or lease, unless you are completing the requirements of a building permit where the contractor listed on the permit substantially completed the project. If you sell or lease more than one building you have wired yourself within 1 year after the construction is complete, the law will presume that you built it for sale or lease, which is a violation of this exemption. You may not hire an unlicensed person as your electrical contractor. Your construction shall be done according to building codes and zoning regulations. It is your responsibility to make sure that people employed by you have licenses required by state law and by county or municipal licensing ordinances. (7) Any construction, alteration, improvement, or repair carried on within the limits of any site the title to which is in the United States or any construction, alteration, improvement, or repair on any project when federal law supersedes this part. (8) Any construction or operation incidental to the construction or repair of irrigation and drainage ditches; regularly constituted irrigation districts; reclamation districts; or clearing or other work on the land in rural districts for fire prevention purposes or otherwise, except when performed by a certificateholder under this part. (9) A registered architect or engineer acting within the scope of his or her practice, or any person exempted by the law regulating architects or engineers, including persons doing design work as specified in s. 481.229(1)(b). (10) Any person who only furnishes materials or supplies without fabricating them into, or consuming them in the performance of, the work of the contractor. (11) The installation of alarm systems on motor vehicles and boats. (12) Any person as defined and licensed under chapter 527 while engaged in work regulated under that chapter. (13) Any person defined and licensed as a fire protection system contractor under chapter 633, while engaged in work as a fire protection system contractor. (14) The sale of, installation of, repair of, alteration of, addition to, or design of electrical wiring, fixtures, appliances, thermostats, apparatus, raceways, computers, customer premises equipment, customer premises wiring, and conduit, or any part thereof, by an employee, contractor, subcontractor, or affiliate of a company operating under a certificate issued under chapter 364 or chapter 610, or under a local franchise or right-of-way agreement, if those items are for the purpose of transmitting data, voice, video, or other communications, or commands as part of a cable television, community antenna television, radio distribution, communications, or telecommunications system. An employee, subcontractor, contractor, or affiliate of a company that operates under a certificate issued under chapter 364 or chapter 610, or under a local franchise or right-of-way agreement, is not subject to any local ordinance that requires a permit for work related to low-voltage electrical work, including related technical codes, regulations, and licensure. The scope of this exemption is limited to electrical circuits and equipment governed by the applicable provisions of Articles 725 (Classes 2 and 3 circuits only), 770, 800, 810, and 820 of the National Electrical Code, current edition, or 47 C.F.R. part 68, and employees, contractors, and subcontractors of companies, and affiliates thereof, operating under a certificate issued under chapter 364 or chapter 610 or under a local franchise or right-of-way agreement. This subsection does not relieve any person from licensure as an alarm system contractor. (15) The provision, installation, testing, routine maintenance, factory-servicing, or monitoring of a personal emergency response system, as defined in s. 489.505, by an authorized person who: (a) Is an employee of, or a volunteer supervised by an employee of, a health care facility licensed by the Agency for Health Care Administration; (b) Performs services for the Department of Elderly Affairs; (c) Performs services for the Department of Children and Families under chapter 410; or (d) Is an employee of or an authorized representative or distributor for the producer of the personal emergency response system being monitored.

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to provide any of the agencies mentioned in this subsection the authority to develop rules, criteria, or policy pursuant to this subsection. (17) The monitoring of an alarm system without fee by a direct employee of a law enforcement agency or of a county, municipal, or special district fire department or by a law enforcement officer or fire official acting in an official capacity.

This exemption is intended to allow businesses to monitor their own alarm systems and is not limited to monitoring a single location of that business. However, it is not intended to enable the owner of any apartment complex, aggregate housing, or commercial property to monitor alarm systems on property leased or rented to the residents, clients, or customers thereof. (20) Contracting for repair, maintenance, remodeling, or improvement by any person licensed under part I of chapter 475 while acting as the owner’s agent pursuant to that license, where all work requiring a contractor is performed by a contractor who has a current, valid certificate or registration issued under this part to perform such work, and where the aggregate contract for labor, materials, and all other items is less than $5,000; however, this exemption does not apply: (a) If the maintenance, repair, remodeling, or improvement is a part of a larger or major operation, whether undertaken by the same or a different contractor, or in which a division of the operation is made in contracts of amounts less than $5,000 for the purpose of evading this part or otherwise.
