Therefore, in order to preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the public, the Legislature must provide privileged communication for members of the public or those acting on their behalf to encourage needed or desired psychological services to be sought out. The Legislature further finds that, since such psychological services assist the public primarily with emotional survival, which in turn affects physical and psychophysical survival, the practice of psychology and school psychology by unqualified persons presents a danger to public health, safety, and welfare.",

For the purposes of this subsection, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to: (a) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare; (b) Prevent a loss of commission or compact state funds; (c) Meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule that is established by federal law or rule; or (d) Protect public health and safety. (13) The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the chair of the commission before the end of the notice period. If a challenge is not made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission. ARTICLE XII OVERSIGHT; DEFAULT, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, AND TERMINATION; DISPUTE RESOLUTION; AND ENFORCEMENT (1) OVERSIGHT.— (a) The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each compact state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact’s purposes and intent. The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law. (b) All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a compact state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the commission. (c) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or promulgated rules. (2) DEFAULT, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, AND TERMINATION.— (a) If the commission determines that a compact state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall: 1. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other compact states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of remedying the default, and any other action to be taken by the commission; and 2. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. (b) If a state in default fails to remedy the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compact states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated on the effective date of termination. A remedy of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default. (c) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. The commission shall submit a notice of intent to suspend or terminate a defaulting compact state to the state’s governor, the majority and minority leaders of the state’s legislature, and each of the compact states. (d) A compact state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination. (e) The commission may not bear any costs incurred by the state that is found to be in default or has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state. (f) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the state of Georgia or the federal district where the compact has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. (3) DISPUTE RESOLUTION.— (a) Upon request by a compact state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact which arise among compact states and between compact and noncompact states. (b) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes that arise before the commission. (4) ENFORCEMENT.— (a) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact. (b) By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the state of Georgia or the federal district where the compact has its principal offices against a compact state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. (c) The remedies herein are not the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law. ARTICLE XIII DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PSYCHOLOGY INTERJURISDICTIONAL COMPACT COMMISSION AND ASSOCIATED RULES; WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENTS (1) The compact shall become effective on the date on which the compact is enacted into law in the seventh compact state. The provisions that become effective at that time shall be limited to the powers granted to the commission relating to assembly and the promulgation of rules. Thereafter, the commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and administration of the compact. (2) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commission’s initial adoption of the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state. (3) Any compact state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same. (a) A compact state’s withdrawal does not take effect until 6 months after enactment of the repealing statute. (b) Withdrawal does not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state’s psychology regulatory authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this act before the effective date of withdrawal. (4) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any psychology licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a compact state and a noncompact state which does not conflict with the provisions of this compact. (5) This compact may be amended by the compact states. An amendment to this compact will not become effective and binding upon any compact state until it is enacted into the law of all compact states. ARTICLE XIV CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state member thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining compact states.
