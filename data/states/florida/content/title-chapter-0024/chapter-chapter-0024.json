X of the State Constitution in a manner that enables the people of the state to benefit from significant additional moneys for education and also enables the people of the state to play the best lottery games available. (2) The intent of the Legislature is: (a) That the net proceeds of lottery games conducted pursuant to this act be used to support improvements in public education and that such proceeds not be used as a substitute for existing resources for public education. (b) That the lottery games be operated by a department of state government that functions as much as possible in the manner of an entrepreneurial business enterprise. The Legislature recognizes that the operation of a lottery is a unique activity for state government and that structures and procedures appropriate to the performance of other governmental functions are not necessarily appropriate to the operation of a state lottery. (c) That the lottery games be operated by a self-supporting, revenue-producing department. (d) That the department be accountable to the Legislature and the people of the state through a system of audits and reports and through compliance with financial disclosure, open meetings, and public records laws.

(8) Conduct such market research as is necessary or appropriate, which may include an analysis of the demographic characteristics of the players of each lottery game and an analysis of advertising, promotion, public relations, incentives, and other aspects of communications. (9) Adopt rules governing the establishment and operation of the state lottery, including: (a) The type of lottery games to be conducted, except that: 1. No name of an elected official shall appear on the ticket or play slip of any lottery game or on any prize or on any instrument used for the payment of prizes, unless such prize is in the form of a state warrant. 2. No coins or currency shall be dispensed from any electronic computer terminal or device used in any lottery game. 3.

(b) The sales price of tickets. (c) The number and sizes of prizes. (d) The method of selecting winning tickets. However, if a lottery game involves a drawing, the drawing shall be public and witnessed by an accountant employed by an independent certified public accounting firm.

(f) The frequency of drawings or selections of winning tickets. (g) The number and type of locations at which tickets may be purchased.

Any additional retailer compensation is limited to the Florida Lottery Retailer Bonus Commission program appropriated in Specific Appropriation 2561 of the 2025-2026 General Appropriations Act. (j) Such other matters necessary or desirable for the efficient or economical operation of the lottery or for the convenience of the public. (10) Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 286, have the authority to hold patents, copyrights, trademarks, and service marks and enforce its rights with respect thereto. The department shall notify the Department of State in writing whenever property rights by patent, copyright, or trademark are secured by the department. (11) In the selection of games and method of selecting winning tickets, be sensitive to the impact of the lottery upon the pari-mutuel industry and, accordingly, the department may use for any game the theme of horseracing, dogracing, or jai alai and may allow a lottery game to be based upon a horserace, dograce, or jai alai activity so long as the outcome of such lottery game is determined entirely by chance. (12) Have the authority to perform any of the functions of the Department of Management Services under chapter 255, chapter 273, chapter 281, chapter 283, or chapter 287, or any rules adopted under any such chapter, and may grant approvals provided for under any such chapter or rules. If the department finds, by rule, that compliance with any such chapter would impair or impede the effective or efficient operation of the lottery, the department may adopt rules providing alternative procurement procedures. Such alternative procedures shall be designed to allow the department to evaluate competing proposals and select the proposal that provides the greatest long-term benefit to the state with respect to the quality of the products or services, dependability and integrity of the vendor, dependability of the vendor’s products or services, security, competence, timeliness, and maximization of gross revenues and net proceeds over the life of the contract. (13) Have the authority to acquire real property and make improvements thereon. The title to such property shall be vested in the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund. The board shall give the department preference in leasing state-owned lands under the board’s control and may not exercise any jurisdiction over lands purchased or leased by the department while such lands are actively used by the department. Actions of the department under this subsection are exempt from the time limitations and deadlines of chapter 253.

(15) Enter into contracts for the purchase, lease, or lease-purchase of such goods and services as are necessary for the operation and promotion of the state lottery, including assistance provided by any governmental agency. (16) In accordance with the provisions of this act, enter into contracts with retailers so as to provide adequate and convenient availability of tickets to the public for each game. (17) Have the authority to enter into agreements with other states for the operation and promotion of a multistate lottery if such agreements are in the best interest of the state lottery. The authority conferred by this subsection is not effective until 1 year after the first day of lottery ticket sales. (18) Employ division directors and other staff as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this act; however: (a) No person shall be employed by the department who has been convicted of, or entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony committed in the preceding 10 years, regardless of adjudication, unless the department determines that: 1. The person has been pardoned or his or her civil rights have been restored; or 2. Subsequent to such conviction or entry of plea the person has engaged in the kind of law-abiding commerce and good citizenship that would reflect well upon the integrity of the lottery. (b) No officer or employee of the department having decisionmaking authority shall participate in any decision involving any vendor or retailer with whom the officer or employee has a financial interest. No such officer or employee may participate in any decision involving any vendor or retailer with whom the officer or employee has discussed employment opportunities without the approval of the secretary or, if such officer is the secretary, without the approval of the Governor. Any officer or employee of the department shall notify the secretary of any such discussion or, if such officer is the secretary, he or she shall notify the Governor. A violation of this paragraph is punishable in accordance with s. 112.317. (c) No officer or employee of the department who leaves the employ of the department shall represent any vendor or retailer before the department regarding any specific matter in which the officer or employee was involved while employed by the department, for a period of 1 year following cessation of employment with the department. A violation of this paragraph is punishable in accordance with s. 112.317. (d) The department shall establish and maintain a personnel program for its employees, including a personnel classification and pay plan which may provide any or all of the benefits provided in the Senior Management Service or Selected Exempt Service. Each officer or employee of the department shall be a member of the Florida Retirement System.

Employees of the department shall serve at the pleasure of the secretary and shall be subject to suspension, dismissal, reduction in pay, demotion, transfer, or other personnel action at the discretion of the secretary. Such personnel actions are exempt from the provisions of chapter 120. All employees of the department are exempt from the Career Service System provided in chapter 110 and, notwithstanding the provisions of s. 110.205(5), are not included in either the Senior Management Service or the Selected Exempt Service. However, all employees of the department are subject to all standards of conduct adopted by rule for career service and senior management employees pursuant to chapter 110. In the event of a conflict between standards of conduct applicable to employees of the Department of the Lottery the more restrictive standard shall apply. Interpretations as to the more restrictive standard may be provided by the Commission on Ethics upon request of an advisory opinion pursuant to s. 112.322(3)(a), for purposes of this subsection the opinion shall be considered final action. (19) Adopt by rule a code of ethics for officers and employees of the department which supplements the standards of conduct for public officers and employees imposed by law.

Any other state agency, including the Department of Business and Professional Regulation and the Department of Revenue, shall, upon request, provide the Department of the Lottery with any information relevant to any investigation conducted pursuant to this act. The Department of the Lottery shall maintain the confidentiality of any confidential information it receives from any other agency. The Department of the Lottery shall reimburse any agency for the actual cost of providing any assistance pursuant to this subsection. (6) The division shall monitor ticket validation and lottery drawings. (7)(a) After the first full year of sales of tickets to the public, or sooner if the secretary deems necessary, the department shall engage an independent firm experienced in security procedures, including, but not limited to, computer security and systems security, to conduct a comprehensive study and evaluation of all aspects of security in the operation of the department. (b) The portion of the security report containing the overall evaluation of the department in terms of each aspect of security shall be presented to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The portion of the security report containing specific recommendations shall be confidential and shall be presented only to the secretary, the Governor, and the Auditor General; however, upon certification that such information is necessary for the purpose of effecting legislative changes, such information shall be disclosed to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, who may disclose such information to members of the Legislature and legislative staff as necessary to effect such purpose. However, any person who receives a copy of such information or other information which is confidential pursuant to this act or rule of the department shall maintain its confidentiality. The confidential portion of the report is exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. (c) Thereafter, similar studies of security shall be conducted as the department deems appropriate but at least once every 2 years.

The Legislature finds that such emergency rulemaking power is necessary for the preservation of the rights and welfare of the people in order to provide additional funds to benefit the public. The Legislature further finds that the unique nature of state lottery operations requires, from time to time, that the department respond as quickly as is practicable to changes in the marketplace. Therefore, in adopting such emergency rules, the department need not make the findings required by s. 120.54(4)(a). Emergency rules adopted under this section are exempt from s. 120.54(4)(c) and shall remain in effect until replaced by other emergency rules or by rules adopted under the nonemergency rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act. (2) The provisions of s. 120.57(3) apply to the department’s contracting process, except that: (a) A formal written protest of any decision, intended decision, or other action subject to protest shall be filed within 72 hours after receipt of notice of the decision, intended decision, or other action. (b) In a competitive procurement protest, including the rejection of all bids, proposals, or replies, the administrative law judge shall not substitute his or her procurement decision for the agency’s procurement decision but shall review the intended agency action only to determine if the agency action is illegal, arbitrary, dishonest, or fraudulent. (c) As an alternative to any provision in s. 120.57(3)(c), the department may proceed with the bid solicitation or contract award process when the secretary of the department sets forth in writing particular facts and circumstances which require the continuance of the bid solicitation process or the contract award process in order to avoid a substantial loss of funding to the state or to avoid substantial disruption of the timetable for any scheduled lottery game.

However, any prize, to the extent that it has not been assigned or encumbered pursuant to s. 24.1153, may be paid to the estate of a deceased prize winner or to a person designated pursuant to an appropriate court order. A prize that is payable in installments over time is assignable, but only pursuant to an appropriate court order as provided in s. 24.1153. (b) No prize shall be paid to any person under the age of 18 years unless the winning ticket was lawfully purchased and made a gift to the minor. In such case, the department shall direct payment to an adult member of the minor’s family or the legal guardian of the minor as custodian for the minor. The person named as custodian shall have the same powers and duties as prescribed for a custodian pursuant to chapter 710, the Florida Uniform Transfers to Minors Act. (c) No prize may be paid arising from claimed tickets that are stolen, counterfeit, altered, fraudulent, unissued, produced or issued in error, unreadable, not received or not recorded by the department by applicable deadlines, lacking in captions that confirm and agree with the lottery play symbols as appropriate to the lottery game involved, or not in compliance with such additional specific rules and public or confidential validation and security tests of the department appropriate to the particular lottery game involved. (d) No particular prize in any lottery game may be paid more than once, and in the event of a binding determination that more than one claimant is entitled to a particular prize, the sole remedy of such claimants is the award to each of them of an equal share in the prize. (e) For the convenience of the public, retailers may be authorized to pay winners amounts less than $600 after performing validation procedures on their premises appropriate to the lottery game involved. (f) Holders of tickets shall have the right to claim prizes for 180 days after the drawing or the end of the lottery game or play in which the prize was won; except that with respect to any game in which the player may determine instantly if he or she has won or lost, such right shall exist for 60 days after the end of the lottery game. If a valid claim is not made for a prize within the applicable period, the prize shall constitute an unclaimed prize for purposes of subsection (2). (g) No prize shall be paid upon a ticket purchased or sold in violation of this act or to any person who is prohibited from purchasing a lottery ticket pursuant to this act. Any such prize shall constitute an unclaimed prize for purposes of subsection (2). (2)(a) Eighty percent of all unclaimed prize money shall be deposited in the Educational Enhancement Trust Fund consistent with the provisions of s. 24.121(2). Subject to appropriations provided in the General Appropriations Act, these funds may be used to match private contributions received under the postsecondary matching grant programs established in ss. 1011.32, 1011.85, 1011.94, and 1013.79. (b) The remaining 20 percent of unclaimed prize money shall be added to the pool from which future prizes are to be awarded or used for special prize promotions. (3) The department shall be discharged of all liability upon payment of a prize. (4) It is the responsibility of the appropriate state agency and of the judicial branch to identify to the department, in the form and format prescribed by the department, persons owing an outstanding debt to any state agency or owing child support collected through a court, including spousal support or alimony for the spouse or former spouse of the obligor if the child support obligation is being enforced by the Department of Revenue. Prior to the payment of a prize of $600 or more to any claimant having such an outstanding obligation, the department shall transmit the amount of the debt to the agency claiming the debt and shall authorize payment of the balance to the prize winner after deduction of the debt. If a prize winner owes multiple debts subject to offset under this subsection and the prize is insufficient to cover all such debts, the amount of the prize shall be transmitted first to the agency claiming that past due child support is owed. If a balance of lottery prize remains after payment of past due child support, the remaining lottery prize amount shall be transmitted to other agencies claiming debts owed to the state, pro rata, based upon the ratio of the individual debt to the remaining debt owed to the state.

A court may issue an order approving a voluntary assignment and directing the department to make prize payments in whole or in part to the designated assignee, if the court finds that all of the following conditions have been met: (a) The assignment is in writing, is executed by the assignor, and is, by its terms, subject to the laws of this state. (b) The purchase price being paid for the payments being assigned represents a present value of the payments being assigned, discounted at an annual rate that does not exceed the state’s usury limit for loans. (c) The assignor provides a sworn affidavit attesting that he or she: 1. Is of sound mind, is in full command of his or her faculties, and is not acting under duress; 2. Has been advised regarding the assignment by his or her own independent legal counsel, who is unrelated to and is not being compensated by the assignee or any of the assignee’s affiliates, and has received independent financial or tax advice concerning the effects of the assignment from a lawyer or other professional who is unrelated to and is not being compensated by the assignee or any of the assignee’s affiliates; 3. Understands that he or she will not receive the prize payments or portions thereof for the years assigned; 4. Understands and agrees that with regard to the assigned payments the department and its officials and employees will have no further liability or responsibility to make the assigned payments to him or her; 5. Has been provided with a one-page written disclosure statement setting forth, in bold type of not less than 14 points, the payments being assigned, by amounts and payment dates; the purchase price being paid; the rate of discount to present value, assuming daily compounding and funding on the contract date; and the amount, if any, of any origination or closing fees that will be charged to him or her; and 6. Was advised in writing, at the time he or she signed the assignment contract, that he or she had the right to cancel the contract, without any further obligation, within 3 business days following the date on which the contract was signed. (d) Written notice of the proposed assignment and any court hearing concerning the proposed assignment is provided to the department’s counsel at least 10 days prior to any court hearing. The department is not required to appear in or be named as a party to any such action seeking judicial confirmation of an assignment under this section, but may intervene as of right in any such proceeding. (2) A certified copy of a court order approving a voluntary assignment must be provided to the department no later than 14 days before the date on which the payment is to be made. (3) In accordance with the provisions of s. 24.115(4), a voluntary assignment may not include or cover payments or portions of payments that are subject to offset on account of a defaulted or delinquent child support obligation or on account of a debt owed to a state agency. Each court order issued under subsection (1) shall provide that any delinquent child support obligations of the assigning prize winner and any debts owed to a state agency by the assigning prize winner, as of the date of the court order, shall be offset by the department first against remaining payments or portions thereof due the prize winner and then against payments due the assignee. (4) The department, and its respective officials and employees, shall be discharged of all liability upon payment of an assigned prize under this section. (5) The department may establish a reasonable fee to defray any administrative expenses associated with assignments made under this section, including the cost to the department of any processing fee that may be imposed by a private annuity provider. The fee amount shall reflect the direct and indirect costs associated with processing such assignments. (6) If at any time the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent jurisdiction issues a determination letter, revenue ruling, other public ruling of the Internal Revenue Service, or published decision to any state lottery or prize winner of any state lottery declaring that the voluntary assignment of prizes will affect the federal income tax treatment of prize winners who do not assign their prizes, the secretary of the department shall immediately file a copy of that letter, ruling, or published decision with the Secretary of State and the Office of the State Courts Administrator. A court may not issue an order authorizing a voluntary assignment under this section after the date any such ruling, letter, or published decision is filed. History.—s. 1, ch. 99-184.
