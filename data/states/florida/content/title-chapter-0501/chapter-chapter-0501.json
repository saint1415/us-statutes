      "text": "501.603 Definitions.—As used in this part, unless the context otherwise requires, the term: (1) “Commercial telephone solicitation” means: (a) An unsolicited telephone call to a person initiated by a commercial telephone seller or salesperson, or an automated dialing machine used in accordance with the provisions of s. 501.059(8) for the purpose of inducing the person to purchase or invest in consumer goods or services; (b) Other communication with a person where: 1. A gift, award, or prize is offered; or 2. A telephone call response is invited; and 3. The salesperson intends to complete a sale or enter into an agreement to purchase or invest in consumer goods or services during the course of the telephone call; or (c) Other communication with a person which represents a price, quality, or availability of consumer goods or services and which invites a response by telephone or which is followed by a call to the person by a salesperson. For purposes of this section, “other communication” means a written or oral notification or advertisement transmitted through any means. Also, for purposes of this section, “invites a response by telephone” does not mean the mere listing or including of a telephone number in a notification or advertisement. (2) “Commercial telephone seller” means a person who engages in commercial telephone solicitation on his or her own behalf or through salespersons. The term does not include a salesperson as defined in subsection (11) or a person or entity operating under a valid affidavit of exemption filed with the department according to s. 501.608(1)(b) or exempted from this part by s. 501.604. The term includes, but is not limited to, owners, operators, officers, directors, partners, or other individuals engaged in the management activities of a business entity pursuant to this part. (3) “Consumer goods or services” means any real property or any tangible or intangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes or any property of any nature which is solicited for the purpose of providing a profit or investment opportunity, including, without limitation, any such property intended to be attached to or installed in any real property, without regard to whether it is so attached or installed, as well as timeshare estates and licenses, and any services related to such property. (4) “Department” means the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. (5) “Enforcing authority” means the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services or the office of the state attorney if a violation of this part occurs in or affects the judicial circuit under the jurisdiction of the office of the state attorney. (6) “Gift, award, or prize” means a gratuity which the purchaser believes to be of value. (7) “Individual” means a single human being and does not mean a firm, association of individuals, corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, or any other entity. (8) “Novelty payment” means a payment method that does not provide systematic monitoring to detect and deter fraud. The term includes, but is not limited to, the following payment devices: (a) A remotely created check, which is a check that is not created by the paying bank and that does not bear the signature of the person on whose account the check is drawn. (b) A remotely created payment order, which is a payment instruction or order drawn on a person’s account which is initiated or created by the payee and which does not bear the signature of the person on whose account the order is drawn and which is cleared through a check-clearing system. (c) A cash-to-cash money transfer, which is the electronic transfer of the value of cash received from one person to another person in a different location which is sent by a money transfer provider and received in the form of cash. As used in this paragraph, the term “money transfer provider” means a person or financial institution that provides cash-to-cash money transfers for a person in the normal course of its business, regardless of whether the person holds an account with such person or financial institution. (d) A cash reload mechanism, which is a system that makes it possible to convert cash into an electronic form that a person can use to add money to a general-use prepaid card or an online account with a payment intermediary. As used in this paragraph, the term “mechanism” means a system that is purchased by a person on a prepaid basis, that enables access to the funds via an authorization code or other security measure, and that is not directly used as a general-use prepaid card. (9) “Person” includes any individual, group of individuals, firm, association, corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, or any other business entity.

(2) The amount of the bond, letter of credit, or certificate of deposit must be a minimum of $50,000, and the bond, letter of credit, or certificate of deposit must be in favor of the department for the use and benefit of a purchaser who is injured by the fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract, financial failure, or violation of this part by the applicant.
