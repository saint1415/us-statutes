      "text": "466.006 Examination of dentists.— (1)(a) It is the intent of the Legislature to reduce the costs associated with an independent state-developed practical or clinical examination to measure an applicant’s ability to practice the profession of dentistry and to use the American Dental Licensing Examination developed by the American Board of Dental Examiners, Inc., in lieu of an independent state-developed practical or clinical examination. The Legislature finds that the American Dental Licensing Examination, in both its structure and function, consistently meets generally accepted testing standards and has been found, as it is currently organized and operating, to adequately and reliably measure an applicant’s ability to practice the profession of dentistry. (b)1. Any person desiring to be licensed as a dentist must apply to the department. There is an application fee set by the board which may not exceed $100 and is nonrefundable. 2. Applicants for licensure must also submit to background screening in accordance with s. 456.0135. (2) The department shall license an applicant who the board certifies meets all of the following criteria: (a) Is 18 years of age or older. (b)1. Is a graduate of a dental school accredited by the American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation or its successor entity, if any, or any other dental accrediting entity recognized by the United States Department of Education; or 2. Is a dental student at an accredited dental school who has completed all the coursework necessary to prepare the student to perform the clinical and diagnostic procedures required to pass the licensure examinations. A dental school student who takes the licensure examinations during the student’s final year of an approved dental school must graduate before being certified for licensure pursuant to s. 466.011. (c) Has successfully completed the examination administered by the Joint Commission on National Dental Examinations or its successor organization. (3) If an applicant is a graduate of a dental college or school not accredited in accordance with paragraph (2)(b) or of a dental college or school not approved by the board, the applicant is not entitled to take the examinations required in this section to practice dentistry until she or he satisfies one of the following: (a) Completes a program of study, as defined by the board by rule, at an accredited American dental school and demonstrates receipt of a D.D.S. or D.M.D. from said school; or (b) Submits proof of having successfully completed at least 2 consecutive academic years at a full-time supplemental general dentistry program accredited by the American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation. This program must provide didactic and clinical education at the level of a D.D.S. or D.M.D. program accredited by the American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation. For purposes of this paragraph, a supplemental general dentistry program does not include an advanced education program in a dental specialty. (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law in chapter 456 pertaining to the clinical dental licensure examination or national examinations, to be licensed as a dentist in this state, an applicant must successfully complete both of the following: (a) A written examination on the laws and rules of the state regulating the practice of dentistry. (b) A practical or clinical examination, which must be the American Dental Licensing Examination produced by the American Board of Dental Examiners, Inc., or its successor entity, if any, which is administered in this state, provided that the board has attained, and continues to maintain thereafter, representation on the board of directors of the American Board of Dental Examiners, the examination development committee of the American Board of Dental Examiners, and such other committees of the American Board of Dental Examiners as the board deems appropriate by rule to assure that the standards established herein are maintained organizationally. 1. As an alternative to such practical or clinical examination, an applicant may submit scores from an American Dental Licensing Examination previously administered in a jurisdiction other than this state after October 1, 2011, and such examination results are recognized as valid for the purpose of licensure in this state. A passing score on the American Dental Licensing Examination administered out of state is the same as the passing score for the American Dental Licensing Examination administered in this state. The applicant must have completed the examination after October 1, 2011. This subparagraph may not be given retroactive application. 2. If the date of an applicant’s passing American Dental Licensing Examination scores from an examination previously administered in a jurisdiction other than this state under subparagraph 1. is older than 365 days, such scores are nevertheless valid for the purpose of licensure in this state, but only if the applicant demonstrates that all of the following additional standards have been met: a. The applicant completed the American Dental Licensing Examination after October 1, 2011. This sub-subparagraph may not be given retroactive application. b. The applicant graduated from a dental school accredited by the American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation or its successor entity, if any, or any other dental accrediting organization recognized by the United States Department of Education. Provided, however, if the applicant did not graduate from such a dental school, the applicant may submit proof of having successfully completed a full-time supplemental general dentistry program accredited by the American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation of at least 2 consecutive academic years at such accredited sponsoring institution. Such program must provide didactic and clinical education at the level of a D.D.S. or D.M.D. program accredited by the American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation. For purposes of this sub-subparagraph, a supplemental general dentistry program does not include an advanced education program in a dental specialty. c. The applicant currently possesses a valid and active dental license in good standing, with no restriction, which has never been revoked, suspended, restricted, or otherwise disciplined, from another state or territory of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. d. The applicant must disclose to the board during the application process if he or she has been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank, the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank, or the American Association of Dental Boards Clearinghouse. This sub-subparagraph does not apply if the applicant successfully appealed to have his or her name removed from the data banks of these agencies. e.(I)(A) The applicant submits proof of having been consecutively engaged in the full-time practice of dentistry in another state or territory of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in the 5 years immediately preceding the date of application for licensure in this state; or (B) If the applicant has been licensed in another state or territory of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for less than 5 years, the applicant submits proof of having been engaged in the full-time practice of dentistry since the date of his or her initial licensure. (II) As used in this section, “full-time practice” is defined as a minimum of 1,200 hours per year for each year in the consecutive 5-year period or, when applicable, the period since initial licensure, and must include any combination of the following: (A) Active clinical practice of dentistry providing direct patient care. (B) Full-time practice as a faculty member employed by a dental or dental hygiene school approved by the board or accredited by the American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation. (C) Full-time practice as a student at a postgraduate dental education program approved by the board or accredited by the American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation. (III) The board shall develop rules to determine what type of proof of full-time practice is required and to recoup the cost to the board of verifying full-time practice under this section. Such proof must, at a minimum, be: (A) Admissible as evidence in an administrative proceeding; (B) Submitted in writing; (C) Further documented by an applicant’s annual income tax return filed with the Internal Revenue Service for each year in the preceding 5-year period or, if the applicant has been practicing for less than 5 years, the period since initial licensure; and (D) Specifically found by the board to be both credible and admissible. (IV) The board may excuse applicants from the 1,200-hour requirement in the event of hardship, as defined by the board. f. The applicant submits documentation that he or she has completed, or will complete before he or she is licensed in this state, continuing education equivalent to this state’s requirements for the last full reporting biennium. g. The applicant proves that he or she has never been convicted of, or pled nolo contendere to, regardless of adjudication, any felony or misdemeanor related to the practice of a health care profession in any jurisdiction. h. The applicant has successfully passed a written examination on the laws and rules of this state regulating the practice of dentistry and the computer-based diagnostic skills examination. i. The applicant submits documentation that he or she has successfully completed the applicable examination administered by the Joint Commission on National Dental Examinations or its successor organization. (5)(a) The practical examination required under subsection (4) is the American Dental Licensing Examination developed by the American Board of Dental Examiners, Inc., or its successor entity, if any, provided the board finds that the successor entity’s clinical examination complies with the provisions of this section, and must include, at a minimum, all of the following: 1. A comprehensive diagnostic skills examination covering the full scope of dentistry and an examination on applied clinical diagnosis and treatment planning in dentistry for dental candidates. 2. Two restorations on a manikin that has typodont teeth with simulated caries as approved by the Commission on Dental Competency Assessments.

This section does not allow a person to be licensed as a dentist in this state without taking the examinations as set forth in s. 466.006, nor does this section mean that regional examinations administered under this section may be substituted for complying with testing requirements under s. 466.006. (2) Each school of dentistry in this state which is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of the American Dental Association or its successor agency may, upon written approval by the Board of Dentistry, offer regional licensure examinations only to dental students in the final year of a program at an approved dental school, if the board has approved the hosting school’s written plan to comply with the following conditions: (a) A member of the regional examination body’s board of directors or equivalent thereof must be a member of the American Association of Dental Examiners. (b) The student must have successfully passed parts I and II of the National Board of Dental Examiners examination within 2 years before taking the regional examination. (c) At least one of the examination monitors must be a dentist licensed in this state who has completed all necessary standardization exercises required by the regional examination body. Recruitment of examination monitors is the responsibility of the regional examination body. (d) The board chair or the chair’s designee must be allowed to observe testing while it is in progress. (e) Each student, upon being deemed eligible by the dental school to apply to the regional examination body to take the regional examination, must receive written disclosure in at least 12-point boldface type that states: “This examination does not meet the licensure requirements of chapter 466, Florida Statutes, for licensure in the State of Florida. Persons wishing to practice dentistry in Florida must pass the Florida licensure examinations.” (f) The student must be enrolled as a dental student in the student’s final year of a program at an approved dental school that is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of the American Dental Association or its successor agency. (g) The student must have completed all coursework deemed necessary by the dental school to prepare the student to perform all clinical and diagnostic procedures required to pass the regional examination. (3) A student who takes the examination pursuant to this section, a dental school that submits a plan pursuant to this section, or a regional examination body that a dental school proposes to host under this section does not have standing to assert that a state agency has taken action for which a hearing may be sought under ss. 120.569 and 120.57.

Therefore, notwithstanding the requirements of s. 466.006, the board shall grant a health access dental license to practice dentistry in this state in health access settings as defined in s. 466.003 to an applicant who meets all of the following criteria: (1) Files an appropriate application approved by the board. (2) Pays an application license fee for a health access dental license, laws-and-rule exam fee, and an initial licensure fee. The fees specified in this subsection may not differ from an applicant seeking licensure pursuant to s. 466.006. (3) Has submitted to background screening in accordance with s. 456.0135 and has not been convicted of or pled nolo contendere to, regardless of adjudication, any felony or misdemeanor related to the practice of a health care profession. (4) Submits proof of graduation from a dental school accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association or its successor agency. (5) Submits documentation that she or he has completed, or will obtain before licensure, continuing education equivalent to this state’s requirement for dentists licensed under s. 466.006 for the last full reporting biennium before applying for a health access dental license. (6) Submits proof of her or his successful completion of parts I and II of the dental examination by the National Board of Dental Examiners and a state or regional clinical dental licensing examination that the board has determined effectively measures the applicant’s ability to practice safely. (7) Currently holds a valid, active dental license in good standing which has not been revoked, suspended, restricted, or otherwise disciplined from another of the United States, the District of Columbia, or a United States territory. (8) Has never had a license revoked from another of the United States, the District of Columbia, or a United States territory. (9) Has never failed the examination specified in s. 466.006, unless the applicant was reexamined pursuant to s. 466.006 and received a license to practice dentistry in this state. (10) Has not been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank, unless the applicant successfully appealed to have his or her name removed from the data bank. (11) Submits proof that he or she has been engaged in the active, clinical practice of dentistry providing direct patient care for 5 years immediately preceding the date of application, or in instances when the applicant has graduated from an accredited dental school within the preceding 5 years, submits proof of continuous clinical practice providing direct patient care since graduation.

It is the purpose of this section to provide for the evaluation of foreign dental schools and the certification of those foreign dental schools which provide an education which is reasonably comparable to that of similar accredited institutions in the United States and which adequately prepare their students for the practice of dentistry. (2) The department shall be responsible for the certification of foreign dental schools based on standards established pursuant to subsection (4). The department may contract with outside consultants or a national professional organization to survey and evaluate foreign dental schools. Such consultant or organization shall report to the department regarding its findings in the survey and evaluation. (3) The department shall establish a technical advisory group to review and comment upon the survey and evaluation of a foreign dental school contracted for pursuant to subsection (2) prior to any final action by the department regarding certification of the foreign dental school. The technical advisory group shall be selected by the department and shall consist of four dentists, two of whom shall be selected from a list of five recognized United States dental educators recommended by the foreign school seeking certification. None of the members of the technical advisory group shall be affiliated with the school seeking certification. (4) Any foreign dental school which wishes to be certified pursuant to this section shall make application to the department for such certification, which shall be based upon a finding that the educational program of the foreign dental school is reasonably comparable to that of similar accredited institutions in the United States and adequately prepares its students for the practice of dentistry. Curriculum, faculty qualifications, student attendance, plant and facilities, and other relevant factors shall be reviewed and evaluated. The board, with the cooperation of the department, shall identify by rule the standards and review procedures and methodology to be used in the certification process consistent with this subsection. The department shall not grant certification if deficiencies found are of such magnitude as to prevent the students in the school from receiving an educational base suitable for the practice of dentistry. (5) Periodic surveys and evaluations of all certified schools shall be made to ensure continued compliance with this section. Certification shall include provisional and full certification. The provisional form of certification shall be for a period determined by the department, not to exceed 3 years, and shall be granted to an institution, in accordance with rule, to provide reasonable time for the school seeking permanent certification to overcome deficiencies found by the department.

(2) Pharmacists licensed pursuant to chapter 465 may fill prescriptions of legally licensed dentists in this state for any drugs necessary for the practice of dentistry. (3) The board shall adopt rules which: (a) Define general anesthesia. (b) Specify which methods of general or local anesthesia or sedation, if any, are limited or prohibited for use by dentists. (c) Establish minimal training, education, experience, or certification for a dentist to use general anesthesia or sedation, which rules may exclude, in the board’s discretion, those dentists using general anesthesia or sedation in a competent and effective manner as of the effective date of the rules. (d) Establish further requirements relating to the use of general anesthesia or sedation, including, but not limited to, office equipment and the training of dental assistants or dental hygienists who work with dentists using general anesthesia or sedation. (e) Establish an administrative mechanism enabling the board to verify compliance with training, education, experience, equipment, or certification requirements of dentists, dental hygienists, and dental assistants adopted pursuant to this subsection. The board may charge a fee to defray the cost of verifying compliance with requirements adopted pursuant to this paragraph. (4) A dentist or dental hygienist who administers or employs the use of any form of anesthesia must possess a certification in either basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation for health professionals or advanced cardiac life support approved by the American Heart Association or the American Red Cross or an equivalent agency-sponsored course with recertification every 2 years. Each dental office which uses any form of anesthesia must have immediately available and in good working order such resuscitative equipment, oxygen, and other resuscitative drugs as are specified by rule of the board in order to manage possible adverse reactions. (5) A dental hygienist under the direct supervision of a dentist may administer local anesthesia, including intraoral block anesthesia, soft tissue infiltration anesthesia, or both, to a nonsedated patient who is 18 years of age or older, if the following criteria are met: (a) The dental hygienist has successfully completed a course in the administration of local anesthesia which is offered by a dental or dental hygiene program accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association or approved by the board. The course must include a minimum of 30 hours of didactic instruction and 30 hours of clinical experience, and instruction in: 1. Theory of pain control. 2. Selection-of-pain-control modalities. 3. Anatomy. 4. Neurophysiology. 5. Pharmacology of local anesthetics. 6. Pharmacology of vasoconstrictors. 7. Psychological aspects of pain control. 8. Systematic complications. 9. Techniques of maxillary anesthesia. 10. Techniques of mandibular anesthesia. 11. Infection control. 12. Medical emergencies involving local anesthesia. (b) The dental hygienist presents evidence of current certification in basic or advanced cardiac life support. (c) The dental hygienist possesses a valid certificate issued under subsection (6). (6) Any dental hygienist seeking a certificate to administer local anesthesia must apply to the department, remit an application fee, and submit proof of successful completion of a course in the administration of local anesthesia pursuant to subsection (5). The board shall certify, and the department shall issue a certificate to, any dental hygienist who fulfills the qualifications of subsection (5). The board shall establish a one-time application fee not to exceed $35. The certificate is not subject to renewal but is part of the dental hygienist’s permanent record and must be prominently displayed at the location where the dental hygienist is authorized to administer local anesthesia. The board shall adopt rules necessary to administer subsection (5) and this subsection. (7) A licensed dentist may utilize an X-ray machine, expose dental X-ray films, and interpret or read such films. The provisions of part IV of chapter 468 to the contrary notwithstanding, a licensed dentist may authorize or direct a dental assistant to operate such equipment and expose such films under her or his direction and supervision, pursuant to rules adopted by the board in accordance with s. 466.024 which ensure that said assistant is competent by reason of training and experience to operate said equipment in a safe and efficient manner. The board may charge a fee not to exceed $35 to defray the cost of verifying compliance with requirements adopted pursuant to this section. (8) The provisions of s. 465.0276 notwithstanding, a dentist need not register with the board or comply with the continuing education requirements of that section if the dentist confines her or his dispensing activity to the dispensing of fluorides and chlorohexidine rinse solutions; provided that the dentist complies with and is subject to all laws and rules applicable to pharmacists and pharmacies, including, but not limited to, chapters 465, 499, and 893, and all applicable federal laws and regulations, when dispensing such products. (9) Any adverse incident that occurs in an office maintained by a dentist must be reported to the department. The required notification to the department must be submitted in writing by certified mail and postmarked within 48 hours after the incident occurs. (10) A dentist practicing in this state must notify the board in writing by certified mail within 48 hours after any adverse incident that occurs in the dentist’s outpatient facility. A complete written report must be filed with the board within 30 days after the incident occurs. (11) Any certified registered dental hygienist administering local anesthesia must notify the board in writing by registered mail within 48 hours after any adverse incident that was related to or the result of the administration of local anesthesia. A complete written report must be filed with the board within 30 days after the mortality or other adverse incident. (12) A failure by the dentist or dental hygienist to timely and completely comply with all the reporting requirements in this section is the basis for disciplinary action by the board pursuant to s. 466.028(1). (13) The department shall review each adverse incident and determine whether it involved conduct by a health care professional subject to disciplinary action, in which case s. 456.073 applies. Disciplinary action, if any, shall be taken by the board under which the health care professional is licensed. (14) As used in subsections (9)-(13), the term “adverse incident” means any mortality that occurs during or as the result of a dental procedure, or an incident that results in a temporary or permanent physical or mental injury that requires hospitalization or emergency room treatment of a dental patient which occurs during or as a direct result of the use of general anesthesia, deep sedation, moderate sedation, pediatric moderate sedation, oral sedation, minimal sedation (anxiolysis), nitrous oxide, or local anesthesia.

      "text": "466.018 Dentist of record; patient records.— (1) Each patient shall have a dentist of record. The dentist of record shall remain primarily responsible for all dental treatment on such patient regardless of whether the treatment is rendered by the dentist or by another dentist, dental hygienist, or dental assistant rendering such treatment in conjunction with, at the direction or request of, or under the supervision of such dentist of record. The dentist of record shall be identified in the record of the patient. If treatment is rendered by a dentist other than the dentist of record or by a dental hygienist or assistant, the name or initials of such person shall be placed in the record of the patient. In any disciplinary proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter or chapter 456, it shall be presumed as a matter of law that treatment was rendered by the dentist of record unless otherwise noted on the patient record pursuant to this section. The dentist of record and any other treating dentist are subject to discipline pursuant to this chapter or chapter 456 for treatment rendered the patient and performed in violation of such chapter. One of the purposes of this section is to ensure that the responsibility for each patient is assigned to one dentist in a multidentist practice of any nature and to assign primary responsibility to the dentist for treatment rendered by a dental hygienist or assistant under her or his supervision. This section shall not be construed to assign any responsibility to a dentist of record for treatment rendered pursuant to a proper referral to another dentist not in practice with the dentist of record or to prohibit a patient from voluntarily selecting a new dentist without permission of the dentist of record. (2) If the dentist of record is not identified in the patient record as required by subsection (1), it shall be presumed as a matter of law that the dentist of record is the owner of the dental practice in which the patient was treated. Further, the dentist of record in a multidentist practice shall not change unless the subsequent treating dentist acknowledges in writing in the record that she or he is now the dentist of record for the patient. It shall be presumed as a matter of law that a new dentist of record has taken or reviewed the patient’s medical history and dental records, that she or he has examined the patient, and that she or he has either developed a new treatment plan or has agreed to continue the preexisting treatment plan. However, the dentist of record shall be changed when the dentist of record leaves the practice where the treatment was being rendered and the patient elects to continue treatment in the office where treatment began. (3) Every dentist shall maintain written dental records and medical history records which justify the course of treatment of the patient. The records shall include, but not be limited to, patient history, examination results, test results, and, if taken, X rays. (4) In a multidentist practice of any nature, the owner dentist shall maintain either the original or a duplicate of all patient records, including dental charts, patient histories, examination and test results, study models, and X rays, of any patient treated by a dentist at the owner dentist’s practice facility. The purpose of this requirement is to impose a duty upon the owner of a multidentist practice to maintain patient records for all patients treated at the owner’s practice facility whether or not the owner was involved in the patient’s treatment. This subsection does not relieve the dentist of record in a multidentist practice of the responsibility to maintain patient records. An owner dentist of a multidentist practice may be relieved of the responsibility to maintain the original or duplicate patient records for patients treated at the owner dentist’s practice facility if, upon request of the patient or the patient’s legal representative, she or he transfers custody of the records to another dentist, the patient, or the patient’s legal representative and retains, in lieu of the records, a written statement, signed by the owner dentist, the person who received the records, and two witnesses, that lists the date, the records that were transferred, and the persons to whom the records were transferred. Further, the dentist of record may be relieved of the responsibility to maintain the original or duplicate patient records if she or he leaves the practice where the treatment was rendered, transfers custody of the records to the owner of the practice, and retains, in lieu of the records, a written statement, signed by the dentist of record, the owner of the practice, and two witnesses, that lists the date and the records that were transferred. The owner dentist shall provide reasonable access to duplicate records at cost. (5) All patient records kept in accordance with this section shall be maintained for a period of 4 years from the date of the patient’s last appointment.

(2) The purpose of this section is to ensure that the public has access to information which provides a sufficient basis upon which to make an informed selection of dentists while also ensuring that the public is protected from false or misleading advertisements which would detract from a fair and rational selection process. The board shall adopt rules to carry out the intent of this section, the purpose of which shall be to regulate the manner of such advertising in keeping with the provisions hereof. (3) An advertisement by a licensed dentist may not contain any false, fraudulent, misleading, or deceptive statement or claim or any statement or claim which: (a) Contains misrepresentations of fact; (b) Is likely to mislead or deceive because in context it makes only a partial disclosure of relevant facts; (c) Contains laudatory statements about the dentist or group of dentists; (d) Is intended or is likely to create false, unjustified expectations of favorable results; (e) Relates to the quality of dental services provided as compared to other available dental services; (f) Is intended or is likely to appeal primarily to a layperson’s fears; (g) Contains fee information without a disclaimer that such is a minimum fee only; or (h) Contains other representations or implications that in reasonable probability will cause an ordinary, prudent person to misunderstand or to be deceived. (4) An advertisement of dental services provided through telehealth as defined in s. 456.47(1) must include a disclaimer that reads, in a clearly legible font and size, “An in-person examination with a dentist licensed under chapter 466, Florida Statutes, is recommended before beginning telehealth treatment in order to prevent injury or harm” for each of the following services, if advertised: (a) The taking of an impression or the digital scanning of the human tooth, teeth, or jaws, directly or indirectly and by any means or method. (b) Furnishing, supplying, constructing, reproducing, or repairing any prosthetic denture, bridge, or appliance or any other structure designed to be worn in the human mouth. (c) Placing an appliance or a structure in the human mouth or adjusting or attempting to adjust the appliance or structure. (d) Correcting or attempting to correct malformations of teeth or jaws. (5) For purposes of this section, D.D.S. or D.M.D. are synonymous and may be used interchangeably by licensed dentists who have graduated from an accredited American dental school with a D.D.S. or D.M.D. degree, when advertising dental services.

      "text": "466.021 Retention of dental laboratories by dentist; penalty.—Each licensed dentist who uses the services of any dental laboratory for the purpose of constructing, altering, repairing, or duplicating any denture, implant, veneer, partial denture, bridge splint, orthodontic or other prosthetic appliance, or other suitable form of artificial oral restorative device shall be required to furnish the dental laboratory with a written prescription in a form prescribed by rule of the board. This prescription shall be dated and signed by the dentist and shall include the license number of the dentist, the patient’s name or number with sufficient descriptive information to clearly identify each separate and individual piece of work to be performed by the dental laboratory, and a specification of materials to be contained in each work product. A copy of the prescription shall be retained in a file in the prescribing dentist’s office for a period of 4 years following the date the prescription was issued, and the original prescription shall be retained in a file by the dental laboratory for a period of 4 years. A registered dental laboratory shall disclose in writing at the time of delivery of the final restoration to the prescribing dentist the materials and all certificates of authenticity that constitute each product manufactured and the point of origin of manufacture of each restoration, including the address and contact information of the dental laboratory. The file of prescriptions to be kept by the dentist and the dental laboratory shall be open to inspection at any reasonable time by the department or its constituted agent. Failure of the dentist to keep records of each prescription shall subject the dentist to suspension or revocation of her or his license to practice dentistry in this state. Failure of a dental laboratory that has accepted a prescription to have the original or electronic copy of each prescription and to ensure the accuracy of each product’s material disclosure at the time it is delivered to the prescribing dentist as required by this section is admissible evidence of a violation of this chapter and constitutes a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. This section does not preclude a registered dental laboratory from working for another registered dental laboratory if that work is performed pursuant to written authorization, in a form to be prescribed by rule of the board, which evidences that the originating laboratory has obtained a valid prescription and which sets forth the work to be performed and the resulting material certifications to be provided. A dental laboratory accepting prescriptions from dentists is liable for damages caused by inaccuracies in the material disclosure, certificates of authenticity, or point of origin provided by the dental laboratory to the prescribing dentist. This section does not preclude a registered laboratory from providing its services to dentists licensed and practicing in another state if that work is requested or otherwise authorized in written form that clearly identifies the name and address of the requesting dentist and sets forth the work to be performed and otherwise complies with all applicable laws and treaties.

      "text": "466.022 Peer review; records; immunity; confidentiality.— (1) The Legislature finds that effective peer review of consumer complaints by professional associations of dentists is a valuable service to the public. In performing such service, any member of a peer review organization or committee shall, pursuant to s. 466.028(1)(f), report to the department the name of any licensee who he or she believes has violated this chapter. Any such peer review committee member shall be afforded the privileges and immunities of any other complainant or witness which are provided by s. 456.073(11). Furthermore, a professional organization or association of dentists which sponsors, sanctions, or otherwise operates or participates in peer review activities is hereby afforded the same privileges and immunities afforded to any member of a duly constituted medical review committee by s. 766.101(3). (2) Information obtained from the official records of peer review organizations or committees shall not be subject to discovery or introduction into evidence in any disciplinary proceeding against a licensee. Further, no person who voluntarily serves on a peer review committee or who investigates a complaint for the committee shall be permitted or required to testify in any such disciplinary proceeding as to any evidence or other matters produced or presented during the proceedings of such organization or committee or as to any findings, recommendations, evaluations, opinions, or other actions of such organization or committee or any members thereof. However, nothing in this section shall be construed to mean that information, documents, or records otherwise available and obtained from original sources are immune from discovery or use in any such disciplinary proceeding merely because they were presented during proceedings of a peer review organization or committee. Members of peer review organizations shall assist the department in identification of such original sources when possible. (3) Peer review information obtained by the department as background information shall remain confidential and exempt from ss. 119.07(1) and 286.011 regardless of whether probable cause is found. The provisions of s. 766.101 continue to apply in full notwithstanding the fact that peer review information becomes available to the department pursuant to this chapter. For the purpose of this section, official records of peer review organizations or committees include correspondence between the dentist who is the subject of the complaint and the organization; correspondence between the complainant and the organization; diagnostic data, treatment plans, and radiographs used by investigators or otherwise relied upon by the organization or committee; results of patient examinations; interviews; evaluation worksheets; recommendation worksheets; and peer review report forms.

In addition, dental hygienists may expose dental X-ray films, apply topical preventive or prophylactic agents, and perform all tasks delegable by the dentist in accordance with s. 466.024. The board by rule shall determine whether such functions shall be performed under the direct, indirect, or general supervision of the dentist. (2) Dental hygienists may perform their duties: (a) In the office of a licensed dentist; (b) In public health programs and institutions of the Department of Children and Families, Department of Health, and Department of Juvenile Justice under the general supervision of a licensed dentist; (c) In a health access setting as defined in s. 466.003; or (d) Upon a patient of record of a dentist who has issued a prescription for the services of a dental hygienist, which prescription shall be valid for 2 years unless a shorter length of time is designated by the dentist, in: 1.

(4) The board by rule may limit the number of dental hygienists or dental assistants to be supervised by a dentist if they perform expanded duties requiring direct or indirect supervision pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The purpose of the limitation shall be to protect the health and safety of patients and to ensure that procedures which require more than general supervision be adequately supervised. However, the Department of Children and Families, Department of Health, Department of Juvenile Justice, and public institutions approved by the board shall not be so limited as to the number of dental hygienists or dental assistants working under the supervision of a licensed dentist.

(2) A dental hygienist may, without supervision and within the lawful scope of his or her duties as authorized by law, perform dental charting of hard and soft tissues in public and private educational institutions of the state and Federal Government, nursing homes, assisted living and long-term care facilities, community health centers, county health departments, mobile dental or health units, health access settings as defined in s. 466.003, and epidemiological surveys for public health. A dental hygienist may also perform dental charting on a volunteer basis at health fairs. (3) Each person who receives a dental charting pursuant to this section, or the parent or legal guardian of the person, shall receive and acknowledge a written disclosure form before receiving the dental charting procedure that states that the purpose of the dental charting is to collect data for use by a dentist at a prompt subsequent examination. The disclosure form shall also emphasize that diagnosis of caries, soft tissue disease, oral cancer, temporomandibular joint disease (TMJ), and dentofacial malocclusions can only be completed by a dentist in the context of delivering a comprehensive dental examination. (4) The board shall approve the content of charting and disclosure forms to be used under this section. Both forms shall emphasize the inherent limitations of dental charting and encourage complete examination by a dentist in rendering a professional diagnosis of the patient’s overall oral health needs. (5) Dental charting performed under this section is not a substitute for a comprehensive dental examination. (6) Medical clearance by a physician or dentist is required before a periodontal probe may be used on a person who receives a dental charting. (7) Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit direct reimbursement for dental charting performed under this section by Medicaid, health insurers, health maintenance organizations, prepaid dental plans, or other third-party payors beyond what is otherwise allowable by law. (8) All referrals made in conjunction with the provision of dental charting services under this section shall be in strict conformance with federal and state patient referral, anti-kickback, and patient brokering laws. (9) A dental hygienist performing dental charting without supervision shall not be deemed to have created either a patient of record or a medical record.

A dentist licensed under this chapter or a physician licensed under chapter 458 or chapter 459 must give medical clearance before a dental hygienist removes calculus deposits, accretions, and stains from exposed surfaces of the teeth or from tooth surfaces within the gingival sulcus. 2. A dentist shall conduct a dental examination on a patient within 13 months after a dental hygienist removes the patient’s calculus deposits, accretions, and stains from exposed surfaces of the teeth or from tooth surfaces within the gingival sulcus. Additional oral hygiene services may not be performed under this paragraph without a clinical examination by a dentist who is licensed under this chapter. This subsection does not authorize a dental hygienist to perform root planing or gingival curettage without supervision by a dentist. (3) For all remediable tasks listed in subsection (2), the following disclaimer must be provided to the patient in writing before any procedure is performed: (a) The services being offered are not a substitute for a comprehensive dental exam by a dentist. (b) The diagnosis of caries, soft tissue disease, oral cancer, temporomandibular joint disease (TMJ), and dentofacial malocclusions will be completed only by a dentist in the context of delivering a comprehensive dental exam. (4) This section does not prevent a program operated by one of the health access settings as defined in s. 466.003 or a nonprofit organization that is exempt from federal income taxation under s. 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and described in s. 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code from billing and obtaining reimbursement for the services described in this section which are provided by a dental hygienist or from making or maintaining any records pursuant to s. 456.057 necessary to obtain reimbursement. (5) A dental hygienist who performs, without supervision, the remediable tasks listed in subsection (2) shall: (a) Provide a dental referral in strict compliance with federal and state patient referral, anti-kickback, and patient brokering laws. (b) Encourage the establishment of a dental home. (c) Maintain professional malpractice insurance coverage that has minimum limits of $100,000 per occurrence and $300,000 in the aggregate through the employing health access setting or individual policy. (6) Notwithstanding subsection (1) or subsection (2), a dentist may delegate the tasks of gingival curettage and root planing to a dental hygienist but not to a dental assistant. (7) All other remediable tasks shall be performed under the direct, indirect, or general supervision of a dentist, as determined by rule of the board, and after such formal or on-the-job training by the dental hygienist or dental assistant as the board by rule may require. The board by rule may establish a certification process for expanded-duty dental assistants, establishing such training or experience criteria or examinations as it deems necessary and specifying which tasks may be delegable only to such assistants. If the board does establish such a certification process, the department shall implement the application process for such certification and administer any examinations required. (8) Notwithstanding subsection (1) or subsection (2), a dentist may not delegate to anyone other than another licensed dentist: (a) Any prescription of drugs or medications requiring the written order or prescription of a licensed dentist or physician. (b) Any diagnosis for treatment or treatment planning. (9) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a dentist is primarily responsible for all procedures delegated by her or him. (10) A dental assistant may not perform an intraoral procedure except after such formal or on-the-job training as the board by rule shall prescribe.

      "text": "466.028 Grounds for disciplinary action; action by the board.— (1) The following acts constitute grounds for denial of a license or disciplinary action, as specified in s. 456.072(2): (a) Attempting to obtain, obtaining, or renewing a license under this chapter by bribery, fraudulent misrepresentations, or through an error of the department or the board. (b) Having a license to practice dentistry or dental hygiene revoked, suspended, or otherwise acted against, including the denial of licensure, by the licensing authority of another state, territory, or country. (c) Being convicted or found guilty of or entering a plea of nolo contendere to, regardless of adjudication, a crime in any jurisdiction which relates to the practice of dentistry or dental hygiene. A plea of nolo contendere shall create a rebuttable presumption of guilt to the underlying criminal charges. (d) Advertising goods or services in a manner which is fraudulent, false, deceptive, or misleading in form or content contrary to s. 466.019 or rules of the board adopted pursuant thereto. (e) Advertising, practicing, or attempting to practice under a name other than one’s own. (f) Failing to report to the department any person who the licensee knows, or has reason to believe, is clearly in violation of this chapter or of the rules of the department or the board. However, a person who the licensee knows, or has reason to believe, is clearly unable to practice her or his profession with reasonable skill and safety to patients by reason of illness or use of alcohol, drugs, narcotics, chemicals, or any other type of material, or as a result of a mental or physical condition, may be reported to a consultant operating an impaired practitioner program as described in s. 456.076 rather than to the department. (g) Aiding, assisting, procuring, or advising any unlicensed person to practice dentistry or dental hygiene contrary to this chapter or to a rule of the department or the board. (h) Being employed by any corporation, organization, group, or person other than a dentist or a professional corporation or limited liability company composed of dentists to practice dentistry. (i) Failing to perform any statutory or legal obligation placed upon a licensee. (j) Making or filing a report which the licensee knows to be false, failing to file a report or record required by state or federal law, knowingly impeding or obstructing such filing or inducing another person to do so. Such reports or records shall include only those which are signed in the capacity as a licensee. (k) Committing any act which would constitute sexual battery, as defined in chapter 794, upon a patient or intentionally touching the sexual organ of a patient. (l) Making deceptive, untrue, or fraudulent representations in or related to the practice of dentistry. (m) Failing to keep written dental records and medical history records justifying the course of treatment of the patient including, but not limited to, patient histories, examination results, test results, and X rays, if taken. (n) Failing to make available to a patient or client, or to her or his legal representative or to the department if authorized in writing by the patient, copies of documents in the possession or under control of the licensee which relate to the patient or client. (o) Performing professional services which have not been duly authorized by the patient or client, or her or his legal representative, except as provided in ss. 766.103 and 768.13. (p) Prescribing, procuring, dispensing, administering, mixing, or otherwise preparing a legend drug, including any controlled substance, other than in the course of the professional practice of the dentist. For the purposes of this paragraph, it shall be legally presumed that prescribing, procuring, dispensing, administering, mixing, or otherwise preparing legend drugs, including all controlled substances, in excessive or inappropriate quantities is not in the best interest of the patient and is not in the course of the professional practice of the dentist, without regard to her or his intent. (q) Prescribing, procuring, dispensing, or administering any medicinal drug appearing on any schedule set forth in chapter 893, by a dentist to herself or himself, except those prescribed, dispensed, or administered to the dentist by another practitioner authorized to prescribe them. (r) Prescribing, procuring, ordering, dispensing, administering, supplying, selling, or giving any drug which is a Schedule II amphetamine or a Schedule II sympathomimetic amine drug or a compound thereof, pursuant to chapter 893, to or for any person except for the clinical investigation of the effects of such drugs or compounds when an investigative protocol therefor is submitted to, and reviewed and approved by, the board before such investigation is begun. (s) Being unable to practice her or his profession with reasonable skill and safety to patients by reason of illness or use of alcohol, drugs, narcotics, chemicals, or any other type of material or as a result of any mental or physical condition. In enforcing this paragraph, the department shall have, upon a finding of the State Surgeon General or her or his designee that probable cause exists to believe that the licensee is unable to practice dentistry or dental hygiene because of the reasons stated in this paragraph, the authority to issue an order to compel a licensee to submit to a mental or physical examination by physicians designated by the department. If the licensee refuses to comply with such order, the department’s order directing such examination may be enforced by filing a petition for enforcement in the circuit court where the licensee resides or does business. The licensee against whom the petition is filed shall not be named or identified by initials in any public court records or documents, and the proceedings shall be closed to the public. The department shall be entitled to the summary procedure provided in s. 51.011. A licensee affected under this paragraph shall at reasonable intervals be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate that she or he can resume the competent practice of her or his profession with reasonable skill and safety to patients. (t) Committing fraud, deceit, or misconduct in the practice of dentistry or dental hygiene. (u) Failing to provide and maintain reasonable sanitary facilities and conditions. (v) Failing to provide adequate radiation safeguards. (w) Performing any procedure or prescribing any therapy which, by the prevailing standards of dental practice in the community, would constitute experimentation on human subjects, without first obtaining full, informed, and written consent. (x) Being guilty of incompetence or negligence by failing to meet the minimum standards of performance in diagnosis and treatment when measured against generally prevailing peer performance, including, but not limited to, the undertaking of diagnosis and treatment for which the dentist is not qualified by training or experience or being guilty of dental malpractice. For purposes of this paragraph, it shall be legally presumed that a dentist is not guilty of incompetence or negligence by declining to treat an individual if, in the dentist’s professional judgment, the dentist or a member of her or his clinical staff is not qualified by training and experience, or the dentist’s treatment facility is not clinically satisfactory or properly equipped to treat the unique characteristics and health status of the dental patient, provided the dentist refers the patient to a qualified dentist or facility for appropriate treatment. As used in this paragraph, “dental malpractice” includes, but is not limited to, three or more claims within the previous 5-year period which resulted in indemnity being paid, or any single indemnity paid in excess of $25,000 in a judgment or settlement, as a result of negligent conduct on the part of the dentist. (y) Practicing or offering to practice beyond the scope permitted by law or accepting and performing professional responsibilities which the licensee knows or has reason to know that she or he is not competent to perform. (z) Delegating professional responsibilities to a person who is not qualified by training, experience, or licensure to perform them. (aa) Violating a lawful order of the board or department previously entered in a disciplinary hearing; or failure to comply with a lawfully issued subpoena of the board or department. (bb) Conspiring with another licensee or with any person to commit an act, or committing an act, which would tend to coerce, intimidate, or preclude another licensee from lawfully advertising her or his services. (cc) Being adjudged mentally incompetent in this or any other state, the discipline for which shall last only so long as the adjudication. (dd) Presigning blank prescription or laboratory work order forms. (ee) Prescribing, ordering, dispensing, administering, supplying, selling, or giving growth hormones, testosterone or its analogs, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), or other hormones for the purpose of muscle building or to enhance athletic performance. For the purposes of this subsection, the term “muscle building” does not include the treatment of injured muscle. A prescription written for the drug products listed above may be dispensed by the pharmacist with the presumption that the prescription is for legitimate medical use. (ff) Operating or causing to be operated a dental office in such a manner as to result in dental treatment that is below minimum acceptable standards of performance for the community. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of substandard materials or equipment, the imposition of time limitations within which dental procedures are to be performed, or the failure to maintain patient records as required by this chapter. (gg) Administering anesthesia in a manner which violates rules of the board adopted pursuant to s. 466.017. (hh) Failing to report to the department any licensee under chapter 458 or chapter 459 who the dentist knows has violated the grounds for disciplinary action set out in the law under which that person is licensed and who provides health care services in a facility licensed under chapter 395, or a health maintenance organization certificated under part I of chapter 641, in which the dentist also provides services. (ii) Failing to report to the board, in writing, within 30 days if action has been taken against one’s license to practice dentistry in another state, territory, or country. (jj) Advertising specialty services in violation of this chapter. (kk) Allowing any person other than another dentist or a professional corporation or limited liability company composed of dentists to direct, control, or interfere with a dentist’s clinical judgment; however, this paragraph may not be construed to limit a patient’s right of informed consent. To direct, control, or interfere with a dentist’s clinical judgment may not be interpreted to mean dental services contractually excluded, the application of alternative benefits that may be appropriate given the dentist’s prescribed course of treatment, or the application of contractual provisions and scope of coverage determinations in comparison with a dentist’s prescribed treatment on behalf of a covered person by an insurer, health maintenance organization, or a prepaid limited health service organization. (ll) Providing deceptive or fraudulent expert witness testimony related to the practice of dentistry. (mm) Failing by the dentist of record, before the initial diagnosis and correction of a malposition of human teeth or initial use of an orthodontic appliance, to perform an in-person examination of the patient or obtain records from an in-person examination within the last 12 months and to perform a review of the patient’s most recent diagnostic digital or conventional radiographs or other equivalent bone imaging suitable for orthodontia. (nn) Failing to provide each patient with the name, contact telephone number, after-hours contact information for emergencies, and license information of each dentist who is providing dental services to the patient. (oo) Violating any provision of this chapter or chapter 456, or any rules adopted pursuant thereto. (2) The board may enter an order denying licensure or imposing any of the penalties in s. 456.072(2) against any applicant for licensure or licensee who is found guilty of violating any provision of subsection (1) of this section or who is found guilty of violating any provision of s. 456.072(1). (3) There shall be a minimum 6-month suspension of the license of a dentist who is convicted of a violation of paragraph (1)(z). (4) The department shall reissue the license of a disciplined licensee upon certification by the board that the disciplined licensee has complied with all of the terms and conditions set forth in the final order. (5) In addition, if the department finds that an applicant has a complaint filed against her or him in another jurisdiction, the board may deny the application pending final disposition of the complaint. (6) Upon the department’s receipt from an insurer or self-insurer of a report of a closed claim against a dentist pursuant to s. 627.912 or upon the receipt from a claimant of a presuit notice against a dentist pursuant to s. 766.106 the department shall review each report and determine whether it potentially involved conduct by a licensee that is subject to disciplinary action, in which case the provisions of s. 456.073 shall apply. However, if it is reported that a dentist has had any indemnity paid in excess of $25,000 in a judgment or settlement or has had three or more claims for dental malpractice within the previous 5-year period which resulted in indemnity being paid, the department shall investigate the occurrence upon which the claims were based and determine if action by the department against the dentist is warranted. (7) Subject to the authority and conditions established in s. 456.073, the probable cause panel of the board may recommend that the department seek a specified penalty in cases in which probable cause has been found and the panel has directed that an administrative complaint be filed. If the department seeks a penalty other than that recommended by the probable cause panel, the department shall provide the board with a written statement which sets forth the reasons therefor. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude a probable cause panel of any other board under the jurisdiction of the department from making similar recommendations as penalties. (8) The purpose of this section is to facilitate uniform discipline for those acts made punishable under this section and, to this end, a reference to this section constitutes a general reference under the doctrine of incorporation by reference.

      "text": "466.0282 Specialties.— (1) A dentist licensed under this chapter may not hold himself or herself out as a specialist, or advertise membership in or specialty recognition by an accrediting organization, unless the dentist: (a) Has completed a specialty education program approved by the American Dental Association and the Commission on Dental Accreditation and: 1. Is eligible for examination by a national specialty board recognized by the American Dental Association; or 2. Is a diplomate of a national specialty board recognized by the American Dental Association; or (b) Has continuously held himself or herself out as a specialist since December 31, 1964, in a specialty recognized by the American Dental Association. (2) A dentist licensed under this chapter may not represent to the public without appropriate disclosure that his or her practice is limited to a specific area of dentistry other than a specialty area of dentistry authorized under subsection (1), unless the dentist has attained membership in or has otherwise been credentialed by an accrediting organization which is recognized by the board as a bona fide organization for such an area of dental practice. In order to be recognized by the board as a bona fide accrediting organization for a specific area of dental practice other than a specialty area of dentistry authorized under subsection (1), the organization must condition membership or credentialing of its members upon all of the following: (a) Successful completion of a formal, full-time advanced education program that is affiliated with or sponsored by a university-based dental school and is: 1. Beyond the dental degree; 2. At the graduate or postgraduate level; and 3. Of at least 12 months in duration. (b) Prior didactic training and clinical experience in the specific area of dentistry which is greater than that of other dentists. (c) Successful completion of oral and written examinations based on psychometric principles. (3) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsections (1) and (2), a dentist who lacks membership in or certification, diplomate status, or other similar credentials from an accrediting organization approved as bona fide by either the American Dental Association or the board may announce a practice emphasis in any other area of dental practice if the dentist incorporates in capital letters or some other manner clearly distinguishable from the rest of the announcement, solicitation, or advertisement the following statement: “ (NAME OF ANNOUNCED AREA OF DENTAL PRACTICE) IS NOT RECOGNIZED AS A SPECIALTY AREA BY THE AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION OR THE FLORIDA BOARD OF DENTISTRY.” If such an area of dental practice is officially recognized by an organization which the dentist desires to acknowledge or otherwise reference in the dentist’s announcement, solicitation, or advertisement, the same announcement, solicitation, or advertisement shall also state prominently: “ (NAME OF REFERENCED ORGANIZATION) IS NOT RECOGNIZED AS A BONA FIDE SPECIALTY ACCREDITING ORGANIZATION BY THE AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION OR THE FLORIDA BOARD OF DENTISTRY.” (4) The purpose of this section is to prevent a dentist from advertising without appropriate disclosure membership in an organization which may be perceived by the public as recognizing or accrediting specialization or other unique competencies in an area of dentistry that is not recognized or accredited by the American Dental Association or the board in accordance with this section. The purpose of this section is also to prohibit a dentist from advertising a specialty or other area of dental practice without appropriate disclosure unless the special competencies held by the dentist satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) or subsection (2). The Legislature finds that dental consumers can reasonably rely on these requirements as satisfactory evidence of a dentist’s attainment of meaningful competencies in the specialty or other bona fide area of dental practice advertised.

(b) Control the use of any dental equipment or material while such equipment or material is being used for the provision of dental services, whether those services are provided by a dentist, a dental hygienist, or a dental assistant. (c) Direct, control, or interfere with a dentist’s clinical judgment. To direct, control, or interfere with a dentist’s clinical judgment may not be interpreted to mean dental services contractually excluded, the application of alternative benefits that may be appropriate given the dentist’s prescribed course of treatment, or the application of contractual provisions and scope of coverage determinations in comparison with a dentist’s prescribed treatment on behalf of a covered person by an insurer, health maintenance organization, or a prepaid limited health service organization. Any lease agreement, rental agreement, or other arrangement between a nondentist and a dentist whereby the nondentist provides the dentist with dental equipment or dental materials shall contain a provision whereby the dentist expressly maintains complete care, custody, and control of the equipment or practice. (2) The purpose of this section is to prevent a nondentist from influencing or otherwise interfering with the exercise of a dentist’s independent professional judgment. In addition to the acts specified in subsection (1), no person who is not a dentist licensed pursuant to this chapter nor any entity that is not a professional corporation or limited liability company composed of dentists shall enter into a relationship with a licensee pursuant to which such unlicensed person or such entity exercises control over the following: (a) The selection of a course of treatment for a patient, the procedures or materials to be used as part of such course of treatment, and the manner in which such course of treatment is carried out by the licensee; (b) The patient records of a dentist; (c) Policies and decisions relating to pricing, credit, refunds, warranties, and advertising; and (d) Decisions relating to office personnel and hours of practice. (3) Any person who violates this section commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.

In order to be recognized by the board as a bona fide accrediting organization for a specific area of dental practice other than a specialty area of dentistry authorized under subsection (1), the organization must condition membership or credentialing of its members upon all of the following:(a)Successful completion of a formal, full-time advanced education program that is affiliated with or sponsored by a university-based dental school and is:1.Beyond the dental degree;2.At the graduate or postgraduate level; and3.Of at least 12 months in duration.(b)Prior didactic training and clinical experience in the specific area of dentistry which is greater than that of other dentists.(c)Successful completion of oral and written examinations based on psychometric principles.(3)Notwithstanding the requirements of subsections (1) and (2), a dentist who lacks membership in or certification, diplomate status, or other similar credentials from an accrediting organization approved as bona fide by either the American Dental Association or the board may announce a practice emphasis in any other area of dental practice if the dentist incorporates in capital letters or some other manner clearly distinguishable from the rest of the announcement, solicitation, or advertisement the following statement: “(NAME OF ANNOUNCED AREA OF DENTAL PRACTICE)IS NOT RECOGNIZED AS A SPECIALTY AREA BY THE AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION OR THE FLORIDA BOARD OF DENTISTRY.” If such an area of dental practice is officially recognized by an organization which the dentist desires to acknowledge or otherwise reference in the dentist’s announcement, solicitation, or advertisement, the same announcement, solicitation, or advertisement shall also state prominently: “(NAME OF REFERENCED ORGANIZATION)IS NOT RECOGNIZED AS A BONA FIDE SPECIALTY ACCREDITING ORGANIZATION BY THE AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION OR THE FLORIDA BOARD OF DENTISTRY.”(4)The purpose of this section is to prevent a dentist from advertising without appropriate disclosure membership in an organization which may be perceived by the public as recognizing or accrediting specialization or other unique competencies in an area of dentistry that is not recognized or accredited by the American Dental Association or the board in accordance with this section. The purpose of this section is also to prohibit a dentist from advertising a specialty or other area of dental practice without appropriate disclosure unless the special competencies held by the dentist satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) or subsection (2). The Legislature finds that dental consumers can reasonably rely on these requirements as satisfactory evidence of a dentist’s attainment of meaningful competencies in the specialty or other bona fide area of dental practice advertised. The Legislature also finds that this process for the recognition of dental specialties and other bona fide areas of dental practice is the least restrictive means available to ensure that consumers are not misled about a dentist’s unique credentials.History.—s. 4, ch. 94-105; s. 6, ch. 96-281; s. 1111, ch. 97-103; s. 3, ch. 99-183.",
