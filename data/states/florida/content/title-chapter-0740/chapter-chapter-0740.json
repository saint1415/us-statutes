(3) A user’s direction under subsection (1) or subsection (2) overrides a contrary provision in a terms-of-service agreement that does not require the user to act affirmatively and distinctly from the user’s assent to the terms of service.

(2) A custodian may assess a reasonable administrative charge for the cost of disclosing digital assets under this chapter. (3) A custodian is not required to disclose under this chapter a digital asset deleted by a user. (4) If a user directs or a fiduciary requests a custodian to disclose under this chapter some, but not all, of the user’s digital assets to the fiduciary or a designated recipient, the custodian is not required to disclose the assets if segregation of the assets would impose an undue burden on the custodian. If the custodian believes the direction or request imposes an undue burden, the custodian or the fiduciary may seek an order from the court to disclose: (a) A subset limited by date of the user’s digital assets; (b) All of the user’s digital assets to the fiduciary or designated recipient, or to the court for review in chambers; or (c) None of the user’s digital assets.
