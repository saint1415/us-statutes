A communicable disease is any disease caused by transmission of a specific infectious agent, or its toxic products, from an infected person, an infected animal, or the environment to a susceptible host, either directly or indirectly. The communicable disease program must include, but need not be limited to: (a) Programs for the prevention and control of tuberculosis in accordance with chapter 392. (b) Programs for the prevention and control of human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome in accordance with chapter 384 and this chapter. (c) Programs for the prevention and control of sexually transmissible diseases in accordance with chapter 384. (d) Programs for the prevention, control, and reporting of communicable diseases of public health significance as provided for in this chapter. (e) Programs for the prevention and control of vaccine-preventable diseases, including programs to immunize school children as required by s. 1003.22(3)-(11) and the development of an automated, electronic, and centralized database and registry of immunizations. The department shall ensure that all children in this state are immunized against vaccine-preventable diseases. The immunization registry must allow the department to enhance current immunization activities for the purpose of improving the immunization of all children in this state. 1. Except as provided in subparagraph 2., the department shall include all children born in this state in the immunization registry by using the birth records from the Office of Vital Statistics. The department shall add other children to the registry as immunization services are provided. 2. The parent or guardian of a child may refuse to have the child included in the immunization registry by signing a form obtained from the department, or from the health care practitioner or entity that provides the immunization, which indicates that the parent or guardian does not wish to have the child included in the immunization registry. Each consent to treatment form provided by a health care practitioner or by an entity that administers vaccinations or causes vaccinations to be administered to children from birth through 17 years of age must contain a notice stating that the parent or guardian of a child may refuse to have his or her child included in the immunization registry. The parent or guardian must provide such opt-out form to the health care practitioner or entity upon administration of the vaccination. Such health care practitioner or entity shall submit the form to the department. A parent or guardian may submit the opt-out form directly to the department. Any records or identifying information pertaining to the child shall be removed from the registry, if the parent or guardian has refused to have his or her child included in the immunization registry. 3. A college or university student, from 18 years of age to 23 years of age, who obtains a vaccination from a college or university student health center or clinic in the state may refuse to be included in the immunization registry by signing a form obtained from the department, health center, or clinic which indicates that the student does not wish to be included in the immunization registry. The student must provide such opt-out form to the health center or clinic upon administration of the vaccination. Such health center or clinic shall submit the form to the department. A student may submit the opt-out form directly to the department. Any records or identifying information pertaining to the student shall be removed from the registry if the student has refused to be included in the immunization registry. 4. The immunization registry shall allow for immunization records to be electronically available to entities that are required by law to have such records, including, but not limited to, schools and licensed child care facilities. 5. A health care practitioner licensed under chapter 458, chapter 459, or chapter 464 in this state who administers vaccinations or causes vaccinations to be administered to children from birth through 17 years of age is required to report vaccination data to the immunization registry, unless a parent or guardian of a child has refused to have the child included in the immunization registry by meeting the requirements of subparagraph 2. A health care practitioner licensed under chapter 458, chapter 459, or chapter 464 in this state who administers vaccinations or causes vaccinations to be administered to college or university students from 18 years of age to 23 years of age at a college or university student health center or clinic is required to report vaccination data to the immunization registry, unless the student has refused to be included in the immunization registry by meeting the requirements of subparagraph 3. Vaccination data for students in other age ranges may be submitted to the immunization registry only if the student consents to inclusion in the immunization registry. The upload of data from existing automated systems is an acceptable method for updating immunization information in the immunization registry. The information in the immunization registry must include the child’s name, date of birth, address, and any other unique identifier necessary to correctly identify the child; the immunization record, including the date, type of administered vaccine, and vaccine lot number; and the presence or absence of any adverse reaction or contraindication related to the immunization. Information received by the department for the immunization registry retains its status as confidential medical information and the department must maintain the confidentiality of that information as otherwise required by law. A health care practitioner or other agency that obtains information from the immunization registry must maintain the confidentiality of any medical records in accordance with s. 456.057 or as otherwise required by law.

      "text": "381.004 HIV testing.— (1) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section: (a) “Health care setting” means a setting devoted to the diagnosis and care of persons or the provision of medical services to persons, such as county health department clinics, hospitals, urgent care clinics, substance abuse treatment clinics, primary care settings, community clinics, blood banks, mobile medical clinics, and correctional health care facilities. (b) “HIV test” means a test ordered after July 6, 1988, to determine the presence of the antibody or antigen to human immunodeficiency virus or the presence of human immunodeficiency virus infection. (c) “HIV test result” means a laboratory report of a human immunodeficiency virus test result entered into a medical record on or after July 6, 1988, or any report or notation in a medical record of a laboratory report of a human immunodeficiency virus test. The term does not include test results reported to a health care provider by a patient. (d) “Nonhealth care setting” means a site that conducts HIV testing for the sole purpose of identifying HIV infection. Such setting does not provide medical treatment but may include community-based organizations, outreach settings, county health department HIV testing programs, and mobile vans. (e) “Preliminary HIV test” means an antibody or antibody-antigen screening test, such as the immunosorbent assays (IA), or a rapid test approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. (f) “Significant exposure” means: 1. Exposure to blood or body fluids through needlestick, instruments, or sharps; 2. Exposure of mucous membranes to visible blood or body fluids to which universal precautions apply according to the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including, without limitations, the following body fluids: a. Blood. b. Semen. c. Vaginal secretions. d. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). e. Synovial fluid. f. Pleural fluid. g. Peritoneal fluid. h. Pericardial fluid. i. Amniotic fluid. j. Laboratory specimens that contain HIV (e.g., suspensions of concentrated virus); or 3. Exposure of skin to visible blood or body fluids, especially when the exposed skin is chapped, abraded, or afflicted with dermatitis or the contact is prolonged or involving an extensive area. (g) “Test subject” or “subject of the test” means the person upon whom an HIV test is performed, or the person who has legal authority to make health care decisions for the test subject. (2) HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS TESTING; INFORMED CONSENT; RESULTS; COUNSELING; CONFIDENTIALITY.— (a) Before performing an HIV test: 1. In a health care setting, the person to be tested shall be notified orally or in writing that the test is planned and that he or she has the right to decline the test. If the person to be tested declines the test, such decision shall be documented in the medical record. A person who has signed a general consent form for medical care is not required to sign or otherwise provide a separate consent for an HIV test during the period in which the general consent form is in effect. 2. In a nonhealth care setting, a provider shall obtain the informed consent of the person upon whom the test is to be performed. Informed consent shall be preceded by an explanation of the right to confidential treatment of information identifying the subject of the test and the results of the test as provided by law. The provider shall also inform the test subject that a positive HIV test result will be reported to the county health department with sufficient information to identify the test subject and provide him or her with information on the availability and location of sites where anonymous testing is performed. As required in paragraph (3)(c), each county health department shall maintain a list of sites where anonymous testing is performed which includes site locations, telephone numbers, and hours of operation. (b) Except as provided in paragraph (h), informed consent must be obtained from a legal guardian or other person authorized by law if the person: 1. Is not competent, is incapacitated, or is otherwise unable to make an informed judgment; or 2. Has not reached the age of majority, except as provided in s. 384.30. (c) The person ordering the test or that person’s designee shall ensure that all reasonable efforts are made to notify the test subject of his or her test result. Notification of a person with a positive test result shall include information on the availability of appropriate medical and support services, on the importance of notifying partners who may have been exposed, and on preventing transmission of HIV. Notification of a person with a negative test result shall include, as appropriate, information on preventing the transmission of HIV. When testing occurs in a hospital emergency department, detention facility, or other facility and the test subject has been released before being notified of positive test results, informing the county health department for that department to notify the test subject fulfills this responsibility. (d) A positive preliminary test result may not be revealed to any person except in the following situations: 1. Preliminary test results may be released to licensed physicians or the medical or nonmedical personnel subject to the significant exposure for purposes of subparagraphs (h)10., 11., and 12. 2. Preliminary test results may be released to health care providers and to the person tested when decisions about medical care or treatment of, or recommendation to, the person tested and, in the case of an intrapartum or postpartum woman, when care, treatment, or recommendations regarding her newborn, cannot await the results of confirmatory testing. Positive preliminary HIV test results may not be characterized to the patient as a diagnosis of HIV infection. Justification for the use of preliminary test results must be documented in the medical record by the health care provider who ordered the test. 3. The results of rapid testing technologies shall be considered preliminary and may be released in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions as approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration. 4. Corroborating or confirmatory testing must be conducted as followup to a positive preliminary test. Results shall be communicated to the patient according to statute regardless of the outcome. Except as provided in this section, test results are confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1). (e) Except as provided in this section, the identity of any person upon whom a test has been performed and test results are confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1). No person who has obtained or has knowledge of a test result pursuant to this section may disclose or be compelled to disclose the identity of any person upon whom a test is performed, or the results of such a test in a manner which permits identification of the subject of the test, except to the following persons: 1. The subject of the test or the subject’s legally authorized representative. 2. Any person, including third-party payors, designated in a legally effective release of the test results executed prior to or after the test by the subject of the test or the subject’s legally authorized representative. The test subject may in writing authorize the disclosure of the test subject’s HIV test results to third party payors, who need not be specifically identified, and to other persons to whom the test subject subsequently issues a general release of medical information. A general release without such prior written authorization is not sufficient to release HIV test results. 3. An authorized agent or employee of a health facility or health care provider if the health facility or health care provider itself is authorized to obtain the test results, the agent or employee participates in the administration or provision of patient care or handles or processes specimens of body fluids or tissues, and the agent or employee has a need to know such information. The department shall adopt a rule defining which persons have a need to know pursuant to this subparagraph. 4. Health care providers consulting between themselves or with health care facilities to determine diagnosis and treatment. For purposes of this subparagraph, health care providers shall include licensed health care professionals employed by or associated with state, county, or municipal detention facilities when such health care professionals are acting exclusively for the purpose of providing diagnoses or treatment of persons in the custody of such facilities. 5. The department, in accordance with rules for reporting and controlling the spread of disease, as otherwise provided by state law. 6. A health facility or health care provider which procures, processes, distributes, or uses: a. A human body part from a deceased person, with respect to medical information regarding that person; or b. Semen provided prior to July 6, 1988, for the purpose of artificial insemination. 7. Health facility staff committees, for the purposes of conducting program monitoring, program evaluation, or service reviews pursuant to chapters 395 and 766. 8. Authorized medical or epidemiological researchers who may not further disclose any identifying characteristics or information. 9. A person allowed access by a court order which is issued in compliance with the following provisions: a. No court of this state shall issue such order unless the court finds that the person seeking the test results has demonstrated a compelling need for the test results which cannot be accommodated by other means. In assessing compelling need, the court shall weigh the need for disclosure against the privacy interest of the test subject and the public interest which may be disserved by disclosure which deters blood, organ, and semen donation and future human immunodeficiency virus-related testing or which may lead to discrimination. This paragraph shall not apply to blood bank donor records. b. Pleadings pertaining to disclosure of test results shall substitute a pseudonym for the true name of the subject of the test. The disclosure to the parties of the subject’s true name shall be communicated confidentially in documents not filed with the court. c. Before granting any such order, the court shall provide the individual whose test result is in question with notice and a reasonable opportunity to participate in the proceedings if he or she is not already a party. d. Court proceedings as to disclosure of test results shall be conducted in camera, unless the subject of the test agrees to a hearing in open court or unless the court determines that a public hearing is necessary to the public interest and the proper administration of justice. e. Upon the issuance of an order to disclose test results, the court shall impose appropriate safeguards against unauthorized disclosure which shall specify the persons who may have access to the information, the purposes for which the information shall be used, and appropriate prohibitions on future disclosure. 10. A person allowed access by order of a judge of compensation claims of the Division of Administrative Hearings. A judge of compensation claims shall not issue such order unless he or she finds that the person seeking the test results has demonstrated a compelling need for the test results which cannot be accommodated by other means. 11. Those employees of the department or of child-placing or child-caring agencies or of family foster homes, licensed pursuant to s. 409.175, who are directly involved in the placement, care, control, or custody of such test subject and who have a need to know such information; adoptive parents of such test subject; or any adult custodian, any adult relative, or any person responsible for the child’s welfare, if the test subject was not tested under subparagraph (b)2. and if a reasonable attempt has been made to locate and inform the legal guardian of a test result. The department shall adopt a rule to implement this subparagraph. 12. Those employees of residential facilities or of community-based care programs that care for developmentally disabled persons, pursuant to chapter 393, who are directly involved in the care, control, or custody of such test subject and who have a need to know such information. 13. A health care provider involved in the delivery of a child can note the mother’s HIV test results in the child’s medical record. 14. Medical personnel or nonmedical personnel who have been subject to a significant exposure during the course of medical practice or in the performance of professional duties, or individuals who are the subject of the significant exposure as provided in subparagraphs (h)10.-12. 15. The medical examiner shall disclose positive HIV test results to the department in accordance with rules for reporting and controlling the spread of disease. (f) Except as provided in this section, the identity of a person upon whom a test has been performed is confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1). No person to whom the results of a test have been disclosed may disclose the test results to another person except as authorized by this subsection and by ss. 951.27 and 960.003. Whenever disclosure is made pursuant to this subsection, it shall be accompanied by a statement in writing which includes the following or substantially similar language: “This information has been disclosed to you from records whose confidentiality is protected by state law. State law prohibits you from making any further disclosure of such information without the specific written consent of the person to whom such information pertains, or as otherwise permitted by state law. A general authorization for the release of medical or other information is NOT sufficient for this purpose.” An oral disclosure shall be accompanied by oral notice and followed by a written notice within 10 days, except that this notice shall not be required for disclosures made pursuant to subparagraphs (e)3. and 4. (g) Human immunodeficiency virus test results contained in the medical records of a hospital licensed under chapter 395 may be released in accordance with s. 395.3025 without being subject to subparagraph (e)2., subparagraph (e)9., or paragraph (f). (h) Paragraph (a) does not apply: 1. When testing for sexually transmissible diseases is required by state or federal law, or by rule, including the following situations: a. HIV testing pursuant to s. 796.08 of persons convicted of prostitution or of procuring another to commit prostitution. b. HIV testing of inmates pursuant to s. 945.355 before their release from prison by reason of parole, accumulation of gain-time credits, or expiration of sentence. c. Testing for HIV by a medical examiner in accordance with s. 406.11. d. HIV testing of pregnant women pursuant to s. 384.31. 2. To those exceptions provided for blood, plasma, organs, skin, semen, or other human tissue pursuant to s. 381.0041. 3. For the performance of an HIV-related test by licensed medical personnel in bona fide medical emergencies if the test results are necessary for medical diagnostic purposes to provide appropriate emergency care or treatment to the person being tested and the patient is unable to consent, as supported by documentation in the medical record. Notification of test results in accordance with paragraph (c) is required. 4. For the performance of an HIV-related test by licensed medical personnel for medical diagnosis of acute illness where, in the opinion of the attending physician, providing notification would be detrimental to the patient, as supported by documentation in the medical record, and the test results are necessary for medical diagnostic purposes to provide appropriate care or treatment to the person being tested. Notification of test results in accordance with paragraph (c) is required if it would not be detrimental to the patient. This subparagraph does not authorize the routine testing of patients for HIV infection without notification. 5. If HIV testing is performed as part of an autopsy for which consent was obtained pursuant to s. 872.04. 6. For the performance of an HIV test upon a defendant pursuant to the victim’s request in a prosecution for any type of sexual battery where a blood sample is taken from the defendant voluntarily, pursuant to court order for any purpose, or pursuant to s. 775.0877, s. 951.27, or s. 960.003; however, the results of an HIV test performed shall be disclosed solely to the victim and the defendant, except as provided in ss. 775.0877, 951.27, and 960.003. 7. If an HIV test is mandated by court order. 8. For epidemiological research pursuant to s. 381.0031, for research consistent with institutional review boards created by 45 C.F.R. part 46, or for the performance of an HIV-related test for the purpose of research, if the testing is performed in a manner by which the identity of the test subject is not known and may not be retrieved by the researcher. 9. If human tissue is collected lawfully without the consent of the donor for corneal removal as authorized by s. 765.5185 or enucleation of the eyes as authorized by s. 765.519. 10. For the performance of an HIV test upon an individual who comes into contact with medical personnel in such a way that a significant exposure has occurred during the course of employment, within the scope of practice, or during the course of providing emergency medical assistance to the individual. The term “medical personnel” includes a licensed or certified health care professional; an employee of a health care professional or health care facility; employees of a laboratory licensed under chapter 483; personnel of a blood bank or plasma center; a medical student or other student who is receiving training as a health care professional at a health care facility; and a paramedic or emergency medical technician certified by the department to perform life-support procedures under s. 401.23. a. The occurrence of a significant exposure shall be documented by medical personnel under the supervision of a licensed physician and recorded only in the personnel record of the medical personnel. b. Costs of an HIV test shall be borne by the medical personnel or the employer of the medical personnel. However, costs of testing or treatment not directly related to the initial HIV tests or costs of subsequent testing or treatment may not be borne by the medical personnel or the employer of the medical personnel. c. In order to use the provisions of this subparagraph, the medical personnel must be tested for HIV pursuant to this section or provide the results of an HIV test taken within 6 months before the significant exposure if such test results are negative. d. A person who receives the results of an HIV test pursuant to this subparagraph shall maintain the confidentiality of the information received and of the persons tested. Such confidential information is exempt from s. 119.07(1). e. If the source of the exposure is not available and will not voluntarily present himself or herself to a health facility to be tested for HIV, the medical personnel or the employer of such person acting on behalf of the employee may seek a court order directing the source of the exposure to submit to HIV testing. A sworn statement by a physician licensed under chapter 458 or chapter 459 that a significant exposure has occurred and that, in the physician’s medical judgment, testing is medically necessary to determine the course of treatment constitutes probable cause for the issuance of an order by the court. The results of the test shall be released to the source of the exposure and to the person who experienced the exposure. 11. For the performance of an HIV test upon an individual who comes into contact with nonmedical personnel in such a way that a significant exposure has occurred while the nonmedical personnel provides emergency medical assistance during a medical emergency. For the purposes of this subparagraph, a medical emergency means an emergency medical condition outside of a hospital or health care facility that provides physician care. The test may be performed only during the course of treatment for the medical emergency. a. The occurrence of a significant exposure shall be documented by medical personnel under the supervision of a licensed physician and recorded in the medical record of the nonmedical personnel. b. Costs of any HIV test shall be borne by the nonmedical personnel or the employer of the nonmedical personnel. However, costs of testing or treatment not directly related to the initial HIV tests or costs of subsequent testing or treatment may not be borne by the nonmedical personnel or the employer of the nonmedical personnel. c. In order to use the provisions of this subparagraph, the nonmedical personnel shall be tested for HIV pursuant to this section or shall provide the results of an HIV test taken within 6 months before the significant exposure if such test results are negative. d. A person who receives the results of an HIV test pursuant to this subparagraph shall maintain the confidentiality of the information received and of the persons tested. Such confidential information is exempt from s. 119.07(1). e. If the source of the exposure is not available and will not voluntarily present himself or herself to a health facility to be tested for HIV, the nonmedical personnel or the employer of the nonmedical personnel acting on behalf of the employee may seek a court order directing the source of the exposure to submit to HIV testing. A sworn statement by a physician licensed under chapter 458 or chapter 459 that a significant exposure has occurred and that, in the physician’s medical judgment, testing is medically necessary to determine the course of treatment constitutes probable cause for the issuance of an order by the court. The results of the test shall be released to the source of the exposure and to the person who experienced the exposure. 12. For the performance of an HIV test by the medical examiner or attending physician upon an individual who expired or could not be resuscitated while receiving emergency medical assistance or care and who was the source of a significant exposure to medical or nonmedical personnel providing such assistance or care. a. HIV testing may be conducted only after appropriate medical personnel under the supervision of a licensed physician documents in the medical record of the medical personnel or nonmedical personnel that there has been a significant exposure and that, in accordance with the written protocols based on the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on HIV postexposure prophylaxis and in the physician’s medical judgment, the information is medically necessary to determine the course of treatment for the medical personnel or nonmedical personnel. b. Costs of an HIV test performed under this subparagraph may not be charged to the deceased or to the family of the deceased person. c. For this subparagraph to be applicable, the medical personnel or nonmedical personnel must be tested for HIV under this section or must provide the results of an HIV test taken within 6 months before the significant exposure if such test results are negative. d. A person who receives the results of an HIV test pursuant to this subparagraph shall comply with paragraph (e). 13. For the performance of an HIV-related test medically indicated by licensed medical personnel for medical diagnosis of a hospitalized infant as necessary to provide appropriate care and treatment of the infant if, after a reasonable attempt, a parent cannot be contacted to provide consent. The medical records of the infant must reflect the reason consent of the parent was not initially obtained. Test results shall be provided to the parent when the parent is located. 14. For the performance of HIV testing conducted to monitor the clinical progress of a patient previously diagnosed to be HIV positive. 15. For the performance of repeated HIV testing conducted to monitor possible conversion from a significant exposure. (3) COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT NETWORK OF VOLUNTARY HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS TESTING PROGRAMS.— (a) The Department of Health shall establish a network of voluntary human immunodeficiency virus testing programs in every county in the state. These programs shall be conducted in each health department established under the provisions of part I of chapter 154. Additional programs may be contracted to other private providers to the extent that finances permit and local circumstances dictate. (b) Each county health department shall have the ability to provide counseling and testing for human immunodeficiency virus to each patient who receives services and shall offer such testing on a voluntary basis to each patient who presents himself or herself for services in a public health program designated by the State Health Officer by rule. (c) Each county health department shall provide a program of counseling and testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection, on both an anonymous and confidential basis. Counseling provided to a patient tested on both an anonymous and confidential basis shall include informing the patient of the availability of partner-notification services, the benefits of such services, and the confidentiality protections available as part of such services. The Department of Health or its designated agent shall continue to provide for anonymous testing through an alternative testing site program with sites throughout all areas of the state. Each county health department shall maintain a list of anonymous testing sites. The list shall include the locations, phone numbers, and hours of operation of the sites and shall be disseminated to all persons and programs offering human immunodeficiency virus testing within the service area of the county health department, including physicians licensed under chapter 458 or chapter 459. Except as provided in this section, the identity of a person upon whom a test has been performed and test results are confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1). (d) The result of a serologic test conducted under the auspices of the Department of Health shall not be used to determine if a person may be insured for disability, health, or life insurance or to screen or determine suitability for, or to discharge a person from, employment. Any person who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (4) HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS TESTING REQUIREMENTS; REGISTRATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH; EXEMPTIONS FROM REGISTRATION.—No county health department and no other person in this state shall conduct or hold themselves out to the public as conducting a testing program for acquired immune deficiency syndrome or human immunodeficiency virus status without first registering with the Department of Health, reregistering each year, complying with all other applicable provisions of state law, and meeting the following requirements: (a) The program must be directed by a person with a minimum number of contact hours of experience in the counseling of persons with acquired immune deficiency syndrome or human immunodeficiency virus infection, as established by the Department of Health by rule. (b) The program must have all medical care supervised by a physician licensed under the provisions of chapter 458 or chapter 459. (c) The program shall have all laboratory procedures performed in a laboratory appropriately certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under the federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and the federal rules adopted thereunder. (d) The program must meet all of the requirements in subsection (2). (e) The program must provide the opportunity for pretest counseling on the meaning of a test for human immunodeficiency virus, including medical indications for the test; the possibility of false positive or false negative results; the potential need for confirmatory testing; the potential social, medical, and economic consequences of a positive test result; and the need to eliminate high-risk behavior. (f) The program must provide supplemental corroborative testing on all positive test results before the results of any positive test are provided to the patient. Except as provided in this section, the identity of any person upon whom a test has been performed and test results are confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1). (g) The program must provide the opportunity for face-to-face posttest counseling on the meaning of the test results; the possible need for additional testing; the social, medical, and economic consequences of a positive test result; and the need to eliminate behavior which might spread the disease to others. (h) Each person providing posttest counseling to a patient with a positive test result shall receive specialized training, to be specified by rule of the department, about the special needs of persons with positive results, including recognition of possible suicidal behavior, and shall refer the patient for further health and social services as appropriate. (i) When services are provided for a charge during pretest counseling, testing, supplemental testing, and posttest counseling, the program must provide a complete list of all such charges to the patient and the Department of Health. (j) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a facility licensed under chapter 395 or chapter 483 or a person licensed under the provisions of chapter 457, chapter 458, chapter 459, chapter 460, chapter 461, chapter 466, or chapter 467 to register with the Department of Health and comply with the requirements of this subsection if the testing program is part of routine medical care or if the facility or person does not advertise to the general public that the facility or person conducts testing programs for human immunodeficiency virus infection or specializes in such testing.

(3) The Department of Health shall have the responsibility, in cooperation with the Department of Education, to supervise the administration of the school health services program and perform periodic program reviews. However, the principal of each school shall have immediate supervisory authority over the health personnel working in the school. (4)(a) Each county health department shall develop, jointly with the district school board and the local school health advisory committee, a school health services plan. The plan must include, at a minimum, provisions for all of the following: 1. Health appraisal; 2. Records review; 3. Nurse assessment; 4. Nutrition assessment; 5. A preventive dental program; 6.

(8) In the absence of negligence, no person shall be liable for any injury caused by an act or omission in the administration of school health services. (9) Any health care entity that provides school health services under contract with the department pursuant to a school health services plan developed under this section, and as part of a school nurse services public-private partnership, is deemed to be a corporation acting primarily as an instrumentality of the state solely for the purpose of limiting liability pursuant to s. 768.28(5). The limitations on tort actions contained in s. 768.28(5) shall apply to any action against the entity with respect to the provision of school health services, if the entity is acting within the scope of and pursuant to guidelines established in the contract or by rule of the department. The contract must require the entity, or the partnership on behalf of the entity, to obtain general liability insurance coverage, with any additional endorsement necessary to insure the entity for liability assumed by its contract with the department. The Legislature intends that insurance be purchased by entities, or by partnerships on behalf of the entity, to cover all liability claims, and under no circumstances shall the state or the department be responsible for payment of any claims or defense costs for claims brought against the entity or its subcontractor for services performed under the contract with the department. This subsection does not preclude consideration by the Legislature for payment by the state of any claims bill involving an entity contracting with the department pursuant to this section.

(2) The State Surgeon General, or his or her designees, in cooperation with the Commissioner of Education, or his or her designees, in equal representation, shall form a joint committee to evaluate and select the school districts or schools to be funded. (3) Any school district, school, or laboratory school which desires to receive state funding under the provisions of this section shall submit a proposal to the joint committee established in subsection (2). The proposal shall state the goals of the program, provide specific plans for reducing teenage pregnancy, and describe all of the health services to be available to students with funds provided pursuant to this section, including a combination of initiatives such as health education, counseling, extracurricular, and self-esteem components. School health services shall not promote elective termination of pregnancy as a part of counseling services. Only those program proposals which have been developed jointly by county health departments and local school districts or schools, and which have community and parental support, shall be eligible for funding. Funding shall be available specifically for implementation of one of the following programs: (a) School health improvement pilot project.—The program shall include basic health care to an elementary school, middle school, and high school feeder system. Program services shall include, but not be limited to: 1. Planning, implementing, and evaluating school health services. Staffing shall include a full-time, trained school health aide in each elementary, middle, and high school; one full-time nurse to supervise the aides in the elementary and middle schools; and one full-time nurse in each high school. 2. Providing student health appraisals and identification of actual or potential health problems by screenings, nursing assessments, and record reviews. 3. Expanding screening activities. 4. Improving the student utilization of school health services. 5. Coordinating health services for students with parents or guardians and other agencies in the community. (b) Student support services team program.—The program shall include a multidisciplinary team composed of a psychologist, social worker, and nurse whose responsibilities are to provide basic support services and to assist, in the school setting, children who exhibit mild to severely complex health, behavioral, or learning problems affecting their school performance. Support services shall include, but not be limited to: evaluation and treatment for minor illnesses and injuries, referral and followup for serious illnesses and emergencies, onsite care and consultation, referral to a physician, and followup care for pregnancy or chronic diseases and disorders as well as emotional or mental problems. Services also shall include referral care for drug and alcohol abuse and sexually transmitted diseases, sports and employment physicals, immunizations, and in addition, effective preventive services aimed at delaying early sexual involvement and aimed at pregnancy, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, sexually transmitted diseases, and destructive lifestyle conditions, such as alcohol and drug abuse. Moneys for this program shall be used to fund three teams, each consisting of one half-time psychologist, one full-time nurse, and one full-time social worker. Each team shall provide student support services to an elementary school, middle school, and high school that are a part of one feeder school system and shall coordinate all activities with the school administrator and certified school counselor at each school. A program that places all three teams in middle schools or high schools may also be proposed. (c) Full service schools.—The full-service schools shall integrate the services of the Department of Health that are critical to the continuity-of-care process. The department shall provide services to students on the school grounds. Department personnel shall provide their specialized services as an extension of the educational environment. Such services may include nutritional services, medical services, aid to dependent children, parenting skills, counseling for abused children, and education for the students’ parents or guardians. Funding may also be available for any other program that is comparable to a program described in this subsection but is designed to meet the particular needs of the community. (4) In addition to the merits of a proposal, selection shall be based on those school districts or schools that most closely meet the following criteria: (a) Have evidence of a comprehensive inservice staff development plan to ensure delivery of appropriate curriculum. (b) Have evidence of a cooperative working relationship between the county health department and the school district or school and have community as well as parental support. (c) Have a high percentage of subsidized school lunches. (d) Have a high incidence of medically underserved high-risk children, low birthweight babies, infant mortality, or teenage pregnancy. (5) Each school district or school program that is funded through the provisions of this section shall provide a mechanism through which a parent may, by written request, exempt a child from all or certain services provided by a school health services program described in subsection (3). (6) The services provided by a comprehensive school health program must focus attention on promoting the health of students, reducing risk-taking behavior, and reducing teen pregnancy. Services provided under this section are in addition to the services provided under s. 381.0056 and are intended to supplement, rather than supplant, those services.

(d) If the department or any state attorney has probable cause to believe that an establishment or person has violated any provision of paragraph (a), an action may be brought by the department or the state attorney to enjoin such establishment or person from continuing such violation, or engaging therein or doing any acts in furtherance thereof, and the court may provide any other relief it deems appropriate. (9) ENFORCEMENT.— (a) The department shall inspect or investigate an establishment as necessary, but at least annually, to ensure compliance with this section. Department personnel may, at any reasonable time, enter any establishment licensed under this section or any premises the department has reason to believe is being operated or maintained in violation of this section, to determine compliance with this section or any rule adopted under this section. (b) The department may impose an administrative fine, not to exceed $1,000 per violation per day, for the violation of any provision of this section, any rule adopted under this section, or any term or condition of any license issued under this section by the department. (c) In determining the amount of fine to be levied for a violation, as provided in paragraph (b), the following factors shall be considered: 1. The severity of the violation and the extent to which the provisions of this section, the rules adopted under this section, or any terms or conditions of any license issued under this section were violated. 2. Actions taken by the licensee to correct the violation. 3. Any previous violations by the licensee. (d) The department may issue a stop-use order, or institute legal action for injunctive or other relief, to enforce any provision of this section. (e) The department may cancel, revoke, or suspend a license to operate an establishment if the licensee: 1. Fails to pay any fee required by this section; 2. Obtains or attempts to obtain a license under this section by fraud, misrepresentation, or concealment; or 3. Violates any provision of this section or any rule adopted under this section. (f)1. The department may issue a citation that contains an order of correction or an order to pay a fine, or both, for any violation of this section or the rules adopted under this section, when the violation of the section or rule is enforceable by an administrative or civil remedy or when the violation of the section or rule is a misdemeanor of the second degree. A citation constitutes a notice of proposed agency action. 2. A citation must be in writing and must describe the particular nature of the violation, including specific reference to the provision of law or rule allegedly violated. 3. The fines imposed by a citation may not exceed $1,000 for each violation. Each day the violation exists constitutes a separate violation for which a citation may be issued. 4. The department shall inform the recipient of a citation, by written notice pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57, of the right to an administrative hearing to contest the citation within 21 days after the date the citation is received. The citation must contain a conspicuous statement that if the recipient fails to pay any fine levied against the recipient within the time allowed or fails to appear to contest the citation after having requested a hearing, the recipient has waived the recipient’s right to contest the citation and must pay the maximum fine. 5. The department may reduce or waive any fine imposed by a citation. In determining whether to reduce or waive a fine, the department must consider the gravity of the violation, the person’s attempts at correcting the violation, and the person’s history of previous violations for which enforcement actions were taken under this section. 6. Any person who willingly refuses to sign and accept a citation issued by the department commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. 7. This paragraph provides an alternative means of enforcing this section, but does not prohibit the department from enforcing this section or the rules adopted under this section by any other means. However, the department may use only a single method of enforcement for each violation. (g) The department shall deposit all fines it collects under this section in the County Health Department Trust Fund for use in providing services specified in this section. (10) RULES.—The department has authority to adopt rules to implement this section. Such rules may include sanitation practices, sterilization requirements and procedures, patient record content requirements, personnel record retention requirements, patient notification requirements and procedures, physical plant requirements, light requirements, and enforcement procedures.

      "text": "381.0098 Biomedical waste.— (1) LEGISLATIVE INTENT.—Except as otherwise provided herein, the Department of Health shall regulate the packaging, transport, storage, and treatment of biomedical waste. The Department of Environmental Protection shall regulate onsite and offsite incineration and disposal of biomedical waste. Consistent with the foregoing, the Department of Health shall have the exclusive authority to establish treatment efficacy standards for biomedical waste and the Department of Environmental Protection shall have the exclusive authority to establish statewide standards relating to environmental impacts, if any, of treatment and disposal including, but not limited to, water discharges and air emissions. An interagency agreement between the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Health shall be developed to ensure maximum efficiency in coordinating, administering, and regulating biomedical wastes. (2) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the term: (a) “Biomedical waste” means any solid or liquid waste which may present a threat of infection to humans. The term includes, but is not limited to, nonliquid human tissue and body parts; laboratory and veterinary waste which contains human-disease-causing agents; discarded disposable sharps; human blood, blood products, and body fluids; and other materials which in the opinion of the department represent a significant risk of infection to persons outside the generating facility. The term does not include human remains that are disposed of by persons licensed under chapter 497. (b) “Biomedical waste generator” means a facility or person that produces or generates biomedical waste. The term includes, but is not limited to, hospitals, skilled nursing or convalescent hospitals, intermediate care facilities, clinics, dialysis clinics, dental offices, health maintenance organizations, surgical clinics, medical buildings, physicians’ offices, laboratories, veterinary clinics, and funeral homes where embalming procedures are performed. (c) “Department” means the Department of Health. (d) “Sharps” mean those biomedical wastes which as a result of their physical characteristics are capable of puncturing, lacerating, or otherwise breaking the skin when handled. (e) “Treatment” means any process, including steam treatment, chemical treatment, and microwave shredding, which changes the character or composition of biomedical waste so as to render it noninfectious. For the purposes of this section, treatment does not include the incineration of biomedical waste. (3) OPERATING STANDARDS.—The department shall adopt rules necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public and to carry out the purpose of this section. Such rules shall address, but need not be limited to, definitions of terms, the packaging of biomedical waste, including specific requirements for the segregation of the waste at the point of generation; the safe packaging of sharps; the placement of the waste in containers that will protect waste handlers and the public from exposure; the appropriate labeling of containers of waste; written operating plans for managing biomedical waste; and the transport, storage, and treatment of biomedical wastes. (4) PERMITS AND FEES.— (a) All persons who generate, store, or treat biomedical waste shall obtain a permit from the department prior to commencing operation, except that a biomedical waste generator generating less than 25 pounds of biomedical waste in each 30-day period shall be exempt from the registration and fee requirements of this subsection. A biomedical waste generator need not obtain a separate permit if such generator works less than 6 hours in a 7-day period at a location different than the location specified on the permit. The department may issue combined permits for generation, storage, and treatment as appropriate to streamline permitting procedures. Application for such permit shall be made on an application form provided by the department and within the timeframes and in the manner prescribed by department rule. (b) Once the department determines that the person generating, storing, or treating biomedical waste is capable of constructing a facility or operating in compliance with this section and the rules adopted under this section, the department shall grant the permit. (c) If the department determines that the person generating, storing, or treating biomedical waste does not meet the provisions outlined in this section or the rules adopted under this section, the department shall deny the application for the permit pursuant to provisions of chapter 120. Such denial shall be in writing and shall list the circumstances for denial. Upon correction of such circumstances, the permit shall be issued. (d) The permit for a biomedical waste facility may not be transferred. When the ownership, control, or name of a biomedical waste facility is changed and continues to operate, the new owner shall apply to the department, upon forms provided by the department, for issuance of a permit in the timeframe and manner prescribed by rule of the department. (e) The department shall establish a schedule of fees for such permits. Fees assessed under this section shall be in an amount sufficient to meet the costs of carrying out the provisions of this section and rules adopted under this section. The fee schedule shall not be less than $50 or more than $400 for each year the permit is valid. Fees may be prorated on a quarterly basis when a facility will be in operation for 6 months or less before the annual renewal date. The department shall assess the minimum fees provided in this subsection until a fee schedule is adopted by rule of the department. Facilities owned and operated by the state shall be exempt from the payment of any fees. (f) Fees collected by the department in accordance with provisions of this section and the rules adopted under this section shall be deposited into a trust fund administered by the department for the payment of costs incurred in the administration of this section. (g) Permits issued by the department shall be valid for no more than 5 years. However, upon expiration, a new permit may be issued by the department in accordance with this section and the rules of the department. (h) The department may develop a streamlined process for permitting biomedical waste storage facilities that accept and store only sharps collected from the public, which may include the issuance of a single permit for each applicant that develops or sponsors a sharps collection program. (5) TRANSPORTERS.—Any person who transports biomedical waste within the state must register with the department prior to engaging in the transport of biomedical waste in accordance with rules adopted by the department. A registration may not be transferred from one biomedical waste transporter to another. If the ownership or name of a biomedical waste transporter is changed and the owner intends to continue operation of the transporter, the owner must apply to the department on departmental forms within the timeframes and in the manner prescribed by department rule. The department may charge registration fees in the same manner as is provided in paragraphs (4)(e) and (f). The department may exempt from this requirement any person who, or facility that, transports less than 25 pounds of such waste on any single occasion. (6) TRACKING SYSTEM.—The department shall adopt rules for a system of tracking biomedical waste. (a) Such system shall, at a minimum, provide for tracking of the transportation of the waste from the generator to the treatment or incineration facility, including a means for providing the generator of the waste assurance that the waste is received by the treatment or incineration facility, and shall include the identification of the entity transporting the waste on the container. (b) Inspections may be conducted for purposes of compliance with this section. Any such inspection shall be commenced and completed with reasonable promptness. If the officer, employee, or representative of the department obtains any samples, prior to leaving the premises he or she shall give the owner, operator, or agent in charge a receipt describing the sample obtained. (c) Any person who fails to comply with the provisions of this subsection commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (7) ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES.—Any person or public body in violation of this section or rules adopted under this section is subject to penalties provided in ss. 381.0012 and 381.0061. However, an administrative fine not to exceed $2,500 may be imposed for each day such person or public body is in violation of this section. The department may deny, suspend, or revoke any biomedical waste permit or registration if the permittee violates this section, any rule adopted under this section, or any lawful order of the department.

      "text": "381.026 Florida Patient’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities.— (1) SHORT TITLE.—This section may be cited as the “Florida Patient’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities.” (2) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section and s. 381.0261, the term: (a) “Department” means the Department of Health. (b) “Health care facility” means a facility licensed under chapter 395. (c) “Health care provider” means a physician licensed under chapter 458, an osteopathic physician licensed under chapter 459, a podiatric physician licensed under chapter 461, or an advanced practice registered nurse registered under s. 464.0123. (d) “Primary care provider” means a health care provider licensed under chapter 458, chapter 459, or chapter 464 who provides medical services to patients which are commonly provided without referral from another health care provider, including family and general practice, general pediatrics, and general internal medicine. (e) “Responsible provider” means a health care provider who is primarily responsible for patient care in a health care facility or provider’s office. (3) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this section to promote the interests and well-being of the patients of health care providers and health care facilities and to promote better communication between the patient and the health care provider. It is the intent of the Legislature that health care providers understand their responsibility to give their patients a general understanding of the procedures to be performed on them and to provide information pertaining to their health care so that they may make decisions in an informed manner after considering the information relating to their condition, the available treatment alternatives, and substantial risks and hazards inherent in the treatments. It is the intent of the Legislature that patients have a general understanding of their responsibilities toward health care providers and health care facilities. It is the intent of the Legislature that the provision of such information to a patient eliminate potential misunderstandings between patients and health care providers. It is a public policy of the state that the interests of patients be recognized in a patient’s bill of rights and responsibilities and that a health care facility or health care provider may not require a patient to waive his or her rights as a condition of treatment. This section shall not be used for any purpose in any civil or administrative action and neither expands nor limits any rights or remedies provided under any other law. (4) RIGHTS OF PATIENTS.—Each health care facility or provider shall observe the following standards: (a) Individual dignity.— 1. The individual dignity of a patient must be respected at all times and upon all occasions. 2. Every patient who is provided health care services retains certain rights to privacy, which must be respected without regard to the patient’s economic status or source of payment for his or her care. The patient’s rights to privacy must be respected to the extent consistent with providing adequate medical care to the patient and with the efficient administration of the health care facility or provider’s office. However, this subparagraph does not preclude necessary and discreet discussion of a patient’s case or examination by appropriate medical personnel. 3. A patient has the right to a prompt and reasonable response to a question or request. A health care facility shall respond in a reasonable manner to the request of a patient’s health care provider for medical services to the patient. The health care facility shall also respond in a reasonable manner to the patient’s request for other services customarily rendered by the health care facility to the extent such services do not require the approval of the patient’s health care provider or are not inconsistent with the patient’s treatment. 4. A patient in a health care facility has the right to retain and use personal clothing or possessions as space permits, unless for him or her to do so would infringe upon the right of another patient or is medically or programmatically contraindicated for documented medical, safety, or programmatic reasons. 5. A patient receiving care in a health care facility or in a provider’s office has the right to bring any person of his or her choosing to the patient-accessible areas of the health care facility or provider’s office to accompany the patient while the patient is receiving inpatient or outpatient treatment or is consulting with his or her health care provider, unless doing so would risk the safety or health of the patient, other patients, or staff of the facility or office or cannot be reasonably accommodated by the facility or provider. (b) Information.— 1. A patient has the right to know the name, function, and qualifications of each health care provider who is providing medical services to the patient. A patient may request such information from his or her responsible provider or the health care facility in which he or she is receiving medical services. 2. A patient in a health care facility has the right to know what patient support services are available in the facility. 3. A patient has the right to be given by his or her health care provider information concerning diagnosis, planned course of treatment, alternatives, risks, and prognosis, unless it is medically inadvisable or impossible to give this information to the patient, in which case the information must be given to the patient’s guardian or a person designated as the patient’s representative. A patient has the right to refuse this information. 4. A patient has the right to refuse any treatment based on information required by this paragraph, except as otherwise provided by law. The responsible provider shall document any such refusal. 5. A patient in a health care facility has the right to know what facility rules and regulations apply to patient conduct. 6. A patient has the right to express grievances to a health care provider, a health care facility, or the appropriate state licensing agency regarding alleged violations of patients’ rights. A patient has the right to know the health care provider’s or health care facility’s procedures for expressing a grievance. 7. A patient in a health care facility who does not speak English has the right to be provided an interpreter when receiving medical services if the facility has a person readily available who can interpret on behalf of the patient. 8. A health care provider or health care facility shall respect a patient’s right to privacy and should refrain from making a written inquiry or asking questions concerning the ownership of a firearm or ammunition by the patient or by a family member of the patient, or the presence of a firearm in a private home or other domicile of the patient or a family member of the patient. Notwithstanding this provision, a health care provider or health care facility that in good faith believes that this information is relevant to the patient’s medical care or safety, or safety of others, may make such a verbal or written inquiry. 9. A patient may decline to answer or provide any information regarding ownership of a firearm by the patient or a family member of the patient, or the presence of a firearm in the domicile of the patient or a family member of the patient. A patient’s decision not to answer a question relating to the presence or ownership of a firearm does not alter existing law regarding a physician’s authorization to choose his or her patients. 10. A health care provider or health care facility may not discriminate against a patient based solely upon the patient’s exercise of the constitutional right to own and possess firearms or ammunition. 11. A health care provider or health care facility shall respect a patient’s legal right to own or possess a firearm and should refrain from unnecessarily harassing a patient about firearm ownership during an examination. (c) Financial information and disclosure.— 1. A patient has the right to be given, upon request, by the responsible provider, his or her designee, or a representative of the health care facility full information and necessary counseling on the availability of known financial resources for the patient’s health care. 2. A health care provider or a health care facility shall, upon request, disclose to each patient who is eligible for Medicare, before treatment, whether the health care provider or the health care facility in which the patient is receiving medical services accepts assignment under Medicare reimbursement as payment in full for medical services and treatment rendered in the health care provider’s office or health care facility. 3. A primary care provider may publish a schedule of charges for the medical services that the provider offers to patients. The schedule must include the prices charged to an uninsured person paying for such services by cash, check, credit card, or debit card. The schedule must be posted in a conspicuous place in the reception area of the provider’s office and must include, but is not limited to, the 50 services most frequently provided by the primary care provider. The schedule may group services by three price levels, listing services in each price level. The posting must be at least 15 square feet in size. A primary care provider who publishes and maintains a schedule of charges for medical services is exempt from the license fee requirements for a single period of renewal of a professional license under chapter 456 for that licensure term and is exempt from the continuing education requirements of chapter 456 and the rules implementing those requirements for a single 2-year period. 4. If a primary care provider publishes a schedule of charges pursuant to subparagraph 3., he or she must continually post it at all times for the duration of active licensure in this state when primary care services are provided to patients. If a primary care provider fails to post the schedule of charges in accordance with this subparagraph, the provider shall be required to pay any license fee and comply with any continuing education requirements for which an exemption was received. 5. A health care provider or a health care facility shall, upon request, furnish a person, before the provision of medical services, a reasonable estimate of charges for such services. The health care provider or the health care facility shall provide an uninsured person, before the provision of a planned nonemergency medical service, a reasonable estimate of charges for such service and information regarding the provider’s or facility’s discount or charity policies for which the uninsured person may be eligible. Such estimates by a primary care provider must be consistent with the schedule posted under subparagraph 3. Estimates shall, to the extent possible, be written in language comprehensible to an ordinary layperson. Such reasonable estimate does not preclude the health care provider or health care facility from exceeding the estimate or making additional charges based on changes in the patient’s condition or treatment needs. 6. Each licensed facility, except a facility operating exclusively as a state facility, shall make available to the public on its website or by other electronic means a description of and a hyperlink to the health information that is disseminated by the agency pursuant to s. 408.05(3). The facility shall place a notice in the reception area that such information is available electronically and the website address. The licensed facility may indicate that the pricing information is based on a compilation of charges for the average patient and that each patient’s statement or bill may vary from the average depending upon the severity of illness and individual resources consumed. The licensed facility may also indicate that the price of service is negotiable for eligible patients based upon the patient’s ability to pay. 7. A patient has the right to receive a copy of an itemized statement or bill upon request. A patient has a right to be given an explanation of charges upon request. (d) Access to health care.— 1. A patient has the right to impartial access to medical treatment or accommodations, regardless of race, national origin, religion, handicap, or source of payment. 2. A patient has the right to treatment for any emergency medical condition that will deteriorate from failure to provide such treatment. 3. A patient has the right to access any mode of treatment that is, in his or her own judgment and the judgment of his or her health care practitioner, in the best interests of the patient, including complementary or alternative health care treatments, in accordance with the provisions of s. 456.41. (e) Experimental research.—In addition to the provisions of s. 766.103, a patient has the right to know if medical treatment is for purposes of experimental research and to consent prior to participation in such experimental research. For any patient, regardless of ability to pay or source of payment for his or her care, participation must be a voluntary matter; and a patient has the right to refuse to participate. The patient’s consent or refusal must be documented in the patient’s care record. (f) Patient’s knowledge of rights and responsibilities.—In receiving health care, patients have the right to know what their rights and responsibilities are. (5) RESPONSIBILITIES OF PATIENTS.—Each patient of a health care provider or health care facility shall respect the health care provider’s and health care facility’s right to expect behavior on the part of patients which, considering the nature of their illness, is reasonable and responsible. Each patient shall observe the responsibilities described in the following summary. (6) SUMMARY OF RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES.—Any health care provider who treats a patient in an office or any health care facility licensed under chapter 395 that provides emergency services and care or outpatient services and care to a patient, or admits and treats a patient, shall adopt and make available to the patient, in writing, a statement of the rights and responsibilities of patients, including the following: SUMMARY OF THE FLORIDA PATIENT’S BILL OF RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES Florida law requires that your health care provider or health care facility recognize your rights while you are receiving medical care and that you respect the health care provider’s or health care facility’s right to expect certain behavior on the part of patients.

      "text": "381.028 Adverse medical incidents.— (1) SHORT TITLE.—This section may be cited as the “Patients’ Right-to-Know About Adverse Medical Incidents Act.” (2) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this act to implement s. 25, Art. X of the State Constitution. The Legislature finds that this section of the State Constitution is intended to grant patient access to records of adverse medical incidents, which records were made or received in the course of business by a health care facility or provider, and not to repeal or otherwise modify existing laws governing the use of these records and the information contained therein. The Legislature further finds that all existing laws extending criminal and civil immunity to persons providing information to quality-of-care committees or organizations and all existing laws concerning the discoverability or admissibility into evidence of records of an adverse medical incident in any judicial or administrative proceeding remain in full force and effect. (3) DEFINITIONS.—As used in s. 25, Art. X of the State Constitution and this act, the term: (a) “Agency” means the Agency for Health Care Administration. (b) “Adverse medical incident” means medical negligence, intentional misconduct, and any other act, neglect, or default of a health care facility or health care provider which caused or could have caused injury to or the death of a patient, including, but not limited to, those incidents that are required by state or federal law to be reported to any governmental agency or body, incidents that are reported to any governmental agency or body, and incidents that are reported to or reviewed by any health care facility peer review, risk management, quality assurance, credentials, or similar committee or any representative of any such committee. (c) “Department” means the Department of Health. (d) “Have access to any records” means, in addition to any other procedure for producing the records provided by general law, making the records available for inspection and copying upon formal or informal request by the patient or a representative of the patient, provided that current records that have been made publicly available by publication or on the Internet may be provided by reference to the location at which the records are publicly available.

L. No. 104-191, and its implementing regulations, the Federal Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. s. 552(a), and its implementing regulations, and any other federal law, including, but not limited to, federal common law and decisional law, that would prohibit the disclosure of patient privacy information. (j) “Records” means the final report of any adverse medical incident. Medical records that are not the final report of any adverse medical incident, including drafts or other nonfinal versions; notes; and any documents or portions thereof which constitute, contain, or reflect any attorney-client communications or any attorney-client work product may not be considered “records” for purposes of s. 25, Art. X of the State Constitution and this act. (k) “Representative of the patient” means a parent of a minor patient, a court-appointed guardian for the patient, a health care surrogate, or a person holding a power of attorney or notarized consent appropriately executed by the patient granting permission to a health care facility or health care provider to disclose the patient’s health care information to that person. In the case of a deceased patient, the term also means the personal representative of the estate of the deceased patient; the deceased patient’s surviving spouse, surviving parent, or surviving adult child; the parent or guardian of a surviving minor child of the deceased patient; or the attorney for any such person. (4) PATIENTS’ RIGHT OF ACCESS.—Patients have a right to have access to any records made or received in the course of business by a health care facility or health care provider relating to any adverse medical incident. In providing access to these records, the health care facility or health care provider may not disclose the identity of patients involved in the incidents and shall maintain any privacy restrictions imposed by federal law. (5) APPLICABILITY.—Section 25, Art. X of the State Constitution applies to records created, incidents occurring, and actions pending on or after November 2, 2004. Section 25, Art. X of the State Constitution does not apply to records created, incidents occurring, or actions pending before November 2, 2004.

      "heading": "Special needs shelters.",
      "text": "381.0303 Special needs shelters.— (1) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this section is to provide for the operation and closure of special needs shelters and to designate the Department of Health, through its county health departments, as the lead agency for coordination of the recruitment of health care practitioners, as defined in s. 456.001(4), to staff special needs shelters in times of emergency or disaster and to provide resources to the department to carry out this responsibility. However, nothing in this section prohibits a county health department from entering into an agreement with a local emergency management agency to assume the lead responsibility for recruiting health care practitioners. (2) SPECIAL NEEDS SHELTER PLAN; STAFFING; STATE AGENCY ASSISTANCE.—If funds have been appropriated to support disaster coordinator positions in county health departments: (a) The department shall assume lead responsibility for the coordination of local medical and health care providers, the American Red Cross, and other interested parties in developing a plan for the staffing and medical management of special needs shelters and pediatric special needs shelters. Plans must conform to the local comprehensive emergency management plan. (b) County health departments shall, in conjunction with the local emergency management agencies, have the lead responsibility for coordination of the recruitment of health care practitioners to staff local special needs shelters. County health departments shall assign their employees to work in special needs shelters when those employees are needed to protect the health and safety of persons with special needs. County governments shall assist the department with nonmedical staffing and the operation of special needs shelters. The local health department and emergency management agency shall coordinate these efforts to ensure appropriate staffing in special needs shelters, including a staff member who is familiar with the needs of persons with Alzheimer’s disease. (c) The appropriate county health department and local emergency management agency shall jointly decide who has responsibility for medical supervision in each special needs shelter. (d) Local emergency management agencies shall be responsible for the designation and operation of special needs shelters during times of emergency or disaster and the closure of the facilities following an emergency or disaster. The local health department and emergency management agency shall coordinate these efforts to ensure the appropriate designation and operation of special needs shelters. County health departments shall assist the local emergency management agency with regard to the management of medical services in special needs shelters. (e) The Secretary of Elderly Affairs, or his or her designee, shall convene, at any time that he or she deems appropriate and necessary, a multiagency special needs shelter discharge planning team to assist local areas that are severely impacted by a natural or manmade disaster that requires the use of special needs shelters. Multiagency special needs shelter discharge planning teams shall provide assistance to local emergency management agencies with the continued operation or closure of the shelters, as well as with the discharge of special needs clients to alternate facilities if necessary. Local emergency management agencies may request the assistance of a multiagency special needs shelter discharge planning team by alerting statewide emergency management officials of the necessity for additional assistance in their area. The Secretary of Elderly Affairs is encouraged to proactively work with other state agencies prior to any natural disasters for which warnings are provided to ensure that multiagency special needs shelter discharge planning teams are ready to assemble and deploy rapidly upon a determination by state emergency management officials that a disaster area requires additional assistance. The Secretary of Elderly Affairs may call upon any state agency or office to provide staff to assist a multiagency special needs shelter discharge planning team. Unless the secretary determines that the nature or circumstances surrounding the disaster do not warrant participation from a particular agency’s staff, each multiagency special needs shelter discharge planning team shall include at least one representative from each of the following state agencies: 1. Department of Elderly Affairs. 2. Department of Health. 3. Department of Children and Families. 4. Department of Veterans’ Affairs. 5. Division of Emergency Management. 6. Agency for Health Care Administration. 7. Agency for Persons with Disabilities. (3) SPECIAL CARE FOR PERSONS WITH ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE OR RELATED FORMS OF DEMENTIA.—All special needs shelters must establish designated shelter areas for persons with Alzheimer’s disease or related forms of dementia to enable those persons to maintain their normal habits and routines to the greatest extent possible. (4) REIMBURSEMENT TO HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONERS AND FACILITIES.— (a) The department shall, upon request, reimburse in accordance with paragraph (b): 1. Health care practitioners, as defined in s. 456.001, provided the practitioner is not providing care to a patient under an existing contract, and emergency medical technicians and paramedics licensed under chapter 401 for medical care provided at the request of the department in special needs shelters or at other locations during times of emergency or a declared disaster. Reimbursement for health care practitioners, except for physicians licensed under chapter 458 or chapter 459, shall be based on the average hourly rate that such practitioners were paid according to the most recent survey of Florida hospitals conducted by the Florida Hospital Association or other nationally recognized or state-recognized data source. 2. Health care facilities, such as hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and community residential homes, if, upon closure of a special needs shelter, a multiagency special needs shelter discharge planning team determines that it is necessary to discharge persons with special needs to other health care facilities. The receiving facilities are eligible for reimbursement for services provided to the individuals for up to 90 days. A facility must show proof of a written request from a representative of an agency serving on the multiagency special needs shelter discharge planning team that the individual for whom the facility is seeking reimbursement for services rendered was referred to that facility from a special needs shelter. The department shall specify by rule which expenses are reimbursable and the rate of reimbursement for each service. (b) Reimbursement is subject to the availability of federal funds and shall be requested on forms prepared by the department. If a Presidential Disaster Declaration has been issued, the department shall request federal reimbursement of eligible expenditures. The department may not provide reimbursement to facilities under this subsection for services provided to a person with special needs if, during the period of time in which the services were provided, the individual was enrolled in another state-funded program, such as Medicaid or another similar program, was covered under a policy of health insurance as defined in s. 624.603, or was a member of a health maintenance organization or prepaid health clinic as defined in chapter 641, which would otherwise pay for the same services. Travel expense and per diem costs shall be reimbursed pursuant to s. 112.061. (5) HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONER REGISTRY.—The department may use the registries established in ss. 401.273 and 456.38 when health care practitioners are needed to staff special needs shelters or to assist with other disaster-related activities. (6) SPECIAL NEEDS SHELTER INTERAGENCY COMMITTEE.—The State Surgeon General may establish a special needs shelter interagency committee and serve as, or appoint a designee to serve as, the committee’s chair. The department shall provide any necessary staff and resources to support the committee in the performance of its duties. The committee shall address and resolve problems related to special needs shelters not addressed in the state comprehensive emergency medical plan and shall consult on the planning and operation of special needs shelters. (a) The committee shall develop, negotiate, and regularly review any necessary interagency agreements, and undertake other such activities as the department deems necessary to facilitate the implementation of this section. (b) The special needs shelter interagency committee shall be composed of representatives of emergency management, health, medical, and social services organizations. Membership shall include, but shall not be limited to, representatives of the Departments of Health, Children and Families, Elderly Affairs, and Education; the Agency for Health Care Administration; the Division of Emergency Management; the Florida Medical Association; the Florida Osteopathic Medical Association; Associated Home Health Industries of Florida, Inc.; the Florida Nurses Association; the Florida Health Care Association; the Florida Assisted Living Affiliation; the Florida Hospital Association; the Florida Statutory Teaching Hospital Council; the Florida Association of Homes for the Aging; the Florida Emergency Preparedness Association; the American Red Cross; Florida Hospices and Palliative Care, Inc.; the Association of Community Hospitals and Health Systems; the Florida Association of Health Maintenance Organizations; the Florida League of Health Systems; the Private Care Association; the Salvation Army; the Florida Association of Aging Services Providers; the AARP; and the Florida Renal Coalition. (c) Meetings of the committee shall be held in Tallahassee, and members of the committee shall serve at the expense of the agencies or organizations they represent. The committee shall make every effort to use teleconference or video conference capabilities in order to ensure statewide input and participation. (7) RULES.—The department, in coordination with the Division of Emergency Management, has the authority to adopt rules necessary to implement this section. Rules shall include: (a) The definition of a “person with special needs,” including eligibility criteria for individuals with physical, mental, cognitive impairment, or sensory disabilities and the services a person with special needs can expect to receive in a special needs shelter. (b) The process for special needs shelter health care practitioners and facility reimbursement for services provided in a disaster. (c) Guidelines for special needs shelter staffing levels to provide services. (d) The definition of and standards for special needs shelter supplies and equipment, including durable medical equipment. (e) Standards for the special needs shelter registration program, including all necessary forms and guidelines for addressing the needs of unregistered persons in need of a special needs shelter. (f) Standards for addressing the needs of families where only one dependent is eligible for admission to a special needs shelter and the needs of adults with special needs who are caregivers for individuals without special needs. (g) The requirement of the county health departments to seek the participation of hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, home health agencies, hospice providers, nurse registries, home medical equipment providers, dialysis centers, and other health and medical emergency preparedness stakeholders in pre-event planning activities. (8) EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PLANS.—The submission of emergency management plans to county health departments by home health agencies, nurse registries, hospice programs, and home medical equipment providers is conditional upon receipt of an appropriation by the department to establish disaster coordinator positions in county health departments unless the State Surgeon General and a local county commission jointly determine to require that such plans be submitted based on a determination that there is a special need to protect public health in the local area during an emergency.

      "text": "381.0406 Rural health networks.— (1) LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT.— (a) The Legislature finds that, in rural areas, access to health care is limited and the quality of health care is negatively affected by inadequate financing, difficulty in recruiting and retaining skilled health professionals, and because of a migration of patients to urban areas for general acute care and specialty services. (b) The Legislature further finds that the efficient and effective delivery of health care services in rural areas requires the integration of public and private resources and the coordination of health care providers. (c) The Legislature further finds that the availability of a continuum of quality health care services, including preventive, primary, secondary, tertiary, and long-term care, is essential to the economic and social vitality of rural communities. (d) The Legislature further finds that the creation of rural health networks can help to alleviate these problems. Rural health networks shall act in the broad public interest and, to the extent possible, be structured to provide a continuum of quality health care services for rural residents through the cooperative efforts of rural health network members. (e) The Legislature further finds that rural health networks shall have the goal of increasing the utilization of statutory rural hospitals for appropriate health care services whenever feasible, which shall help to ensure their survival and thereby support the economy and protect the health and safety of rural residents. (f) Finally, the Legislature finds that rural health networks may serve as “laboratories” to determine the best way of organizing rural health services, to move the state closer to ensuring that everyone has access to health care, and to promote cost containment efforts. The ultimate goal of rural health networks shall be to ensure that quality health care is available and efficiently delivered to all persons in rural areas. (2) DEFINITIONS.— (a) “Rural” means an area with a population density of less than 100 individuals per square mile or an area defined by the most recent United States Census as rural. (b) “Health care provider” means any individual, group, or entity, public or private, that provides health care, including: preventive health care, primary health care, secondary and tertiary health care, in-hospital health care, public health care, and health promotion and education. (c) “Rural health network” or “network” means a nonprofit legal entity, consisting of rural and urban health care providers and others, that is organized to plan and deliver health care services on a cooperative basis in a rural area, except for some secondary and tertiary care services. (3) REQUIRED MEMBER INCLUSION.—Health care provider membership may vary, but all networks shall include members that provide public health, comprehensive primary care, emergency medical care, and acute inpatient care. (4) AVAILABILITY.—Network membership shall be available to all health care providers, provided that they render care to all patients referred to them from other network members, comply with network quality assurance and risk management requirements, abide by the terms and conditions of network provider agreements in paragraph (11)(c), and provide services at a rate or price equal to the rate or price negotiated by the network. (5) GEOGRAPHIC AREA.—Network areas do not need to conform to local political boundaries or state administrative district boundaries. The geographic area of one rural health network, however, may not overlap the territory of any other rural health network. (6) PROVISIONS FOR REFERRAL TO SERVICES NOT AVAILABLE IN RURAL AREAS.—Networks shall develop provisions for referral to tertiary inpatient care and to other services that are not available in rural areas. (7) AVAILABILITY OF BASIC HEALTH SERVICES.—Networks shall make available health promotion, disease prevention, and primary care services to improve the health status of rural residents and to contain health care costs. (8) POINTS OF ENTRY.—Networks may have multiple points of entry, such as through private physicians, community health centers, county health departments, certified rural health clinics, hospitals, or other providers; or they may have a single point of entry. (9) STANDARD PROTOCOLS, COORDINATION AND SHARING OF PATIENT RECORDS; INFORMATION EXCHANGE.—Networks shall establish standard protocols, coordinate and share patient records, and develop patient information exchange systems. (10) RISK MANAGEMENT AND QUALITY ASSURANCE.—Networks shall develop risk management and quality assurance programs for network providers. (11) GOVERNANCE AND ORGANIZATION.— (a) Networks shall be incorporated under the laws of the state. (b) Networks shall have a board of directors that derives membership from local government, health care providers, businesses, consumers, and others. (c) Network boards of directors shall have the responsibility of determining the content of health care provider agreements that link network members. The agreements shall specify: 1. Who provides what services. 2. The extent to which the health care provider provides care to persons who lack health insurance or are otherwise unable to pay for care. 3. The procedures for transfer of medical records. 4. The method used for the transportation of patients between providers. 5. Referral and patient flow including appointments and scheduling. 6. Payment arrangements for the transfer or referral of patients. (d) There shall be no liability on the part of, and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against, any member of a network board of directors, or its employees or agents, for any lawful action taken by them in the performance of their administrative powers and duties under this subsection. (12) SERVICES.— (a) Networks, to the extent feasible, shall provide for a continuum of care for all patients served by the network. Each network shall include the following core services: disease prevention, health promotion, comprehensive primary care, emergency medical care, and acute inpatient care. Each network shall ensure the availability of comprehensive maternity care, including prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care for uncomplicated pregnancies, either directly, by contract, or through referral agreements. Networks shall, to the extent feasible, also ensure the availability of the following services within the specified timeframes, either directly, by contract, or through referral agreements: 1.

Magnetic resonance imaging, lithotripter treatment, advanced radiology, and other technologically advanced services. g. Subacute care. (b) Networks shall actively participate with area health education center programs, whenever feasible, in developing and implementing recruitment, training, and retention programs directed at positively influencing the supply and distribution of health care professionals serving in, or receiving training in, network areas. (c) As funds become available, networks shall emphasize community care alternatives for elders who would otherwise be placed in nursing homes. (d) To promote the most efficient use of resources, networks shall emphasize disease prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of medical problems, and community care alternatives for persons with mental health and substance abuse disorders who are at risk to be institutionalized. (13) TRAUMA SERVICES.—In those network areas which have an established trauma agency approved by the Department of Health, that trauma agency must be a participant in the network. Trauma services provided within the network area must comply with s. 395.405. (14) FINANCING.—Networks may use all sources of public and private funds to support network activities. Nothing in this section prohibits networks from becoming managed care providers. (15) IMPLEMENTATION.—As funds become available, networks shall be developed and implemented in two phases. (a) Phase I shall consist of a network planning and development grant program. Planning grants shall be used to organize networks, incorporate network boards, and develop formal provider agreements as provided for in this section. The Department of Health shall develop a request-for-proposal process to solicit grant applications. (b) Phase II shall consist of network operations. As funds become available, certified networks shall be eligible to receive grant funds to be used to help defray the costs of network infrastructure development, patient care, and network administration. Infrastructure development includes, but is not limited to: recruitment and retention of primary care practitioners; development of preventive health care programs; linkage of urban and rural health care systems; design and implementation of automated patient records, outcome measurement, quality assurance, and risk management systems; establishment of one-stop service delivery sites; upgrading of medical technology available to network providers; enhancement of emergency medical systems; enhancement of medical transportation; and development of telecommunication capabilities. A Phase II award may occur in the same fiscal year as a Phase I award. (16) CERTIFICATION.—For the purpose of certifying networks that are eligible for Phase II funding, the Department of Health shall certify networks that meet the criteria delineated in this section and the rules governing rural health networks. (17) RULES.—The Department of Health shall establish rules that govern the creation and certification of networks, including establishing outcome measures for networks.

      "text": "381.04065 Rural health network cooperative agreements.— (1) INTENT.—It is the Legislature’s intent that, to the extent necessary to foster the development of rural health networks as provided for in s. 381.0406, competitive market forces shall be replaced with state regulation, as provided for in this section. It is also the intent of the Legislature that consolidation of network hospital services or technologies undertaken pursuant to this section, and cooperative agreements between members of rural health networks, shall not violate the state’s antitrust laws when such arrangements improve the quality of health care, moderate cost increases, and are made between members of rural health networks as defined in s. 381.0406. It is also the intent of the Legislature that such arrangements be protected from federal antitrust laws, subject to the approval and supervision of the Department of Health. Such intent is within the public policy of the state to facilitate the provision of quality, cost-efficient medical care to rural patients. (2) DEPARTMENT APPROVAL.—Providers who are members of certified rural health networks who seek to consolidate services or technologies or enter into cooperative agreements shall seek approval from the Department of Health, which may consult with the Department of Legal Affairs. The department shall determine that the likely benefits resulting from the agreement outweigh any disadvantages attributable to any potential reduction in competition resulting from the agreement and issue a letter of approval if, in its determination, the agreement reduces or moderates costs and meets any of the following criteria: (a) Consolidates services or facilities in a market area used by rural health network patients to avoid duplication; (b) Promotes cooperation between rural health network members in the market area; (c) Encourages cost sharing among rural health network facilities; (d) Enhances the quality of rural health care; or (e) Improves utilization of rural health resources and equipment. (3) STATE OVERSIGHT.—The Department of Health shall review each agreement approved under this section at least every 2 years. If the department determines that the likely benefits resulting from its state action approval no longer outweigh any disadvantages attributable to any potential reduction in competition resulting from the agreement, the department shall initiate proceedings to terminate its state action approval governing the agreement. Such termination proceeding shall be governed by chapter 120. (4) JUDICIAL REVIEW.—Any applicant aggrieved by a decision of the Department of Health shall be entitled to both administrative and judicial review thereof in accordance with chapter 120. In such review, the decision of the department shall be affirmed unless it is arbitrary, capricious, or it is not in compliance with this section. (5) RULEMAKING.—The Department of Health, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, shall establish rules necessary to implement this section.

      "text": "381.06014 Blood establishments.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Blood establishment” means any person, entity, or organization, operating within the state, which examines an individual for the purpose of blood donation or which collects, processes, stores, tests, or distributes blood or blood components collected from the human body for the purpose of transfusion, for any other medical purpose, or for the production of any biological product. A person, entity, or organization that uses a mobile unit to conduct such activities within the state is also a blood establishment. (b) “Volunteer donor” means a person who does not receive remuneration, other than an incentive, for a blood donation intended for transfusion, and the product container of the donation from the person qualifies for labeling with the statement “volunteer donor” under 21 C.F.R. s. 606.121. (2) Any blood establishment operating in the state may not conduct any activity defined in paragraph (1)(a) unless that blood establishment is operated in a manner consistent with the provisions of 21 C.F.R. parts 211 and 600-640. (3) Any blood establishment determined to be operating in the state in a manner not consistent with the provisions of 21 C.F.R. parts 211 and 600-640 and in a manner that constitutes a danger to the health or well-being of donors or recipients as evidenced by the federal Food and Drug Administration’s inspection reports and the revocation of the blood establishment’s license or registration is in violation of this chapter and must immediately cease all operations in the state. (4) The operation of a blood establishment in a manner not consistent with the provisions of 21 C.F.R. parts 211 and 600-640 and in a manner that constitutes a danger to the health or well-being of blood donors or recipients as evidenced by the federal Food and Drug Administration’s inspection process is declared a nuisance and inimical to the public health, welfare, and safety. The Agency for Health Care Administration or any state attorney may bring an action for an injunction to restrain such operations or enjoin the future operation of the blood establishment. (5) A local government may not restrict the access to or use of any public facility or infrastructure for the collection of blood or blood components from volunteer donors based on whether the blood establishment is operating as a for-profit organization or not-for-profit organization. (6) In determining the service fee of blood or blood components received from volunteer donors and sold to hospitals or other health care providers, a blood establishment may not base the service fee of the blood or blood component solely on whether the purchasing entity is a for-profit organization or not-for-profit organization. (7) A blood establishment that collects blood or blood components from volunteer donors must disclose on the Internet the information required under this subsection to educate and inform donors and the public about the blood establishment’s activities. A hospital that collects blood or blood components to be used only by that hospital’s licensed facilities or by a health care provider that is a part of the hospital’s business entity is exempt from the disclosure requirements in this subsection. The information required to be disclosed under this subsection may be cumulative for all blood establishments within a business entity. A blood establishment must disclose on its website all of the following information: (a) A description of the steps involved in collecting, processing, and distributing volunteer donations. (b) By March 1 of each year, the number of units of blood components which were: 1. Produced by the blood establishment during the preceding calendar year; 2. Obtained from other sources during the preceding calendar year; 3. Distributed during the preceding calendar year to health care providers located outside this state. However, if the blood establishment collects donations in a county outside this state, distributions to health care providers in that county shall be excluded. Such information shall be reported in the aggregate for health care providers located within the United States and its territories or outside the United States and its territories; and 4. Distributed during the preceding calendar year to entities that are not health care providers. Such information shall be reported in the aggregate for purchasers located within the United States and its territories or outside the United States and its territories. (c) The blood establishment’s conflict-of-interest policy, policy concerning related-party transactions, whistleblower policy, and policy for determining executive compensation. If a change occurs to any of these documents, the revised document must be available on the blood establishment’s website by the following March 1. (d) Except for a hospital that collects blood or blood components from volunteer donors: 1. The most recent 3 years of the Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax, Internal Revenue Service Form 990, if the business entity for the blood establishment is eligible to file such return. The Form 990 must be available on the blood establishment’s website within 60 calendar days after it is filed with the Internal Revenue Service; or 2. If the business entity for the blood establishment is not eligible to file the Form 990 return, a balance sheet, income statement, and statement of changes in cash flow, along with the expression of an opinion thereon by an independent certified public accountant who audited or reviewed such financial statements. Such documents must be available on the blood establishment’s website within 120 days after the end of the blood establishment’s fiscal year and must remain on the blood establishment’s website for at least 36 months. (8) A blood establishment is liable for a civil penalty for failing to make the disclosures required under subsection (7). The Department of Legal Affairs may assess the civil penalty against the blood establishment for each day that it fails to make such required disclosures, but the penalty may not exceed $10,000 per year. If multiple blood establishments operated by a single business entity fail to meet such disclosure requirements, the civil penalty may be assessed against only one of the business entity’s blood establishments. The Department of Legal Affairs may terminate an action if the blood establishment agrees to pay a stipulated civil penalty. A civil penalty so collected accrues to the state and shall be deposited as received into the General Revenue Fund unallocated. The Department of Legal Affairs may terminate the action and waive the civil penalty upon a showing of good cause by the blood establishment as to why the required disclosures were not made.

The state bears no responsibility for the collection of any interest charges or other remaining balances. (d) A dentist or dental hygienist may receive up to a maximum of 5 awards pursuant to paragraph (a), one award for each year he or she maintains eligibility for the program for the entire year. Such awards are not required to be awarded in consecutive years, and, if a dentist or dental hygienist loses eligibility pursuant to subsection (4) for the current year, he or she may reapply for the program in a future year once he or she has regained eligibility. (4) A dentist or dental hygienist is not eligible to receive funds under the loan program if the dentist or dental hygienist: (a) Is no longer employed by a public health program or private practice that meets the requirements of subsection (2) or does not verify, in a manner determined by the department, that he or she has volunteered his or her dental services for the required number of hours. (b) Ceases to participate in the Florida Medicaid program. (c) Has disciplinary action taken against his or her license by the Board of Dentistry for a violation of s. 466.028. (5) A dental student or dental hygiene student who demonstrates an offer of employment in a public health program or private practice as specified in paragraph (2)(a) may apply for the loan program before obtaining active employment but may not be awarded funds from the loan program until he or she meets the requirements of subsection (2). (6) A dentist or dental hygienist who receives payment under the program shall furnish information requested by the department for the purpose of the department’s duties under s. 381.4021.

(2) An applicant for or recipient of services funded under the brain and spinal cord injury program must inform the brain and spinal cord injury program of any rights she or he has to third-party payments for such services, and the brain and spinal cord injury program shall be subrogated to her or his rights to such third-party payments. The brain and spinal cord injury program may recover directly from: (a) Any third party that is liable to make a benefit payment to the provider of the recipient’s funded services or to the recipient under the terms of any contract, settlement, or award; (b) The recipient, if she or he has received a third-party payment for funded services provided to her or him; or (c) The provider of the recipient’s funded services, if third-party payment for such services has been recovered by the provider. (3) An applicant for or a recipient of funded services is deemed to have assigned to the brain and spinal cord injury program her or his rights to any payments for such services from a third party and to have authorized the brain and spinal cord injury program to release information with respect to such services for the sole purpose of obtaining reimbursement. (4) The brain and spinal cord injury program may, in order to enforce its rights under this section, institute, intervene in, or join any legal proceeding against a third party against whom recovery rights arise. Action taken by the brain and spinal cord injury program does not preclude the recipient’s recovery for that portion of her or his damages not subrogated to the brain and spinal cord injury program, and action taken by the recipient does not prejudice the rights of the brain and spinal cord injury program. (5) When the brain and spinal cord injury program provides, pays for, or becomes liable for funded services, it has a lien for the amount of such services upon all causes of action that accrue to the recipient or to her or his legal representatives as a result of sickness, injury, disease, disability, or death due to the liability of a third party which necessitated funded services. To perfect such lien, a notice of lien must be filed with the clerk of the circuit court in the recipient’s county of residence. The notice of lien must contain the name and address of the person to whom services were furnished and the name, address, and telephone number of a person at the brain and spinal cord injury program from whom information regarding the lien can be obtained. Failure of the brain and spinal cord injury program to file a notice of lien does not affect the program’s other rights provided in this section. Any notice of lien filed as provided under this subsection is valid for 5 years after filing, and may be extended for an additional 5-year period by filing a new notice of lien at any time prior to the expiration of the original notice of lien. (6) In recovering any payments in accordance with this section, the brain and spinal cord injury program may make appropriate settlements. (7) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, payments made for funded services are neither collateral payments nor collateral sources within the meaning of chapter 86-160, Laws of Florida, or chapter 88-1, Laws of Florida. (8) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the brain and spinal cord injury program retains all rights and remedies granted under this section as against moneys paid under chapter 440. (9) The department shall adopt rules to administer this section. History.—s. 22, ch. 2000-367.

      "text": "381.89 Regulation of tanning facilities.— (1) As used in this section: (a) “Tanning facility” means a place of business which provides access to a tanning device by customers. (b) “Department” means the Department of Health. (c) “Tanning device” means equipment that emits electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths between 200 and 400 nanometers and that is used for tanning the skin, including a sunlamp, tanning booth, or tanning bed or any accompanying equipment. (2) This section does not apply to a tanning facility that uses only phototherapy devices that emit ultraviolet radiation which are used only by or under the direct supervision of a physician licensed under chapter 458 or an osteopathic physician licensed under chapter 459. (3)(a) A person may not operate a tanning facility unless it is licensed under this section. (b) The department shall establish procedures for the issuance and annual renewal of licenses and shall establish annual license and renewal fees and late-payment fees in an amount necessary to cover the expenses of administering this section. Annual license and renewal fees may not be more than $250 per tanning device, and a maximum total fee per individual tanning facility may be set by rule. (c) The department may adopt a system under which licenses expire on staggered dates and the annual renewal fees are prorated quarterly to reflect the actual number of months the license is valid. (d) The department may cancel, revoke, or suspend a license to operate a tanning facility if the licensee: 1. Fails to pay any fee required by this section; 2. Obtains or attempts to obtain a license by fraud; or 3. Violates a provision of this section. (4)(a) A tanning facility must give each customer a written warning that states that: 1. Not wearing the provided eye protection can cause damage to the eyes. 2. Overexposure causes burns. 3. Repeated exposure can cause premature aging of the skin or skin cancer. 4. Abnormal skin sensitivity or burning may be caused by certain foods, cosmetics, or medications, including, without limitation, tranquilizers, diuretics, antibiotics, high blood pressure medicines, or birth control pills. 5. Any person who takes a prescription or over-the-counter medication should consult a physician before using a tanning device. 6.

(b) A tanning facility must have a copy of the facility’s most recent inspection report available to the public and must post a warning sign in any area where a tanning device is used. Posting this sign does not absolve the facility of any liability. The sign must state: DANGER, ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION Follow these instructions: 1. Avoid frequent or lengthy exposure. As with natural sunlight, exposure can cause eye and skin injury or allergic reactions. Repeated exposure can cause chronic sun damage characterized by wrinkling, dryness, fragility and bruising of the skin or skin cancer. 2. Wear protective eyewear. FAILURE TO USE PROTECTIVE EYEWEAR CAN RESULT IN SEVERE BURNS OR LONG-TERM INJURY TO THE EYES. 3. Ultraviolet radiation from sunlamps will aggravate the effects of the sun. Therefore, do not sunbathe before or after exposure to ultraviolet radiation. 4. Using medications or cosmetics can increase your sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation. Consult a physician before using a sunlamp if you are using medications, have a history of skin problems, or believe you are especially sensitive to sunlight. Women who are pregnant or on birth control who use this product can develop discolored skin. IF YOU DO NOT TAN IN THE SUN YOU WILL NOT TAN BY USING THIS DEVICE. (5) A tanning facility may not claim or distribute promotional materials that claim a tanning device is safe or free from risk.

The General Appropriations Act or accompanying legislation may limit the number of cancer centers which shall receive Tier 3 designations or provide additional criteria for such designation. 3. A cancer center’s participation in Tier 3 may not extend beyond June 30, 2024. 4. A cancer center that qualifies as a designated Tier 3 center under the criteria provided in subparagraph 1. by July 1, 2014, is authorized to pursue NCI designation as a cancer center or a comprehensive cancer center until June 30, 2024. (5) The department shall use the following formula to calculate a participating cancer center’s allocation fraction: CAF = [0.4 x (CRC÷TCRC)]+[0.3 x (CPC÷TCPC)]+[0.3 x (CBE÷TCBE)] Where: CAF = A cancer center’s allocation fraction. CRC = A cancer center’s tier-weighted reportable cases. TCRC = The total tier-weighted reportable cases for all cancer centers. CPC = A cancer center’s tier-weighted peer-review costs. TCPC = The total tier-weighted peer-review costs for all cancer centers. CBE = A cancer center’s tier-weighted biomedical education and training. TCBE = The total tier-weighted biomedical education and training for all cancer centers. (6) A cancer center’s annual allocation shall be calculated by multiplying the funds appropriated for the Casey DeSantis Cancer Research Program in the General Appropriations Act by that cancer center’s allocation fraction. If the calculation results in an annual allocation that is less than $16 million, that cancer center’s annual allocation shall be increased to a sum equaling $16 million, with the additional funds being provided proportionally from the annual allocations calculated for the other participating cancer centers. (7) The amount of $37,771,257 from the total funds appropriated in the General Appropriations Act for the Casey DeSantis Cancer Research Program shall be excluded from the annual allocation fraction calculation under subsection (5). The excluded amount shall be distributed to participating cancer centers in the same proportion as determined by the allocation fraction calculation.

(d) A provision to allow the department and other state auditing bodies to audit all financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and any other documents pertinent to the allocation agreement. (e) A provision requiring the annual reporting of outcome data and protocols used in achieving those outcomes. (12)(a) The Legislature finds that targeted areas of cancer research require increased resources and that Florida should become a leader in promoting research opportunities for these targeted areas. Floridians should not have to leave the state to receive the most advanced cancer care and treatment. To meet this need, the Cancer Connect Collaborative Research Incubator, or “incubator” as used in this subsection, is created within the department, to be overseen by the collaborative, to provide funding for a targeted area of cancer research over a 5-year period. For the 5-year period beginning July 1, 2025, the incubator’s targeted area of cancer research is pediatric cancer. (b) Contingent upon the appropriation of funds by the Legislature, grants issued through the incubator must be awarded through a peer-reviewed, competitive process. Priority must be given to applicants that focus on enhancing both research and treatment by increasing participation in clinical trials related to the targeted area of cancer research, including all of the following: 1. Identifying strategies to increase enrollment in cancer clinical trials. 2. Supporting public and private professional education programs to raise awareness and knowledge about cancer clinical trials. 3. Providing tools for cancer patients and community-based oncologists to help identify available cancer clinical trials in this state. 4.

(d) Applications for incubator funding may be submitted by any Florida-based specialty hospital as defined in s. 395.002(28)(a) which provides cancer treatment for patients from birth to 18 years of age. All qualified applicants must have equal access and opportunity to compete for research funding. Incubator grants must be recommended by the collaborative and awarded by the department on the basis of scientific merit, as determined by a competitively open and peer-reviewed process to ensure objectivity, consistency, and high quality. (e) To ensure that all proposals for research funding are appropriate and are evaluated fairly on the basis of scientific merit, the department shall appoint peer review panels of independent, scientifically qualified individuals to review the scientific merit of each proposal and establish its priority score. The priority scores must be forwarded to the collaborative and must be considered in determining which proposals the collaborative recommends for funding. (f) The collaborative and the peer review panels shall establish and follow rigorous guidelines for ethical conduct and adhere to a strict policy with regard to conflicts of interest regarding the assessment of incubator grant applications. A member of the collaborative or a panel may not participate in any discussion or decision of the collaborative or a panel regarding a research proposal from any firm, entity, or agency with which the member is associated as a governing body member, as an employee, or through a contractual arrangement. (g) Each recipient of incubator grant funds must enter into an allocation agreement with the department. Each such allocation agreement must include all of the following: 1. A line-item budget narrative documenting the annual allocation of funds to a recipient. 2. A cap on the annual award of 15 percent for administrative expenses. 3. A requirement for the recipient to submit quarterly reports of all expenditures made by the recipient with funds received through the incubator. 4. A provision to allow the department and other state auditing bodies to audit all financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and any other documents pertinent to the allocation agreement. 5.

Any other documentation as required by board rule. The department must submit such documentation to the Consortium for Medical Marijuana Clinical Outcomes Research established pursuant to s. 1004.4351. (c) If a qualified physician determines that smoking is an appropriate route of administration for a qualified patient, other than a patient diagnosed with a terminal condition, the qualified physician must submit the following documentation to the applicable board: 1. A list of other routes of administration, if any, certified by a qualified physician that the patient has tried, the length of time the patient used such routes of administration, and an assessment of the effectiveness of those routes of administration in treating the qualified patient’s qualifying condition. 2. Research documenting the effectiveness of smoking as a route of administration to treat similarly situated patients with the same qualifying condition as the qualified patient. 3. A statement signed by the qualified physician documenting the qualified physician’s opinion that the benefits of smoking marijuana for medical use outweigh the risks for the qualified patient. (d) A qualified physician may not issue a physician certification for marijuana in a form for smoking to a patient under 18 years of age unless the patient is diagnosed with a terminal condition, the qualified physician determines that smoking is the most effective route of administration for the patient, and a second physician who is a board-certified pediatrician concurs with such determination.

(f) A qualified physician may not issue a physician certification for more than three 70-day supply limits of marijuana or more than six 35-day supply limits of marijuana in a form for smoking. The department shall quantify by rule a daily dose amount with equivalent dose amounts for each allowable form of marijuana dispensed by a medical marijuana treatment center. The department shall use the daily dose amount to calculate a 70-day supply. 1. A qualified physician may request an exception to the daily dose amount limit, the 35-day supply limit of marijuana in a form for smoking, and the 4-ounce possession limit of marijuana in a form for smoking established in paragraph (14)(a).

(h) An active order for low-THC cannabis or medical cannabis issued pursuant to former s. 381.986, Florida Statutes 2016, and registered with the compassionate use registry before June 23, 2017, is deemed a physician certification, and all patients possessing such orders are deemed qualified patients until the department begins issuing medical marijuana use registry identification cards. (i) The department shall monitor physician registration in the medical marijuana use registry and the issuance of physician certifications for practices that could facilitate unlawful diversion or misuse of marijuana or a marijuana delivery device and shall take disciplinary action as appropriate. The department may suspend the registration of a qualified physician in the medical marijuana use registry for a period of up to 2 years if the qualified physician: 1. Fails to comply with this section; or 2. Provides, advertises, or markets telehealth services before July 1, 2023. (j) The Board of Medicine and the Board of Osteopathic Medicine shall jointly create a physician certification pattern review panel that shall review all physician certifications submitted to the medical marijuana use registry. The panel shall track and report the number of physician certifications and the qualifying medical conditions, dosage, supply amount, and form of marijuana certified. The panel shall report the data both by individual qualified physician and in the aggregate, by county, and statewide. The physician certification pattern review panel shall, beginning January 1, 2018, submit an annual report of its findings and recommendations to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.

An infrastructure reasonably located to dispense marijuana to registered qualified patients statewide or regionally as determined by the department. 7. The financial ability to maintain operations for the duration of the 2-year approval cycle, including the provision of certified financial statements to the department. a. Upon approval, the applicant must post a $5 million performance bond issued by an authorized surety insurance company rated in one of the three highest rating categories by a nationally recognized rating service. However, a medical marijuana treatment center serving at least 1,000 qualified patients is only required to maintain a $2 million performance bond. b. In lieu of the performance bond required under sub-subparagraph a., the applicant may provide an irrevocable letter of credit payable to the department or provide cash to the department. If provided with cash under this sub-subparagraph, the department must deposit the cash in the Grants and Donations Trust Fund within the Department of Health, subject to the same conditions as the bond regarding requirements for the applicant to forfeit ownership of the funds. If the funds deposited under this sub-subparagraph generate interest, the amount of that interest must be used by the department for the administration of this section. 8. That all owners and managers have passed a background screening pursuant to subsection (9). As used in this subparagraph, the term: a. “Manager” means any person with the authority to exercise or contribute to the operational control, direction, or management of an applicant or a medical marijuana treatment center or who has authority to supervise any employee of an applicant or a medical marijuana treatment center. The term includes an individual with the power or authority to direct or influence the direction or operation of an applicant or a medical marijuana treatment center through board membership, an agreement, or a contract. b. “Owner” means any person who owns or controls a 5 percent or greater share of interests of the applicant or a medical marijuana treatment center which include beneficial or voting rights to interests.

Representation of minority persons and veterans in the medical marijuana treatment center’s workforce; b. Efforts to recruit minority persons and veterans for employment; and c. A record of contracts for services with minority business enterprises and veteran business enterprises. (c) A medical marijuana treatment center may not make a wholesale purchase of marijuana from, or a distribution of marijuana to, another medical marijuana treatment center, unless the medical marijuana treatment center seeking to make a wholesale purchase of marijuana submits proof of harvest failure to the department. (d) The department shall establish, maintain, and control a computer software tracking system that traces marijuana from seed to sale and allows real-time, 24-hour access by the department to data from all medical marijuana treatment centers and marijuana testing laboratories. The tracking system must allow for integration of other seed-to-sale systems and, at a minimum, include notification of when marijuana seeds are planted, when marijuana plants are harvested and destroyed, and when marijuana is transported, sold, stolen, diverted, or lost. Each medical marijuana treatment center shall use the seed-to-sale tracking system established by the department or integrate its own seed-to-sale tracking system with the seed-to-sale tracking system established by the department. Each medical marijuana treatment center may use its own seed-to-sale system until the department establishes a seed-to-sale tracking system. The department may contract with a vendor to establish the seed-to-sale tracking system. The vendor selected by the department may not have a contractual relationship with the department to perform any services pursuant to this section other than the seed-to-sale tracking system. The vendor may not have a direct or indirect financial interest in a medical marijuana treatment center or a marijuana testing laboratory. 2 (e) A licensed medical marijuana treatment center shall cultivate, process, transport, and dispense marijuana for medical use. A licensed medical marijuana treatment center may not contract for services directly related to the cultivation, processing, and dispensing of marijuana or marijuana delivery devices, except that a medical marijuana treatment center licensed pursuant to subparagraph (a)1. may contract with a single entity for the cultivation, processing, transporting, and dispensing of marijuana and marijuana delivery devices. A licensed medical marijuana treatment center shall, at all times, maintain compliance with the criteria demonstrated and representations made in the initial application and the criteria established in this subsection. Upon request, the department may grant a medical marijuana treatment center a variance from the representations made in the initial application. Consideration of such a request must be based upon the individual facts and circumstances surrounding the request. A variance may not be granted unless the requesting medical marijuana treatment center can demonstrate to the department that it has a proposed alternative to the specific representation made in its application which fulfills the same or a similar purpose as the specific representation in a way that the department can reasonably determine will not be a lower standard than the specific representation in the application. A variance may not be granted from the requirements in subparagraph 2. and subparagraphs (b)1. and 2. 1. A licensed medical marijuana treatment center may transfer ownership to an individual or entity who meets the requirements of this section.

(13) UNLICENSED ACTIVITY.— (a) If the department has probable cause to believe that a person or entity that is not registered or licensed with the department has violated this section, s. 381.988, or any rule adopted pursuant to this section, the department may issue and deliver to such person or entity a notice to cease and desist from such violation. The department also may issue and deliver a notice to cease and desist to any person or entity who aids and abets such unlicensed activity. The issuance of a notice to cease and desist does not constitute agency action for which a hearing under s. 120.569 or s. 120.57 may be sought. For the purpose of enforcing a cease and desist order, the department may file a proceeding in the name of the state seeking issuance of an injunction or a writ of mandamus against any person or entity who violates any provisions of such order. (b) In addition to the remedies under paragraph (a), the department may impose by citation an administrative penalty not to exceed $5,000 per incident. The citation shall be issued to the subject and must contain the subject’s name and any other information the department determines to be necessary to identify the subject, a brief factual statement, the sections of the law allegedly violated, and the penalty imposed. If the subject does not dispute the matter in the citation with the department within 30 days after the citation is served, the citation shall become a final order of the department. The department may adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 to implement this section. Each day that the unlicensed activity continues after issuance of a notice to cease and desist constitutes a separate violation. The department shall be entitled to recover the costs of investigation and prosecution in addition to the fine levied pursuant to the citation. Service of a citation may be made by personal service or by mail to the subject at the subject’s last known address or place of practice. If the department is required to seek enforcement of the cease and desist or agency order, it shall be entitled to collect attorney fees and costs. (c) In addition to or in lieu of any other administrative remedy, the department may seek the imposition of a civil penalty through the circuit court for any violation for which the department may issue a notice to cease and desist.
