(2) A mortgage that is an open-end mortgage as provided in the loan agreement may be canceled upon written notice from the borrower of the intent to close the mortgage.

      "text": "701.04 Cancellation of mortgages, liens, and judgments.— (1)(a) Within 10 days after receipt of the written request of a mortgagor, a record title owner of the property, a fiduciary or trustee lawfully acting on behalf of a record title owner, or any other person lawfully authorized to act on behalf of a mortgagor or record title owner of the property, the mortgagee or mortgage servicer shall send or cause to be sent an estoppel letter setting forth the unpaid balance of the loan secured by the mortgage. If the written request is made by a person other than the mortgagor, the request must include a copy of the instrument showing such person’s title in the property or other lawful authorization, and the mortgagee or mortgage servicer must notify the mortgagor of the request. (b) The estoppel letter must at a minimum include: 1. The unpaid balance of the loan secured by the mortgage as of the date specified in the estoppel letter, including an itemization of the principal, interest, and any other charges comprising the unpaid balance; and 2. Interest accruing on a per-day basis for the unpaid balance from and after the date specified in the estoppel letter, if applicable. (c)1. Except for mortgages for which a notice of lis pendens in a foreclosure action or a suggestion of bankruptcy has been properly filed and recorded, the mortgagee or mortgage servicer may not qualify, reserve the right to change, or condition or disclaim the reliance of others on the information provided in an estoppel letter under paragraph (b), and any attempt to do so is void and unenforceable. However, if the mortgagee or mortgage servicer determines that any of the information provided in the estoppel letter under paragraph (b) was inaccurate, the mortgagee or mortgage servicer may send a corrected estoppel letter to the person who requested the estoppel letter in the same manner as used to respond to the original written request. If the original written request is made by a person other than the mortgagor, the mortgagee or mortgage servicer must also provide a copy of any corrected estoppel letter to the mortgagor. 2. If the person who requested the original estoppel letter under paragraph (a) receives a corrected estoppel letter by 3 p.m. in such person’s time zone at least 1 business day before a payment is issued in reliance on the previous estoppel letter, the corrected estoppel letter supersedes all prior estoppel letters. 3. If any of the information provided in the estoppel letter under paragraph (b) was inaccurate, but the person who requested the estoppel letter did not timely receive a corrected estoppel letter as provided in subparagraph 2., the mortgagee or mortgage servicer may not deny the accuracy of such information as against any person who relied on it. This subparagraph does not affect the right of a mortgagee to recover any sum that it did not include in an estoppel letter from any person liable for payment of the loan or other obligations secured by the mortgage, nor does it limit any claim or defense to recovery which such person may have at law or in equity. (d) The mortgagee or mortgage servicer acting in accordance with a request in substantial compliance with this subsection is expressly discharged from any obligation or liability to any person on account of the release of the requested information, other than the obligation to comply with the terms of the estoppel letter. (e) If a payment is received at the location and in the manner specified by the mortgagee or mortgage servicer, the mortgagee or mortgage servicer must accept and may not return any payment received in reliance on an estoppel letter and must promptly apply such payment to the unpaid balance of the loan properly due under or secured by the mortgage. (f)1. A written request for an estoppel letter under paragraph (a) must be sent to the mortgagee or mortgage servicer by first-class mail, postage prepaid; by common carrier delivery service; or by e-mail, facsimile, or other electronic means at the address made available by the mortgagee or mortgage servicer for such purpose or through an automated system provided by the mortgagee or mortgage servicer for requesting an estoppel letter. The written request is considered received by the mortgagee or mortgage servicer: a. Five business days after the request sent by first-class mail is deposited with the United States Postal Service; b. The day the request is delivered by a common carrier delivery service; or c. The day the request is sent by e-mail, facsimile, or other electronic means or through an automated system provided by the mortgagee or mortgage servicer for requesting an estoppel letter. If any of the days in sub-subparagraph a., sub-subparagraph b., or sub-subparagraph c. fall on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday specified in s. 110.117(1) or the laws of the United States, the request for an estoppel letter is considered timely received by the mortgagee or mortgage servicer on the next business day. 2. The mortgagee or mortgage servicer must send an estoppel letter by first-class mail, postage prepaid; by common carrier delivery service; or by e-mail, facsimile, or other electronic means, as directed in the written request, or through an automated system provided by the mortgagee or mortgage servicer for this purpose. However, the mortgagee or mortgage servicer is not required to pay for a common carrier delivery service. If the 10-day period after a written request is received by the mortgagee or mortgage servicer ends on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday specified in s. 110.117(1) or the laws of the United States, the estoppel letter is considered timely if it is sent by the close of business on the next business day. (g) Notwithstanding s. 655.059, a mortgagee or mortgage servicer may provide the financial information required under this subsection to a person authorized under this subsection to request the financial information. (2)(a) Within 60 days after the unpaid balance of a loan secured by a mortgage has been fully paid or paid pursuant to an estoppel letter under subsection (1), whichever is earlier, the mortgagee or mortgage servicer shall execute in writing an instrument acknowledging release of the mortgage; have the instrument acknowledged, or proven, and send it or cause it to be sent for recording in the official records of the proper county; and send or cause to be sent the recorded release to the mortgagor or record title owner of the property. The prevailing party in a civil action brought against the mortgagee or mortgage servicer to enforce the requirements of this paragraph is entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs. (b) The recorded release of the mortgage does not relieve the mortgagor, or the mortgagor’s successors or assigns, from any personal liability on the loan or other obligations previously secured by the mortgage. (3) Within 60 days after the unpaid balance on a lien or judgment has been fully paid to the person entitled to the payment thereof, the creditor or assignee, or the attorney of record in the case of a judgment, to whom the payment was made shall execute in writing an instrument acknowledging satisfaction of the lien or judgment; have the instrument acknowledged, or proven, and send it or cause it to be sent for recording in the official records of the proper county; and send or cause to be sent the recorded satisfaction to the person who has made the full payment. The prevailing party in a civil action brought against the creditor or assignee, or the attorney of record in the case of a judgment, to enforce the requirements of this subsection is entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs. (4) When a writ of execution has been issued, docketed, and indexed with a sheriff and the judgment upon which it was issued has been fully paid, it is the responsibility of the person receiving payment to request, in writing, addressed to the sheriff, return of the writ of execution as fully satisfied.

      "heading": "Title insurer; mortgage release certificate.",
      "text": "701.041 Title insurer; mortgage release certificate.— (1) DEFINITIONS.—For purposes of this section: (a) “Estoppel letter” means a statement containing, at a minimum, the information required in s. 701.04(1)(b). (b) “Mortgagee” means: 1. The grantee of a mortgage; or 2. If a mortgage has been assigned of record, the last person to whom the mortgage has been assigned of record. (c) “Mortgage servicer” means the last person to whom a mortgagor or the mortgagor’s successor in interest has been instructed by a mortgagee to send payments on a loan secured by a mortgage. A person transmitting an estoppel letter is the mortgage servicer for the mortgage described in the estoppel letter. (d) “Mortgagor” means the grantor of a mortgage. (e) “Record” means to record with the clerk of the circuit court or the comptroller in the county or counties in which the real property securing the mortgage is located. (f) “Title insurer” means a corporation or other business entity authorized and licensed to transact the business of insuring titles to interests in real property in this state under chapter 624. (2) CERTIFICATE OF RELEASE.—An officer or duly appointed agent of a title insurer may, on behalf of a mortgagor or a person who acquired from the mortgagor title to all or a part of the property described in a mortgage, execute a certificate of release that complies with the requirements of this section and record the certificate of release in the real property records of each county in which the mortgage is recorded if a satisfaction or release of the mortgage has not been executed and recorded after the date payment in full of the loan properly due under or secured by the mortgage was made in accordance with an estoppel letter furnished by the mortgagee or mortgage servicer. (3) CONTENTS.—A certificate of release executed under this section must contain: (a) The name of the mortgagor, the name of the original mortgagee, and, if applicable, the mortgage servicer; the date of the mortgage; the date of recording; and the volume and page or document number in the real property records in which the mortgage is recorded, together with similar information for the last recorded assignment of the mortgage. (b) A statement that the mortgage being released is eligible for release under this section. (c) The name of the title insurer filing the certificate of release, a statement that the person executing the certificate of release is an officer or a duly appointed agent of the title insurer, a statement that the title insurer is authorized and licensed to transact the business of insuring titles to interests in real property in this state under chapter 624 or chapter 626, and, if executed by a duly appointed agent, shall further provide the recording information of the appointment of such agent as required by subsection (4). (d) A statement that the certificate of release is made on behalf of the mortgagor or a person who acquired title from the mortgagor to all or a part of the property described in the mortgage. (e) A statement that the mortgagee or mortgage servicer provided an estoppel letter which was used to make payment in full of the unpaid balance of the loan secured by the mortgage. (f) A statement that payment in full of the unpaid balance of the loan secured by the mortgage was made in accordance with the estoppel letter and that a copy of the certificate of release was sent to the mortgagee or mortgage servicer that provided the estoppel letter. (4) EXECUTION.— (a) A certificate of release authorized by subsection (2) must be duly executed, sworn to or affirmed under penalty of perjury before a notary public, and recorded and may be executed by an officer of a title insurer or by a duly appointed agent of a title insurer. Such delegation to an agent by a title insurer shall not relieve the title insurer of any liability for damages caused by the agent for the execution or recordation of a certificate of release. (b) The appointment of an agent must be duly executed, acknowledged, and recorded by an officer of a title insurer and must state: 1. The title insurer as the principal. 2. The identity of the person, partnership, or corporation authorized to act as agent to execute and record certificates of release provided for in this section on behalf of the title insurer. 3. That the agent has the full authority to execute and record certificates of release provided for in this section on behalf of the title insurer. (c) A separate appointment of agent shall not be necessary for each certificate of release provided that at least one such appointment is recorded in the county in which the mortgaged property is located. The appointment of agent must be rerecorded where necessary to establish authority of the agent, but such authority shall continue until a revocation of appointment is recorded in the office of the county recorder in which the appointment of agent was recorded. (d) After recordation of a title insurer’s revocation of appointment in the office of the county recorder in which the appointment was recorded, the agent whose appointment is revoked in such county shall have no further authority to execute or record certificates of release as provided in this section on behalf of that title insurer with respect to any mortgages recorded in that county, and no such certificate of release thereafter executed or recorded by that agent on behalf of that title insurer shall be effective to release any mortgage recorded in that county. (5) EFFECT.—For purposes of releasing the mortgage, a certificate of release containing the information and statements provided for in subsection (3) and executed as provided in subsection (4) is entitled to be recorded with the county recorder and operates as a release of the mortgage described in the certificate of release. The county recorder shall rely upon the certificate to release the mortgage. Recording of a certificate of release by a title insurer or its agent shall not relieve the mortgagor, or the mortgagor’s successors or assigns, from any personal liability on the loan or other obligations secured by the mortgage. A certificate of release recorded pursuant to this section fulfills any other obligation of the mortgagee or mortgage servicer to file a satisfaction or release of the mortgage. (6) LIABILITY OF TITLE INSURER AND TITLE INSURANCE AGENT.— (a) In addition to any other remedy provided by law, a title insurer and title insurance agent recording a certificate of release under this section shall be liable to the holder of the obligation secured by the mortgage for actual damage sustained due to the recording of the certificate of release. Reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees shall be awarded to the prevailing party. (b) The title insurer named in a certificate of release filed by a duly appointed agent shall be liable pursuant to this subsection without regard to whether the title insurer authorized the specific certificate of release recorded by the agent. (c) The title insurer and title insurance agent shall have no liability under this subsection if the title insurer or title insurance agent shows that payment in full of the unpaid balance of the loan secured by the mortgage was made in accordance with the estoppel letter furnished by the mortgagee or the mortgage servicer. (d) Liability of a title insurer pursuant to this section shall be considered to be a title insurance claim on real property in this state pursuant to s. 627.7865. (7) RECORDING.—If a mortgage is recorded in more than one county and a certificate of release is recorded in one of such counties, a certified copy of the certificate of release may be recorded in another of such counties with the same effect as the original. In all cases, the certificate of release shall be entered and indexed as satisfactions of mortgage are entered and indexed. (8) APPLICATION.—This section applies only to a mortgage that secures a loan in the principal amount of $500,000 or less as determined from the recorded mortgage and contains no disclosure of record that the mortgage secures an open-end or revolving line of credit agreement.
