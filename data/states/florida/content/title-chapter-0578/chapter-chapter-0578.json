As such, this chapter is intended as comprehensive and exclusive and occupies the whole field of regulation of seed. (2) The authority to regulate seed or matters relating to seed in this state is preempted to the state. A local government or political subdivision of the state may not enact or enforce an ordinance that regulates seed, including the power to assess any penalties provided for violation of this chapter.

The application must be filed with the department by using a form prescribed by the department or by using the department’s website and shall be accompanied by an annual registration fee for each such place of business based on the gross receipts from the sale of such seed for the last preceding license year as follows: (a)1. Receipts of less than $500, a fee of $10. 2. Receipts of $500 or more but less than $1,000, a fee of $25. 3. Receipts of $1,000 or more but less than $2,500, a fee of $100. 4.

(b) For places of business not previously in operation, the fee shall be based on anticipated receipts for the first license year. (2) A receipt from the department of the registration and payment of the fee shall constitute a sufficient permit for the dealer to engage in or continue in the business of selling, distributing for sale, offering or exposing for sale, handling for sale, or soliciting orders for the purchase of any agricultural, vegetable, flower, tree, or shrub seed within the state. However, the department has authority to suspend or revoke any permit for the violation of any provision of this law or of any rule adopted under authority hereof. The registration shall expire on June 30 of the next calendar year and shall be renewed on July 1 of each year. If any person subject to the requirements of this section fails to comply, the department may issue a stop-sale notice or order which shall prohibit the person from selling or causing to be sold any agricultural, vegetable, flower, tree, or shrub seed until the requirements of this section are met. (3) Every person selling, distributing for sale, offering for sale, exposing for sale, handling for sale, or soliciting orders for the purchase of any agricultural, vegetable, flower, tree, or shrub seed in the state other than as provided in subsection (4), shall be subject to the requirements of this section. (4) This chapter does not apply to farmers who sell only uncleaned, unprocessed, unpackaged, and unlabeled seed, but shall apply to farmers who sell cleaned, processed, packaged, and labeled seed in amounts in excess of $10,000 in any one year. (5) When packet seed is sold, offered for sale, or exposed for sale, the company that packs seed for retail sale must register and pay fees as provided under subsection (1).

Provided, that such carrier is not engaged in processing or merchandising seed subject to the provisions of this law. (2) The provisions of ss. 578.09 and 578.13 do not apply to: (a) Seed or grain not intended for sowing or planting purposes. (b) Seed stored in, consigned to, or being transported to seed cleaning or processing establishments for cleaning or processing only. Any labeling or other representation which may be made with respect to the unclean seed is subject to this law. (c) Seed under development or maintained exclusively for research purposes. (3) If seeds cannot be identified by examination thereof, a person is not subject to the criminal penalties of this chapter for having sold or offered for sale seeds subject to this chapter which were incorrectly labeled or represented as to kind, species, and, if appropriate, subspecies, variety, type, or origin, elevation, and, if required, year of collection unless he or she has failed to obtain an invoice, genuine grower’s or tree seed collector’s declaration, or other labeling information and to take such other precautions as may be reasonable to ensure the identity of the seeds to be as stated by the grower. A genuine grower’s declaration of variety must affirm that the grower holds records of proof of identity concerning parent seed, such as invoice and labels. (4) When seeds are sold from a duly labeled container and taken therefrom in the presence of the purchaser, the container in which such seeds are delivered to the purchaser will not be required to have a label or tag unless so requested by the purchaser.
