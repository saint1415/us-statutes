A title loan lender may not own or operate more than one title loan office unless the lender obtains a separate title loan lender license for each title loan office. (2) A person applying for licensure as a title loan lender shall file with the office an application, the bond required by s. 537.005(3), a nonrefundable application fee of $1,200, a nonrefundable investigation fee of $200, and a complete set of fingerprints taken by an authorized law enforcement officer.

(3) If the office determines that an application should be approved, the office shall issue a license for a period not to exceed 2 years. (4) A license shall be renewed biennially by filing a renewal form and a nonrefundable renewal fee of $1,200. A license that is not renewed by the end of the biennial period shall automatically revert to inactive status. An inactive license may be reactivated within 6 months after becoming inactive by filing a reactivation form, payment of the nonrefundable $1,200 renewal fee, and payment of a nonrefundable reactivation fee of $600. A license that is not reactivated within 6 months after becoming inactive may not be reactivated and shall automatically expire. The commission shall establish by rule the procedures for renewal and reactivation of a license and shall adopt a renewal form and a reactivation form. (5) Each license must be conspicuously displayed at the title loan office. When a licensee wishes to move a title loan office to another location, the licensee shall provide prior written notice to the office. (6) A license issued pursuant to this act is not transferable or assignable. (7) Each licensee shall designate and maintain a registered agent in this state for service of process. (8) Whenever a person or a group of persons, directly or indirectly or acting by or through one or more persons, proposes to purchase or acquire a 50 percent or more interest in a licensee, such person or group shall submit an initial application for licensure under this act prior to such purchase or acquisition. (9) The commission may adopt rules to allow for electronic filing of applications, fees, and forms required by this act. (10) All moneys collected by the office under this act shall be deposited into the Regulatory Trust Fund of the office. History.—s. 4, ch. 2000-138; s. 641, ch. 2003-261.

If the applicant is other than a natural person, the application shall contain the name and the residence and business address of each ultimate equitable owner of 10 percent or more of such entity and each director, general partner, and executive officer of such entity. (b) State whether any individual identified in paragraph (a) has, within the last 10 years, pleaded nolo contendere to, or has been convicted or found guilty of, a felony, regardless of whether adjudication was withheld. (c) Identify the county and municipality with the street and number or location where the business is to be conducted. (d) Contain additional information as the commission determines by rule to be necessary to ensure compliance with this act. (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), the application need not state the full name and address of each officer, director, and shareholder if the applicant is owned directly or beneficially by a person who as an issuer has a class of securities registered pursuant to s. 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or, pursuant to s. 13 or s. 15(d) of such act, is an issuer of securities which is required to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, if the person files with the office any information, documents, and reports required by such act to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (3) An applicant for licensure shall file with the office a bond, in the amount of $100,000 for each license, with a surety company qualified to do business in this state. However, in no event shall the aggregate amount of the bond required for a single title loan lender exceed $1 million. In lieu of the bond, the applicant may establish a certificate of deposit or an irrevocable letter of credit in a financial institution, as defined in s. 655.005, in the amount of the bond. The original bond, certificate of deposit, or letter of credit shall be filed with the office, and the office shall be the beneficiary to that document. The bond, certificate of deposit, or letter of credit shall be in favor of the office for the use and benefit of any consumer who is injured pursuant to a title loan transaction by the fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract, financial failure, or violation of any provision of this act by the title loan lender. Such liability may be enforced either by proceeding in an administrative action or by filing a judicial suit at law in a court of competent jurisdiction. However, in such court suit, the bond, certificate of deposit, or letter of credit posted with the office shall not be amenable or subject to any judgment or other legal process issuing out of or from such court in connection with such lawsuit, but such bond, certificate of deposit, or letter of credit shall be amenable to and enforceable only by and through administrative proceedings before the office. It is the intent of the Legislature that such bond, certificate of deposit, or letter of credit shall be applicable and liable only for the payment of claims duly adjudicated by order of the office. The bond, certificate of deposit, or letter of credit shall be payable on a pro rata basis as determined by the office, but the aggregate amount may not exceed the amount of the bond, certificate of deposit, or letter of credit. (4) The office shall approve an application and issue a license if the office determines that the applicant satisfies the requirements of this act. History.—s. 5, ch. 2000-138; s. 642, ch. 2003-261.

The title loan agreement shall include the following information: (a) The make, model, and year of the titled personal property to which the loan property relates. (b) The vehicle identification number, or other comparable identification number, along with the license plate number, if applicable, of the titled personal property to which the loan property relates. (c) The name, residential address, date of birth, physical description, and social security number of the borrower. (d) The date the title loan agreement is executed by the title loan lender and the borrower. (e) The identification number and the type of identification, including the issuing agency, accepted from the borrower. (f) The amount of money advanced, designated as the “amount financed.” (g) The maturity date of the title loan agreement, which shall be 30 days after the date the title loan agreement is executed by the title loan lender and the borrower. (h) The total title loan interest payable on the maturity date, designated as the “finance charge.” (i) The amount financed plus finance charge, which must be paid to reclaim the loan property on the maturity date, designated as the “total amount of all payments.” (j) The interest rate, computed in accordance with the regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to the federal Truth in Lending Act, designated as the “annual percentage rate.” (2) The following information shall also be printed on all title loan agreements: (a) The name and physical address of the title loan office. (b) The name and address of the Department of Financial Services as well as a telephone number to which consumers may address complaints. (c) The following statement in not less than 12-point type that: 1. If the borrower fails to repay the full amount of the title loan on or before the end of the maturity date or any extension of the maturity date and fails to make a payment on the title loan within 30 days after the end of the maturity date or any extension of the maturity date, whichever is later, the title loan lender may take possession of the borrower’s motor vehicle and sell the vehicle in the manner provided by law. If the vehicle is sold, the borrower is entitled to any proceeds of the sale in excess of the amount owed on the title loan and the reasonable expenses of repossession and sale. 2. If the title loan agreement is lost, destroyed, or stolen, the borrower should immediately so advise the issuing title loan lender in writing. (d) The statement that “The borrower represents and warrants that the titled personal property to which the loan property relates is not stolen and has no liens or encumbrances against it, the borrower has the right to enter into this transaction, and the borrower will not apply for a duplicate certificate of title while the title loan agreement is in effect.” (e) A blank line for the signature of the borrower and the title loan lender or the lender’s agent. All owners of the titled personal property must sign the title loan agreement. (3) At the time of the transaction, the title loan lender shall deliver to the borrower an exact copy of the executed title loan agreement. (4) Upon execution of a title loan agreement, the title loan lender may take possession of the loan property and retain possession of such property until such property is redeemed. The borrower shall have the exclusive right to redeem the loan property by repaying all amounts legally due under the agreement. When the loan property is redeemed, the lender shall immediately return the loan property and commence action to release any security interest in the titled personal property. During the term of the agreement or any extension of the agreement, a title loan lender may retain physical possession of the loan property only. A title loan lender shall not require a borrower to provide any additional security or guaranty as a condition to entering into a title loan transaction.

      "text": "537.011 Title loan charges.— (1) A title loan lender may charge a maximum interest rate of 30 percent per annum computed on the first $2,000 of the principal amount, 24 percent per annum on that part of the principal amount exceeding $2,000 and not exceeding $3,000, and 18 percent per annum on that part of the principal amount exceeding $3,000. The original principal amount is the same amount as the amount financed, as defined by the federal Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In determining compliance with the statutory maximum interest, the computations must be simple interest and not add-on interest or any other computations. When two or more interest rates are to be applied to the principal amount, the lender may charge interest at that single annual percentage rate which, if applied according to the actuarial method to each of the scheduled periodic balances of principal, would produce at maturity the same total amount of interest as would result from the application of the two or more rates otherwise permitted, based upon the assumption that all payments are made as agreed. (2) The annual percentage rate that may be charged for a title loan may equal, but not exceed, the annual percentage rate that must be computed and disclosed as required by the federal Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The maximum annual percentage rate of interest that may be charged is 12 times the maximum monthly rate, and the maximum monthly rate must be computed on the basis of one-twelfth of the annual rate for each full month. The commission shall establish by rule the rate for each day in a fraction of a month when the period for which the charge is computed is more or less than 1 month. (3) A title loan agreement may be extended for one or more 30-day periods by mutual consent of the title loan lender and the borrower. Each extension of a title loan agreement shall be executed in a separate extension agreement, each of which shall comply with the requirements for executing a title loan agreement as provided in this act. The interest rate charged in any title loan extension agreement shall not exceed the interest rate charged in the related title loan agreement. A title loan lender may not capitalize in any title loan extension agreement any unpaid interest due on the related title loan agreement or any subsequent extensions to that title loan agreement. (4) Any interest contracted for or received, directly or indirectly, by a title loan lender, or an agent of the title loan lender, in excess of the amounts authorized under this chapter is prohibited and may not be collected by the title loan lender or an agent of the title loan lender. (a) If such excess interest resulted from a bona fide error by the title loan lender, or an agent of the title loan lender, the title loan agreement shall be voidable and the lender shall refund the excess interest to the borrower within 20 days after discovery by the lender or borrower of the bona fide error, whichever occurs first. (b) If such excess interest resulted from an act by the title loan lender, or an agent of the title loan lender, to circumvent the maximum title loan interest allowed by this act, the title loan agreement is void. The lender shall refund to the borrower any interest paid on the title loan and return to the borrower the loan property. The title loan lender forfeits the lender’s right to collect any principal owed by the borrower on the title loan. (c) The office may order a title loan lender, or an agent of the title loan lender, to comply with the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b). (5) Any interest contracted for or received, directly or indirectly, by a title loan lender, or an agent of the title loan lender, in excess of the amount allowed by this act constitutes a violation of chapter 687, governing interest and usury, and the penalties of that chapter apply.

However, if the title loan lender determines that the person is not the borrower, the title loan lender is not required to allow the redemption of the loan property by such person. The person reclaiming the loan property must sign the borrower’s copy of the title loan agreement which the title loan lender may retain to evidence such person’s receipt of the loan property. A person reclaiming the loan property who is not the borrower must show identification to the title loan lender, together with notarized written authorization from the borrower, and the title loan lender shall record that person’s name and address on the title loan agreement retained by the title loan lender. In such case, the person reclaiming the borrower’s copy of the title loan agreement shall be provided a copy of such signed form as evidence of such agreement. (2) If the borrower’s copy of the title loan agreement is lost, destroyed, or stolen, the borrower must notify the title loan lender, in writing by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or in person evidenced by a signed receipt, and receipt of such notice shall invalidate such title loan agreement if the loan property has not previously been reclaimed. Before delivering the loan property or issuing a new title loan agreement, the title loan lender shall require the borrower to make a written statement of the loss, destruction, or theft of the borrower’s copy of the title loan agreement.

For such purposes, the office may examine the books, accounts, records, and other documents or matters of any licensee or other person. The office may compel the production of all relevant books, records, and other documents and materials relative to an examination or investigation. Examinations shall not be made more often than once during any 12-month period unless the office has reason to believe the licensee is not complying with the provisions of this act. (2) The office shall conduct all examinations at a convenient location in this state unless the office determines that it is more effective or cost-efficient to perform an examination at the licensee’s out-of-state location. For an examination performed at the licensee’s out-of-state location, the licensee shall pay the travel expense and per diem subsistence at the rate provided by law for up to thirty 8-hour days per year for each office examiner who participates in such an examination. However, if the examination involves or reveals possible fraudulent conduct by the licensee, the licensee shall pay the travel expenses and per diem subsistence provided by law, without limitation, for each participating examiner. (3) Any person having reason to believe that any provision of this act has been violated may file with the Department of Financial Services or the office a written complaint setting forth the details of such alleged violation, and the office may investigate such complaint.
