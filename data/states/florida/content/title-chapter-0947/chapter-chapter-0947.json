(2) Objective parole criteria will be designed to give primary weight to the seriousness of the offender’s present criminal offense and the offender’s past criminal record. In considering the risk of recidivism, practice has shown that the best predictor is prior record. (3) The chair shall be the agency head. While the commission is responsible for making decisions on the granting and revoking of parole, the chair shall establish, execute, and be held accountable for all administrative policy decisions. The routine administrative decisions are the full responsibility of the chair. (4) Hearing examiners are assigned on the basis of caseload needs as determined by the chair. (5) It is the intent of the Legislature that the decision to parole an inmate from the incarceration portion of the inmate’s sentence is an act of grace of the state and shall not be considered a right.

The chair is authorized to provide or disseminate information relative to parole by means of documents, seminars, programs, or otherwise as he or she determines necessary. The chair shall establish, execute, and be held accountable for all administrative policy decisions. However, decisions to grant or revoke parole shall be made in accordance with ss. 947.172, 947.174, and 947.23. The commissioners shall be directly accountable to the chair in the execution of their duties as commissioners, and the chair has authority to recommend to the Governor suspension of a commissioner who fails to perform the duties provided for by statute.

(b) Involve the offender in developing her or his individual rehabilitation program for the period of incarceration and parole with the department and the commission. (c) Require establishment of criteria to be used in determining which offenders are eligible for this program. (d) Encourage, through department and commission action, youthful offenders who are housed within institutions of the department to participate in the program. However, no offender shall be eligible to participate in this program who was sentenced as an habitual felony offender pursuant to s. 775.084 or who was convicted of a capital or life felony as provided by s. 775.081, s. 775.082, or s. 775.083. Offenders meeting eligibility criteria may be offered the opportunity to participate in the program which will include a parole date. (3) MUTUAL PARTICIPATION PROGRAM; DEVELOPMENT; CRITERIA; DEPARTMENT AND COMMISSION RULES.— (a) The department and the commission shall jointly develop a mutual participation program which sets forth for each eligible offender the terms of her or his institutional confinement, a parole date, and terms of parole supervision and release, provided such offender meets the criteria set forth in this act and any additional criteria established by the department and the commission. 1. The department and the commission, as a portion of the mutual participation program, shall require that each eligible offender satisfactorily work at a job within the institution or as a part of a correctional industries program or satisfactorily participate in a vocational training or educational program offered by the department. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to exclude eligible offenders from meeting both the work requirements and training and educational requirements when deemed appropriate by the department and commission. 2. Additional criteria shall be established and required by the commission and the department for participation in the program, including, but not limited to, vocational counseling and work-release programs; however, criteria for satisfactory participation in the program shall not include academic classroom instruction at the college level. 3. A panel of at least two members of the commission shall establish a parole date for each eligible offender, based on the satisfactory completion of the program. In no case shall such date fall after the date which would have been established under s. 947.172. (b) The commission shall promulgate rules on criteria used to establish parole dates, conditions precedent to the granting of parole, terms of parole, and release from parole. The department and the commission shall establish such criteria relating to parole supervision, which criteria shall include, but not be limited to, the requirements for participation in vocational or counseling programs available in the community, stipulations related to employment, and other criteria considered necessary for the successful reintegration of the offender into society. (c) Periodic written reports of the offender’s progress in the program shall be submitted to the department and the commission.

Effective July 1, 1994, and applicable for offenses committed on or after that date, the commission may require, as a condition of conditional release, that the releasee make payment of the debt due and owing to a county or municipal detention facility under s. 951.032 for medical care, treatment, hospitalization, or transportation received by the releasee while in that detention facility. The commission, in determining whether to order such repayment and the amount of such repayment, shall consider the amount of the debt, whether there was any fault of the institution for the medical expenses incurred, the financial resources of the releasee, the present and potential future financial needs and earning ability of the releasee, and dependents, and other appropriate factors. If any inmate placed on conditional release supervision is also subject to probation or community control, resulting from a probationary or community control split sentence within the overall term of sentences, the Department of Corrections shall supervise such person according to the conditions imposed by the court and the commission shall defer to such supervision. If the court revokes probation or community control and resentences the offender to a term of incarceration, such revocation also constitutes a sufficient basis for the revocation of the conditional release supervision on any nonprobationary or noncommunity control sentence without further hearing by the commission. If any such supervision on any nonprobationary or noncommunity control sentence is revoked, such revocation may result in a forfeiture of all gain-time, and the commission may revoke the resulting deferred conditional release supervision or take other action it considers appropriate. If the term of conditional release supervision exceeds that of the probation or community control, then, upon expiration of the probation or community control, authority for the supervision shall revert to the commission and the supervision shall be subject to the conditions imposed by the commission. A panel of no fewer than two commissioners shall establish the terms and conditions of any such release. If the offense was a controlled substance violation, the conditions shall include a requirement that the offender submit to random substance abuse testing intermittently throughout the term of conditional release supervision, upon the direction of the correctional probation officer as defined in s. 943.10(3). The commission shall also determine whether the terms and conditions of such release have been violated and whether such violation warrants revocation of the conditional release. (3) As part of the conditional release process, the commission, through review and consideration of information provided by the department, shall determine: (a) The amount of reparation or restitution. (b) The consequences of the offense as reported by the aggrieved party. (c) The aggrieved party’s fear of the inmate or concerns about the release of the inmate. (4) The commission shall provide to the aggrieved party information regarding the manner in which notice of any developments concerning the status of the inmate during the term of conditional release may be requested. (5) Within 180 days prior to the tentative release date or provisional release date, whichever is earlier, a representative of the department shall review the inmate’s program participation, disciplinary record, psychological and medical records, criminal records, and any other information pertinent to the impending release. The department shall gather and compile information necessary for the commission to make the determinations set forth in subsection (3). A department representative shall conduct a personal interview with the inmate for the purpose of determining the details of the inmate’s release plan, including the inmate’s planned residence and employment. The department representative shall forward the inmate’s release plan to the commission and recommend to the commission the terms and conditions of the conditional release. (6) The commission shall review the recommendations of the department, and such other information as it deems relevant, and may conduct a review of the inmate’s record for the purpose of establishing the terms and conditions of the conditional release. The commission may impose any special conditions it considers warranted from its review of the release plan and recommendation. If the commission determines that the inmate is eligible for release under this section, the commission shall enter an order establishing the length of supervision and the conditions attendant thereto. However, an inmate who has been convicted of a violation of chapter 794 or found by the court to be a sexual predator is subject to the maximum level of supervision provided, with the mandatory conditions as required in subsection (7), and that supervision shall continue through the end of the releasee’s original court-imposed sentence. The length of supervision must not exceed the maximum penalty imposed by the court. (7)(a) Any inmate who is convicted of a crime committed on or after October 1, 1995, or who has been previously convicted of a crime committed on or after October 1, 1995, in violation of chapter 794, s. 800.04, s. 827.071, s. 847.0135(5), or s. 847.0145, and is subject to conditional release supervision, shall have, in addition to any other conditions imposed, the following special conditions imposed by the commission: 1. A mandatory curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. The commission may designate another 8-hour period if the offender’s employment precludes the above specified time, and such alternative is recommended by the Department of Corrections. If the commission determines that imposing a curfew would endanger the victim, the commission may consider alternative sanctions. 2. If the victim was under the age of 18, a prohibition on living within 1,000 feet of a school, child care facility, park, playground, designated public school bus stop, or other place where children regularly congregate. A releasee who is subject to this subparagraph may not relocate to a residence that is within 1,000 feet of a public school bus stop. Beginning October 1, 2004, the commission or the department may not approve a residence that is located within 1,000 feet of a school, child care facility, park, playground, designated school bus stop, or other place where children regularly congregate for any releasee who is subject to this subparagraph. On October 1, 2004, the department shall notify each affected school district of the location of the residence of a releasee 30 days prior to release and thereafter, if the releasee relocates to a new residence, shall notify any affected school district of the residence of the releasee within 30 days after relocation. If, on October 1, 2004, any public school bus stop is located within 1,000 feet of the existing residence of such releasee, the district school board shall relocate that school bus stop. Beginning October 1, 2004, a district school board may not establish or relocate a public school bus stop within 1,000 feet of the residence of a releasee who is subject to this subparagraph. The failure of the district school board to comply with this subparagraph shall not result in a violation of conditional release supervision. A releasee who is subject to this subparagraph may not be forced to relocate and does not violate his or her conditional release supervision if he or she is living in a residence that meets the requirements of this subparagraph and a school, child care facility, park, playground, designated public school bus stop, or other place where children regularly congregate is subsequently established within 1,000 feet of his or her residence. 3. Active participation in and successful completion of a sex offender treatment program with qualified practitioners specifically trained to treat sex offenders, at the releasee’s own expense. If a qualified practitioner is not available within a 50-mile radius of the releasee’s residence, the offender shall participate in other appropriate therapy. 4. A prohibition on any contact with the victim, directly or indirectly, including through a third person, unless approved by the victim, a qualified practitioner in the sexual offender treatment program, and the sentencing court. 5. If the victim was under the age of 18, a prohibition against contact with children under the age of 18 without review and approval by the commission. The commission may approve supervised contact with a child under the age of 18 if the approval is based upon a recommendation for contact issued by a qualified practitioner who is basing the recommendation on a risk assessment. Further, the sex offender must be currently enrolled in or have successfully completed a sex offender therapy program. The commission may not grant supervised contact with a child if the contact is not recommended by a qualified practitioner and may deny supervised contact with a child at any time. When considering whether to approve supervised contact with a child, the commission must review and consider the following: a. A risk assessment completed by a qualified practitioner. The qualified practitioner must prepare a written report that must include the findings of the assessment and address each of the following components: (I) The sex offender’s current legal status; (II) The sex offender’s history of adult charges with apparent sexual motivation; (III) The sex offender’s history of adult charges without apparent sexual motivation; (IV) The sex offender’s history of juvenile charges, whenever available; (V) The sex offender’s offender treatment history, including a consultation from the sex offender’s treating, or most recent treating, therapist; (VI) The sex offender’s current mental status; (VII) The sex offender’s mental health and substance abuse history as provided by the Department of Corrections; (VIII) The sex offender’s personal, social, educational, and work history; (IX) The results of current psychological testing of the sex offender if determined necessary by the qualified practitioner; (X) A description of the proposed contact, including the location, frequency, duration, and supervisory arrangement; (XI) The child’s preference and relative comfort level with the proposed contact, when age-appropriate; (XII) The parent’s or legal guardian’s preference regarding the proposed contact; and (XIII) The qualified practitioner’s opinion, along with the basis for that opinion, as to whether the proposed contact would likely pose significant risk of emotional or physical harm to the child. The written report of the assessment must be given to the commission. b. A recommendation made as a part of the risk-assessment report as to whether supervised contact with the child should be approved; c. A written consent signed by the child’s parent or legal guardian, if the parent or legal guardian is not the sex offender, agreeing to the sex offender having supervised contact with the child after receiving full disclosure of the sex offender’s present legal status, past criminal history, and the results of the risk assessment. The commission may not approve contact with the child if the parent or legal guardian refuses to give written consent for supervised contact; d. A safety plan prepared by the qualified practitioner, who provides treatment to the offender, in collaboration with the sex offender, the child’s parent or legal guardian, and the child, when age appropriate, which details the acceptable conditions of contact between the sex offender and the child. The safety plan must be reviewed and approved by the Department of Corrections before being submitted to the commission; and e. Evidence that the child’s parent or legal guardian, if the parent or legal guardian is not the sex offender, understands the need for and agrees to the safety plan and has agreed to provide, or to designate another adult to provide, constant supervision any time the child is in contact with the offender. The commission may not appoint a person to conduct a risk assessment and may not accept a risk assessment from a person who has not demonstrated to the commission that he or she has met the requirements of a qualified practitioner as defined in this section. 6. If the victim was under age 18, a prohibition on working for pay or as a volunteer at any school, child care facility, park, playground, or other place where children regularly congregate, as prescribed by the commission. 7. Unless otherwise indicated in the treatment plan provided by a qualified practitioner in the sexual offender treatment program, a prohibition on viewing, owning, or possessing any obscene, pornographic, or sexually stimulating visual or auditory material, including telephone, electronic media, computer programs, or computer services that are relevant to the offender’s deviant behavior pattern. 8. Effective for a releasee whose crime is committed on or after July 1, 2005, a prohibition on accessing the Internet or other computer services until a qualified practitioner in the offender’s sex offender treatment program, after a risk assessment is completed, approves and implements a safety plan for the offender’s accessing or using the Internet or other computer services. 9. A requirement that the releasee must submit two specimens of blood to the Department of Law Enforcement to be registered with the DNA database. 10. A requirement that the releasee make restitution to the victim, as determined by the sentencing court or the commission, for all necessary medical and related professional services relating to physical, psychiatric, and psychological care. 11. Submission to a warrantless search by the community control or probation officer of the probationer’s or community controllee’s person, residence, or vehicle. (b) For a releasee whose crime was committed on or after October 1, 1997, in violation of chapter 794, s. 800.04, s. 827.071, s. 847.0135(5), or s. 847.0145, and who is subject to conditional release supervision, in addition to any other provision of this subsection, the commission shall impose the following additional conditions of conditional release supervision: 1. As part of a treatment program, participation in a minimum of one annual polygraph examination to obtain information necessary for risk management and treatment and to reduce the sex offender’s denial mechanisms. The polygraph examination must be conducted by a polygrapher who is a member of a national or state polygraph association and who is certified as a postconviction sex offender polygrapher, where available, and at the expense of the releasee. The results of the examination shall be provided to the releasee’s probation officer and qualified practitioner and may not be used as evidence in a hearing to prove that a violation of supervision has occurred. 2. Maintenance of a driving log and a prohibition against driving a motor vehicle alone without the prior approval of the supervising officer. 3. A prohibition against obtaining or using a post office box without the prior approval of the supervising officer. 4. If there was sexual contact, a submission to, at the releasee’s expense, an HIV test with the results to be released to the victim or the victim’s parent or guardian. 5. Electronic monitoring of any form when ordered by the commission. Any person who has been placed under supervision and is electronically monitored by the department must pay the department for the cost of the electronic monitoring service at a rate that may not exceed the full cost of the monitoring service. Funds collected under this subparagraph shall be deposited into the General Revenue Fund. The department may exempt a person from the payment of all or any part of the electronic monitoring service cost if the department finds that any of the factors listed in s. 948.09(3) exist. (8) It is the finding of the Legislature that the population of offenders released from state prison into the community who meet the conditional release criteria poses the greatest threat to the public safety of the groups of offenders under community supervision. Therefore, the Department of Corrections is to provide intensive supervision by experienced correctional probation officers to conditional release offenders. Subject to specific appropriation by the Legislature, caseloads may be restricted to a maximum of 40 conditional release offenders per officer to provide for enhanced public safety and to effectively monitor conditions of electronic monitoring or curfews, if so ordered by the commission. (9) The commission shall adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 necessary to implement the provisions of the Conditional Release Program Act. (10) Effective for a releasee whose crime was committed on or after September 1, 2005, in violation of chapter 794, s. 800.04(4), (5), or (6), s. 827.071, or s. 847.0145, and the unlawful activity involved a victim who was 15 years of age or younger and the offender is 18 years of age or older or for a releasee who is designated as a sexual predator pursuant to s. 775.21, in addition to any other provision of this section, the commission must order electronic monitoring for the duration of the releasee’s supervision. (11) Effective for a releasee whose crime was committed on or after October 1, 2008, and who has been found to have committed the crime for the purpose of benefiting, promoting, or furthering the interests of a criminal gang, the commission shall, in addition to any other conditions imposed, impose a condition prohibiting the releasee from knowingly associating with other criminal gang members or associates, except as authorized by law enforcement officials, prosecutorial authorities, or the court, for the purpose of aiding in the investigation of criminal activity. (12) In addition to all other conditions imposed, for a releasee who is subject to conditional release for a crime that was committed on or after May 26, 2010, and who has been convicted at any time of committing, or attempting, soliciting, or conspiring to commit, any of the criminal offenses listed in s. 943.0435(1)(h)1.a.(I), or a similar offense in another jurisdiction against a victim who was under 18 years of age at the time of the offense, if the releasee has not received a pardon for any felony or similar law of another jurisdiction necessary for the operation of this subsection, if a conviction of a felony or similar law of another jurisdiction necessary for the operation of this subsection has not been set aside in any postconviction proceeding, or if the releasee has not been removed from the requirement to register as a sexual offender or sexual predator pursuant to s. 943.04354, the commission must impose the following conditions: (a) A prohibition on visiting schools, child care facilities, parks, and playgrounds without prior approval from the releasee’s supervising officer. The commission may also designate additional prohibited locations to protect a victim. The prohibition ordered under this paragraph does not prohibit the releasee from visiting a school, child care facility, park, or playground for the sole purpose of attending a religious service as defined in s. 775.0861 or picking up or dropping off the releasee’s child or grandchild at a child care facility or school. (b) A prohibition on distributing candy or other items to children on Halloween; wearing a Santa Claus costume, or other costume to appeal to children, on or preceding Christmas; wearing an Easter Bunny costume, or other costume to appeal to children, on or preceding Easter; entertaining at children’s parties; or wearing a clown costume without prior approval from the commission. (13) If a person who is transferred to the custody of the Department of Children and Families pursuant to part V of chapter 394 is subject to conditional release supervision, the period of conditional release supervision is tolled until such person is no longer in the custody of the Department of Children and Families. This subsection applies to all periods of conditional release supervision which begin on or after October 1, 2014, regardless of the date of the underlying offense. (14) Effective for a releasee whose crime was committed on or after October 1, 2014, in violation of chapter 794, s. 800.04, s. 827.071, s. 847.0135(5), or s. 847.0145, in addition to any other provision of this section, the commission must impose a condition prohibiting the releasee from viewing, accessing, owning, or possessing any obscene, pornographic, or sexually stimulating visual or auditory material unless otherwise indicated in the treatment plan provided by a qualified practitioner in the sexual offender treatment program. Visual or auditory material includes, but is not limited to, telephone, electronic media, computer programs, and computer services.

      "text": "947.146 Control Release Authority.— (1) There is created a Control Release Authority which shall be composed of the members of the Florida Commission on Offender Review and which shall have the same chair as the commission. The authority shall use such commission staff as it determines is necessary to carry out its purposes. (2) The authority shall implement a system for determining the number and type of inmates who must be released into the community under control release in order to maintain the state prison system between 99 and 100 percent of its total capacity as defined in s. 944.023. No inmate has a right to control release. Control release is an administrative function solely used to manage the state prison population within total capacity. An inmate may not receive an advancement of his or her control release date by an award of control release allotments for any period of time before the date the inmate becomes statutorily eligible for control release or before the subsequent date of establishment of the inmate’s advanceable control release date. (3) Within 120 days prior to the date the state correctional system is projected pursuant to s. 216.136 to exceed 99 percent of total capacity, the authority shall determine eligibility for and establish a control release date for an appropriate number of parole ineligible inmates committed to the department and incarcerated within the state who have been determined by the authority to be eligible for discretionary early release pursuant to this section. In establishing control release dates, it is the intent of the Legislature that the authority prioritize consideration of eligible inmates closest to their tentative release date. The authority shall rely upon commitment data on the offender information system maintained by the department to initially identify inmates who are to be reviewed for control release consideration. The authority may use a method of objective risk assessment in determining if an eligible inmate should be released. Such assessment shall be a part of the department’s management information system. However, the authority shall have sole responsibility for determining control release eligibility, establishing a control release date, and effectuating the release of a sufficient number of inmates to maintain the inmate population between 99 percent and 100 percent of total capacity. Inmates who are ineligible for control release are inmates who are parole eligible or inmates who: (a) Are serving a sentence that includes a mandatory minimum provision for a capital offense or drug trafficking offense and have not served the number of days equal to the mandatory minimum term less any jail-time credit awarded by the court; (b) Are serving the mandatory minimum portion of a sentence enhanced under s. 775.087(2) or (3) or s. 784.07(3); (c) Are convicted, or have been previously convicted, of committing or attempting to commit sexual battery, incest, or any of the following lewd or indecent assaults or acts: masturbating in public; exposing the sexual organs in a perverted manner; or nonconsensual handling or fondling of the sexual organs of another person; (d) Are convicted, or have been previously convicted, of committing or attempting to commit assault, aggravated assault, battery, or aggravated battery, and a sex act was attempted or completed during commission of such offense; (e) Are convicted, or have been previously convicted, of committing or attempting to commit kidnapping, burglary, or murder, and the offense was committed with the intent to commit sexual battery or a sex act was attempted or completed during commission of the offense; (f) Are convicted, or have been previously convicted, of committing or attempting to commit false imprisonment upon a child under the age of 13 and, in the course of committing the offense, the inmate committed aggravated child abuse, sexual battery against the child, or a lewd or lascivious offense committed upon or in the presence of a person less than 16 years of age; (g) Are sentenced, have previously been sentenced, or have been sentenced at any time under s. 775.084, or have been sentenced at any time in another jurisdiction as a habitual offender; (h) Are convicted, or have been previously convicted, of committing or attempting to commit assault, aggravated assault, battery, aggravated battery, kidnapping, manslaughter, or murder against an officer as defined in s. 943.10(1), (2), (3), (6), (7), (8), or (9); against a state attorney or assistant state attorney; or against a justice or judge of a court described in Art. V of the State Constitution; or against an officer, judge, or state attorney employed in a comparable position by any other jurisdiction; or (i) Are convicted, or have been previously convicted, of committing or attempting to commit murder in the first, second, or third degree under s. 782.04(1), (2), (3), or (4), or have ever been convicted of any degree of murder or attempted murder in another jurisdiction; (j) Are convicted, or have been previously convicted, of DUI manslaughter under s. 316.193(3)(c)3., and are sentenced, or have been sentenced at any time, as a habitual offender for such offense, or have been sentenced at any time in another jurisdiction as a habitual offender for such offense; (k)1. Are serving a sentence for an offense committed on or after January 1, 1994, for a violation of s. 775.0823(2), (3), (4), (5), or (6), and the subtotal of the offender’s sentence points is multiplied pursuant to former s. 921.0014 or s. 921.0024; 2. Are serving a sentence for an offense committed on or after October 1, 1995, for a violation of s. 775.0823(2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), or (9), and the subtotal of the offender’s sentence points is multiplied pursuant to former s. 921.0014 or s. 921.0024; (l) Are serving a sentence for an offense committed on or after January 1, 1994, for possession of a firearm, semiautomatic firearm, or machine gun in which additional points are added to the subtotal of the offender’s sentence points pursuant to former s. 921.0014 or s. 921.0024; or (m) Are convicted, or have been previously convicted, of committing or attempting to commit manslaughter, kidnapping, robbery, carjacking, home-invasion robbery, or a burglary under s. 810.02(2). In making control release eligibility determinations under this subsection, the authority may rely on any document leading to or generated during the course of the criminal proceedings, including, but not limited to, any presentence or postsentence investigation or any information contained in arrest reports relating to circumstances of the offense. (4) Control release dates shall be based upon a system of uniform criteria which shall include, but not be limited to, present offenses for which the person is committed, past criminal conduct, length of cumulative sentences, and age of the offender at the time of commitment, together with any aggravating or mitigating circumstances. (5) Whenever the inmate population drops below 99 percent of total capacity and remains below 99 percent for 90 consecutive days without requiring the release of inmates under this section, all control release dates shall become void and no inmate shall be eligible for release under any previously established control release date. An inmate shall not have a right to a control release date, nor shall the authority be required to establish or reestablish any additional control release dates except under the provisions of subsection (2). (6) For purpose of determining eligibility for control release, the mandatory minimum portion of a concurrent sentence will begin on the date the sentence begins to run as provided in s. 921.161. The mandatory minimum portions of consecutive sentences shall be served at the beginning of the maximum sentence as established by the Department of Corrections. With respect to offenders who have more than one sentence with a mandatory minimum portion, each mandatory minimum portion of consecutive sentences shall be served consecutively; provided, that in no case shall a sentence begin to run before the date of imposition of that sentence. (7) The authority has the power and duty to: (a) Extend or advance the control release date of any inmate for whom a date has been established pursuant to subsection (2), based upon one or more of the following: 1. Recently discovered information of: a. Past criminal conduct; b. Verified threats by inmates provided by victims, law enforcement, or the department; c. Potential risk to or vulnerability of a victim; d. Psychological or physical trauma to the victim due to the criminal offense; e. Court-ordered restitution; f. History of abuse or addiction to a chemical substance verified by a presentence or postsentence investigation report; g. The inmate’s ties to organized crime; h. A change in the inmate’s sentence structure; i. Cooperation with law enforcement; j. Strong community support; and k. A documented mental condition as a factor for future criminal behavior. 2. The recommendation of the department regarding: a. A medical or mental health-related condition; or b. Institutional adjustment of the inmate, which may include refusal by the inmate to sign the agreement to the conditions of the release plan. 3. Total capacity of the state prison system. (b) Authorize an individual commissioner to postpone a control release date for not more than 60 days without a hearing for any inmate who has become the subject of a disciplinary proceeding, a criminal arrest, an information, or an indictment; who has been terminated from work release; or about whom there is any recently discovered information as specified in paragraph (a). (c) Determine the terms, conditions, and period of time of control release for persons released pursuant to this section. (d) Determine violations of control release and what actions shall be taken with reference thereto. (e) Provide for victim input into the decisionmaking process which may be used by the authority as aggravation or mitigation in determining which persons shall be released on control release. (f) Make such investigations as may be necessary for the purposes of establishing, modifying, or revoking a control release date. (g) Contract with a public defender or private counsel for representation of indigent persons charged with violating the terms of control release. (h) Adopt such rules as the authority deems necessary for implementation of the provisions of this section. (8) The Department of Corrections shall select and contract with public or private organizations for the provision of basic support services for inmates whose term of control release supervision does not exceed 180 days. Basic support services shall include, but not be limited to, substance abuse counseling, temporary housing, family counseling, and employment support programs. (9) The authority shall examine such records as it deems necessary of the department, the Department of Children and Families, the Department of Law Enforcement, and any other such agency for the purpose of either establishing, modifying, or revoking a control release date. The victim impact statement shall be included in such records for examination. Such agencies shall provide the information requested by the authority for the purposes of fulfilling the requirements of this section. (10) The authority shall adopt as a standard condition for all persons released pursuant to this section that such persons shall not commit a violation which constitutes a felony. The authority shall determine the appropriate terms, conditions, and lengths of supervision, if any, for persons placed on control release, except that such lengths of supervision shall be determined as provided in s. 947.24 and may not exceed the maximum period for which the person has been sentenced. If the person’s conviction was for a controlled substance violation, the conditions must include a requirement that the person submit to random substance abuse testing intermittently throughout the term of supervision, and, when warranted, a requirement that the person participate in substance abuse assessment and substance abuse treatment services upon the direction of the correctional probation officer as defined in s. 943.10(3). Effective July 1, 1994, and applicable for offenses committed on or after that date, the authority may require, as a condition of control release, that the control releasee make payment of the debt due and owing to a county or municipal detention facility under s. 951.032 for medical care, treatment, hospitalization, or transportation received by the releasee while in that detention facility. The authority, in determining whether to order such repayment and the amount of such repayment, shall consider the amount of the debt, whether there was any fault of the institution for the medical expenses incurred, the financial resources of the releasee, the present and potential future financial needs and earning ability of the releasee, and dependents, and other appropriate factors. If any inmate placed on control release supervision is also subject to probation or community control, the department shall supervise such person according to the conditions imposed by the court, and the authority shall defer to such supervision. If the court revokes the probation or community control, the authority, as the result of the revocation, may vacate the grant of control release and resulting deferred control release supervision or take other action it considers appropriate. If the term of control release supervision exceeds that of the probation or community control, then supervision shall revert to the authority’s conditions upon expiration of the probation or community control. (11) If an inmate is released on control release supervision subject to a detainer for a pending charge and the pending charge results in a new commitment to incarceration before expiration of the terms of control release supervision, the authority may vacate the grant of control release and the control release supervision or take other action it considers appropriate. (12) When the authority has reasonable grounds to believe that an offender released under this section has violated the terms and conditions of control release, such offender shall be subject to the provisions of s. 947.141 and shall be subject to forfeiture of gain-time pursuant to s. 944.28(1). (13) If it is discovered that any control releasee was placed on control release by error or while statutorily ineligible for such release, the order of control release may be vacated and the Control Release Authority may cause a warrant to be issued for the arrest and return of the control releasee to the custody of the Department of Corrections for service of the unserved portion of the sentence or combined sentences. (14) Effective July 1, 1996, all control release dates established prior to such date become void and no inmate shall be eligible for release under any previously established control release date. Offenders who are under control release supervision as of July 1, 1996, shall be subject to the conditions established by the authority until such offenders have been discharged from supervision. Offenders who have warrants outstanding based on violation of supervision as of July 1, 1996, or who violate the terms of their supervision subsequent to July 1, 1996, shall be subject to the provisions of s. 947.141.

      "text": "947.149 Conditional medical release.— (1) The commission shall, in conjunction with the department, establish the conditional medical release program. An inmate is eligible for consideration for release under the conditional medical release program when the inmate, because of an existing medical or physical condition, is determined by the department to be within one of the following designations: (a) “Permanently incapacitated inmate,” which means an inmate who has a condition caused by injury, disease, or illness which, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, renders the inmate permanently and irreversibly physically incapacitated to the extent that the inmate does not constitute a danger to herself or himself or others. (b) “Terminally ill inmate,” which means an inmate who has a condition caused by injury, disease, or illness which, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, renders the inmate terminally ill to the extent that there can be no recovery and death is imminent, so that the inmate does not constitute a danger to herself or himself or others. (2) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, any person determined eligible under this section and sentenced to the custody of the department may, upon referral by the department, be considered for conditional medical release by the commission, in addition to any parole consideration for which the inmate may be considered, except that conditional medical release is not authorized for an inmate who is under sentence of death. No inmate has a right to conditional medical release or to a medical evaluation to determine eligibility for such release. (3) The authority and whether or not to grant conditional medical release and establish additional conditions of conditional medical release rests solely within the discretion of the commission, in accordance with the provisions of this section, together with the authority to approve the release plan to include necessary medical care and attention. The department shall identify inmates who may be eligible for conditional medical release based upon available medical information and shall refer them to the commission for consideration. In considering an inmate for conditional medical release, the commission may require that additional medical evidence be produced or that additional medical examinations be conducted, and may require such other investigations to be made as may be warranted. (4) The conditional medical release term of an inmate released on conditional medical release is for the remainder of the inmate’s sentence, without diminution of sentence for good behavior. Supervision of the medical releasee must include periodic medical evaluations at intervals determined by the commission at the time of release. (5)(a) If it is discovered during the conditional medical release that the medical or physical condition of the medical releasee has improved to the extent that she or he would no longer be eligible for conditional medical release under this section, the commission may order that the releasee be returned to the custody of the department for a conditional medical release revocation hearing, in accordance with s. 947.141. If conditional medical release is revoked due to improvement in the medical or physical condition of the releasee, she or he shall serve the balance of her or his sentence with credit for the time served on conditional medical release and without forfeiture of any gain-time accrued prior to conditional medical release. If the person whose conditional medical release is revoked due to an improvement in medical or physical condition would otherwise be eligible for parole or any other release program, the person may be considered for such release program pursuant to law. (b) In addition to revocation of conditional medical release pursuant to paragraph (a), conditional medical release may also be revoked for violation of any condition of the release established by the commission, in accordance with s. 947.141, and the releasee’s gain-time may be forfeited pursuant to s. 944.28(1). (6) The department and the commission shall adopt rules as necessary to implement the conditional medical release program. History.—s. 16, ch. 92-310; s. 2, ch. 94-121; s. 1672, ch. 97-102.

Such interview shall take place within 2 years after the initial interview and every 2 years thereafter. (b) For any inmate convicted of murder or attempted murder; sexual battery or attempted sexual battery; kidnapping or attempted kidnapping; or robbery, burglary of a dwelling, burglary of a structure or conveyance, or breaking and entering, or the attempt thereof of any of these crimes, in which a human being is present and a sexual act is attempted or completed, or any inmate who has been sentenced to a 25-year minimum mandatory sentence previously provided in s. 775.082, and whose presumptive parole release date is more than 7 years after the date of the initial interview, a hearing examiner shall schedule an interview for review of the presumptive parole release date. The interview shall take place once within 7 years after the initial interview and once every 7 years thereafter if the commission finds that it is not reasonable to expect that parole will be granted at a hearing during the following years and states the bases for the finding in writing. For an inmate who is within 7 years of his or her tentative release date, the commission may establish an interview date before the 7-year schedule.

The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to an inmate serving a concurrent sentence in another jurisdiction pursuant to s. 921.16(2). (2) The commission, for good cause, may at any time request that a hearing examiner conduct a subsequent hearing according to the procedures outlined in this section. Such request shall specify in writing the reasons for such review. (3) The department shall, within a reasonable amount of time, make available and bring to the attention of the commission such information as is deemed important to the review of the presumptive parole release date, including, but not limited to, current progress reports, psychological reports, and disciplinary reports. (4) The department or a hearing examiner may recommend that an inmate be placed in a work-release program prior to the last 18 months of her or his confinement before the presumptive parole release date. If the commission does not deny the recommendation within 30 days of the receipt of the recommendation, the inmate may be placed in such a program, and the department shall advise the commission of the fact prior to such placement.

In developing such guidelines, the commission shall consult with the department.

      "text": "947.1745 Establishment of effective parole release date.—If the inmate’s institutional conduct has been satisfactory, the presumptive parole release date shall become the effective parole release date as follows: (1) Within 90 days before the presumptive parole release date, a hearing examiner shall conduct a final interview with the inmate in order to establish an effective parole release date and parole release plan. If it is determined that the inmate’s institutional conduct has been unsatisfactory, a statement to this effect shall be made in writing with particularity and shall be forwarded to a panel of no fewer than two commissioners appointed by the chair. (2) If the panel finds that the inmate’s parole release plan is unsatisfactory, this finding may constitute new information and good cause in exceptional circumstances as described in s. 947.173, under which the panel may extend the presumptive parole release date for not more than 1 year. The panel may review any subsequently proposed parole release plan at any time. (3) Within 30 days after receipt of the inmate’s parole release plan, the panel shall determine whether to authorize the effective parole release date. The inmate must be notified of the decision in writing within 30 days after the decision by the panel. (4) If an effective date of parole has been established, release on that date is conditioned upon the completion of a satisfactory plan for parole supervision. An effective date of parole may be delayed for up to 60 days by a commissioner without a hearing for the development and approval of release plans. (5) An effective date of parole may be delayed by a commissioner for up to 60 days without a hearing based on: (a) New information not available at the time of the effective parole release date interview. (b) Unsatisfactory institutional conduct which occurred subsequent to the effective parole release date interview. (c) The lack of a verified parole release plan. (6) Within 90 days before the effective parole release date interview, the commission shall send written notice to the sentencing judge of any inmate who has been scheduled for an effective parole release date interview. If the sentencing judge is no longer serving, the notice must be sent to the chief judge of the circuit in which the offender was sentenced. The chief judge may designate any circuit judge within the circuit to act in the place of the sentencing judge. Within 30 days after receipt of the commission’s notice, the sentencing judge, or the designee, shall send to the commission notice of objection to parole release, if the judge objects to such release. If there is objection by the judge, such objection may constitute good cause in exceptional circumstances as described in s. 947.173, and the commission may schedule a subsequent review within 2 years, extending the presumptive parole release date beyond that time. However, for an inmate who has been: (a) Convicted of murder or attempted murder; (b) Convicted of sexual battery or attempted sexual battery; (c) Convicted of kidnapping or attempted kidnapping; (d) Convicted of robbery, burglary of a dwelling, burglary of a structure or conveyance, or breaking and entering, or the attempt thereof of any of these crimes, in which a human being is present and a sexual act is attempted or completed; or (e) Sentenced to a 25-year minimum mandatory sentence previously provided in s. 775.082, the commission may schedule a subsequent review under this subsection once every 7 years, extending the presumptive parole release date beyond that time if the commission finds that it is not reasonable to expect that parole would be granted at a review during the following years and states the bases for the finding in writing. For an inmate who is within 7 years of his or her release date, the commission may schedule a subsequent review before the 7-year schedule. With any subsequent review the same procedure outlined above will be followed. If the judge remains silent with respect to parole release, the commission may authorize an effective parole release date. This subsection applies if the commission desires to consider the establishment of an effective release date without delivery of the effective parole release date interview. Notice of the effective release date must be sent to the sentencing judge, and either the judge’s response to the notice must be received or the time period allowed for such response must elapse before the commission may authorize an effective release date.

No person shall be placed on parole unless and until the commission is satisfied that he or she will be suitably employed in self-sustaining employment or that he or she will not become a public charge. The commission shall determine the terms upon which such person shall be granted parole. If the person’s conviction was for a controlled substance violation, one of the conditions must be that the person submit to random substance abuse testing intermittently throughout the term of supervision, upon the direction of the correctional probation officer as defined in s. 943.10(3). In addition to any other lawful condition of parole, the commission may make the payment of the debt due and owing to the state under s. 960.17 or the payment of the attorney’s fees and costs due and owing to the state under s. 938.29 a condition of parole subject to modification based on change of circumstances. If the person’s conviction was for a crime that was found to have been committed for the purpose of benefiting, promoting, or furthering the interests of a criminal gang, one of the conditions must be that the person be prohibited from knowingly associating with other criminal gang members or associates, except as authorized by law enforcement officials, prosecutorial authorities, or the court, for the purpose of aiding in the investigation of criminal activity.

The parolee may knowingly execute a waiver of this hearing, up until the time of such hearing, provided the consequences of such action have been fully explained. If the parolee elects to proceed with the preliminary hearing: (a) The parolee shall be afforded a timely notice of the preliminary hearing, which notice shall state the purpose of the hearing and state the alleged violation. (b) The parolee shall be permitted to cross-examine adverse witnesses, unless it is determined that good cause exists not to allow such examination. (c) The parolee shall be allowed to call witnesses as provided in subsection (3), and present evidence in her or his own behalf. (d) The parolee may be represented by counsel. The findings based on the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing shall be made available to the parolee either immediately following the preliminary hearing or within a reasonable time thereafter. (2) If the preliminary hearing results in a finding of probable cause or reasonable grounds to believe that a violation of the terms or conditions of parole has occurred, any one or more commissioners or a duly authorized representative of the commission shall convene a final revocation hearing on the alleged violation. The parolee shall appear at the final hearing in person, and, if the parolee desires, she or he may be represented by counsel. At the final hearing, the state and the parolee may introduce such evidence as is necessary and pertinent to the charge of parole violation. (3) Any one or more commissioners or a duly authorized representative of the commission may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses at such hearing by the issuance of summons, subpoenas, and subpoenas duces tecum. Subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum shall be enforceable by appropriate proceedings in circuit court, and the failure to comply with a court order enforcing a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum shall constitute contempt of court. Any one or more commissioners or a duly authorized representative of the commission may issue subpoenas on behalf of the state or the parolee. The commission may decline a request to subpoena a witness whose testimony it finds would be cumulative, irrelevant, or nonprobative. The party requesting the subpoenas shall furnish to the commissioner, commissioners, or duly authorized representative of the commission the names and addresses of her or his proposed witnesses at least 10 days prior to the hearing date. (4) At the hearing, the parolee shall be informed orally and in writing of: (a) The violation of the terms and conditions of parole with which the parolee has been charged. (b) The right to be represented by counsel. (c) The right to be heard in person. (d) The right to secure, present, and compel the attendance of witnesses as provided in subsection (3) and the production of documents on her or his behalf. (e) The right of access to all evidence used against her or him. (f) The right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, unless the commissioner, commissioners, or duly authorized representative of the commission conducting the hearing finds specifically, and states in writing, good cause not to allow the confrontation. (5)(a) At any such hearing convened by one or more commissioners or a duly authorized representative of the commission, the accused may waive her or his right to proceed further if, after being informed of her or his rights and after being advised of the consequences of a waiver in regard to the nature of the order which may be entered as a result of such waiver, the accused affirms, in writing, knowledge and understanding of such rights and consequences and elects, in writing, to execute the waiver. (b) The accused violator may execute a waiver, in writing, of a final revocation hearing prior to the commencement of such hearing. Such waiver may be executed before a member of the commission or a duly authorized representative of the commission after the accused violator has been informed of her or his rights and after she or he has been advised of the consequences of a waiver. Within 14 days after the execution of a waiver, the accused may withdraw the waiver by executing a withdrawal of waiver before a notary public and forwarding the original of that withdrawal to the commission. (6) Within a reasonable time after the hearing, the commissioner, commissioners, or duly authorized representative of the commission who conducted the hearing shall make findings of fact in regard to the alleged parole violation. (a) If the hearing was conducted by three or more commissioners, a majority of them shall enter an order determining whether the charges of parole violation have been sustained, based on the findings of fact made by them. By such order they shall revoke the parole and return the parolee to prison to serve the sentence theretofore imposed upon her or him, reinstate the original order of parole, order the placement of the parolee into a community control program as set forth in s. 948.101, or enter such other order as is proper. (b) If the hearing was conducted by one or two commissioners or a duly authorized representative of the commission, at least two commissioners shall enter an order determining whether or not the charges of parole violation have been sustained, based on the findings of fact made by the commissioner, commissioners, or duly authorized representative of the commission. The commissioners, by such order, shall revoke the parole and return the parolee to prison to serve the sentence theretofore imposed upon her or him, reinstate the original order of parole, order the placement of the parolee into a community control program as set forth in s. 948.101, or enter such other order as is proper. (c) If the disposition after the revocation hearing is to place the parolee into a community control program, the commission shall be guided by the procedures and requirements provided in chapter 948 which apply to the courts regarding the development and implementation of community control. However, any decision to revoke parole shall be based on a violation of a term or condition specifically enumerated in the parole release order. In a case in which parole is revoked, the majority of the commission or the two commissioners shall make a written statement of the evidence relied on and the reasons for revoking parole. (7) Whenever a parole is revoked by the commission and the parolee is ordered by the commission to be returned to prison, the parolee, by reason of her or his misconduct, shall be deemed to forfeit all gain-time or commutation of time for good conduct, as provided for by law, earned up to the date of her or his release on parole. Nothing herein shall deprive the prisoner of her or his right to gain-time or commutation of time for good conduct, as provided by law, from the date the prisoner is returned to prison.

      "text": "947.24 Discharge from parole supervision or release supervision.— (1) When a person is placed on parole, control release, or conditional release, the commission shall determine the period of time the person will be under parole supervision or release supervision in the following manner: (a) If the person is being paroled or released under supervision from a single or concurrent sentence, the period of time the person will be under parole supervision or release supervision may not exceed 2 years unless the commission designates a longer period of time, in which case it must advise the parolee or releasee in writing of the reasons for the extended period. In any event, the period of parole supervision or release supervision may not exceed the maximum period for which the person has been sentenced. (b) If the person is being paroled or released under supervision from a consecutive sentence or sentences, the period of time the person will be under parole supervision or release supervision will be for the maximum period for which the person was sentenced. (2) The commission shall review the progress of each person who has been placed on parole, control release, or conditional release after 2 years of supervision in the community and biennially thereafter. The department shall provide to the commission the information necessary to conduct such a review. Such review must include consideration of whether to modify the reporting schedule, thereby authorizing the person under parole supervision or release supervision to submit reports quarterly, semiannually, or annually. The commission, after having retained jurisdiction of a person for a sufficient length of time to evidence satisfactory rehabilitation and cooperation, may further modify the terms and conditions of the person’s parole, control release, or conditional release, may discharge the person from parole supervision or release supervision, may relieve the person from making further reports, or may permit the person to leave the state or country, upon finding that such action is in the best interests of the person and society. (3) Upon the termination of an offender’s term of supervision, which is monitored by the commission, including, but not limited to, parole, the commission must notify the offender in writing of all outstanding terms at the time of termination to assist the offender in determining his or her status with regard to the completion of all terms of sentence, as that term is defined in s. 98.0751. (4) This section does not affect the rights of a parolee to request modification of the terms and conditions of parole under s. 947.19.
