These procedures must include numerical parameters for 25-percent, 50-percent, 110-percent, and 150-percent pledge levels based on nationally recognized financial rating services information and established financial performance guidelines. (2) A qualified public depository may not accept or retain any public deposit required to be secured unless it deposits with the Chief Financial Officer eligible collateral at least equal to the greater of: (a) The average daily balance of public deposits that does not exceed the lesser of its tangible equity capital or 20 percent of the pool figure multiplied by the depository’s collateral-pledging level, plus the greater of: 1. One hundred ten percent of the average daily balance of public deposits in excess of its tangible equity capital; or 2. One hundred ten percent of the average daily balance of public deposits in excess of 20 percent of the pool figure. (b) Twenty-five percent of the average monthly balance of public deposits. (c) One hundred ten percent of the average daily balance of public deposits if the qualified public depository: 1. Has been established for less than 3 years; 2. Has experienced material decreases in its tangible equity capital; or 3. Has an overall financial condition that is materially deteriorating. (d) One hundred fifty percent of an established maximum amount of public deposits which has been mutually agreed upon by and between the Chief Financial Officer and the qualified public depository. (e) Minimum required collateral of $100,000. (f) An amount as required in special instructions from the Chief Financial Officer to protect the integrity of the public deposits program. (3) Each qualified public depository shall report its required collateral on the monthly report required in s. 280.16 and simultaneously pledge, deposit, or issue eligible collateral needed. (4) Additional collateral is required within 2 business days if public deposits are accepted that would increase the qualified public depository’s average daily balance for the current month by 25 percent over the average daily balance of the previously reported month. (5) Additional collateral of 20 percent of required collateral is necessary if a valuation date other than the close of business as described below has been approved for the qualified public depository and the required collateral is found to be insufficient based on the Chief Financial Officer’s valuation. (6) Each qualified public depository shall value its collateral in the following manner; it must: (a) Use a nationally recognized source. (b) Use market price, quality ratings, and pay-down factors as of the close of business on the last banking day in the reported month, or as of a date approved by the Chief Financial Officer. (c) Report any material decline in value that occurs before the date of mailing the monthly report, required in s. 280.16, to the Chief Financial Officer. (d) Use 100 percent of the maximum amount available under Federal Home Loan Bank letters of credit as market value. (7) A qualified public depository shall pledge, deposit, or issue additional eligible collateral between filing periods of the monthly report required in s. 280.16 when notified by the Chief Financial Officer that current market value of collateral does not meet required collateral. The pledge, deposit, or issuance of such additional collateral shall be made within 2 business days after the Chief Financial Officer’s notification. (8) A qualified public depository may be required to return public deposits to governmental units and be suspended or disqualified or subjected to administrative penalty as provided in s. 280.051 or s. 280.054 for failure to meet required collateral. (9) The Chief Financial Officer shall adopt rules for the establishment of collateral requirements, collateral pledging levels, required collateral calculations, and market value and clarifying terms.

Additional comparison processes may be performed as public deposits program resources permit. (d)1. Any related documents, reports, records, or other information deemed necessary by the Chief Financial Officer in order to ascertain compliance with this chapter, including, but not limited to, verifying the attestation required under s. 280.025. 2. If the Chief Financial Officer determines that the attestation required under s. 280.025 is materially false, he or she must report such determination to the Attorney General, who may bring a civil or administrative action for damages, injunctive relief, and such other relief as may be appropriate. If such action is successful, the Attorney General is entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs. 3. As related to federally chartered financial institutions, this paragraph may not be construed to create a power exceeding the visitorial powers of the Chief Financial Officer allowed under federal law.

Any qualified public depository which has been disqualified may not reapply for qualification until after the expiration of 1 year from the date of the final order of disqualification or the final disposition of any appeal taken therefrom. (b) In lieu of suspension or disqualification, impose an administrative penalty upon the qualified public depository as provided in s. 280.054. (c) If the Chief Financial Officer has reason to believe that any qualified public depository or any other financial institution holding public deposits is or has been violating this chapter or rules adopted hereunder or no longer meets the definition of a qualified public depository under s. 280.02, he or she may issue to the qualified public depository or other financial institution an order to cease and desist from the violation or to correct the condition giving rise to or resulting from the violation. If any qualified public depository or other financial institution violates a cease-and-desist or corrective order, the Chief Financial Officer may impose an administrative penalty upon the qualified public depository or other financial institution as provided in s. 280.054 or s. 280.055. In addition to the administrative penalty, the Chief Financial Officer may suspend or disqualify any qualified public depository for violation of any order issued pursuant to this paragraph.

The Chief Financial Officer shall determine such assessment for each qualified public depository by multiplying the total amount of any remaining loss to all public depositors by a percentage which represents the average monthly balance of public deposits held by each qualified public depository during the previous 12 months divided by the total average monthly balances of public deposits held by all qualified public depositories, excluding the defaulting depository, during the same period. The assessment calculation must be computed to six decimal places. (4) Each qualified public depository shall pay its assessment to the Chief Financial Officer within 7 business days after it receives notice of the assessment. If a depository fails to pay its assessment when due, the Chief Financial Officer shall satisfy the assessment by demanding payment under letters of credit or selling collateral pledged or deposited by that depository. (5) The Chief Financial Officer shall distribute the funds to the public depositors of the qualified public depository in default according to their validated claims. The Chief Financial Officer, at his or her discretion, may make partial payments to public depositors that have experienced a loss of public funds which payments are critical to the immediate operations of the public entity. The public depositor requesting partial payment of a claim shall provide the Chief Financial Officer with written documentation justifying the need for partial payment. (6) Public depositors receiving payment under the provisions of this section shall assign to the Chief Financial Officer any interest they may have in funds that may subsequently be made available to the qualified public depository in default. If the qualified public depository in default or its receiver provides the funds to the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Financial Officer shall distribute the funds, plus all accrued interest which has accumulated from the investment of the funds, if any, to the depositories which paid assessments on the same pro rata basis as the assessments were paid. (7) Expenses incurred by the Chief Financial Officer in connection with a default or insolvency which are not normally incurred by the Chief Financial Officer in the administration of this act must be paid out of the amount paid under letters of credit or proceeds from the sale of collateral.

The Chief Financial Officer must segregate and separately account for any collateral proceeds, assessments, or administrative penalties attributable to a credit union from any collateral proceeds, assessments, or administrative penalties attributable to any bank, savings bank, or savings association. Any administrative penalty collected pursuant to this chapter shall be deposited into the Treasury Administrative and Investment Trust Fund. (2) The Chief Financial Officer is authorized to pay any losses to public depositors from the fund, subject to the limitations provided in subsection (1), and there are hereby appropriated from the fund such sums as may be necessary from time to time to pay the losses. The term “losses,” for purposes of this chapter, must also include losses of interest or other accumulations to the public depositor as a result of penalties for early withdrawal required by Depository Institution Deregulatory Commission Regulations or applicable successor federal laws or regulations because of suspension or disqualification of a qualified public depository by the Chief Financial Officer pursuant to s. 280.05 or because of withdrawal from the public deposits program pursuant to s. 280.11. In that event, the Chief Financial Officer is authorized to assess against the suspended, disqualified, or withdrawing public depository, in addition to any amount authorized by any other provision of this chapter, an administrative penalty equal to the amount of the early withdrawal penalty and to pay that amount over to the public depositor as reimbursement for such loss. Any money in the fund estimated not to be needed for immediate cash requirements shall be invested pursuant to s. 17.61.
