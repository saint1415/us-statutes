The Legislature finds further that it is difficult for the public to make an informed choice when selecting a physician and that the consequences of a wrong decision could seriously harm the public health and safety. The primary legislative purpose in enacting this chapter is to ensure that every physician practicing in this state meets minimum requirements for safe practice. It is the legislative intent that physicians who fall below minimum competency or who otherwise present a danger to the public shall be prohibited from practicing in this state.",

The program shall provide for initial and periodic training in the grounds for disciplinary action, the actions which may be taken by the board and the department, changes in relevant statutes and rules, and any relevant judicial and administrative decisions. No member of the board shall participate on probable cause panels or in disciplinary decisions of the board unless he or she has completed the disciplinary training program. (5) During the time members are appointed to a probable cause panel, they shall attempt to complete their work on every case presented to them. In the event that consideration of a case is begun but not completed during the term of those members on the panel, they may reconvene as a probable cause panel for the purpose of completing their deliberations on that case. (6) All provisions of chapter 456 relating to activities of the board shall apply.

The board shall prescribe the additional requirements in a manner that permits the applicant to complete the requirements and be reexamined within 2 years after the date the applicant petitions the board to retake the examination a sixth or subsequent time. (3) Notwithstanding subparagraph (1)(f)3., a graduate of a foreign medical school that has not been excluded from consideration under s. 458.314(8) need not present the certificate issued by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates or pass the examination utilized by that commission if the graduate: (a) Has received a bachelor’s degree from an accredited United States college or university.

The provisions of this subsection shall control over any conflicting provisions of s. 120.60(1). (5) The board may not certify to the department for licensure any applicant who is under investigation in another jurisdiction for an offense which would constitute a violation of this chapter until such investigation is completed. Upon completion of the investigation, the provisions of s. 458.331 shall apply. Furthermore, the department may not issue an unrestricted license to any individual who has committed any act or offense in any jurisdiction which would constitute the basis for disciplining a physician pursuant to s. 458.331. When the board finds that an individual has committed an act or offense in any jurisdiction which would constitute the basis for disciplining a physician pursuant to s. 458.331, then the board may enter an order imposing one or more of the terms set forth in subsection (8). (6) Each applicant who meets the requirements of this chapter shall be licensed as a physician, with rights as defined by law. (7) Upon certification by the board, the department shall impose conditions, limitations, or restrictions on a license if the applicant is on probation in another jurisdiction for an act which would constitute a violation of this chapter. (8) When the board determines that any applicant for licensure has failed to meet, to the board’s satisfaction, each of the appropriate requirements set forth in this section, it may enter an order requiring one or more of the following terms: (a) Refusal to certify to the department an application for licensure, certification, or registration; (b) Certification to the department of an application for licensure, certification, or registration with restrictions on the scope of practice of the licensee; (c) Certification to the department of an application for licensure, certification, or registration with placement of the physician on probation for a period of time and subject to such conditions as the board may specify, including, but not limited to, requiring the physician to submit to treatment, attend continuing education courses, submit to reexamination, or work under the supervision of another physician; (d) Certification to the department of a person desiring to be licensed as a physician under this section who has held an active medical faculty certificate under s. 458.3145 for at least 3 years and has held a full-time faculty appointment for at least 3 consecutive years to teach in a program of medicine listed under s. 458.3145(1)(i); or (e) Certification to the department of an application for licensure submitted by a graduate of a foreign medical school that has not been excluded from consideration under s. 458.314(8) if the graduate has not completed an approved residency under sub-subparagraph (1)(f)2.c. or sub-subparagraph (1)(f)3.c. but meets the following criteria: 1. Has an active, unencumbered license to practice medicine in a foreign country; 2. Has actively practiced medicine during the entire 4-year period preceding the date of the submission of a licensure application; 3. Has completed a residency or substantially similar postgraduate medical training in a country recognized by his or her licensing jurisdiction which is substantially similar to a residency program accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, as determined by the board; 4. Has had his or her medical credentials evaluated by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates, holds an active, valid certificate issued by that commission, and has passed the examination used by that commission; and 5. Has an offer for full-time employment as a physician from a health care provider that operates in this state. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “health care provider” means a health care professional, health care facility, or entity licensed or certified to provide health services in this state as recognized by the board. An applicant who is not certified for unrestricted licensure under this paragraph may be certified by the board under paragraph (b) or paragraph (c), as applicable. A physician licensed after receiving certification under this paragraph must maintain his or her employment with the original employer or with another health care provider that operates in this state, at a location within this state, for at least 2 consecutive years after licensure, in accordance with rules adopted by the board. Such physician must notify the board within 5 business days after any change of employer.

      "text": "458.314 Certification of foreign educational institutions.— (1) The Legislature recognizes the need to ensure that graduates of foreign medical schools who have received an education which is reasonably comparable to that of similar accredited institutions in the United States and which adequately prepares its students for the practice of medicine shall be subject to the same licensure requirements as graduates of accredited medical schools or colleges. It is the purpose of this section to provide for the evaluation of foreign medical schools and the certification of those foreign medical schools which provide an education which is reasonably comparable to that of similar accredited institutions in the United States and which adequately prepares its students for the practice of medicine. (2) The department shall be responsible for the certification of foreign medical schools based on standards established pursuant to subsection (4). The department may contract with outside consultants or a national professional organization to survey and evaluate foreign medical schools. Such consultant or organization shall report to the department regarding its findings in the survey and evaluation. (3) The department shall establish a technical advisory group to review and comment upon the survey and evaluation of a foreign medical school contracted for by the department pursuant to subsection (2) prior to any final action by the department regarding certification of the foreign medical school. The technical advisory group shall be selected by the department and shall consist of four physicians, two of whom shall be selected from a list of five recognized United States medical educators recommended by the foreign school seeking certification. None of the members of the technical advisory group shall be affiliated with the school seeking certification. (4) Any foreign medical school which wishes to be certified pursuant to this section shall make application to the department for such certification, which shall be based upon a finding that the educational program of the foreign medical school is reasonably comparable to that of similar accredited institutions in the United States and adequately prepares its students for the practice of medicine. Curriculum, faculty qualifications, student attendance, plant and facilities, and other relevant factors shall be reviewed and evaluated. The board with the cooperation of the department shall identify, by rule, the standards and review procedures and methodology to be used in the certification process consistent with this subsection. The department shall not grant certification if deficiencies found are of such magnitude as to prevent the students in the school from receiving an educational base suitable for the practice of medicine. (5) Periodic surveys and evaluations of all certified schools shall be made to ensure continued compliance with this section. Certification shall include provisional and full certification. The provisional form of certification shall be for a period determined by the department not to exceed 3 years and shall be granted to an institution, in accordance with rule, to provide reasonable time for the school seeking permanent certification to overcome deficiencies found by the department. Prior to the expiration of a provisional certification and before the full certification is granted, the school shall be required to submit evidence that deficiencies noted at the time of initial application have been remedied. A school granted full certification shall provide evidence of continued compliance with this section. In the event that the department denies certification or recertification, the department shall give the school a specific listing of deficiencies which caused the department to disapprove it and what the department will require for compliance and shall permit the school, upon request, to demonstrate by satisfactory evidence, within 90 days, that it has remedied the deficiencies enumerated by the department. (6) A school shall pay a registration fee established by rule of the department, not to exceed $1,000, at the time of application for certification and shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses the department expects to incur, in an amount not to exceed $40,000, for the conduct of the certification survey. (7) The department shall renew a certification upon receipt of a renewal application from an institution and a fee not to exceed $500. Each fully certified institution shall provide a renewal application every 7 years. Any certification which is not renewed shall expire. (8) If a foreign medical school does not seek certification under this section, the board may, at its discretion, exclude the foreign medical school from consideration as an institution that provides medical education that is reasonably comparable to that of similar accredited institutions in the United States and that adequately prepares its students for the practice of medicine in this state. However, a license or medical faculty certificate issued to a physician under this chapter before July 1, 2024, is not affected by this subsection.

(2) The certificate authorizes the holder to practice only in conjunction with his or her faculty position at an accredited medical school and its affiliated clinical facilities or teaching hospitals that are registered with the Board of Medicine as sites at which holders of medical faculty certificates will be practicing, or a specialty-licensed children’s hospital licensed under chapter 395 that is affiliated with an accredited medical school and its affiliated clinics. Such certificate automatically expires when the holder’s relationship with the medical school is terminated or after a period of 24 months, whichever occurs sooner, and is renewable every 2 years by a holder who applies to the board on a form prescribed by the board and provides certification by the dean of the medical school that the holder is a distinguished medical scholar and an outstanding practicing physician. (3) The holder of a medical faculty certificate issued under this section has all rights and responsibilities prescribed by law for the holder of a license issued under s. 458.311, except as specifically provided otherwise by law. Such responsibilities include compliance with continuing medical education requirements as set forth by rule of the board. A hospital or ambulatory surgical center licensed under chapter 395, health maintenance organization certified under chapter 641, insurer as defined in s. 624.03, multiple-employer welfare arrangement as defined in s. 624.437, or any other entity in this state, in considering and acting upon an application for staff membership, clinical privileges, or other credentials as a health care provider, may not deny the application of an otherwise qualified physician for such staff membership, clinical privileges, or other credentials solely because the applicant is a holder of a medical faculty certificate under this section. (4) Annual review of all such certificate recipients will be made by the deans of the accredited 4-year medical schools provided in paragraph (1)(i) and reported to the Board of Medicine. (5) Notwithstanding subsection (1), any physician, when providing medical care or treatment in connection with the education of students, residents, or faculty at the request of the dean of an accredited medical school within this state or at the request of the medical director of a statutory teaching hospital as defined in s. 408.07 or a specialty-licensed children’s hospital licensed under chapter 395 that is affiliated with an accredited medical school and its affiliated clinics, may do so upon registration with the board and demonstration of financial responsibility pursuant to s. 458.320(1) or (2) unless such physician is exempt under s. 458.320(5)(a). The performance of such medical care or treatment must be limited to a single period of time, which may not exceed 180 consecutive days, and must be rendered within a facility registered under subsection (2) or within a statutory teaching hospital as defined in s. 408.07. A registration fee not to exceed $300, as set by the board, is required of each physician registered under this subsection. However, no more than three physicians per year per institution may be registered under this subsection, and an exemption under this subsection may not be granted to a physician more than once in any given 5-year period.

However, a physician who is not fully retired in all jurisdictions may use a limited license only for noncompensated practice. If the person applying for a limited license submits a statement from the employing agency or institution stating that he or she will not receive compensation for any service involving the practice of medicine, the application fee and all licensure fees shall be waived. However, any person who receives a waiver of fees for a limited license shall pay such fees if the person receives compensation for the practice of medicine. (b) If it has been more than 3 years since active practice was conducted by the applicant, the full-time director of the county health department or a licensed physician, approved by the board, must supervise the applicant for a period of 6 months after he or she is granted a limited license under this subsection, unless the board determines that a shorter period of supervision will be sufficient to ensure that the applicant is qualified for licensure. Procedures for such supervision must be established by the board. (c) The recipient of a limited license under this subsection may practice only in the employ of public agencies or institutions or nonprofit agencies or institutions meeting the requirements of s. 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, which agencies or institutions are located in the areas of critical medical need as determined by the board. Determination of medically underserved areas shall be made by the board after consultation with the department and statewide medical organizations; however, such determination shall include, but not be limited to, health professional shortage areas designated by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. A recipient of a limited license under this subsection may use the license to work for any approved employer in any area of critical need approved by the board. (d) The recipient of a limited license shall, within 30 days after accepting employment, notify the board of all approved institutions in which the licensee practices and of all approved institutions where practice privileges have been denied. (e) This subsection does not limit any policy by the board, otherwise authorized by law, to grant licenses to physicians duly licensed in other states under conditions less restrictive than the requirements of this subsection. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, the board may refuse to authorize a physician otherwise qualified to practice in the employ of any agency or institution otherwise qualified if the agency or institution has caused or permitted violations of the provisions of this chapter which it knew or should have known were occurring. (f) The board shall notify the director of the full-time local county health department of any county in which a licensee intends to practice under this subsection. The director of the full-time county health department shall assist in the supervision of any licensee within the county and shall notify the board if he or she becomes aware of any actions by the licensee which would be grounds for revocation of the limited license. The board shall establish procedures for such supervision. (g) The board shall review the practice of each licensee biennially to verify compliance with the restrictions prescribed in this subsection and other applicable provisions of this chapter. (h) Any person holding an active license to practice medicine in this state may convert that license to a limited license under this subsection for the purpose of providing volunteer, uncompensated care for low-income Floridians. The applicant must submit a statement from the employing agency or institution stating that he or she will not receive compensation for any service involving the practice of medicine. The application fee and all licensure fees, including neurological injury compensation assessments, are waived for such applicant. (2) GRADUATE ASSISTANT PHYSICIANS.—A graduate assistant physician is a medical school graduate who meets the requirements of this subsection and has obtained a limited license from the board for the purpose of practicing temporarily under the direct supervision of a physician who has a full, active, and unencumbered license issued under this chapter, pending the graduate’s entrance into a residency under the National Resident Match Program. (a) Any person desiring to obtain a limited license as a graduate assistant physician must submit to the board an application and demonstrate that he or she meets all of the following criteria: 1. Is a graduate of an allopathic medical school or allopathic college approved by an accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education. 2. Has successfully passed all parts of the United States Medical Licensing Examination. 3.

(b) The board shall issue a graduate assistant physician limited license for a duration of 2 years to an applicant who meets the requirements of paragraph (a) and all of the following criteria: 1. Is at least 21 years of age. 2. Is of good moral character. 3. Submits documentation that the applicant has agreed to enter into a written protocol drafted by a physician with a full, active, and unencumbered license issued under this chapter upon the board’s issuance of a limited license to the applicant and submits a copy of the protocol. The board shall establish by rule specific provisions that must be included in a physician-drafted protocol. 4. Has not committed any act or offense in this or any other jurisdiction which would constitute the basis for disciplining a physician under s. 458.331. 5.

The board may not certify to the department for limited licensure under this subsection any applicant who is under investigation in another jurisdiction for an offense which would constitute a violation of this chapter or chapter 456 until such investigation is completed. Upon completion of the investigation, s. 458.331 applies. Furthermore, the department may not issue a limited license to any individual who has committed any act or offense in any jurisdiction which would constitute the basis for disciplining a physician under s. 458.331. If the board finds that an individual has committed an act or offense in any jurisdiction which would constitute the basis for disciplining a physician under s. 458.331, the board may enter an order imposing one of the following terms: a. Refusal to certify to the department an application for a graduate assistant physician limited license; or b. Certification to the department of an application for a graduate assistant physician limited license with restrictions on the scope of practice of the licensee. (c) A graduate assistant physician limited licensee may apply for a one-time renewal of his or her limited license by submitting a board-approved application, documentation of actual practice under the required protocol during the initial limited licensure period, and documentation of applications he or she has submitted for accredited graduate medical education training programs. The one-time renewal terminates after 1 year. A graduate assistant physician who has received a limited license under this subsection is not eligible to apply for another limited license, regardless of whether he or she received a one-time renewal under this paragraph. (d) A limited licensed graduate assistant physician may provide health care services only under the direct supervision of a physician with a full, active, and unencumbered license issued under this chapter. (e) A physician must be approved by the board to supervise a limited licensed graduate assistant physician. (f) A physician may supervise no more than two graduate assistant physicians with limited licenses. (g) Supervision of limited licensed graduate assistant physicians requires the physical presence of the supervising physician at the location where the services are rendered. (h) A physician-drafted protocol must specify the duties and responsibilities of the limited licensed graduate assistant physician according to criteria adopted by board rule. (i) Each protocol that applies to a limited licensed graduate assistant physician and his or her supervising physician must ensure that: 1. There is a process for the evaluation of the limited licensed graduate assistant physicians’ performance; and 2. The delegation of any medical task or procedure is within the supervising physician’s scope of practice and appropriate for the graduate assistant physician’s level of competency. (j) A limited licensed graduate assistant physician’s prescriptive authority is governed by the physician-drafted protocol and criteria adopted by the board and may not exceed that of his or her supervising physician. Any prescriptions and orders issued by the graduate assistant physician must identify both the graduate assistant physician and the supervising physician. (k) A physician who supervises a graduate assistant physician is liable for any acts or omissions of the graduate assistant physician acting under the physician’s supervision and control. Third-party payors may reimburse employers of graduate assistant physicians for covered services rendered by graduate assistant physicians.

      "text": "458.319 Renewal of license.— (1) The department shall renew a license upon receipt of the renewal application, evidence that the applicant has actively practiced medicine or has been on the active teaching faculty of an accredited medical school for at least 2 years of the immediately preceding 4 years, and a fee not to exceed $500; provided, however, that if the licensee is either a resident physician, assistant resident physician, fellow, house physician, or intern in an approved postgraduate training program, as defined by the board by rule, the fee shall not exceed $100 per annum. If the licensee has not actively practiced medicine for at least 2 years of the immediately preceding 4 years, the board shall require that the licensee successfully complete a board-approved clinical competency examination prior to renewal of the license. “Actively practiced medicine” means that practice of medicine by physicians, including those employed by any governmental entity in community or public health, as defined by this chapter, including physicians practicing administrative medicine. An applicant for a renewed license must also submit the information required under s. 456.039 to the department on a form and under procedures specified by the department, along with payment in an amount equal to the costs incurred by the Department of Health for the statewide criminal background check of the applicant. The applicant must submit a set of fingerprints to the Department of Health on a form and under procedures specified by the department, along with payment in an amount equal to the costs incurred by the department for a national criminal background check of the applicant for the initial renewal of his or her license after January 1, 2000. If the applicant fails to submit either the information required under s. 456.039 or a set of fingerprints to the department as required by this section, the department shall issue a notice of noncompliance, and the applicant will be given 30 additional days to comply. If the applicant fails to comply within 30 days after the notice of noncompliance is issued, the department or board, as appropriate, may issue a citation to the applicant and may fine the applicant up to $50 for each day that the applicant is not in compliance with the requirements of s. 456.039. The citation must clearly state that the applicant may choose, in lieu of accepting the citation, to follow the procedure under s. 456.073. If the applicant disputes the matter in the citation, the procedures set forth in s. 456.073 must be followed. However, if the applicant does not dispute the matter in the citation with the department within 30 days after the citation is served, the citation becomes a final order and constitutes discipline. Service of a citation may be made by personal service or certified mail, restricted delivery, to the subject at the applicant’s last known address. If an applicant has submitted fingerprints to the department for a national criminal history check upon initial licensure and is renewing his or her license for the first time, then the applicant need only submit the information and fee required for a statewide criminal history check. (2) The department shall adopt rules establishing a procedure for the biennial renewal of licenses. (3) The licensee must have on file with the department the address of his or her primary place of practice within this state prior to engaging in that practice. Prior to changing the address of the primary place of practice, whether or not within this state, the licensee shall notify the department of the address of the new primary place of practice. (4)(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter or chapter 456, the requirements for the biennial renewal of the license of any licensee who is a member of the Legislature shall stand continued and extended without the requirement of any filing by such a licensee of any notice or application for renewal with the board or the department and such licensee’s license shall be an active status license under this chapter, throughout the period that the licensee is a member of the Legislature and for a period of 60 days after the licensee ceases to be a member of the Legislature. (b) At any time during the licensee’s legislative term of office and during the period of 60 days after the licensee ceases to be a member of the Legislature, the licensee may file a completed renewal application that shall consist solely of: 1. A license renewal fee of $250 for each year the licensee’s license renewal has been continued and extended pursuant to the terms of this subsection since the last otherwise regularly scheduled biennial renewal year and each year during which the renewed license shall be effective until the next regularly scheduled biennial renewal date; 2. Documentation of the completion by the licensee of 10 hours of continuing medical education credits for each year from the effective date of the last renewed license for the licensee until the year in which the application is filed; and 3. The information from the licensee expressly required in s. 456.039(1)(a)1.-8. and (b), and (4)(a), (b), and (c). (c) The department and board may not impose any additional requirements for the renewal of such licenses and, not later than 20 days after receipt of a completed application as specified in paragraph (b), shall renew the active status license of the licensee, effective on and retroactive to the last previous renewal date of the licensee’s license. This license renewal shall be valid until the next regularly scheduled biennial renewal date for such license, and thereafter shall be subject to the biennial requirements for renewal in this chapter and chapter 456.

If timely payment is not made by the physician, the department shall suspend the license of the physician pursuant to procedures set forth in subparagraphs (5)(g)3., 4., and 5. Nothing in this paragraph shall abrogate a judgment debtor’s obligation to satisfy the entire amount of any judgment. (5) The requirements of subsections (1), (2), and (3) do not apply to: (a) Any person licensed under this chapter who practices medicine exclusively as an officer, employee, or agent of the Federal Government or of the state or its agencies or its subdivisions. For the purposes of this subsection, an agent of the state, its agencies, or its subdivisions is a person who is eligible for coverage under any self-insurance or insurance program authorized by the provisions of s. 768.28(16). (b) Any person whose license has become inactive under this chapter and who is not practicing medicine in this state. Any person applying for reactivation of a license must show either that such licensee maintained tail insurance coverage which provided liability coverage for incidents that occurred on or after January 1, 1987, or the initial date of licensure in this state, whichever is later, and incidents that occurred before the date on which the license became inactive; or such licensee must submit an affidavit stating that such licensee has no unsatisfied medical malpractice judgments or settlements at the time of application for reactivation. (c) Any person holding a limited license pursuant to s. 458.317 and practicing under the scope of such limited license. (d) Any person licensed or certified under this chapter who practices only in conjunction with his or her teaching duties at an accredited medical school or in its main teaching hospitals. Such person may engage in the practice of medicine to the extent that such practice is incidental to and a necessary part of duties in connection with the teaching position in the medical school. (e) Any person holding an active license under this chapter who is not practicing medicine in this state. If such person initiates or resumes any practice of medicine in this state, he or she must notify the department of such activity and fulfill the financial responsibility requirements of this section before resuming the practice of medicine in this state. (f) Any person holding an active license under this chapter who meets all of the following criteria: 1. The licensee has held an active license to practice in this state or another state or some combination thereof for more than 15 years. 2. The licensee has either retired from the practice of medicine or maintains a part-time practice of no more than 1,000 patient contact hours per year. 3. The licensee has had no more than two claims for medical malpractice resulting in an indemnity exceeding $25,000 within the previous 5-year period. 4. The licensee has not been convicted of, or pled guilty or nolo contendere to, any criminal violation specified in this chapter or the medical practice act of any other state. 5. The licensee has not been subject within the last 10 years of practice to license revocation or suspension for any period of time; probation for a period of 3 years or longer; or a fine of $500 or more for a violation of this chapter or the medical practice act of another jurisdiction. The regulatory agency’s acceptance of a physician’s relinquishment of a license, stipulation, consent order, or other settlement, offered in response to or in anticipation of the filing of administrative charges against the physician’s license, constitutes action against the physician’s license for the purposes of this paragraph. 6. The licensee has submitted a form supplying necessary information as required by the department and an affidavit affirming compliance with this paragraph. 7. The licensee must submit biennially to the department certification stating compliance with the provisions of this paragraph. The licensee must, upon request, demonstrate to the department information verifying compliance with this paragraph. A licensee who meets the requirements of this paragraph must post notice in the form of a sign prominently displayed in the reception area and clearly noticeable by all patients or provide a written statement to any person to whom medical services are being provided. The sign or statement must read as follows: “Under Florida law, physicians are generally required to carry medical malpractice insurance or otherwise demonstrate financial responsibility to cover potential claims for medical malpractice. However, certain part-time physicians who meet state requirements are exempt from the financial responsibility law. YOUR DOCTOR MEETS THESE REQUIREMENTS AND HAS DECIDED NOT TO CARRY MEDICAL MALPRACTICE INSURANCE. This notice is provided pursuant to Florida law.” (g) Any person holding an active license under this chapter who agrees to meet all of the following criteria: 1. Upon the entry of an adverse final judgment arising from a medical malpractice arbitration award, from a claim of medical malpractice either in contract or tort, or from noncompliance with the terms of a settlement agreement arising from a claim of medical malpractice either in contract or tort, the licensee shall pay the judgment creditor the lesser of the entire amount of the judgment with all accrued interest or either $100,000, if the physician is licensed pursuant to this chapter but does not maintain hospital staff privileges, or $250,000, if the physician is licensed pursuant to this chapter and maintains hospital staff privileges, within 60 days after the date such judgment became final and subject to execution, unless otherwise mutually agreed to in writing by the parties. Such adverse final judgment shall include any cross-claim, counterclaim, or claim for indemnity or contribution arising from the claim of medical malpractice. Upon notification of the existence of an unsatisfied judgment or payment pursuant to this subparagraph, the department shall notify the licensee by certified mail that he or she shall be subject to disciplinary action unless, within 30 days from the date of mailing, he or she either: a. Shows proof that the unsatisfied judgment has been paid in the amount specified in this subparagraph; or b. Furnishes the department with a copy of a timely filed notice of appeal and either: (I) A copy of a supersedeas bond properly posted in the amount required by law; or (II) An order from a court of competent jurisdiction staying execution on the final judgment pending disposition of the appeal. 2. The Department of Health shall issue an emergency order suspending the license of any licensee who, after 30 days following receipt of a notice from the Department of Health, has failed to: satisfy a medical malpractice claim against him or her; furnish the Department of Health a copy of a timely filed notice of appeal; furnish the Department of Health a copy of a supersedeas bond properly posted in the amount required by law; or furnish the Department of Health an order from a court of competent jurisdiction staying execution on the final judgment pending disposition of the appeal. 3. Upon the next meeting of the probable cause panel of the board following 30 days after the date of mailing the notice of disciplinary action to the licensee, the panel shall make a determination of whether probable cause exists to take disciplinary action against the licensee pursuant to subparagraph 1. 4. If the board determines that the factual requirements of subparagraph 1. are met, it shall take disciplinary action as it deems appropriate against the licensee. Such disciplinary action shall include, at a minimum, probation of the license with the restriction that the licensee must make payments to the judgment creditor on a schedule determined by the board to be reasonable and within the financial capability of the physician. Notwithstanding any other disciplinary penalty imposed, the disciplinary penalty may include suspension of the license for a period not to exceed 5 years. In the event that an agreement to satisfy a judgment has been met, the board shall remove any restriction on the license. 5. The licensee has completed a form supplying necessary information as required by the department. A licensee who meets the requirements of this paragraph shall be required either to post notice in the form of a sign prominently displayed in the reception area and clearly noticeable by all patients or to provide a written statement to any person to whom medical services are being provided. Such sign or statement shall state: “Under Florida law, physicians are generally required to carry medical malpractice insurance or otherwise demonstrate financial responsibility to cover potential claims for medical malpractice. YOUR DOCTOR HAS DECIDED NOT TO CARRY MEDICAL MALPRACTICE INSURANCE. This is permitted under Florida law subject to certain conditions. Florida law imposes penalties against noninsured physicians who fail to satisfy adverse judgments arising from claims of medical malpractice. This notice is provided pursuant to Florida law.” (6) Any deceptive, untrue, or fraudulent representation by the licensee with respect to any provision of this section shall result in permanent disqualification from any exemption to mandated financial responsibility as provided in this section and shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action under s. 458.331. (7) Any licensee who relies on any exemption from the financial responsibility requirement shall notify the department, in writing, of any change of circumstance regarding his or her qualifications for such exemption and shall demonstrate that he or she is in compliance with the requirements of this section. (8) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the department shall suspend the license of any physician against whom has been entered a final judgment, arbitration award, or other order or who has entered into a settlement agreement to pay damages arising out of a claim for medical malpractice, if all appellate remedies have been exhausted and payment up to the amounts required by this section has not been made within 30 days after the entering of such judgment, award, or order or agreement, until proof of payment is received by the department or a payment schedule has been agreed upon by the physician and the claimant and presented to the department. This subsection does not apply to a physician who has met the financial responsibility requirements in paragraphs (1)(b) and (2)(b). (9) The board shall adopt rules to implement the provisions of this section.

A requirement that the facility provide all of the following information to the physician: a. The name and address of the facility. b. The certifying or accrediting organization. c. The type and scope of certification or accreditation. d. The effective and expiration dates of the certification or accreditation. e. Any limitations or conditions imposed by the certifying or accrediting organization. 2. A requirement that the facility notify the physician within 30 days after any change in certification or accreditation status, including renewal, suspension, revocation, or expiration. (4) In the performance of any procedure using or purporting to use stem cells or products containing stem cells, the physician shall use stem cell therapy products obtained from facilities that adhere to the applicable current good manufacturing practices for the collection, removal, processing, implantation, and transfer of stem cells, or products containing stem cells, pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. ss. 301 et seq.; 52 Stat. 1040 et seq.; and 21 C.F.R. part 1271, Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products. (5)(a) A physician who conducts stem cell therapy pursuant to this section shall include the following in any form of advertisement: THIS NOTICE MUST BE PROVIDED TO YOU UNDER FLORIDA LAW.

      "text": "458.326 Intractable pain; authorized treatment.— (1) For the purposes of this section, the term “intractable pain” means pain for which, in the generally accepted course of medical practice, the cause cannot be removed and otherwise treated. (2) Intractable pain must be diagnosed by a physician licensed under this chapter and qualified by experience to render such diagnosis. (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a physician may prescribe or administer any controlled substance under Schedules II-V, as provided for in s. 893.03, to a person for the treatment of intractable pain, provided the physician does so in accordance with that level of care, skill, and treatment recognized by a reasonably prudent physician under similar conditions and circumstances. (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to condone, authorize, or approve mercy killing or euthanasia, and no treatment authorized by this section may be used for such purpose.

      "text": "458.3265 Pain-management clinics.— (1) REGISTRATION.— 1 (a)1. As used in this section, the term: a. “Board eligible” means successful completion of an anesthesia, physical medicine and rehabilitation, rheumatology, or neurology residency program approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education or the American Osteopathic Association for a period of 6 years from successful completion of such residency program. b. “Chronic nonmalignant pain” means pain unrelated to cancer which persists beyond the usual course of disease or the injury that is the cause of the pain or more than 90 days after surgery. c. “Pain-management clinic” or “clinic” means any publicly or privately owned facility: (I) That advertises in any medium for any type of pain-management services; or (II) Where in any month a majority of patients are prescribed opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or carisoprodol for the treatment of chronic nonmalignant pain. 2. Each pain-management clinic must register with the department or hold a valid certificate of exemption pursuant to subsection (2). 3. The following clinics are exempt from the registration requirement of paragraphs (c)-(m) and must apply to the department for a certificate of exemption: a. A clinic licensed as a facility pursuant to chapter 395; b. A clinic in which the majority of the physicians who provide services in the clinic primarily provide surgical services; c. A clinic owned by a publicly held corporation whose shares are traded on a national exchange or on the over-the-counter market and whose total assets at the end of the corporation’s most recent fiscal quarter exceeded $50 million; d. A clinic affiliated with an accredited medical school at which training is provided for medical students, residents, or fellows; e. A clinic that does not prescribe controlled substances for the treatment of pain; f. A clinic owned by a corporate entity exempt from federal taxation under 26 U.S.C. s. 501(c)(3); g. A clinic wholly owned and operated by one or more board-eligible or board-certified anesthesiologists, physiatrists, rheumatologists, or neurologists; or h. A clinic wholly owned and operated by a physician multispecialty practice where one or more board-eligible or board-certified medical specialists, who have also completed fellowships in pain medicine approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education or who are also board-certified in pain medicine by the American Board of Pain Medicine or a board approved by the American Board of Medical Specialties, the American Board of Physician Specialties, or the American Osteopathic Association, perform interventional pain procedures of the type routinely billed using surgical codes. (b) Each clinic location shall be registered separately regardless of whether the clinic is operated under the same business name or management as another clinic. (c) As a part of registration, a clinic must designate a physician who is responsible for complying with all requirements related to registration and operation of the clinic in compliance with this section. Within 10 days after termination of a designated physician, the clinic must notify the department of the identity of another designated physician for that clinic. The designated physician shall have a full, active, and unencumbered license under this chapter or chapter 459 and shall practice at the clinic location for which the physician has assumed responsibility. Failing to have a licensed designated physician practicing at the location of the registered clinic may be the basis for a summary suspension of the clinic registration certificate as described in s. 456.073(8) for a license or s. 120.60(6). (d) The department shall deny registration to any clinic that is not fully owned by a physician licensed under this chapter or chapter 459 or a group of physicians, each of whom is licensed under this chapter or chapter 459; or that is not a health care clinic licensed under part X of chapter 400. (e) The department shall deny registration to any pain-management clinic owned by or with any contractual or employment relationship with a physician: 1. Whose Drug Enforcement Administration number has ever been revoked. 2. Whose application for a license to prescribe, dispense, or administer a controlled substance has been denied by any jurisdiction. 3. Who has been convicted of or pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to, regardless of adjudication, an offense that constitutes a felony for receipt of illicit and diverted drugs, including a controlled substance listed in Schedule I, Schedule II, Schedule III, Schedule IV, or Schedule V of s. 893.03, in this state, any other state, or the United States. (f) If the department finds that a pain-management clinic does not meet the requirement of paragraph (d) or is owned, directly or indirectly, by a person meeting any criteria listed in paragraph (e), the department shall revoke the certificate of registration previously issued by the department. As determined by rule, the department may grant an exemption to denying a registration or revoking a previously issued registration if more than 10 years have elapsed since adjudication. As used in this subsection, the term “convicted” includes an adjudication of guilt following a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or the forfeiture of a bond when charged with a crime. (g) The department may revoke the clinic’s certificate of registration and prohibit all physicians associated with that pain-management clinic from practicing at that clinic location based upon an annual inspection and evaluation of the factors described in subsection (4). (h) If the registration of a pain-management clinic is revoked or suspended, the designated physician of the pain-management clinic, the owner or lessor of the pain-management clinic property, the manager, and the proprietor shall cease to operate the facility as a pain-management clinic as of the effective date of the suspension or revocation. (i) If a pain-management clinic registration is revoked or suspended, the designated physician of the pain-management clinic, the owner or lessor of the clinic property, the manager, or the proprietor is responsible for removing all signs and symbols identifying the premises as a pain-management clinic. (j) Upon the effective date of the suspension or revocation, the designated physician of the pain-management clinic shall advise the department of the disposition of the medicinal drugs located on the premises. The disposition is subject to the supervision and approval of the department. Medicinal drugs that are purchased or held by a pain-management clinic that is not registered may be deemed adulterated pursuant to s. 499.006. (k) If the clinic’s registration is revoked, any person named in the registration documents of the pain-management clinic, including persons owning or operating the pain-management clinic, may not, as an individual or as a part of a group, apply to operate a pain-management clinic for 5 years after the date the registration is revoked. (l) The period of suspension for the registration of a pain-management clinic shall be prescribed by the department, but may not exceed 1 year. (m) A change of ownership of a registered pain-management clinic requires submission of a new registration application. (2) CERTIFICATE OF EXEMPTION.— (a) A pain management clinic claiming an exemption from the registration requirements of subsection (1) must apply for a certificate of exemption on a form adopted in rule by the department. The form must require the applicant to provide: 1. The name or names under which the applicant does business. 2. The address at which the pain management clinic is located. 3. The specific exemption the applicant is claiming with supporting documentation. 4. Any other information deemed necessary by the department. (b) The department must approve or deny the certificate within 30 days after the receipt of a complete application. (c) The certificate of exemption must be renewed biennially, except that the department may issue the initial certificates of exemption for up to 3 years in order to stagger renewal dates. (d) A certificateholder must prominently display the certificate of exemption and make it available to the department or the board upon request. (e) A new certificate of exemption is required for a change of address and is not transferable. A certificate of exemption is valid only for the applicant, qualifying owners, licenses, registrations, certifications, and services provided under a specific statutory exemption and is valid only to the specific exemption claimed and granted. (f) A certificateholder must notify the department at least 60 days before any anticipated relocation or name change of the pain management clinic or a change of ownership. (g) If a pain management clinic no longer qualifies for a certificate of exemption, the certificateholder must notify the department within 3 days after becoming aware that the clinic no longer qualifies for a certificate of exemption and register as a pain management clinic under subsection (1) or cease operations. (3) PHYSICIAN RESPONSIBILITIES.—These responsibilities apply to any physician who provides professional services in a pain-management clinic that is required to be registered in subsection (1). (a) A physician may not practice medicine in a pain-management clinic, as described in subsection (5), if the pain-management clinic is not registered with the department as required by this section. Any physician who qualifies to practice medicine in a pain-management clinic pursuant to rules adopted by the Board of Medicine as of July 1, 2012, may continue to practice medicine in a pain-management clinic as long as the physician continues to meet the qualifications set forth in the board rules. A physician who violates this paragraph is subject to disciplinary action by his or her appropriate medical regulatory board. (b) Only a physician licensed under this chapter or chapter 459 may dispense medication or prescribe a controlled substance regulated under chapter 893 on the premises of a registered pain-management clinic. (c) A physician, a physician assistant, or an advanced practice registered nurse must perform a physical examination of a patient on the same day that the physician prescribes a controlled substance to a patient at a pain-management clinic. If the physician prescribes more than a 72-hour dose of controlled substances for the treatment of chronic nonmalignant pain, the physician must document in the patient’s record the reason for prescribing that quantity. (d) A physician authorized to prescribe controlled substances who practices at a pain-management clinic is responsible for maintaining the control and security of his or her prescription blanks or electronic prescribing software used for prescribing controlled substance pain medication. A physician who issues written prescriptions shall comply with the requirements for counterfeit-resistant prescription blanks in s. 893.065 and the rules adopted pursuant to that section. A physician shall notify, in writing, the department within 24 hours after any theft or loss of a prescription blank or breach of his or her electronic prescribing software used for prescribing pain medication. (e) The designated physician of a pain-management clinic shall notify the applicable board in writing of the date of termination of employment within 10 days after terminating his or her employment with a pain-management clinic that is required to be registered under subsection (1). Each physician practicing in a pain-management clinic shall advise the Board of Medicine, in writing, within 10 calendar days after beginning or ending his or her practice at a pain-management clinic. (f) Each physician practicing in a pain-management clinic is responsible for ensuring compliance with the following facility and physical operations requirements: 1. A pain-management clinic shall be located and operated at a publicly accessible fixed location and must: a. Display a sign that can be viewed by the public that contains the clinic name, hours of operations, and a street address. b. Have a publicly listed telephone number and a dedicated phone number to send and receive faxes with a fax machine that shall be operational 24 hours per day. c.

Display a printed sign located in a conspicuous place in the waiting room viewable by the public with the name and contact information of the clinic’s designated physician and the names of all physicians practicing in the clinic. j. If the clinic stores and dispenses prescription drugs, comply with ss. 499.0121 and 893.07. 2. This section does not excuse a physician from providing any treatment or performing any medical duty without the proper equipment and materials as required by the standard of care. This section does not supersede the level of care, skill, and treatment recognized in general law related to health care licensure. (g) Each physician practicing in a pain-management clinic is responsible for ensuring compliance with the following infection control requirements. 1. The clinic shall maintain equipment and supplies to support infection prevention and control activities. 2. The clinic shall identify infection risks based on the following: a. Geographic location, community, and population served. b. The care, treatment, and services it provides. c. An analysis of its infection surveillance and control data. 3. The clinic shall maintain written infection prevention policies and procedures that address the following: a. Prioritized risks. b. Limiting unprotected exposure to pathogens. c. Limiting the transmission of infections associated with procedures performed in the clinic. d. Limiting the transmission of infections associated with the clinic’s use of medical equipment, devices, and supplies.

The clinic, including its grounds, buildings, furniture, appliances, and equipment shall be structurally sound, in good repair, clean, and free from health and safety hazards. 2. The clinic shall have evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, which shall include provisions for the evacuation of disabled patients and employees. 3. The clinic shall have a written facility-specific disaster plan setting forth actions that will be taken in the event of clinic closure due to unforeseen disasters and shall include provisions for the protection of medical records and any controlled substances. 4. Each clinic shall have at least one employee on the premises during patient care hours who is certified in Basic Life Support and is trained in reacting to accidents and medical emergencies until emergency medical personnel arrive. (i) The designated physician is responsible for ensuring compliance with the following quality assurance requirements. Each pain-management clinic shall have an ongoing quality assurance program that objectively and systematically monitors and evaluates the quality and appropriateness of patient care, evaluates methods to improve patient care, identifies and corrects deficiencies within the facility, alerts the designated physician to identify and resolve recurring problems, and provides for opportunities to improve the facility’s performance and to enhance and improve the quality of care provided to the public. The designated physician shall establish a quality assurance program that includes the following components: 1. The identification, investigation, and analysis of the frequency and causes of adverse incidents to patients. 2. The identification of trends or patterns of incidents. 3. The development of measures to correct, reduce, minimize, or eliminate the risk of adverse incidents to patients. 4. The documentation of these functions and periodic review no less than quarterly of such information by the designated physician.

The number of patients treated at the pain clinic whose domicile is located somewhere other than in this state. A patient’s domicile is the patient’s fixed or permanent home to which he or she intends to return even though he or she may temporarily reside elsewhere. (4) INSPECTION.— (a) The department shall inspect the pain-management clinic annually, including a review of the patient records, to ensure that it complies with this section and the rules of the Board of Medicine adopted pursuant to subsection (5) unless the clinic is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency approved by the Board of Medicine. (b) During an onsite inspection, the department shall make a reasonable attempt to discuss each violation with the owner or designated physician of the pain-management clinic before issuing a formal written notification. (c) Any action taken to correct a violation shall be documented in writing by the owner or designated physician of the pain-management clinic and verified by followup visits by departmental personnel. (5) RULEMAKING.— (a) The department shall adopt rules necessary to administer the registration, exemption, and inspection of pain-management clinics which establish the specific requirements, procedures, forms, and fees. (b) The Board of Medicine shall adopt rules setting forth training requirements for all facility health care practitioners who are not regulated by another board. (6) PENALTIES; ENFORCEMENT.— (a) The department may impose an administrative fine on the clinic of up to $5,000 per violation for violating the requirements of this section; chapter 499, the Florida Drug and Cosmetic Act; 21 U.S.C. ss. 301-392, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; 21 U.S.C. ss. 821 et seq., the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act; chapter 893, the Florida Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act; or the rules of the department. In determining whether a penalty is to be imposed, and in fixing the amount of the fine, the department shall consider the following factors: 1. The gravity of the violation, including the probability that death or serious physical or emotional harm to a patient has resulted, or could have resulted, from the pain-management clinic’s actions or the actions of the physician, the severity of the action or potential harm, and the extent to which the provisions of the applicable laws or rules were violated. 2. What actions, if any, the owner or designated physician took to correct the violations. 3. Whether there were any previous violations at the pain-management clinic. 4. The financial benefits that the pain-management clinic derived from committing or continuing to commit the violation. (b) Each day a violation continues after the date fixed for termination of the violation as ordered by the department constitutes an additional, separate, and distinct violation. (c) The department may impose a fine and, in the case of an owner-operated pain-management clinic, revoke or deny a pain-management clinic’s registration, if the clinic’s designated physician knowingly and intentionally misrepresents actions taken to correct a violation. (d) An owner or designated physician of a pain-management clinic who concurrently operates an unregistered pain-management clinic is subject to an administrative fine of $5,000 per day. (e) If the owner of a pain-management clinic that requires registration fails to apply to register the clinic upon a change of ownership and operates the clinic under the new ownership, the owner is subject to a fine of $5,000.

(h) The actual costs of registration and inspection or accreditation shall be paid by the person seeking to register and operate the office in which a procedure or surgery identified in paragraph (a) will be performed. (2) STANDARDS OF PRACTICE.— (a) A physician may not perform any surgery or procedure identified in paragraph (1)(a) in a setting other than an office surgery setting registered under this section or a facility licensed under chapter 390 or chapter 395, as applicable. The board shall impose a fine of $5,000 per incident on a physician who violates this paragraph. (b) Office surgeries may not: 1. Be a type of surgery that generally results in blood loss of more than 10 percent of estimated blood volume in a patient with a normal hemoglobin level; 2. Require major or prolonged intracranial, intrathoracic, abdominal, or joint replacement procedures, except for laparoscopic procedures; 3. Involve major blood vessels and be performed with direct visualization by open exposure of the major blood vessel, except for percutaneous endovascular intervention; or 4. Be emergent or life threatening. (c) A physician performing a gluteal fat grafting procedure in an office surgery setting shall adhere to standards of practice under this subsection and rules adopted by the board which include, but are not limited to, all of the following: 1. A physician performing a gluteal fat grafting procedure must conduct an in-person examination of the patient while physically present in the same room as the patient no later than the day before the procedure. 2. Before a physician may delegate any duties during a gluteal fat grafting procedure, the patient must provide written, informed consent for such delegation. Any duty delegated by a physician during a gluteal fat grafting procedure must be performed under the direct supervision of the physician performing such procedure. Fat extraction and gluteal fat injections must be performed by the physician and may not be delegated. 3. Fat may only be injected into the subcutaneous space of the patient and may not cross the fascia overlying the gluteal muscle. Intramuscular or submuscular fat injections are prohibited. 4. When the physician performing a gluteal fat grafting procedure injects fat into the subcutaneous space of the patient, the physician must use ultrasound guidance, or guidance with other technology authorized under board rule which equals or exceeds the quality of ultrasound, during the placement and navigation of the cannula to ensure that the fat is injected into the subcutaneous space of the patient above the fascia overlying the gluteal muscle. Such guidance with the use of ultrasound or other technology is not required for other portions of such procedure. 5. An office in which a physician performs gluteal fat grafting procedures must at all times maintain a ratio of one physician to one patient during all phases of the procedure, beginning with the administration of anesthesia to the patient and concluding with the extubation of the patient. After a physician has commenced, and while he or she is engaged in, a gluteal fat grafting procedure, the physician may not commence or engage in another gluteal fat grafting procedure or any other procedure with another patient at the same time. (d) If a procedure in an office surgery setting results in hospitalization, the incident must be reported as an adverse incident pursuant to s. 458.351. (3) RULEMAKING.— (a) The board shall adopt by rule standards of practice for physicians who perform procedures or office surgeries pursuant to this section. (b) The board may adopt rules to administer the registration, inspection, and safety of offices in which a physician performs procedures or office surgeries pursuant to this section.

(2) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the term: (a) “Approved program” means a physician assistant program in the United States or in its territories or possessions which is accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant or, for programs before 2001, accredited by its equivalent or predecessor entities the Committee on Allied Health Education and Accreditation or the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs formally approved by the boards for the education of physician assistants. (b) “Boards” means the Board of Medicine and the Board of Osteopathic Medicine. (c) “Continuing medical education” means courses recognized and approved by the boards, the American Academy of Physician Assistants, the American Medical Association, the American Osteopathic Association, or the Accreditation Council on Continuing Medical Education. (d) “Council” means the Council on Physician Assistants. (e) “Physician assistant” means a person who is a graduate of an approved program or its equivalent or meets standards approved by the boards and is licensed to perform medical services delegated by the supervising physician. (f) “Physician assistant national certifying examination” means the Physician Assistant National Certifying Examination administered by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants or its successor agency. (g) “Supervision” means responsible supervision and control. Except in cases of emergency, supervision requires the easy availability or physical presence of the licensed physician for consultation and direction of the actions of the physician assistant. For the purposes of this definition, the term “easy availability” includes the ability to communicate by way of telecommunication. The boards shall establish rules as to what constitutes responsible supervision of the physician assistant. (h) “Trainee” means a person who is currently enrolled in an approved program. (3) PERFORMANCE OF SUPERVISING PHYSICIAN.—Each physician or group of physicians supervising a licensed physician assistant must be qualified in the medical areas in which the physician assistant is to perform and shall be individually or collectively responsible and liable for the performance and the acts and omissions of the physician assistant. A physician may not supervise more than 10 currently licensed physician assistants at any one time. A physician supervising a physician assistant pursuant to this section may not be required to review and cosign charts or medical records prepared by such physician assistant. (4) PERFORMANCE OF PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS.— (a) The boards shall adopt, by rule, the general principles that supervising physicians must use in developing the scope of practice of a physician assistant under direct supervision and under indirect supervision. These principles shall recognize the diversity of both specialty and practice settings in which physician assistants are used. (b) This chapter does not prevent third-party payors from reimbursing employers of physician assistants for covered services rendered by licensed physician assistants. (c) Licensed physician assistants may not be denied clinical hospital privileges, except for cause, so long as the supervising physician is a staff member in good standing. (d) A supervisory physician may delegate to a licensed physician assistant, pursuant to a written protocol, the authority to act according to s. 154.04(1)(c). Such delegated authority is limited to the supervising physician’s practice in connection with a county health department as defined and established pursuant to chapter 154. The boards shall adopt rules governing the supervision of physician assistants by physicians in county health departments. (e) A supervising physician may delegate to a fully licensed physician assistant the authority to prescribe or dispense any medication used in the supervising physician’s practice unless such medication is listed on the formulary created pursuant to paragraph (f). A fully licensed physician assistant may only prescribe or dispense such medication under the following circumstances: 1. A physician assistant must clearly identify to the patient that he or she is a physician assistant. 2. The supervising physician must notify the department of his or her intent to delegate, on a department-approved form, before delegating such authority and of any change in prescriptive privileges of the physician assistant. Authority to dispense may be delegated only by a supervising physician who is registered as a dispensing practitioner in compliance with s. 465.0276. 3. A fully licensed physician assistant may procure medical devices and drugs unless the medication is listed on the formulary created pursuant to paragraph (f). 4. The physician assistant must complete a minimum of 10 continuing medical education hours in the specialty practice in which the physician assistant has prescriptive privileges with each licensure renewal. Three of the 10 hours must consist of a continuing education course on the safe and effective prescribing of controlled substance medications which is offered by a statewide professional association of physicians in this state accredited to provide educational activities designated for the American Medical Association Physician’s Recognition Award Category 1 credit, designated by the American Academy of Physician Assistants as a Category 1 credit, or designated by the American Osteopathic Association as a Category 1-A credit. 5. The prescription may be in paper or electronic form but must comply with ss. 456.0392(1) and 456.42(1) and chapter 499 and must contain the physician assistant’s name, address, and telephone number and the name of each of his or her supervising physicians. Unless it is a drug or drug sample dispensed by the physician assistant, the prescription must be filled in a pharmacy permitted under chapter 465 and must be dispensed in that pharmacy by a pharmacist licensed under chapter 465. 6. The physician assistant must note the prescription or dispensing of medication in the appropriate medical record. (f)1. The council shall establish a formulary of medicinal drugs that a fully licensed physician assistant having prescribing authority under this section or s. 459.022 may not prescribe. The formulary must include general anesthetics and radiographic contrast materials and must limit the prescription of Schedule II controlled substances as listed in s. 893.03 to a 7-day supply. The formulary must also restrict the prescribing of Schedule II psychiatric mental health controlled substances for children younger than 18 years of age to a 14-day supply, provided the physician assistant is under the supervision of a pediatrician, a family practice physician, an internal medicine physician, or a psychiatrist. 2. In establishing the formulary, the council shall consult with a pharmacist licensed under chapter 465, but not licensed under this chapter or chapter 459, who shall be selected by the State Surgeon General. 3. Only the council shall add to, delete from, or modify the formulary. Any person who requests an addition, a deletion, or a modification of a medicinal drug listed on such formulary has the burden of proof to show cause why such addition, deletion, or modification should be made. 4. The boards shall adopt the formulary required by this paragraph, and each addition, deletion, or modification to the formulary, by rule. Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 120 to the contrary, the formulary rule shall be effective 60 days after the date it is filed with the Secretary of State. Upon adoption of the formulary, the department shall mail a copy of such formulary to each fully licensed physician assistant having prescribing authority under this section or s. 459.022, and to each pharmacy licensed by the state. The boards shall establish, by rule, a fee not to exceed $200 to fund the provisions of paragraph (e) and this paragraph.

      "text": "458.351 Reports of adverse incidents in office practice settings.— (1) Any adverse incident that occurs in any office maintained by a physician for the practice of medicine which is not licensed under chapter 395 must be reported to the department in accordance with the provisions of this section. (2) Any physician or other licensee under this chapter practicing in this state must notify the department if the physician or licensee was involved in an adverse incident that occurred in any office maintained by a physician for the practice of medicine which is not licensed under chapter 395. (3) The required notification to the department must be submitted in writing by certified mail and postmarked within 15 days after the occurrence of the adverse incident. (4) For purposes of notification to the department pursuant to this section, the term “adverse incident” means an event over which the physician or licensee could exercise control and which is associated in whole or in part with a medical intervention, rather than the condition for which such intervention occurred, and which results in the following patient injuries: (a) The death of a patient. (b) Brain or spinal damage to a patient. (c) The performance of a surgical procedure on the wrong patient. (d)1. The performance of a wrong-site surgical procedure; 2. The performance of a wrong surgical procedure; or 3. The surgical repair of damage to a patient resulting from a planned surgical procedure where the damage is not a recognized specific risk as disclosed to the patient and documented through the informed-consent process if it results in: death; brain or spinal damage; permanent disfigurement not to include the incision scar; fracture or dislocation of bones or joints; a limitation of neurological, physical, or sensory function; or any condition that required the transfer of the patient. (e) A procedure to remove unplanned foreign objects remaining from a surgical procedure. (f) Any condition that required the transfer of a patient to a hospital licensed under chapter 395 from an ambulatory surgical center licensed under chapter 395 or any facility or any office maintained by a physician for the practice of medicine which is not licensed under chapter 395. (5) The department shall review each incident and determine whether it potentially involved conduct by a health care professional who is subject to disciplinary action, in which case s. 456.073 applies. Disciplinary action, if any, shall be taken by the board under which the health care professional is licensed. (6)(a) The board shall adopt rules establishing a standard informed consent form that sets forth the recognized specific risks related to cataract surgery. The board must propose such rules within 90 days after the effective date of this subsection. (b) Before formally proposing the rule, the board must consider information from physicians licensed under this chapter or chapter 459 regarding recognized specific risks related to cataract surgery and the standard informed consent forms adopted for use in the medical field by other states. (c) A patient’s informed consent is not executed until the patient, or a person authorized by the patient to give consent, and a competent witness sign the form adopted by the board. (d) An incident resulting from recognized specific risks described in the signed consent form is not considered an adverse incident for purposes of s. 395.0197 and this section. (e) In a civil action or administrative proceeding against a physician based on his or her alleged failure to properly disclose the risks of cataract surgery, a patient’s informed consent executed as provided in paragraph (c) on the form adopted by the board is admissible as evidence and creates a rebuttable presumption that the physician properly disclosed the risks. (7) The board may adopt rules to administer this section. History.—s. 197, ch. 99-397; s. 108, ch. 2000-160; s. 3, ch. 2011-233; s. 115, ch. 2020-2.
