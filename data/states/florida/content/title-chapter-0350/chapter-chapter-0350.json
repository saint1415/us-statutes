      "text": "350.031 Florida Public Service Commission Nominating Council.— (1)(a) There is created a Florida Public Service Commission Nominating Council consisting of 12 members. At least one member of the council must be 60 years of age or older. Six members, including three members of the House of Representatives, one of whom shall be a member of the minority party, shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Six members, including three members of the Senate, one of whom shall be a member of the minority party, shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the President of the Senate. (b) All terms shall be for 4 years except those members of the House and Senate, who shall serve 2-year terms concurrent with the 2-year elected terms of House members. All terms of the members of the Public Service Commission Nominating Council existing on June 30, 2008, shall terminate upon the effective date of this act; however, such members may serve an additional term if reappointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives or the President of the Senate. To establish staggered terms, appointments of members shall be made for initial terms to begin on July 1, 2008, with each appointing officer to appoint three legislator members, one of whom shall be a member of the minority party, to terms through the remainder of the 2-year elected terms of House members; one nonlegislator member to a 6-month term; one nonlegislator member to an 18-month term; and one nonlegislator member to a 42-month term. Thereafter, the terms of the nonlegislator members of the Public Service Commission Nominating Council shall begin on January 2 of the year the term commences and end 4 years later on January 1. (c) The President of the Senate shall appoint the chair of the council in even-numbered years and the vice chair in odd-numbered years, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall appoint the chair of the council in odd-numbered years and the vice chair in even-numbered years, from among the council membership. (d) Vacancies on the council shall be filled for the unexpired portion of the term in the same manner as original appointments to the council. A member may not be reappointed to the council, except for a member of the House of Representatives or the Senate who may be appointed to two 2-year terms, members who are reappointed pursuant to paragraph (b), or a person who is appointed to fill the remaining portion of an unexpired term. (2)(a) No member or spouse shall be the holder of the stocks or bonds of any company, other than through ownership of shares in a mutual fund, regulated by the commission, or any affiliated company of any company regulated by the commission, or be an agent or employee of, or have any interest in, any company regulated by the commission or any affiliated company of any company regulated by the commission, or in any firm which represents in any capacity either companies which are regulated by the commission or affiliates of companies regulated by the commission. As a condition of appointment to the council, each appointee shall affirm to the Speaker and the President his or her qualification by the following certification: “I hereby certify that I am not a stockholder, other than through ownership of shares in a mutual fund, in any company regulated by the commission or in any affiliate of a company regulated by the commission, nor in any way, directly or indirectly, in the employment of, or engaged in the management of any company regulated by the commission or any affiliate of a company regulated by the commission, or in any firm which represents in any capacity either companies which are regulated by the commission or affiliates of companies regulated by the commission.” This certification is made as condition to appointment to the Florida Public Service Commission Nominating Council. (b) A member of the council may be removed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate upon a finding by the Speaker and the President that the council member has violated any provision of this subsection or for other good cause. (c) If a member of the council does not meet the requirements of this subsection, the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House of Representatives, as appropriate, shall appoint a legislative replacement. (3) A majority of the membership of the council may conduct any business before the council. All meetings and proceedings of the council shall be staffed by the Office of Legislative Services and shall be subject to the provisions of ss. 119.07 and 286.011. Members of the council are entitled to receive per diem and travel expenses as provided in s. 112.061, which shall be funded by the Florida Public Service Regulatory Trust Fund. Applicants invited for interviews before the council may, in the discretion of the council, receive per diem and travel expenses as provided in s. 112.061, which shall be funded by the Florida Public Service Regulatory Trust Fund. The council shall establish policies and procedures to govern the process by which applicants are nominated. (4) The council may spend a nominal amount, not to exceed $10,000, to advertise a vacancy on the council, which shall be funded by the Florida Public Service Regulatory Trust Fund. (5) A person may not be nominated to the Governor for appointment to the Public Service Commission until the council has determined that the person is competent and knowledgeable in one or more fields, which shall include, but not be limited to: public affairs, law, economics, accounting, engineering, finance, natural resource conservation, energy, or another field substantially related to the duties and functions of the commission. The commission shall fairly represent the above-stated fields. Recommendations of the council shall be nonpartisan. (6) It is the responsibility of the council to nominate to the Governor no fewer than three persons for each vacancy occurring on the Public Service Commission. The council shall submit the recommendations to the Governor by September 15 of those years in which the terms are to begin the following January, or within 60 days after a vacancy occurs for any reason other than the expiration of the term. (7) The Governor shall fill a vacancy occurring on the Public Service Commission by appointment of one of the applicants nominated by the council only after a background investigation of such applicant has been conducted by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. If the Governor has not made an appointment within 30 consecutive calendar days after the receipt of the recommendation, the council, by majority vote, shall appoint, within 30 days after the expiration of the Governor’s time to make an appointment, one person from the applicants previously nominated to the Governor to fill the vacancy. (8) Each appointment to the Public Service Commission shall be subject to confirmation by the Senate during the next regular session after the vacancy occurs. If the Senate refuses to confirm or fails to consider the Governor’s appointment, the council shall initiate, in accordance with this section, the nominating process within 30 days. (9) When the Governor makes an appointment to fill a vacancy occurring due to expiration of the term, and that appointment has not been confirmed by the Senate before the appointing Governor’s term ends, a successor Governor may, within 30 days after taking office, recall the appointment and, prior to the first day of the next regular session, make a replacement appointment from the list provided to the previous Governor by the council. Such an appointment is subject to confirmation by the Senate at the next regular session following the creation of the vacancy to which the appointments are being made. If the replacement appointment is not timely made, or if the appointment is not confirmed by the Senate for any reason, the council, by majority vote, shall appoint, within 30 days after the Legislature adjourns sine die, one person from the applicants previously nominated to the Governor to fill the vacancy, and this appointee is subject to confirmation by the Senate during the next regular session following the appointment. (10) In keeping with the purpose of the council, which is to select nominees to be appointed to an arm of the legislative branch of government, a person who is employed and receives payment, or who contracts for economic consideration, for the purpose of influencing or attempting to influence action of the council through oral or written communication or through an attempt to obtain the goodwill of a legislator or nonlegislator member of the council, or a person who is principally employed for governmental affairs by another person or governmental entity to act on behalf of that other person or entity for this purpose, must register as a lobbyist pursuant to s. 11.045 and otherwise comply with the requirements of that section. The Legislature shall implement this subsection by joint rule.

      "text": "350.042 Ex parte communications.— (1) A commissioner should accord to every person who is legally interested in a proceeding, or the person’s lawyer, full right to be heard according to law, and, except as authorized by law, shall neither initiate nor consider ex parte communications concerning the merits, threat, or offer of reward in any proceeding under s. 120.569 or s. 120.57 that is currently pending before the commission or that he or she knows or reasonably expects will be filed with the commission within 180 days after the date of any such communication, other than a proceeding under s. 120.54 or s. 120.565, workshops, or internal affairs meetings. An individual may not discuss ex parte with a commissioner the merits of any issue that he or she knows will be filed with the commission within 180 days. This subsection does not apply to commission staff. (2) The provisions of this section shall not prohibit an individual residential ratepayer from communicating with a commissioner, provided that the ratepayer is representing only himself or herself, without compensation. (3)(a) The Legislature finds that it is important to have commissioners who are educated and informed on regulatory policies and developments in science, technology, business management, finance, law, and public policy which are associated with the industries that the commissioners regulate. The Legislature also finds that it is in the public interest for commissioners to become educated and informed on these matters through active participation in meetings that are scheduled by organizations that sponsor such educational or informational sessions, programs, conferences, and similar events and that are duly noticed and open to the public. (b) As used in this subsection, the term “active participation” or “participating in” includes, but is not limited to, attending or speaking at educational sessions, participating in organization governance by attending meetings, serving on committees or in leadership positions, participating in panel discussions, and attending meals and receptions associated with such events that are open to all attendees. (c) The prohibition in subsection (1) remains in effect at all times at such meetings wherever located. While participating in such meetings, a commissioner shall: 1. Refrain from commenting on or discussing any proceeding under s. 120.569 or s. 120.57 which is currently pending before the commission or that he or she knows or reasonably expects will be filed with the commission within 180 days after the meeting. 2. Use reasonable care to ensure that the content of the educational session or other session in which the commissioner participates is not designed to address or create a forum to influence the commissioner on any proceeding under s. 120.569 or s. 120.57 which is currently pending before the commission or that he or she knows or reasonably expects will be filed with the commission within 180 days after the meeting. (4) If a commissioner knowingly receives an ex parte communication relative to a proceeding other than as set forth in subsection (1), to which he or she is assigned, he or she must place on the record of the proceeding copies of all written communications received, all written responses to the communications, and a memorandum stating the substance of all oral communications received and all oral responses made, and shall give written notice to all parties to the communication that such matters have been placed on the record. Any party who desires to respond to an ex parte communication may do so. The response must be received by the commission within 10 days after receiving notice that the ex parte communication has been placed on the record. The commissioner may, if he or she deems it necessary to eliminate the effect of an ex parte communication received by him or her, withdraw from the proceeding, in which case the chair shall substitute another commissioner for the proceeding. (5) Any individual who makes an ex parte communication shall submit to the commission a written statement describing the nature of such communication, to include the name of the person making the communication, the name of the commissioner or commissioners receiving the communication, copies of all written communications made, all written responses to such communications, and a memorandum stating the substance of all oral communications received and all oral responses made. The commission shall place on the record of a proceeding all such communications. (6) Any commissioner who knowingly fails to place on the record any such communications, in violation of the section, within 15 days of the date of such communication is subject to removal and may be assessed a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000. (7)(a) It shall be the duty of the Commission on Ethics to receive and investigate sworn complaints of violations of this section pursuant to the procedures contained in ss. 112.322-112.3241. (b) If the Commission on Ethics finds that there has been a violation of this section by a public service commissioner, it shall provide the Governor and the Florida Public Service Commission Nominating Council with a report of its findings and recommendations. The Governor is authorized to enforce the findings and recommendations of the Commission on Ethics, pursuant to part III of chapter 112 and to remove from office a commissioner who is found by the Commission on Ethics to have willfully and knowingly violated this section. The Governor shall remove from office a commissioner who is found by the Commission on Ethics to have willfully and knowingly violated this section after a previous finding by the Commission on Ethics that the commissioner willfully and knowingly violated this section in a separate matter. (c) If a commissioner fails or refuses to pay the Commission on Ethics any civil penalties assessed pursuant to the provisions of this section, the Commission on Ethics may bring an action in any circuit court to enforce such penalty. (d) If, during the course of an investigation by the Commission on Ethics into an alleged violation of this section, allegations are made as to the identity of the person who participated in the ex parte communication, that person must be given notice and an opportunity to participate in the investigation and relevant proceedings to present a defense. If the Commission on Ethics determines that the person participated in the ex parte communication, the person may not appear before the commission or otherwise represent anyone before the commission for a period of 2 years.

(b) “Cable service” has the same meaning as in 47 U.S.C. s. 522(6). (c) “Communications services” includes any “advanced service,” “cable service,” or “telecommunications service” and shall be construed in the broadest sense. (d) “Enterprise fund” means a separate fund to account for the operation of communications services by a local government, established and maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. (e) “Governmental entity” means any political subdivision as defined in s. 1.01, including any county, municipality, special district, school district, utility authority or other authority or any instrumentality, agency, unit or department thereof. The term does not include an independent special district created before 1970 which has been granted express legislative authority to provide a communications service and which does not sell a communications service outside its district boundaries. (f) “Provide,” “providing,” “provision,” or “provisioning” means offering or supplying a communications service for a fee or other consideration to a person, including any portion of the public or private provider, but does not include service by an entity to itself or to any other governmental entity. (g) “Subscriber” means a person who receives a communications service. (h) “Telecommunications services” means the transmission of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, messages, data, or other information of the user’s choosing, by wire, radio, light waves, or other electromagnetic means, without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received by the user and regardless of the facilities used, including, without limitation, wireless facilities. (2)(a) A governmental entity that proposes to provide a communications service shall hold no less than two public hearings, which shall be held not less than 30 days apart. At least 30 days before the first of the two public hearings, the governmental entity must give notice of the hearing in the predominant newspaper of general circulation in the area considered for service. At least 40 days before the first public hearing, the governmental entity must electronically provide notice to the Department of Revenue and the Public Service Commission, which shall post the notice on the department’s and the commission’s website to be available to the public. The Department of Revenue shall also send the notice by United States Postal Service to the known addresses for all dealers of communications services registered with the department under chapter 202 or provide an electronic notification, if the means are available, within 10 days after receiving the notice. The notice must include the time and place of the hearings and must state that the purpose of the hearings is to consider whether the governmental entity will provide communications services. The notice must include, at a minimum, the geographic areas proposed to be served by the governmental entity and the services, if any, which the governmental entity believes are not currently being adequately provided. The notice must also state that any dealer who wishes to do so may appear and be heard at the public hearings. (b) At a public hearing required by this subsection, a governmental entity must, at a minimum, consider: 1. Whether the service that is proposed to be provided is currently being offered in the community and, if so, whether the service is generally available throughout the community. 2. Whether a similar service is currently being offered in the community and, if so, whether the service is generally available throughout the community. 3. If the same or similar service is not currently offered, whether any other service provider proposes to offer the same or a similar service and, if so, what assurances that service provider is willing or able to offer regarding the same or similar service. 4. The capital investment required by the government entity to provide the communications service, the estimated realistic cost of operation and maintenance and, using a full cost-accounting method, the estimated realistic revenues and expenses of providing the service and the proposed method of financing. 5. The private and public costs and benefits of providing the service by a private entity or a governmental entity, including the affect on existing and future jobs, actual economic development prospects, tax-base growth, education, and public health. (c) At one or more of the public hearings under this subsection, the governmental entity must make available to the public a written business plan for the proposed communications service venture containing, at a minimum: 1. The projected number of subscribers to be served by the venture. 2. The geographic area to be served by the venture. 3. The types of communications services to be provided. 4. A plan to ensure that revenues exceed operating expenses and payment of principal and interest on debt within 4 years. 5.

(d) After making specific findings regarding the factors in paragraphs (b) and (c), the governmental entity may authorize providing a communications service by a majority recorded vote and by resolution, ordinance, or other formal means of adoption. (e) The governing body of a governmental entity may issue one or more bonds to finance the capital costs for facilities to provide a communications service. However: 1. A governmental entity may only pledge revenues in support of the issuance of any bond to finance providing a communications service: a. Within the county in which the governmental entity is located; b. Within an area in which the governmental entity provides electric service outside its home county under an electric service territorial agreement approved by the Public Service Commission before the effective date of this act; or c. If the governmental entity is a municipality or special district, within its corporate limits or in an area in which the municipality or special district provides water, wastewater, electric, or natural gas service, or within an urban service area designated in a comprehensive plan, whichever is larger, unless the municipality or special district obtains the consent by formal action of the governmental entity within the boundaries of which the municipality or special district proposes to provide service. For consent to be effective, any governmental entity from which consent is sought shall be located within the county in which the governmental entity is located or that county. 2.

(f) A governmental entity providing a communications service may not price any service below the cost of providing the service by subsidizing the communications service with moneys from rates paid by subscribers of a noncommunications services utility or from any other revenues. The cost standard for determining cross-subsidization is whether the total revenue from the service is less than the total long-run incremental cost of the service. Total long-run incremental cost means service-specific volume and nonvolume-sensitive costs. (g) A governmental entity providing a communications service must comply with the requirements of s. 218.32 and shall keep separate and accurate books and records, maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, of a governmental entity’s communication service, and they shall be made available for any audits of the books and records conducted under applicable law.

Approve a plan to cease providing communications services; 2. Approve a plan to dispose of the system the governmental entity is using to provide communications services and, accordingly, to cease providing communications services; 3. Approve a plan to create a partnership with a private entity in order to achieve operations in which revenues exceed operating expenses and payment of principal and interest on debt; or 4. Approve the continuing provision of communications services by a majority vote of the governing body of the governing authority. (3)(a) A governmental entity that provides a cable or video service shall comply with the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, 47 U.S.C. ss. 521 et seq., the regulations issued by the Federal Communications Commission under the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, 47 U.S.C. ss. 521 et seq., and all applicable state and federal rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, those provisions of chapters 202, 212, 337, and 610 that apply to a provider of the services.

Access to public rights-of-way; and 2. Permitting, access to, use of, and payment for use of governmental entity-owned poles. The governmental entity is subject to the same terms, conditions, and fees, if any, for access to government-owned poles which the governmental entity applies to a private provider for access. (4)(a) If a governmental entity was providing, as of April 1, 2005, advanced services, cable services, or telecommunications services, then it is not required to comply with paragraph (2)(a), paragraph (2)(b), paragraph (2)(c), paragraph (2)(d), sub-subparagraph (2)(e)1.c., paragraph (2)(f), or paragraph (2)(k) in order to continue to provide advanced services, cable services, or telecommunications services, respectively, but it must comply with and be subject to all other provisions of this section. (b) If a governmental entity, as of April 1, 2005, had issued debt pledging revenues from an advanced service, cable service, or telecommunications service, then it is not required to comply with paragraph (2)(a), paragraph (2)(b), paragraph (2)(c), paragraph (2)(d), sub-subparagraph (2)(e)1.c., paragraph (2)(f), or paragraph (2)(k) in order to provide advanced services, cable services, or telecommunications services, respectively, but it must comply with and be subject to all other provisions of this section.

This subsection does not relieve a governmental entity from complying with subsection (5). (5) Notwithstanding s. 542.235 or any other law, a governmental entity that provides a communications service is subject to the same prohibitions applicable to private providers under ss. 542.18 and 542.19 as it relates to providing a communications service. This section does not limit the availability to any party of any remedy or defense under state or federal anti-trust laws.

By way of example and not limitation, the integral, essential subscribers may include airlines and emergency service entities, and the nonintegral, nonessential subscribers may include retail shops, restaurants, hotels, or rental car companies. (7) This section does not alter or affect any provision in the charter, code, or other governing authority of a governmental entity that imposes additional or different requirements on provision of communications service by a governmental entity.
