The Legislature recognizes that there are conditions which require municipalities to pass certain other traffic ordinances in regulation of municipal traffic that are not required to regulate the movement of traffic outside of such municipalities. Section 316.008 enumerates the area within which municipalities may control certain traffic movement or parking in their respective jurisdictions. This section shall be supplemental to the other laws or ordinances of this chapter and not in conflict therewith. It is unlawful for any local authority to pass or to attempt to enforce any ordinance in conflict with the provisions of this chapter.",

(b) Regulating traffic by means of police officers or official traffic control devices. (c) Regulating or prohibiting processions or assemblages on the streets or highways, including all state or federal highways lying within their boundaries. (d) Designating particular highways or roadways for use by traffic moving in one direction. (e) Establishing speed limits for vehicles in public parks.

(i) Regulating or prohibiting the turning of vehicles or specified types of vehicles. (j) Altering or establishing speed limits within the provisions of this chapter. (k) Requiring written crash reports. (l) Designating no-passing zones. (m) Prohibiting or regulating the use of controlled access roadways by any class or kind of traffic. (n) Prohibiting or regulating the use of heavily traveled streets by any class or kind of traffic found to be incompatible with the normal and safe movement of traffic. (o) Designating hazardous railroad grade crossings in conformity to criteria promulgated by the Department of Transportation. (p) Designating and regulating traffic on play streets. (q) Prohibiting pedestrians from crossing a roadway in a business district or any designated highway except on a crosswalk. (r) Regulating pedestrian crossings at unmarked crosswalks. (s) Regulating persons upon skates, coasters, and other toy vehicles. (t) Adopting and enforcing such temporary or experimental regulations as may be necessary to cover emergencies or special conditions.

(v) Regulating, restricting, or prohibiting traffic within the boundary of any airport owned by the state, a county, a municipality, or a political subdivision and enforcing violations under the provisions of this chapter and chapter 318. (w) Regulating, restricting, or monitoring traffic by security devices or personnel on public streets and highways, whether by public or private parties and providing for the construction and maintenance of such streets and highways. (2) The municipality, through its duly authorized officers, shall have nonexclusive jurisdiction over the prosecution, trial, adjudication, and punishment of violations of this chapter when a violation occurs within the municipality and the person so charged is charged by a municipal police officer. The disposition of such matters in the municipality shall be in accordance with the charter of that municipality. This subsection does not limit those counties which have the charter power to provide and regulate arterial, toll, and other roads, bridges, tunnels, and related facilities from the proper exercise of those powers pertaining to the consolidation and unification of a traffic court system within such counties. (3) No local authority shall erect or maintain any official traffic control device at any location so as to regulate the traffic on any state road unless approval in writing has first been obtained from the Department of Transportation. (4) A county or municipality may enact an ordinance providing a fine for the violation of s. 316.1955 in excess of the fine specified by s. 318.18(6), except that such a fine may not exceed $250. Any such ordinance may provide for the deposit of such fines in a separate county or municipal account to be used in the following manner: (a) One-third to be used to defray expenses for the administration of this subsection. (b) Two-thirds to be used to provide funds to improve accessibility and equal opportunity to qualified persons who have disabilities in the county or municipality and to provide funds to conduct public awareness programs in the county or municipality concerning persons who have disabilities. (5)(a) A county or municipality may enact an ordinance providing a fine for the violation of s. 316.1945(1)(b)2. or 5. in excess of the fine specified by s. 318.18(2), except that such fine may not exceed the fine specified in s. 318.18(2) by more than $3. However, such ordinance shall provide that the fines collected pursuant to this subsection in excess of the fines which would be collected pursuant to s. 318.18(2) for such violations shall be used by the county or municipality for the purpose of funding a firefighter education program. The amount of the fines collected pursuant to this subsection in excess of the fines which would be collected pursuant to s. 318.18(2) for such violations shall be reported on a monthly basis by the clerk of the court to the appropriate county or municipality. (b) A county or municipality may enact an ordinance which dedicates a portion of any fine collected for a violation of such ordinance for the purpose of funding a firefighter education program, if such ordinance is limited to the regulation of parking within a firesafety zone. (6) A county or municipality may enact an ordinance providing for the establishment of a “combat automobile theft” program, and may charge a fee for the administration of the program and the cost of the decal. Such a program shall include: (a) Consent forms for motor vehicle owners who wish to enroll their vehicles. (b) Decals indicating a vehicle’s enrollment in the “combat automobile theft” program. The Department of Law Enforcement shall approve the color, design, and other specifications of the program decal. (c) A consent form signed by a motor vehicle owner provides authorization for a law enforcement officer to stop the vehicle when it is being driven between the hours of 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., provided that a decal is conspicuously affixed to the bottom left corner of the back window of the vehicle to provide notice of its enrollment in the “combat automobile theft” program. The owner of the motor vehicle is responsible for removing the decal when terminating participation in the program, or when selling or otherwise transferring ownership of the vehicle. No civil liabilities will arise from the actions of a law enforcement officer when stopping a vehicle with a yellow decal evidencing enrollment in the program when the driver is not enrolled in the program provided that the stop is made in accordance with the requirements of the “combat automobile theft” program. (7)(a) A county or municipality may enact an ordinance to permit, control, or regulate the operation of vehicles, golf carts, mopeds, motorized scooters, electric bicycles, and electric personal assistive mobility devices on sidewalks or sidewalk areas when such use is permissible under federal law. The ordinance must restrict such vehicles or devices to a maximum speed of 15 miles per hour in such areas. (b)1. Except as provided in subparagraph 2., a personal delivery device and a mobile carrier may be operated on sidewalks and crosswalks within a county or municipality when such use is permissible under federal law. This paragraph does not restrict a county or municipality from otherwise adopting regulations for the safe operation of personal delivery devices and mobile carriers. 2. A personal delivery device may not be operated on the Florida Shared-Use Nonmotorized Trail Network created under s. 339.81 or components of the Florida Greenways and Trails System created under chapter 260. (8)(a) A county or municipality may use traffic infraction detectors to enforce s. 316.074(1) or s. 316.075(1)(c)1. when a driver fails to stop at a traffic signal on streets and highways under its jurisdiction under s. 316.0083. Only a municipality may install or authorize the installation of any such detectors within the incorporated area of the municipality. Only a county may install or authorize the installation of any such detectors within the unincorporated area of the county. (b) Pursuant to paragraph (a), a municipality may install or, by contract or interlocal agreement, authorize the installation of any such detectors only within the incorporated area of the municipality, and a county may install or, by contract or interlocal agreement, authorize the installation of any such detectors only within the unincorporated area of the county. A county may authorize installation of any such detectors by interlocal agreement on roads under its jurisdiction. (c) Pursuant to s. 316.0083, a county or municipality may use traffic infraction detectors to enforce s. 316.074(1) or s. 316.075(1)(c)1. when a driver fails to stop at a traffic signal on state roads under the original jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation when permitted by the Department of Transportation. (9)(a) A county or municipality may enforce the applicable speed limit on a roadway properly maintained as a school zone pursuant to s. 316.1895: 1. Within 30 minutes before through 30 minutes after the start of a regularly scheduled breakfast program; 2. Within 30 minutes before through 30 minutes after the start of a regularly scheduled school session; 3. During the entirety of a regularly scheduled school session; and 4. Within 30 minutes before through 30 minutes after the end of a regularly scheduled school session through the use of a speed detection system for the detection of speed and capturing of photographs or videos for violations in excess of 10 miles per hour over the speed limit in force at the time of the violation. A school zone’s compliance with s. 316.1895 creates a rebuttable presumption that the school zone is properly maintained. (b) A county or municipality may place or install, or contract with a vendor to place or install, a speed detection system within a roadway maintained as a school zone as provided in s. 316.1895 to enforce unlawful speed violations, as specified in s. 316.1895(10) or s. 316.183, on that roadway. (c) A county or municipality must enact an ordinance in order to authorize the placement or installation of a speed detection system on a roadway maintained as a school zone as authorized by this subsection. As part of the public hearing on such proposed ordinance, the county or municipality must consider traffic data or other evidence supporting the installation and operation of each proposed school zone speed detection system, and the county or municipality must determine that the school zone where a speed detection system is to be placed or installed constitutes a heightened safety risk that warrants additional enforcement measures pursuant to this subsection.

      "text": "316.027 Crash involving death or personal injuries.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Serious bodily injury” means an injury to a person, including the driver, which consists of a physical condition that creates a substantial risk of death, serious personal disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member or organ. (b) “Vulnerable road user” means: 1. A pedestrian, including a person actually engaged in work upon a highway, or in work upon utility facilities along a highway, or engaged in the provision of emergency services within the right-of-way; 2. A person operating a bicycle, an electric bicycle, a motorcycle, a scooter, or a moped lawfully on the roadway; 3. A person riding an animal; or 4. A person lawfully operating on a public right-of-way, crosswalk, or shoulder of the roadway: a. A farm tractor or similar vehicle designed primarily for farm use; b. A skateboard, roller skates, or in-line skates; c. A horse-drawn carriage; d. An electric personal assistive mobility device; or e. A wheelchair. (2)(a) The driver of a vehicle involved in a crash occurring on public or private property which results in injury to a person other than serious bodily injury shall immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the crash, or as close thereto as possible, and shall remain at the scene of the crash until he or she has fulfilled the requirements of s. 316.062. A person who willfully violates this paragraph commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. (b) The driver of a vehicle involved in a crash occurring on public or private property which results in serious bodily injury to a person shall immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the crash, or as close thereto as possible, and shall remain at the scene of the crash until he or she has fulfilled the requirements of s. 316.062. A person who willfully violates this paragraph commits a felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. (c) The driver of a vehicle involved in a crash occurring on public or private property which results in the death of a person shall immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the crash, or as close thereto as possible, and shall remain at the scene of the crash until he or she has fulfilled the requirements of s. 316.062. A person who is arrested for a violation of this paragraph and who has previously been convicted of a violation of this section, s. 316.061, s. 316.191, or s. 316.193, or a felony violation of s. 322.34, shall be held in custody until brought before the court for admittance to bail in accordance with chapter 903. A person who willfully violates this paragraph commits a felony of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, and shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 4 years. A person who willfully commits such a violation while driving under the influence as set forth in s. 316.193(1) shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 4 years. (d) Notwithstanding s. 775.089(1)(a), if the driver of a vehicle violates paragraph (a), paragraph (b), or paragraph (c), the court shall order the driver to make restitution to the victim for any damage or loss unless the court finds clear and compelling reasons not to order the restitution. Restitution may be monetary or nonmonetary restitution. The court shall make the payment of restitution a condition of probation in accordance with s. 948.03. An order requiring the defendant to make restitution to a victim does not remove or diminish the requirement that the court order payment to the Crimes Compensation Trust Fund under chapter 960. Payment of an award by the Crimes Compensation Trust Fund creates an order of restitution to the Crimes Compensation Trust Fund unless specifically waived in accordance with s. 775.089(1)(b). (e) A driver who violates paragraph (a), paragraph (b), or paragraph (c) shall have his or her driver license revoked for at least 3 years as provided in s. 322.28(4). 1. A person convicted of violating paragraph (a), paragraph (b), or paragraph (c) shall, before his or her driving privilege may be reinstated, present to the department proof of completion of a victim’s impact panel session in a judicial circuit if such a panel exists, or if such a panel does not exist, a department-approved driver improvement course relating to the rights of vulnerable road users relative to vehicles on the roadway as provided in s. 322.0261(2). 2. The department may reinstate an offender’s driving privilege after he or she satisfies the 3-year revocation period as provided in s. 322.28(4) and successfully completes either a victim’s impact panel session or a department-approved driver improvement course relating to the rights of vulnerable road users relative to vehicles on the roadway as provided in s. 322.0261(2). 3. For purposes of this paragraph, an offender’s driving privilege may be reinstated only after the department verifies that the offender participated in and successfully completed a victim’s impact panel session or a department-approved driver improvement course. (f) For purposes of sentencing under chapter 921 and determining incentive gain-time eligibility under chapter 944, an offense listed in this subsection is ranked one level above the ranking specified in s. 921.0022 or s. 921.0023 for the offense committed if the victim of the offense was a vulnerable road user. (g) The defendant may move to depart from the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment prescribed in paragraph (c) unless the violation was committed while the defendant was driving under the influence. The state may object to this departure. The court may grant the motion only if it finds that a factor, consideration, or circumstance clearly demonstrates that imposing a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment would constitute or result in an injustice. The court shall state in open court the basis for granting the motion. (3) The stops shall be made without unnecessarily obstructing traffic, and, if a damaged vehicle is obstructing traffic, the driver of the vehicle shall make every reasonable effort to move the vehicle or have it moved so as not to obstruct the regular flow of traffic. A person who fails to comply with this subsection shall be cited for a nonmoving violation, punishable as provided in chapter 318. (4)(a) In addition to any other civil, criminal, or administrative penalty imposed, a person whose commission of a noncriminal traffic infraction or a violation of this chapter or s. 1006.66 causes or results in the death of another person may be required by the court to serve 120 community service hours in a trauma center or hospital that regularly receives victims of vehicle accidents, under the supervision of a registered nurse, an emergency room physician, or an emergency medical technician pursuant to a voluntary community service program operated by the trauma center or hospital. (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), in addition to any other civil, criminal, or administrative penalty imposed, a person whose commission of a violation of s. 316.172(1)(a) or (b) causes or results in serious bodily injury to or death of another person shall be required by the court to: 1. Serve 120 community service hours in a trauma center or hospital that regularly receives victims of vehicle accidents, under the supervision of a registered nurse, an emergency room physician, or an emergency medical technician pursuant to a voluntary community service program operated by the trauma center or hospital. 2.

Resulted in death of, personal injury to, or any indication of complaints of pain or discomfort by any of the parties or passengers involved in the crash; 2. Involved a violation of s. 316.061(1) or s. 316.193; 3. Rendered a vehicle inoperable to a degree that required a wrecker to remove it from the scene of the crash; or 4. Involved a commercial motor vehicle. (b) The Florida Traffic Crash Report, Long Form must include: 1. The date, time, and location of the crash. 2. A description of the vehicles involved. 3. The names and addresses of the parties involved, including all drivers and passengers, and the identification of the vehicle in which each was a driver or a passenger. 4. The names and addresses of witnesses. 5. The name, badge number, and law enforcement agency of the officer investigating the crash. 6. The names of the insurance companies for the respective parties involved in the crash. (c) In any crash for which a Florida Traffic Crash Report, Long Form is not required by this section and which occurs on the public roadways of this state, the law enforcement officer shall complete a short-form crash report or provide a driver exchange-of-information form, to be completed by all drivers and passengers involved in the crash, which requires the identification of each vehicle that the drivers and passengers were in. The short-form report must include: 1. The date, time, and location of the crash. 2. A description of the vehicles involved. 3. The names and addresses of the parties involved, including all drivers and passengers, and the identification of the vehicle in which each was a driver or a passenger. 4. The names and addresses of witnesses. 5. The name, badge number, and law enforcement agency of the officer investigating the crash. 6. The names of the insurance companies for the respective parties involved in the crash. (d) Each party to the crash must provide the law enforcement officer with proof of insurance, which must be documented in the crash report. If a law enforcement officer submits a report on the crash, proof of insurance must be provided to the officer by each party involved in the crash. Any party who fails to provide the required information commits a noncriminal traffic infraction, punishable as a nonmoving violation as provided in chapter 318, unless the officer determines that due to injuries or other special circumstances such insurance information cannot be provided immediately. If the person provides the law enforcement agency, within 24 hours after the crash, proof of insurance that was valid at the time of the crash, the law enforcement agency may void the citation. (e) The driver of a vehicle that was in any manner involved in a crash resulting in damage to a vehicle or other property which does not require a law enforcement report shall, within 10 days after the crash, submit a written report of the crash to the department. The report shall be submitted on a form approved by the department. (f) Long-form and short-form crash reports prepared by law enforcement must be submitted to the department and may be maintained by the law enforcement officer’s agency.

I of the State Constitution for a period of 60 days after the date the report is filed. (b) Crash reports held by an agency under paragraph (a) may be made immediately available to the parties involved in the crash, their legal representatives, their licensed insurance agents, their insurers or insurers to which they have applied for coverage, persons under contract with such insurers to provide claims or underwriting information, law enforcement agencies and their contracted service providers, victim services programs, and any federal, state, or local governmental agency or any private person or entity acting on behalf of a federal, state, or local governmental agency in carrying out its functions, but not for redistribution to any person or entity not listed in this subsection. Crash reports held by an agency under paragraph (a) which do not contain the home or employment street addresses, driver license or identification card numbers, dates of birth, and home and employment telephone numbers of the parties involved in the crash shall be made immediately available to radio and television stations licensed by the Federal Communications Commission and newspapers qualified to publish legal notices under ss. 50.011 and 50.031. A crash report may also be made available to any third party acting on behalf of a person or entity authorized under this section to access the crash report, except that the third party may disclose the crash report only to the person or entity authorized to access the crash report under this section on whose behalf the third party has sought the report. This section shall not prevent an agency, pursuant to a memorandum of understanding, from providing data derived from crash reports to a third party solely for the purpose of identifying vehicles involved in crashes if such data does not reveal the identity, home or employment telephone number or home or employment address, or other personal information of the parties involved in the crash. (c) Any local, state, or federal agency that is authorized to have access to crash reports by any provision of law shall be granted such access in the furtherance of the agency’s statutory duties. (d) As a condition precedent to accessing a crash report, a person must present a valid driver license or other photographic identification, proof of status, or identification that demonstrates his or her qualifications to access that information and file a written sworn statement with the state or local agency in possession of the information stating that information from a crash report made confidential and exempt by this section will not be used for any commercial solicitation of accident victims or knowingly disclosed to any third party for the purpose of such solicitation. Such written sworn statement must be completed and sworn to by the requesting party for each individual crash report that is being requested. In lieu of requiring the written sworn statement, an agency may provide crash reports by electronic means pursuant to a memorandum of understanding to third-party vendors under contract with one or more insurers, but only when such contract states that information from a crash report made confidential and exempt by this section will not be used for any commercial solicitation of accident victims by the vendors, or knowingly disclosed by the vendors to any third party for the purpose of such solicitation, and only when a copy of such contract is furnished to the agency as proof of the vendor’s claimed status. (e) This subsection does not prevent the dissemination or publication of news to the general public by any legitimate media entitled to access confidential and exempt information pursuant to this section. (f) Crash reports held by an agency under paragraph (a) may be made available 60 days after the date the report is filed to any person or entity eligible to access crash reports under paragraph (b) or in accordance with any of the permissible uses listed in 18 U.S.C. s. 2721(b) and pursuant to the resale and redisclosure requirements in 18 U.S.C. s. 2721(c). (g) If crash reports are created by or submitted to an agency electronically as data elements within a computerized database or if personal information from a crash report is entered into a computerized database, such crash data held by an agency is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. Sixty days after the date the crash report is filed, an agency may provide crash data derived from the crash report which includes personal information to entities eligible to access the crash report under paragraph (b), or in accordance with any of the permissible uses listed in 18 U.S.C. s. 2721(b) and pursuant to the resale and redisclosure requirements in 18 U.S.C. s. 2721(c). Such data shall be provided pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. (h) This subsection is subject to the Open Government Sunset Review Act in accordance with s. 119.15 and shall stand repealed on October 2, 2027, unless reviewed and saved from repeal through reenactment by the Legislature. (3)(a) Any driver failing to file the written report required under subsection (1) commits a noncriminal traffic infraction, punishable as a nonmoving violation as provided in chapter 318. (b) Any employee of a state or local agency in possession of information made confidential and exempt by this section who knowingly discloses such confidential and exempt information to a person not entitled to access such information under this section commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. (c) Any person, knowing that he or she is not entitled to obtain information made confidential and exempt by this section, who obtains or attempts to obtain such information commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. (d) Any person who knowingly uses confidential and exempt information in violation of a filed written sworn statement, memorandum of understanding, or contractual agreement required by this section commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. (e) In addition to penalties outlined in paragraphs (c) and (d), a person who obtains a crash report or crash data and who knowingly discloses or knowingly uses personal information revealed in the report for a purpose not permitted under 18 U.S.C. s. 2721(b) is liable to the individual to whom the information pertains, who may bring a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction. The court may award: 1. Actual damages, but not less than liquidated damages in the amount of $2,500. 2. Punitive damages upon proof of willful or reckless disregard of the law. 3. Reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred. 4. Such other preliminary and equitable relief as the court determines to be appropriate. This paragraph does not apply to radio and television stations licensed by the Federal Communications Commission and newspapers qualified to publish legal notices under ss. 50.011 and 50.031. (4) Except as specified in this subsection, each crash report made by a person involved in a crash and any statement made by such person to a law enforcement officer for the purpose of completing a crash report required by this section shall be without prejudice to the individual so reporting. Such report or statement may not be used as evidence in any trial, civil or criminal. However, subject to the applicable rules of evidence, a law enforcement officer at a criminal trial may testify as to any statement made to the officer by the person involved in the crash if that person’s privilege against self-incrimination is not violated. The results of breath, urine, and blood tests administered as provided in s. 316.1932 or s. 316.1933 are not confidential and are admissible into evidence in accordance with the provisions of s. 316.1934(2).

The form must call for sufficiently detailed information to disclose, with reference to a vehicle crash, the cause and conditions then existing and the persons and vehicles involved. Every crash report form must call for the policy numbers of liability insurance and the names of carriers covering any vehicle involved in a crash required to be reported by this chapter. (2) Every crash report required to be made in writing must be made on the appropriate form approved by the department and must contain all the information required therein, including: (a) The date, time, and location of the crash; (b) A description of the vehicles involved; (c) The names and addresses of the parties involved; however, in the event of a crash involving a railroad train, including crashes covered by s. 316.027, s. 316.061, s. 316.065, or s. 316.066, the collection of the information specified in this paragraph shall be at the discretion of the law enforcement officer having jurisdiction to investigate the crash; (d) The names and addresses of all drivers and passengers in the motor vehicles involved; however, in the event of a crash involving a railroad train, including crashes covered by s. 316.027, s. 316.061, s. 316.065, or s. 316.066, the collection of the information specified in this paragraph shall be at the discretion of the law enforcement officer having jurisdiction to investigate the crash; (e) The names and addresses of witnesses; (f) The name, badge number, and law enforcement agency of the officer investigating the crash; and (g) The names of the insurance companies of the motor vehicles involved in the crash, unless not available. A member of a railroad train crew or a passenger on a railroad train is not a passenger for purposes of this section. In the event of a crash involving a railroad train, a member of the railroad train crew must furnish the information in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (e) and, upon request of the law enforcement officer having jurisdiction to investigate the crash, the railroad train engineer’s or conductor’s federal certification pursuant to 49 C.F.R. part 240 or part 242. The absence of information in such written crash reports regarding the existence of passengers in the motor vehicles involved in the crash constitutes a rebuttable presumption that no such passengers were involved in the reported crash. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, a crash report produced electronically by a law enforcement officer must, at a minimum, contain the same information as is called for on those forms approved by the department.

      "text": "316.075 Traffic control signal devices.— (1) Except for automatic warning signal lights installed or to be installed at railroad crossings, whenever traffic, including municipal traffic, is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red, and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and the lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows: (a) Green indication.— 1. Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed cautiously straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 2. Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, as directed by the manual, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time, except the driver of any vehicle may U-turn, so as to proceed in the opposite direction unless such movement is prohibited by posted traffic control signs. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 3. Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in s. 316.0755, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. (b) Steady yellow indication.— 1. Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection. 2. Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in s. 316.0755, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway. (c) Steady red indication.— 1. Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown; however: a. The driver of a vehicle which is stopped at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection in obedience to a steady red signal may make a right turn, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at the intersection, except that municipal and county authorities may prohibit any such right turn against a steady red signal at any intersection, which prohibition shall be effective when a sign giving notice thereof is erected in a location visible to traffic approaching the intersection. b. The driver of a vehicle on a one-way street that intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves to the left shall stop in obedience to a steady red signal, but may then make a left turn into the one-way street, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at the intersection, except that municipal and county authorities may prohibit any such left turn as described, which prohibition shall be effective when a sign giving notice thereof is attached to the traffic control signal device at the intersection. 2.a. The driver of a vehicle facing a steady red signal shall stop before entering the crosswalk and remain stopped to allow a pedestrian, with a permitted signal, to cross a roadway when the pedestrian is in the crosswalk or steps into the crosswalk and is upon the half of the roadway upon which the vehicle is traveling or when the pedestrian is approaching so closely from the opposite half of the roadway as to be in danger. b. Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in s. 316.0755, pedestrians facing a steady red signal shall not enter the roadway. (2) In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal. (3)(a) No traffic control signal device shall be used which does not exhibit a yellow or “caution” light between the green or “go” signal and the red or “stop” signal. (b) No traffic control signal device shall display other than the color red at the top of the vertical signal, nor shall it display other than the color red at the extreme left of the horizontal signal. (4) A violation of this section is a noncriminal traffic infraction, punishable pursuant to chapter 318 as either a pedestrian violation or, if the infraction resulted from the operation of a vehicle, as a moving violation.

(c) The owner of the motor vehicle involved in the violation is responsible and liable for payment of a citation issued for failure to pay a toll, unless the owner can establish the motor vehicle was, at the time of the violation, in the care, custody, or control of another person. In order to establish such facts, the owner of the motor vehicle is required, within 14 days after the date of issuance of the citation, to furnish to the appropriate governmental entity an affidavit setting forth: 1. The name, address, date of birth, and, if known, the driver license number of the person who leased, rented, or otherwise had the care, custody, or control of the motor vehicle at the time of the alleged violation; or 2. If stolen, the police report indicating that the vehicle was stolen at the time of the alleged violation. Upon receipt of an affidavit the person designated as having care, custody, and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the violation may be issued a citation for failure to pay a required toll. The affidavit shall be admissible in a proceeding pursuant to this section for the purpose of providing that the person identified in the affidavit was in actual care, custody, or control of the motor vehicle. The owner of a leased vehicle for which a citation is issued for failure to pay a toll is not responsible for payment of the citation and is not required to submit an affidavit as specified in this subsection if the motor vehicle involved in the violation is registered in the name of the lessee of such motor vehicle. (d) A written report of a toll enforcement officer to photographic evidence that a required toll was not paid is admissible in any proceeding to enforce this section and raises a rebuttable presumption that the motor vehicle named in the report or shown in the photographic evidence was used in violation of this section. (3) The submission of a false affidavit is a misdemeanor of the second degree. (4) Any governmental entity, including, without limitation, a clerk of court, may provide the department with data that is machine readable by the department’s computer system, listing persons who have one or more outstanding violations of this section, with reference to the person’s driver license number or vehicle registration number in the case of a business entity. Pursuant to s. 320.03(8), those persons may not be issued a license plate or revalidation sticker for any motor vehicle. (5) Subsections (2)-(4) supplement the enforcement of this section by law enforcement officers, and this section does not prohibit a law enforcement officer from issuing a citation for a violation of this section in accordance with normal traffic enforcement techniques.

(b) The school district may contract with a private vendor or manufacturer to install a school bus infraction detection system on any school bus within its fleet, whether owned, contracted, or leased, and for services including, but not limited to, the installation, operation, and maintenance of the system. The school district’s decision to install school bus infraction detection systems must be based solely on the need to increase public safety. An individual may not receive a commission from any revenue collected from violations detected through the use of a school bus infraction detection system. A private vendor or manufacturer may not receive a fee or remuneration based upon the number of violations detected through the use of a school bus infraction detection system. This paragraph may not be construed to prohibit a private vendor or manufacturer from receiving a fixed amount of collected proceeds for service rendered in relation to the installation, operation, or maintenance of school bus infraction detection systems. (c) The school district must ensure that each school bus infraction detection system meets the requirements of subsection (19). (d) The school district must enter into an interlocal agreement with one or more law enforcement agencies authorized to enforce violations of s. 316.172(1)(a) and (b) within the school district which jointly establishes the responsibilities of enforcement and the reimbursement of costs associated with school bus infraction detection systems consistent with this section. (2)(a) The school district must post signage on the rear of each school bus in which a school bus infraction detection system is installed and operational which indicates the use of such system. The signage must be in the form of one or more signs or stickers and must contain the following elements in substantially the following form: 1. The words “STOP WHEN RED LIGHTS FLASH” or “DO NOT PASS WHEN RED LIGHTS FLASH.” 2. The words “CAMERA ENFORCED.” 3. A graphic depiction of a camera. (b) The signage must occupy at least 75 percent of the available space that does not contain signs or insignia that are required by other applicable law or by the State Board of Education. (c) The sufficiency of signage or compliance with the signage requirements under this subsection may not be raised in a proceeding challenging a violation of s. 316.172(1)(a) or (b). (3) If a school district that has never conducted a school bus infraction detection system program begins such a program, the school district must make a public announcement and conduct a public awareness campaign of the proposed use of school bus infraction detection systems at least 30 days before commencing enforcement under the school bus infraction detection system program and notify the public of the specific date on which the program will commence. During the 30-day public awareness campaign, only a warning may be issued to the registered owner of a motor vehicle for a violation of s. 316.172(1)(a) or (b) enforced by a school bus infraction detection system, and a civil penalty may not be imposed under chapter 318. (4) Within 30 days after an alleged violation of s. 316.172(1)(a) or (b) is recorded by a school bus infraction detection system, the school district or the private vendor or manufacturer under paragraph (1)(b) must submit the following information to a law enforcement agency that has entered into an interlocal agreement with the school district pursuant to paragraph (1)(d) and has traffic infraction enforcement jurisdiction at the location where the alleged violation occurred: (a) A copy of the recorded video and images showing the motor vehicle allegedly violating s. 316.172(1)(a) or (b). (b) The motor vehicle’s license plate number and the state of issuance of the motor vehicle’s license plate. (c) The date, time, and location of the alleged violation. (5) Within 30 days after receiving the information required in subsection (4), the law enforcement agency or its designee must, if it is determined that the motor vehicle violated s. 316.172(1)(a) or (b), send a notice of violation to the registered owner of the motor vehicle involved in the violation specifying the remedies available under s. 318.14 and that the violator must pay the penalty under s. 318.18(5), furnish an affidavit in accordance with subsection (11), or request an administrative hearing with the school district or county, as applicable, within 60 days after the notice of violation is sent in order to avoid court fees, costs, and the issuance of a uniform traffic citation. The mailing of the notice of violation constitutes notification. The notice of violation must be sent by first-class mail and include all of the following: (a) A copy of one or more recorded images showing the motor vehicle involved in the violation, including an image showing the license plate of the motor vehicle. (b) The date, time, and location of the violation. (c) The amount of the civil penalty, the date by which the civil penalty must be paid, and instructions on how to pay the civil penalty. (d) Instructions on how to request a hearing to contest liability or the notice of violation. (e) A notice that the owner has the right to review, in person or remotely, the video and images recorded by the school bus infraction detection system which constitute a rebuttable presumption against the owner of the motor vehicle that the motor vehicle was used in violation of s. 316.172(1)(a) or (b). (f) The time when, and the place or website at which, the recorded video and images may be examined and observed. (g) A warning that failure to pay the civil penalty or to contest liability within 60 days after the notice is sent will result in the issuance of a uniform traffic citation. (6)(a) A local hearing officer appointed by the school district or county shall administer an administrative hearing process for a contested notice of violation. The school district may appoint an attorney who is, and has been for the preceding 5 years, a member in good standing with The Florida Bar to serve as a local hearing officer. The county in which a school district has entered into an interlocal agreement with a law enforcement agency to issue uniform traffic citations may designate by resolution existing staff to serve as the local hearing officer. At the administrative hearing, the local hearing officer shall determine whether a violation of s. 316.172(1)(a) or (b) has occurred. If the local hearing officer finds by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation has occurred, the local hearing officer must uphold the notice of violation and require the petitioner to pay the penalty previously assessed under s. 318.18(5). The local hearing officer shall also require the petitioner to pay costs consistent with this subsection. (b) Procedures for an administrative hearing conducted under this subsection are as follows: 1. The department shall make available electronically to the school district or its designee or the county a Request for Hearing form to assist each district or county with administering this subsection. 2. A person, referred to in this paragraph as the petitioner, who elects to request a hearing under this subsection shall be scheduled for a hearing. The hearing may be conducted either virtually via live video conferencing or in person. 3. Within 120 days after receipt of a timely request for a hearing, the law enforcement agency or its designee shall provide a replica of the notice of violation data to the school district or county by manual or electronic transmission, and thereafter the school district or its designee or the county shall mail a notice of hearing, which shall include a hearing date and may at the discretion of the district or county include virtual and in-person hearing options, to the petitioner by first-class mail. Mailing of the notice of hearing constitutes notification. Upon receipt of the notice of hearing, the petitioner may reschedule the hearing once by submitting a written request to the local hearing officer at least 5 calendar days before the day of the originally scheduled hearing. The petitioner may cancel his or her hearing by paying the penalty assessed in the notice of violation. 4. All testimony at the hearing shall be under oath. The local hearing officer shall take testimony from the law enforcement agency and the petitioner, and may take testimony from others. The local hearing officer shall review the video and images recorded by a school bus infraction detection system. Formal rules of evidence do not apply, but due process shall be observed and govern the proceedings. 5. At the conclusion of the hearing, the local hearing officer shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether a violation has occurred and shall uphold or dismiss the violation. The local hearing officer shall issue a final administrative order including the determination and, if the notice of violation is upheld, require the petitioner to pay the civil penalty previously assessed in the notice of violation, and shall also require the petitioner to pay costs, not to exceed those established in s. 316.0083(5)(e), to be used by the county for operational costs relating to the hearing process or by the school district for technology and operational costs relating to the hearing process as well as school transportation safety-related initiatives. The final administrative order shall be mailed to the petitioner by first-class mail. 6. An aggrieved party may appeal a final administrative order consistent with the process provided in s. 162.11. (c) Any hearing for a contested notice of violation that has not been conducted before July 1, 2025, may be conducted pursuant to the procedures in this subsection within 1 year after such date. (7) If the registered owner or co-owner of the motor vehicle; the person identified as having care, custody, or control of the motor vehicle at the time of the violation; or an authorized representative of the owner, co-owner, or identified person initiates a proceeding to challenge the violation, such person waives any challenge or dispute as to the delivery of the notice of violation. (8) The civil penalties assessed and collected for a violation of s. 316.172(1)(a) or (b) enforced by a school bus infraction detection system must be remitted to the school district in which the violation occurred. Such civil penalties must be used for the installation, operation, or maintenance of school bus infraction detection systems on school buses, including student transportation safety initiatives, driver recruitment and retention stipends, or other student transportation safety enhancements; for the administration and costs associated with the enforcement of violations as described in this section; or to provide financial awards to recruit or retain school bus drivers in the school district in which the civil penalties are assessed and collected. (9) A uniform traffic citation must be issued by mailing the uniform traffic citation by certified mail to the address of the registered owner of the motor vehicle involved in the violation if, within 60 days after notification under subsection (5), payment has not been made, the registered owner has not submitted an affidavit in accordance with subsection (11), or the registered owner has not requested an administrative hearing with the school district or county, as applicable, contesting the notice of violation pursuant to subsection (6). (a) Delivery of the uniform traffic citation constitutes notification of a violation under this subsection. If the registered owner or co-owner of the motor vehicle; the person identified as having care, custody, or control of the motor vehicle at the time of the violation; or a duly authorized representative of the owner, co-owner, or identified person initiates a proceeding to challenge the citation, such person waives any challenge or dispute as to the delivery of the uniform traffic citation. (b) In the case of joint ownership of a motor vehicle, the uniform traffic citation must be mailed to the first name appearing on the motor vehicle registration, unless the first name appearing on the registration is a business organization, in which case the second name appearing on the registration may be used. (c) The uniform traffic citation mailed to the registered owner of the motor vehicle involved in the violation must be accompanied by information described in paragraphs (5)(a)-(f). (10) The registered owner of the motor vehicle involved in the violation is responsible and liable for paying the uniform traffic citation issued for a violation of s. 316.172(1)(a) or (b) unless the owner can establish that: (a) The motor vehicle was, at the time of the violation, in the care, custody, or control of another person; (b) A uniform traffic citation was issued by a law enforcement officer to the driver of the motor vehicle for the alleged violation of s. 316.172(1)(a) or (b); or (c) The motor vehicle’s owner was deceased on or before the date of the alleged violation, as established by an affidavit submitted by the representative of the motor vehicle owner’s estate or other identified person or family member. (11) To establish such facts under subsection (10), the registered owner of the motor vehicle must, within 60 days after the date of issuance of the notice of violation or the uniform traffic citation, furnish to the law enforcement agency that issued the notice of violation or uniform traffic citation an affidavit setting forth information supporting an exception under subsection (10). (a) An affidavit supporting the exception under paragraph (10)(a) must include the name, address, date of birth, and, if known, the driver license number of the person who leased, rented, or otherwise had care, custody, or control of the motor vehicle at the time of the alleged violation. If the motor vehicle was stolen at the time of the alleged violation, the affidavit must include the police report indicating that the motor vehicle was stolen. (b) If a uniform traffic citation for a violation of s. 316.172(1)(a) or (b) was issued at the location of the violation by a law enforcement officer, the affidavit must include the serial number of the uniform traffic citation. (c) If the motor vehicle’s owner to whom a notice of violation or a uniform traffic citation has been issued is deceased, the affidavit must include a certified copy of the owner’s death certificate showing that the date of death occurred on or before the date of the alleged violation and one of the following: 1. A bill of sale or other document showing that the deceased owner’s motor vehicle was sold or transferred after his or her death but on or before the date of the alleged violation. 2. Documented proof that the registered license plate belonging to the deceased owner’s motor vehicle was returned to the department or any branch office or authorized agent of the department after his or her death but on or before the date of the alleged violation. 3. A copy of the police report showing that the deceased owner’s registered license plate or motor vehicle was stolen after his or her death but on or before the date of the alleged violation. Upon receipt of the affidavit and documentation required under paragraphs (b) and (c), or 60 days after the date of issuance of a notice of violation sent to a person identified as having care, custody, or control of the motor vehicle at the time of the violation under paragraph (a), the law enforcement agency must dismiss the notice or citation and provide proof of such dismissal to the person who submitted the affidavit. If, within 60 days after the date of a notice of violation sent to a person under subsection (12), the law enforcement agency receives an affidavit under subsection (13) from the person who was sent a notice of violation affirming that the person did not have care, custody, or control of the motor vehicle at the time of the violation, the law enforcement agency must notify the registered owner that the notice or citation will not be dismissed due to failure to establish that another person had care, custody, or control of the motor vehicle at the time of the violation. (12) Upon receipt of an affidavit under paragraph (10)(a), the law enforcement agency may issue the person identified as having care, custody, or control of the motor vehicle at the time of the violation a notice of violation pursuant to subsection (5) for a violation of s. 316.172(1)(a) or (b). The affidavit is admissible in a proceeding pursuant to this section for the purpose of providing evidence that the person identified in the affidavit was in actual care, custody, or control of the motor vehicle. The owner of a leased motor vehicle for which a uniform traffic citation is issued for a violation of s. 316.172(1)(a) or (b) is not responsible for paying the uniform traffic citation and is not required to submit an affidavit as specified in subsection (11) if the motor vehicle involved in the violation is registered in the name of the lessee of such motor vehicle. (13) If a law enforcement agency receives an affidavit under paragraph (10)(a), the notice of violation required under subsection (5) must be sent to the person identified in the affidavit within 30 days after receipt of the affidavit. The person identified in an affidavit and sent a notice of violation may affirm he or she did not have care, custody, or control of the motor vehicle at the time of the violation by furnishing to the appropriate law enforcement agency within 60 days after the date of the notice of violation an affidavit stating such. (14) The submission of a false affidavit is a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (15) The video and images recorded by a school bus infraction detection system which are attached to or referenced in the uniform traffic citation are evidence of a violation of s. 316.172(1)(a) or (b) and are admissible in any proceeding to enforce this section. The recorded video and images raise a rebuttable presumption that the motor vehicle shown in the recorded video and images was used in violation of s. 316.172(1)(a) or (b). (16) This section supplements the enforcement of s. 316.172(1)(a) and (b) by a law enforcement officer and does not prohibit a law enforcement officer from issuing a uniform traffic citation for a violation of s. 316.172(1)(a) or (b). (17)(a)1. A school bus infraction detection system may not be used for remote surveillance. The collection of evidence by a school bus infraction detection system to enforce violations of s. 316.172 does not constitute remote surveillance. 2. Video and images recorded as part of a school bus infraction detection system may only be used for traffic enforcement and for purposes of determining criminal or civil liability for incidents captured by the school bus infraction detection system incidental to the permissible use of the school bus infraction detection system. 3. To the extent practicable, a school bus infraction detection system must use necessary technology to ensure that personal identifying information contained in the video or still images recorded by the system which is not relevant to the alleged violation, including, but not limited to, the identity of the driver and any passenger of a motor vehicle, the interior or contents of a motor vehicle, the identity of an uninvolved person, a number identifying the address of a private residence, and the contents or interior of a private residence, is sufficiently obscured so as not to reveal such personal identifying information. 4. A notice of a violation or uniform traffic citation issued under this section may not be dismissed solely because a recorded video or still images reveal personal identifying information as provided in subparagraph 3. as long as a reasonable effort has been made to comply with this subsection. (b) Any recorded video or still image obtained through the use of a school bus infraction detection system must be destroyed within 90 days after the final disposition of the recorded event. The vendor of the school bus infraction detection system must provide the school district with written notice by December 31 of each year that such records have been destroyed in accordance with this section. (c) Notwithstanding any other law, registered motor vehicle owner information obtained as a result of the operation of a school bus infraction detection system is not the property of the manufacturer or vendor of the system and may be used only for the purposes of this section. (18)(a) By October 1, 2023, and quarterly thereafter, each school district operating a school bus infraction detection system must submit, in consultation with the law enforcement agencies with which it has interlocal agreements pursuant to this section, a report to the department which details the results of the school bus infraction detection systems in the school district in the preceding quarter. The information from the school districts must be submitted in a form and manner determined by the department, which the department must make available to the school districts by August 1, 2023, and must include at least the following: 1. The number of school buses that have a school bus infraction detection system installed, including the date of installation and, if applicable, the date the systems were removed. 2. The number of notices of violations issued, the number that were contested, the number that were upheld, the number that were dismissed, the number that were issued as uniform traffic citations, and the number that were paid. 3. Data for each infraction to determine locations in need of safety improvements. Such data may include, but is not limited to, global positioning system coordinates of the infraction, the date and time of the infraction, and the name of the school that the school bus was transporting students to or from. 4. Any other statistical data and information required by the department to complete the report required by paragraph (c). (b) Each school district that operates a school bus infraction detection system is responsible for and must maintain its respective data for reporting purposes under this subsection for at least 2 years after such data is reported to the department. (c) On or before December 31, 2024, and annually thereafter, the department shall submit a summary report to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives regarding the use and operation of school bus infraction detection systems under this section, along with the department’s recommendations and any recommended legislation. The summary report must include a review of the information submitted to the department by the school districts and must describe the enhancement of traffic safety and enforcement programs. (19) A school bus infraction detection system must meet specifications established by the State Board of Education and must be tested at regular intervals according to specifications prescribed by state board rule. The state board must establish such specifications by rule on or before December 31, 2023. However, any such equipment acquired by purchase, lease, or other arrangement under an agreement entered into by a school district on or before December 31, 2023, is not required to meet the specifications established by the state board until July 1, 2024. (20) The State Board of Education may adopt rules to address student privacy concerns that may arise from the use of a school bus infraction detection system.

In every event, speed shall be controlled as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person, vehicle, or other conveyance or object on or entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and the duty of all persons to use due care. (2) On all streets or highways, the maximum speed limits for all vehicles must be 30 miles per hour in business or residence districts, and 55 miles per hour at any time at all other locations. However, with respect to a residence district, a county or municipality may set a maximum speed limit of 20 or 25 miles per hour on local streets and highways after an investigation determines that such a limit is reasonable. It is not necessary to conduct a separate investigation for each residence district. The minimum speed limit on all highways that comprise a part of the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways and have not fewer than four lanes is 40 miles per hour, except that when the posted speed limit is 70 miles per hour, the minimum speed limit is 50 miles per hour. (3) A school bus may not exceed the posted speed limits at any time. (4) The driver of every vehicle shall, consistent with the requirements of subsection (1), drive at an appropriately reduced speed when: (a) Approaching and crossing an intersection or railway grade crossing; (b) Approaching and going around a curve; (c) Approaching a hill crest; (d) Traveling upon any narrow or winding roadway; and (e) Any special hazard exists with respect to pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions. (5) No person shall drive a motor vehicle at such a slow speed as to impede or block the normal and reasonable movement of traffic, except when reduced speed is necessary for safe operation or in compliance with law. (6) No driver of a vehicle shall exceed the posted maximum speed limit in a work zone area.

With respect to residence districts, a municipality may set a maximum speed limit of 20 or 25 miles per hour on local streets and highways after an investigation determines that such a limit is reasonable. It shall not be necessary to conduct a separate investigation for each residence district.

(2) SPEED ON COUNTY ROADS.—The maximum speed on any county-maintained road is: (a) In any business or residence district, 30 miles per hour in the daytime or nighttime; provided that with respect to residence districts a county may set a maximum speed limit of 25 miles per hour after an investigation determines that such a limit is reasonable; and it shall not be necessary to conduct a separate investigation in each residence district. (b) On any other part of a county road not a business or residence district, as set forth in s. 316.183. However, the board of county commissioners may set speed zones altering such speeds, both as to maximum and minimum, after investigation determines such a change is reasonable and in conformity to criteria promulgated by the Department of Transportation, except that no such speed zone shall permit a speed of more than 60 miles per hour. (3) POSTING OF SPEED LIMITS.—All speed zones shall be posted with clearly legible signs. No change in speeds from 30 miles per hour or from those established in s. 316.183 shall take effect until the zone is posted by the authority changing the speed pursuant to this section and s. 316.187.

Enforcement shall also be prioritized during the times that speeding-related crashes most often occur. The enforcement of these zones shall be in a way that maximizes public safety. (2) The Department of Transportation, pursuant to the authority granted under s. 316.187, is authorized to set such maximum and minimum speed limits for travel within enhanced penalty zones as it deems safe and advisable. (3) The Department of Transportation shall adopt a uniform system of traffic control devices for use in conjunction with enhanced penalty zones pursuant to the authority granted under s. 316.0745. (4) A person may not drive a vehicle on a roadway designated as an enhanced penalty zone at a speed greater than that posted in the enhanced penalty zone in accordance with this section. A person who violates the speed limit within a legally posted enhanced penalty zone established under this section commits a moving violation, punishable as provided in chapter 318. (5) The Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles shall annually publish the date, time, and number of citations issued both in and outside enhanced penalty zones and shall make available statistical information based thereon as to the number and circumstances of traffic citations inside an enhanced penalty zone.

(2) Upon request from the appropriate local government, the Department of Transportation shall install and maintain such traffic and pedestrian control devices on state-maintained roads as prescribed in this section for all prekindergarten early-intervention schools that receive federal funding through the Headstart program. (3)(a) A school zone located on a state-maintained primary or secondary road shall be maintained by the Department of Transportation. However, nothing herein shall prohibit the Department of Transportation from entering into agreements with counties or municipalities whereby the local governmental entities would maintain specified school zones on state-maintained primary or secondary roads. (b) The county shall have the responsibility to maintain a school zone located outside of any municipality and on a county road. (c) A municipality shall have the responsibility to maintain a school zone located in a municipality. (d) For the purposes of this section, the term “maintained” with respect to any school zone means the care and maintenance of all school zone signs, markers, traffic control devices, and pedestrian control devices. (4)(a) A school zone maintained by a county shall be periodically inspected by the county sheriff’s office or any other qualified agent to determine whether or not the school zone is being properly maintained. (b) A school zone maintained by a municipality shall be periodically inspected by the municipal police department or any other qualified agent to determine whether or not the school zone is being properly maintained. (5) A school zone speed limit may not be less than 15 miles per hour except by local regulation. No school zone speed limit shall be more than 20 miles per hour in an urbanized area, as defined in s. 334.03. Such speed limit may be in force only during those times 30 minutes before, during, and 30 minutes after the periods of time when pupils are arriving at a regularly scheduled breakfast program or a regularly scheduled school session and leaving a regularly scheduled school session. (6) Permanent signs designating school zones and school zone speed limits shall be uniform in size and color, and shall have the times during which the restrictive speed limit is enforced clearly designated thereon. Flashing beacons activated by a time clock, or other automatic device, or manually activated may be used as an alternative to posting the times during which the restrictive school speed limit is enforced. Beginning July 1, 2008, for any newly established school zone or any school zone in which the signing has been replaced, a sign stating “Speeding Fines Doubled” shall be installed within the school zone. The Department of Transportation shall establish adequate standards for the signs and flashing beacons. (7) Portable signs designating school zones and school zone speed limits shall be uniform in size and color. Such signs shall be erected on the roadway only during those hours when pupils are arriving at and leaving regularly scheduled school sessions. The Department of Transportation shall establish adequate standards for the signs. (8) Nothing herein shall prohibit the use of automatic traffic control devices for the control of vehicular and pedestrian traffic at school crossings.

      "text": "316.191 Racing on highways, street takeovers, and stunt driving.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Burnout” means a maneuver performed while operating a motor vehicle whereby the motor vehicle is kept stationary, or is in motion, while the wheels are spun, resulting in friction which causes the motor vehicle’s tires to heat up and emit smoke. (b) “Conviction” means a determination of guilt that is the result of a plea or trial, regardless of whether adjudication is withheld. (c) “Coordinated street takeover” means 10 or more vehicles operated in an organized manner to effect a street takeover. (d) “Doughnut” means a maneuver performed while operating a motor vehicle whereby the front or rear of the motor vehicle is rotated around the opposite set of wheels in a continuous motion which may cause a circular skid-mark pattern of rubber on the driving surface or the tires to heat up and emit smoke from friction, or both. (e) “Drag race” means the operation of two or more motor vehicles from a point side by side at accelerating speeds in a competitive attempt to outdistance each other, or the operation of one or more motor vehicles over a common selected course, from the same point to the same point, for the purpose of comparing the relative speeds or power of acceleration of such motor vehicle or motor vehicles within a certain distance or time limit. (f) “Drifting” means a maneuver performed while operating a motor vehicle whereby the motor vehicle is steered so that it makes a controlled skid sideways through a turn with the front wheels pointed in a direction opposite to that of the turn. (g) “Motor vehicle” has the same meaning as in s. 316.003. The term “motor vehicle” also includes any motorcycle, autocycle, moped, all-terrain vehicle, off-road vehicle, or vehicle not licensed to operate on a highway or roadway. (h) “Race” means the use of one or more motor vehicles in competition, arising from a challenge to demonstrate superiority of a motor vehicle or driver and the acceptance or competitive response to that challenge, either through a prior arrangement or in immediate response, in which the competitor attempts to outgain or outdistance another motor vehicle, to prevent another motor vehicle from passing, to arrive at a given destination ahead of another motor vehicle or motor vehicles, or to test the physical stamina or endurance of drivers over long-distance driving routes. A race may be prearranged or may occur through a competitive response to conduct on the part of one or more drivers which, under the totality of the circumstances, can reasonably be interpreted as a challenge to race. (i) “Spectator” means any person who is knowingly present at and views a drag race or street takeover, when such presence is the result of an affirmative choice to attend or participate in the event. For purposes of determining whether or not an individual is a spectator, finders of fact shall consider the relationship between the motor vehicle operator and the individual, evidence of gambling or betting on the outcome of the event, filming or recording the event, or posting the event on social media, and any other factor that would tend to show knowing attendance or participation. (j) “Street takeover” means the taking over of a portion of a highway, roadway, or parking lot by blocking or impeding the regular flow of traffic to perform a race, drag race, burnout, doughnut, drifting, wheelie, or other stunt driving. (k) “Stunt driving” means to perform or engage in any burnouts, doughnuts, drifting, wheelies, or other dangerous motor vehicle activity on a highway, roadway, or parking lot as part of a street takeover. (l) “Wheelie” means a maneuver performed while operating a motor vehicle whereby a motor vehicle is ridden for a distance with the front wheel or wheels raised off the ground. (2) A person may not: (a) Drive any motor vehicle in any street takeover, stunt driving, race, speed competition or contest, drag race or acceleration contest, test of physical endurance, or exhibition of speed or acceleration or for the purpose of making a speed record on any highway, roadway, or parking lot; (b) In any manner participate in, coordinate through social media or otherwise, facilitate, or collect moneys at any location for any such race, drag race, street takeover, stunt driving, competition, contest, test, or exhibition; (c) Knowingly ride as a passenger in any such race, drag race, street takeover, stunt driving, competition, contest, test, or exhibition; (d) Purposefully cause the movement of traffic, including pedestrian traffic, to slow, stop, or be impeded in any way for any such race, drag race, street takeover, stunt driving, competition, contest, test, or exhibition; (e) Operate a motor vehicle for the purpose of filming or recording the activities of participants in any such race, drag race, street takeover, stunt driving, competition, contest, test, or exhibition. This paragraph does not apply to bona fide members of the news media; or (f) Operate a motor vehicle carrying any amount of fuel for the purposes of fueling a motor vehicle involved in any such race, drag race, street takeover, stunt driving, competition, contest, test, or exhibition. (3)(a) Any person who violates subsection (2) commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. Any person who violates subsection (2) shall pay a fine of not less than $500 and not more than $2,000, and the department shall revoke the driver license of a person so convicted for 1 year. A hearing may be requested pursuant to s. 322.271. (b) Any person who commits a second violation of subsection (2) within 1 year after the date of a prior violation that resulted in a conviction for a violation of subsection (2) commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, and shall pay a fine of not less than $2,500 and not more than $4,000. The department shall also revoke the driver license of that person for 2 years. A hearing may be requested pursuant to s. 322.271. (c) Any person who violates subsection (2) and, in the course of committing the offense, knowingly impedes, obstructs, or interferes with an authorized emergency vehicle as defined in s. 316.003(1) which is on call and responding to an emergency other than a violation of this section, commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in paragraph (b). (d) Any person who commits a second or subsequent violation of paragraph (c) commits a felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. The department shall also revoke the driver license of that person for 4 years. A hearing may be requested pursuant to s. 322.271. (e) Any person who commits a third or subsequent violation of subsection (2) within 5 years after the date of a prior violation that resulted in a conviction for a violation of subsection (2) commits a felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, and shall pay a fine of not less than $3,500 and not more than $7,500.

Pursuant to the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act, the arresting law enforcement agency may move to seize any vehicle used in the violation of paragraph (d). The department shall also revoke the driver license of that person for 2 years. A hearing may be requested pursuant to s. 322.271. (g) In any case charging a violation of subsection (2), the court shall be provided a copy of the driving record of the person charged and may obtain any records from any other source to determine if one or more prior convictions of the person for a violation of subsection (2) have occurred within a specified period before the charged offense. (4)(a) A person may not be a spectator at any race, drag race, or street takeover prohibited under subsection (2). (b) A person who violates paragraph (a) commits a noncriminal traffic infraction, punishable by a fine of $400. (5) Whenever a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a person violated subsection (2), the officer may arrest and take such person into custody without a warrant. The court may enter an order of impoundment or immobilization as a condition of incarceration or probation. Within 7 business days after the date the court issues the order of impoundment or immobilization, the clerk of the court must send notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the registered owner of the motor vehicle, if the registered owner is a person other than the defendant, and to each person of record claiming a lien against the motor vehicle. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the impounding agency shall release a motor vehicle under the conditions provided in s. 316.193(6)(e), (f), (g), and (h), if the owner or agent presents a valid driver license at the time of pickup of the motor vehicle. (b) All costs and fees for the impoundment or immobilization, including the cost of notification, must be paid by the owner of the motor vehicle or, if the motor vehicle is leased or rented, by the person leasing or renting the motor vehicle, unless the impoundment or immobilization order is dismissed. All provisions of s. 713.78 shall apply. (c) Any motor vehicle used in violation of subsection (2) may be impounded for a period of 30 business days if a law enforcement officer has arrested and taken a person into custody pursuant to this subsection. If the arresting officer finds that the criteria of this paragraph are met, the officer may immediately impound the motor vehicle. The law enforcement officer shall notify the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles of any impoundment for violation of this subsection in accordance with procedures established by the department. Paragraphs (a) and (b) shall be applicable to such impoundment. (6) Any motor vehicle used in violation of subsection (2) by any person within 5 years after the date of a prior conviction of that person for a violation under subsection (2) may be seized and forfeited as provided by the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act. This subsection shall only be applicable if the owner of the motor vehicle is the person charged with violating subsection (2). (7) This section does not apply to licensed or duly authorized racetracks, drag strips, or other designated areas set aside by proper authorities for such purposes.

(b) On a second or subsequent conviction, by imprisonment for not more than 6 months or by a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $1,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment. (3) Any person: (a) Who is in violation of subsection (1); (b) Who operates a vehicle; and (c) Who, by reason of such operation, causes: 1. Damage to the property or person of another commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. 2. Serious bodily injury to another commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. The term “serious bodily injury” means an injury to another person, which consists of a physical condition that creates a substantial risk of death, serious personal disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ. (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, $5 shall be added to a fine imposed pursuant to this section. The clerk shall remit the $5 to the Department of Revenue for deposit in the Emergency Medical Services Trust Fund. (5) In addition to any other penalty provided under this section, if the court has reasonable cause to believe that the use of alcohol, chemical substances set forth in s. 877.111, or substances controlled under chapter 893 contributed to a violation of this section, the court shall direct the person so convicted to complete a DUI program substance abuse education course and evaluation as provided in s. 316.193(5) within a reasonable period of time specified by the court. If the DUI program conducting such course and evaluation refers the person to an authorized substance abuse treatment provider for substance abuse evaluation and treatment, the directive of the court requiring completion of such course, evaluation, and treatment shall be enforced as provided in s. 322.245. The referral to treatment resulting from the DUI program evaluation may not be waived without a supporting independent psychosocial evaluation conducted by an authorized substance abuse treatment provider, appointed by the court, which shall have access to the DUI program psychosocial evaluation before the independent psychosocial evaluation is conducted. The court shall review the results and recommendations of both evaluations before determining the request for waiver. The offender shall bear the full cost of this procedure. If a person directed to a DUI program substance abuse education course and evaluation or referred to treatment under this subsection fails to report for or complete such course, evaluation, or treatment, the DUI program shall notify the court and the department of the failure. Upon receipt of such notice, the department shall cancel the person’s driving privilege, notwithstanding the terms of the court order or any suspension or revocation of the driving privilege. The department may reinstate the driving privilege upon verification from the DUI program that the education, evaluation, and treatment are completed. The department may temporarily reinstate the driving privilege on a restricted basis upon verification that the offender is currently participating in treatment and has completed the DUI education course and evaluation requirement. If the DUI program notifies the department of the second failure to complete treatment, the department shall reinstate the driving privilege only after notice of successful completion of treatment from the DUI program.

Serious bodily injury to another, as defined in s. 316.1933, commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. 3. The death of any human being or unborn child commits DUI manslaughter, and commits: a. A felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. b.

A felony of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if the person has a prior conviction under this subparagraph, 1 s. 327.35(3)(a)3.c., s. 782.071, or s. 782.072. For purposes of this subsection, the term “unborn child” has the same meaning as provided in s. 775.021(5). A person who is convicted of DUI manslaughter shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 4 years. (4) Any person who is convicted of a violation of subsection (1) and who has a blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level of 0.15 or higher, or any person who is convicted of a violation of subsection (1) and who at the time of the offense was accompanied in the vehicle by a person under the age of 18 years, shall be punished: (a) By a fine of: 1. Not less than $1,000 or more than $2,000 for a first conviction. 2. Not less than $2,000 or more than $4,000 for a second conviction. 3. Not less than $4,000 for a third or subsequent conviction.

The portion of a fine imposed in excess of $1,000 pursuant to subparagraph (a)1. and the portion of a fine imposed in excess of $2,000 pursuant to subparagraph (a)2. or subparagraph (a)3., shall be remitted by the clerk to the Department of Revenue for deposit into the General Revenue Fund. (c) In addition to the penalties in paragraphs (a) and (b), the court shall order the mandatory placement, at the convicted person’s sole expense, of an ignition interlock device approved by the department in accordance with s. 316.1938 upon all vehicles that are individually or jointly leased or owned and routinely operated by the convicted person for not less than 6 continuous months for the first offense and for not less than 2 continuous years for a second offense, when the convicted person qualifies for a permanent or restricted license. (5) The court shall place all offenders convicted of violating this section on monthly reporting probation and shall require completion of a substance abuse course conducted by a DUI program licensed by the department under s. 322.292, which must include a psychosocial evaluation of the offender. If the DUI program refers the offender to an authorized substance abuse treatment provider for substance abuse treatment, in addition to any sentence or fine imposed under this section, completion of all such education, evaluation, and treatment is a condition of reporting probation. The offender shall assume reasonable costs for such education, evaluation, and treatment. The referral to treatment resulting from a psychosocial evaluation shall not be waived without a supporting independent psychosocial evaluation conducted by an authorized substance abuse treatment provider appointed by the court, which shall have access to the DUI program’s psychosocial evaluation before the independent psychosocial evaluation is conducted. The court shall review the results and recommendations of both evaluations before determining the request for waiver. The offender shall bear the full cost of this procedure. The term “substance abuse” means the abuse of alcohol or any substance named or described in Schedules I through V of s. 893.03. If an offender referred to treatment under this subsection fails to report for or complete such treatment or fails to complete the DUI program substance abuse education course and evaluation, the DUI program shall notify the court and the department of the failure. Upon receipt of the notice, the department shall cancel the offender’s driving privilege, notwithstanding the terms of the court order or any suspension or revocation of the driving privilege. The department may temporarily reinstate the driving privilege on a restricted basis upon verification from the DUI program that the offender is currently participating in treatment and the DUI education course and evaluation requirement has been completed. If the DUI program notifies the department of the second failure to complete treatment, the department shall reinstate the driving privilege only after notice of completion of treatment from the DUI program. The organization that conducts the substance abuse education and evaluation may not provide required substance abuse treatment unless a waiver has been granted to that organization by the department. A waiver may be granted only if the department determines, in accordance with its rules, that the service provider that conducts the substance abuse education and evaluation is the most appropriate service provider and is licensed under chapter 397 or is exempt from such licensure. A statistical referral report shall be submitted quarterly to the department by each organization authorized to provide services under this section. (6) With respect to any person convicted of a violation of subsection (1), regardless of any penalty imposed pursuant to subsection (2), subsection (3), or subsection (4): (a) For the first conviction, the court shall place the defendant on probation for a period not to exceed 1 year and, as a condition of such probation, shall order the defendant to participate in public service or a community work project for a minimum of 50 hours. The court may order a defendant to pay a fine of $10 for each hour of public service or community work otherwise required only if the court finds that the residence or location of the defendant at the time public service or community work is required or the defendant’s employment obligations would create an undue hardship for the defendant. However, the total period of probation and incarceration may not exceed 1 year. The court must also, as a condition of probation, order the impoundment or immobilization of the vehicle that was operated by or in the actual control of the defendant or any one vehicle registered in the defendant’s name at the time of impoundment or immobilization, for a period of 10 days or for the unexpired term of any lease or rental agreement that expires within 10 days. The impoundment or immobilization must not occur concurrently with the incarceration of the defendant. The impoundment or immobilization order may be dismissed in accordance with paragraph (e), paragraph (f), paragraph (g), or paragraph (h). (b) For the second conviction for an offense that occurs within a period of 5 years after the date of a prior conviction for violation of this section, the court shall order imprisonment for not less than 10 days. The court must also, as a condition of probation, order the impoundment or immobilization of all vehicles owned by the defendant at the time of impoundment or immobilization, for a period of 30 days or for the unexpired term of any lease or rental agreement that expires within 30 days. The impoundment or immobilization must not occur concurrently with the incarceration of the defendant and must occur concurrently with the driver license revocation imposed under s. 322.28(2)(a)2. The impoundment or immobilization order may be dismissed in accordance with paragraph (e), paragraph (f), paragraph (g), or paragraph (h). At least 48 hours of confinement must be consecutive. (c) For the third or subsequent conviction for an offense that occurs within a period of 10 years after the date of a prior conviction for violation of this section, the court shall order imprisonment for not less than 30 days. The court must also, as a condition of probation, order the impoundment or immobilization of all vehicles owned by the defendant at the time of impoundment or immobilization, for a period of 90 days or for the unexpired term of any lease or rental agreement that expires within 90 days. The impoundment or immobilization must not occur concurrently with the incarceration of the defendant and must occur concurrently with the driver license revocation imposed under s. 322.28(2)(a)3. The impoundment or immobilization order may be dismissed in accordance with paragraph (e), paragraph (f), paragraph (g), or paragraph (h). At least 48 hours of confinement must be consecutive. (d) The court must at the time of sentencing the defendant issue an order for the impoundment or immobilization of a vehicle. The order of impoundment or immobilization must include the name and telephone numbers of all immobilization agencies meeting all of the conditions of subsection (13). Within 7 business days after the date that the court issues the order of impoundment or immobilization, the clerk of the court must send notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the registered owner of each vehicle, if the registered owner is a person other than the defendant, and to each person of record claiming a lien against the vehicle. (e) A person who owns but was not operating the vehicle when the offense occurred may submit to the court a police report indicating that the vehicle was stolen at the time of the offense or documentation of having purchased the vehicle after the offense was committed from an entity other than the defendant or the defendant’s agent. If the court finds that the vehicle was stolen or that the sale was not made to circumvent the order and allow the defendant continued access to the vehicle, the order must be dismissed and the owner of the vehicle will incur no costs. If the court denies the request to dismiss the order of impoundment or immobilization, the petitioner may request an evidentiary hearing. (f) A person who owns but was not operating the vehicle when the offense occurred, and whose vehicle was stolen or who purchased the vehicle after the offense was committed directly from the defendant or the defendant’s agent, may request an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the impoundment or immobilization should occur. If the court finds that either the vehicle was stolen or the purchase was made without knowledge of the offense, that the purchaser had no relationship to the defendant other than through the transaction, and that such purchase would not circumvent the order and allow the defendant continued access to the vehicle, the order must be dismissed and the owner of the vehicle will incur no costs. (g) The court shall also dismiss the order of impoundment or immobilization of the vehicle if the court finds that the family of the owner of the vehicle has no other private or public means of transportation. (h) The court may also dismiss the order of impoundment or immobilization of any vehicles that are owned by the defendant but that are operated solely by the employees of the defendant or any business owned by the defendant. (i) The court may also dismiss the order of impoundment or immobilization if the defendant provides proof to the satisfaction of the court that a functioning, certified ignition interlock device has been installed upon all vehicles that are individually or jointly leased or owned and routinely operated by the convicted person. (j)1. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, s. 316.1937, and s. 322.2715 relating to ignition interlock devices required for second or subsequent offenders, in order to strengthen the pretrial and posttrial options available to prosecutors and judges, the court may order, if deemed appropriate, that a person participate in a qualified sobriety and drug monitoring program, as defined in subparagraph 2., in addition to the ignition interlock device requirement. Participation shall be at the person’s sole expense. 2. As used in this paragraph, the term “qualified sobriety and drug monitoring program” means an evidence-based program, approved by the department, in which participants are regularly tested for alcohol and drug use. As the court deems appropriate, the program may monitor alcohol or drugs through one or more of the following modalities: breath testing twice a day; continuous transdermal alcohol monitoring in cases of hardship; or random blood, breath, urine, or oral fluid testing. Testing modalities that provide the best ability to sanction a violation as close in time as reasonably feasible to the occurrence of the violation should be given preference. This paragraph does not preclude a court from ordering an ignition interlock device as a testing modality. 3. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “evidence-based program” means a program that satisfies the requirements of at least two of the following: a. The program is included in the federal registry of evidence-based programs and practices. b. The program has been reported in a peer-reviewed journal as having positive effects on the primary targeted outcome. c. The program has been documented as effective by informed experts and other sources. (k) All costs and fees for the impoundment or immobilization, including the cost of notification, must be paid by the owner of the vehicle or, if the vehicle is leased or rented, by the person leasing or renting the vehicle, unless the impoundment or immobilization order is dismissed. All provisions of s. 713.78 shall apply. The costs and fees for the impoundment or immobilization must be paid directly to the person impounding or immobilizing the vehicle. (l) The person who owns a vehicle that is impounded or immobilized under this paragraph, or a person who has a lien of record against such a vehicle and who has not requested a review of the impoundment pursuant to paragraph (e), paragraph (f), or paragraph (g), may, within 10 days after the date that person has knowledge of the location of the vehicle, file a complaint in the county in which the owner resides to determine whether the vehicle was wrongfully taken or withheld from the owner or lienholder. Upon the filing of a complaint, the owner or lienholder may have the vehicle released by posting with the court a bond or other adequate security equal to the amount of the costs and fees for impoundment or immobilization, including towing or storage, to ensure the payment of such costs and fees if the owner or lienholder does not prevail. When the bond is posted and the fee is paid as set forth in s. 28.24, the clerk of the court shall issue a certificate releasing the vehicle. At the time of release, after reasonable inspection, the owner or lienholder must give a receipt to the towing or storage company indicating any loss or damage to the vehicle or to the contents of the vehicle. (m) A defendant, in the court’s discretion, may be required to serve all or any portion of a term of imprisonment to which the defendant has been sentenced pursuant to this section in a residential alcoholism treatment program or a residential drug abuse treatment program. Any time spent in such a program must be credited by the court toward the term of imprisonment. For the purposes of this section, any conviction for a violation of s. 327.35; a previous conviction for the violation of former s. 316.1931, former s. 860.01, or former s. 316.028; or a previous conviction outside this state for driving under the influence, driving while intoxicated, driving with an unlawful blood-alcohol level, driving with an unlawful breath-alcohol level, or any other similar alcohol-related or drug-related traffic offense, is also considered a previous conviction for violation of this section. However, in satisfaction of the fine imposed pursuant to this section, the court may, upon a finding that the defendant is financially unable to pay either all or part of the fine, order that the defendant participate for a specified additional period of time in public service or a community work project in lieu of payment of that portion of the fine which the court determines the defendant is unable to pay. In determining such additional sentence, the court shall consider the amount of the unpaid portion of the fine and the reasonable value of the services to be ordered; however, the court may not compute the reasonable value of services at a rate less than the federal minimum wage at the time of sentencing. (7) A conviction under this section does not bar any civil suit for damages against the person so convicted. (8) At the arraignment, or in conjunction with any notice of arraignment provided by the clerk of the court, the clerk shall provide any person charged with a violation of this section with notice that upon conviction the court shall suspend or revoke the offender’s driver license and that the offender should make arrangements for transportation at any proceeding in which the court may take such action. Failure to provide such notice does not affect the court’s suspension or revocation of the offender’s driver license. (9) A person who is arrested for a violation of this section may not be released from custody: (a) Until the person is no longer under the influence of alcoholic beverages, any chemical substance set forth in s. 877.111, or any substance controlled under chapter 893 and affected to the extent that his or her normal faculties are impaired; (b) Until the person’s blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level is less than 0.05; or (c) Until 8 hours have elapsed from the time the person was arrested. (10) The rulings of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles under s. 322.2615 shall not be considered in any trial for a violation of this section. Testimony or evidence from the administrative proceedings or any written statement submitted by a person in his or her request for administrative review is inadmissible into evidence or for any other purpose in any criminal proceeding, unless timely disclosed in criminal discovery pursuant to Rule 3.220, Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure. (11) The Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles is directed to adopt rules providing for the implementation of the use of ignition interlock devices. (12) If the records of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles show that the defendant has been previously convicted of the offense of driving under the influence, that evidence is sufficient by itself to establish that prior conviction for driving under the influence. However, such evidence may be contradicted or rebutted by other evidence. This presumption may be considered along with any other evidence presented in deciding whether the defendant has been previously convicted of the offense of driving under the influence. (13) If personnel of the circuit court or the sheriff do not immobilize vehicles, only immobilization agencies that meet the conditions of this subsection shall immobilize vehicles in that judicial circuit. (a) The immobilization agency responsible for immobilizing vehicles in that judicial circuit shall be subject to strict compliance with all of the following conditions and restrictions: 1. Any immobilization agency engaged in the business of immobilizing vehicles shall provide to the clerk of the court a signed affidavit attesting that the agency: a. Has verifiable experience in immobilizing vehicles; b. Maintains accurate and complete records of all payments for the immobilization, copies of all documents pertaining to the court’s order of impoundment or immobilization, and any other documents relevant to each immobilization.

      "text": "316.1934 Presumption of impairment; testing methods.— (1) It is unlawful and punishable as provided in chapter 322 and in s. 316.193 for any person who is under the influence of alcoholic beverages or controlled substances, when affected to the extent that the person’s normal faculties are impaired or to the extent that the person is deprived of full possession of normal faculties, to drive or be in actual physical control of any motor vehicle within this state. Such normal faculties include, but are not limited to, the ability to see, hear, walk, talk, judge distances, drive an automobile, make judgments, act in emergencies, and, in general, normally perform the many mental and physical acts of daily life. (2) At the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person while driving, or in actual physical control of, a vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic beverages or controlled substances, when affected to the extent that the person’s normal faculties were impaired or to the extent that he or she was deprived of full possession of his or her normal faculties, the results of any test administered in accordance with s. 316.1932 or s. 316.1933 and this section are admissible into evidence when otherwise admissible, and the amount of alcohol in the person’s blood or breath at the time alleged, as shown by chemical analysis of the person’s blood, or by chemical or physical test of the person’s breath, gives rise to the following presumptions: (a) If there was at that time a blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level of 0.05 or less, it is presumed that the person was not under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired. (b) If there was at that time a blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level in excess of 0.05 but less than 0.08, that fact does not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired but may be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired. (c) If there was at that time a blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher, that fact is prima facie evidence that the person was under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired. Moreover, such person who has a blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher is guilty of driving, or being in actual physical control of, a motor vehicle, with an unlawful blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level. The presumptions provided in this subsection do not limit the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question of whether the person was under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired. (3) A chemical analysis of a person’s blood to determine alcoholic content or a chemical or physical test of a person’s breath, in order to be considered valid under this section, must have been performed substantially in accordance with methods approved by the Department of Law Enforcement and by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the department for this purpose. Any insubstantial differences between approved techniques and actual testing procedures or any insubstantial defects concerning the permit issued by the department, in any individual case do not render the test or test results invalid. The Department of Law Enforcement may approve satisfactory techniques or methods, ascertain the qualifications and competence of individuals to conduct such analyses, and issue permits that are subject to termination or revocation in accordance with rules adopted by the department. (4) Any person charged with a violation of s. 316.193, whether in a municipality or not, is entitled to trial by jury according to the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure. (5) An affidavit containing the results of any test of a person’s blood or breath to determine its alcohol content, as authorized by s. 316.1932 or s. 316.1933, is admissible in evidence under the exception to the hearsay rule in s. 90.803(8) for public records and reports. Such affidavit is admissible without further authentication and is presumptive proof of the results of an authorized test to determine alcohol content of the blood or breath if the affidavit discloses: (a) The type of test administered and the procedures followed; (b) The time of the collection of the blood or breath sample analyzed; (c) The numerical results of the test indicating the alcohol content of the blood or breath; (d) The type and status of any permit issued by the Department of Law Enforcement which was held by the person who performed the test; and (e) If the test was administered by means of a breath testing instrument, the date of performance of the most recent required maintenance on such instrument. The Department of Law Enforcement shall provide a form for the affidavit. Admissibility of the affidavit does not abrogate the right of the person tested to subpoena the person who administered the test for examination as an adverse witness at a civil or criminal trial or other proceeding. (6) Nothing in this section prohibits the prosecution of a person under s. 322.62. The provisions of subsection (2) do not apply to such prosecution and the presumptions made pursuant to that subsection may not be introduced into evidence during such prosecution.

      "text": "316.1937 Ignition interlock devices, requiring; unlawful acts.— (1) In addition to any other authorized penalties, the court may require that any person who is convicted of driving under the influence in violation of s. 316.193 shall not operate a motor vehicle unless that vehicle is equipped with a functioning ignition interlock device certified by the department as provided in s. 316.1938, and installed in such a manner that the vehicle will not start if the operator’s blood alcohol level is in excess of 0.025 percent or as otherwise specified by the court. The court may require the use of an approved ignition interlock device for a period of at least 6 continuous months, if the person is permitted to operate a motor vehicle, whether or not the privilege to operate a motor vehicle is restricted, as determined by the court. The court, however, shall order placement of an ignition interlock device in those circumstances required by s. 316.193. (2) If the court imposes the use of an ignition interlock device, the court shall: (a) Stipulate on the record the requirement for, and the period of, the use of a certified ignition interlock device. (b) Order that the records of the department reflect such requirement. (c) Order that an ignition interlock device be installed, as the court may determine necessary, on any vehicle owned or operated by the person. (d) Determine the person’s ability to pay for installation of the device if the person claims inability to pay. If the court determines that the person is unable to pay for installation of the device, the court may order that any portion of a fine paid by the person for a violation of s. 316.193 shall be allocated to defray the costs of installing the device. (e) Require proof of installation of the device and periodic reporting to the department for verification of the operation of the device in the person’s vehicle. (3) If the court imposes the use of an ignition interlock device on a person whose driving privilege is not suspended or revoked, the court shall require the person to provide proof of compliance to the department within 30 days. If the person fails to provide proof of installation within that period, absent a finding by the court of good cause for that failure which is entered in the court record, the court shall notify the department. (4) If the court imposes the use of an ignition interlock device on a person whose driving privilege is suspended or revoked for a period of less than 3 years, the department shall require proof of compliance before reinstatement of the person’s driving privilege. (5)(a) In addition to any other provision of law, upon conviction of a violation of this section the department shall revoke the person’s driving privilege for 1 year from the date of conviction. Upon conviction of a separate violation of this section during the same period of required use of an ignition interlock device, the department shall revoke the person’s driving privilege for 5 years from the date of conviction. (b) Any person convicted of a violation of subsection (6) who does not have a driver license shall, in addition to any other penalty provided by law, pay a fine of not less than $250 or more than $500 per each such violation. In the event that the person is unable to pay any such fine, the fine shall become a lien against the motor vehicle used in violation of subsection (6) and payment shall be made pursuant to s. 316.3025(5). (6)(a) It is unlawful to tamper with, or to circumvent the operation of, a court-ordered ignition interlock device. (b) It is unlawful for any person whose driving privilege is restricted pursuant to this section to request or solicit any other person to blow into an ignition interlock device or to start a motor vehicle equipped with the device for the purpose of providing the person so restricted with an operable motor vehicle. (c) It is unlawful to blow into an ignition interlock device or to start a motor vehicle equipped with the device for the purpose of providing an operable motor vehicle to a person whose driving privilege is restricted pursuant to this section. (d) It is unlawful to knowingly lease or lend a motor vehicle to a person who has had his or her driving privilege restricted as provided in this section, unless the vehicle is equipped with a functioning, certified ignition interlock device. Any person whose driving privilege is restricted under a condition of probation requiring an ignition interlock device shall notify any other person who leases or loans a motor vehicle to him or her of such driving restriction. (7) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, if a person is required to operate a motor vehicle in the course and scope of his or her employment and if the vehicle is owned or leased by the employer, the person may operate that vehicle without installation of an approved ignition interlock device if the employer has been notified of such driving privilege restriction. Proof of that notification must be with the vehicle. This employment exemption does not apply, however, if the business entity which owns the vehicle is owned or controlled by the person whose driving privilege has been restricted. (8) In addition to the penalties provided in this section, a violation of this section is a noncriminal traffic infraction, punishable as a nonmoving violation as provided in chapter 318.

(2) A person operating a bicycle may not ride other than upon or astride a permanent and regular seat attached thereto unless the bicycle was designed by the manufacturer to be ridden without a seat. (3)(a) A bicycle may not be used to carry more persons at one time than the number for which it is designed or equipped, except that an adult rider may carry a child securely attached to his or her person in a backpack or sling. (b) Except as provided in paragraph (a), a bicycle rider must carry any passenger who is a child under 4 years of age, or who weighs 40 pounds or less, in a seat or carrier that is designed to carry a child of that age or size and that secures and protects the child from the moving parts of the bicycle. (c) A bicycle rider may not allow a passenger to remain in a child seat or carrier on a bicycle when the rider is not in immediate control of the bicycle. (d) A bicycle rider or passenger who is under 16 years of age must wear a bicycle helmet that is properly fitted and is fastened securely upon the passenger’s head by a strap and that meets the federal safety standard for bicycle helmets, final rule, 16 C.F.R. part 1203. As used in this subsection, the term “passenger” includes a child who is riding in a trailer or semitrailer attached to a bicycle. (e) Law enforcement officers and school crossing guards may issue a bicycle safety brochure and a verbal warning to a bicycle rider or passenger who violates this subsection. A bicycle rider or passenger who violates this subsection may be issued a citation by a law enforcement officer and assessed a fine for a pedestrian violation, as provided in s. 318.18. The court shall dismiss the charge against a bicycle rider or passenger for a first violation of paragraph (d) upon proof of purchase of a bicycle helmet that complies with this subsection. (4) No person riding upon any bicycle, coaster, roller skates, sled, or toy vehicle may attach the same or himself or herself to any vehicle upon a roadway. This subsection does not prohibit attaching a bicycle trailer or bicycle semitrailer to a bicycle if that trailer or semitrailer is commercially available and has been designed for such attachment. (5)(a) A person operating a bicycle upon a roadway at less than the normal speed of traffic at the time and place and under the conditions then existing must ride in the bicycle lane or, if there is no bicycle lane on the roadway, as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway except under any of the following situations: 1. When overtaking and passing another bicycle or vehicle proceeding in the same direction. 2. When preparing for a left turn at an intersection or into a private road or driveway. 3. When reasonably necessary to avoid any condition or potential conflict, including, but not limited to, a fixed or moving object, parked or moving vehicle, bicycle, pedestrian, animal, surface hazard, turn lane, or substandard-width lane, which makes it unsafe to continue along the right-hand curb or edge or within a bicycle lane. For the purposes of this subsection, a “substandard-width lane” is a lane that is too narrow for a bicycle and another vehicle to travel safely side by side within the lane. (b) A person operating a bicycle upon a one-way highway with two or more marked traffic lanes may ride as near the left-hand curb or edge of such roadway as practicable. (6)(a) Persons riding bicycles upon a roadway or in a bicycle lane may not ride more than two abreast except on a bicycle path. Persons riding two abreast may not impede traffic when traveling at less than the normal speed of traffic at the time and place and under the conditions then existing and must ride within a single lane. Where bicycle lanes exist, persons riding bicycles may ride two abreast if both are able to remain within the bicycle lane. If the bicycle lane is too narrow to allow two persons riding bicycles to ride two abreast, the persons must ride single-file and within the bicycle lane. On roads that contain a substandard-width lane as defined in subparagraph (5)(a)3., persons riding bicycles may temporarily ride two abreast only to avoid hazards in the roadway or to overtake another person riding a bicycle. (b) When stopping at a stop sign, persons riding bicycles in groups, after coming to a full stop and obeying all traffic laws, may proceed through the stop sign in a group of 10 or fewer at a time. Motor vehicle operators must allow one such group to travel through the intersection before moving forward. (7) Every bicycle in use between sunset and sunrise shall be equipped with a lamp on the front exhibiting a white light visible from a distance of at least 500 feet to the front and a lamp and reflector on the rear each exhibiting a red light visible from a distance of 600 feet to the rear. A bicycle or its rider may be equipped with lights or reflectors in addition to those required by this section. A law enforcement officer may issue a bicycle safety brochure and a verbal warning to a bicycle rider who violates this subsection or may issue a citation and assess a fine for a pedestrian violation as provided in s. 318.18. The court shall dismiss the charge against a bicycle rider for a first violation of this subsection upon proof of purchase and installation of the proper lighting equipment.

(5) An electric bicycle must comply with the equipment and manufacturing requirements for bicycles adopted by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission under 16 C.F.R. part 1512. (6) An electric bicycle must operate in a manner so that the electric motor is disengaged or ceases to function when the rider stops pedaling or when the brakes are applied. (7) An operator may ride an electric bicycle where bicycles are allowed, including, but not limited to, streets, highways, roadways, shoulders, bicycle lanes, and bicycle or multiuse paths. (8) A local government may adopt an ordinance providing one or more minimum age requirements to operate an electric bicycle and may adopt an ordinance requiring an operator of an electric bicycle to possess a government-issued photographic identification while operating the electric bicycle. (9) A local government may provide training on the safe operation of electric bicycles and compliance with the traffic laws of this state that apply to electric bicycles.

      "text": "316.212 Operation of golf carts on certain roadways.—The operation of a golf cart upon the public roads or streets of this state is prohibited except as provided herein: (1) A golf cart may be operated only upon a county road that has been designated by a county, a municipal street that has been designated by a municipality, a two-lane county road located within the jurisdiction of a municipality designated by that municipality, or a road that is owned and maintained by a water control district and has been designated by that water control district, for use by golf carts. Before making such a designation, the responsible local governmental entity must first determine that golf carts may safely travel on or cross the public road or street, considering factors including the speed, volume, and character of motor vehicle traffic using the road or street, and if such designation is to be made by a water control district, the district must also receive approval from the county in which the road to be designated is located. Upon a determination that golf carts may be safely operated on a designated road or street, the responsible governmental entity shall post appropriate signs to indicate that such operation is allowed. (2) A golf cart may be operated on a part of the State Highway System only under the following conditions: (a) To cross a portion of the State Highway System which intersects a county road or municipal street that has been designated for use by golf carts if the Department of Transportation has reviewed and approved the location and design of the crossing and any traffic control devices needed for safety purposes. (b) To cross, at midblock, a part of the State Highway System where a golf course is constructed on both sides of the highway if the Department of Transportation has reviewed and approved the location and design of the crossing and any traffic control devices needed for safety purposes. (c) A golf cart may be operated on a state road that has been designated for transfer to a local government unit pursuant to s. 335.0415 if the Department of Transportation determines that the operation of a golf cart within the right-of-way of the road will not impede the safe and efficient flow of motor vehicular traffic. The department may authorize the operation of golf carts on such a road if: 1. The road is the only available public road along which golf carts may travel or cross or the road provides the safest travel route among alternative routes available; and 2. The speed, volume, and character of motor vehicular traffic using the road is considered in making such a determination. Upon its determination that golf carts may be operated on a given road, the department shall post appropriate signs on the road to indicate that such operation is allowed. (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a golf cart may be operated for the purpose of crossing a street or highway where a single mobile home park is located on both sides of the street or highway and is divided by that street or highway, provided that the governmental entity having original jurisdiction over such street or highway shall review and approve the location of the crossing and require implementation of any traffic controls needed for safety purposes. This subsection shall apply only to residents or guests of the mobile home park. If notice is posted at the entrance and exit of any mobile home park where residents of the park operate golf carts or electric vehicles within the confines of the park, it is not necessary for the park to have a gate or other device at the entrance and exit in order for such golf carts or electric vehicles to be lawfully operated in the park. (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if authorized by the Division of Recreation and Parks of the Department of Environmental Protection, a golf cart may be operated on a road that is part of the State Park Road System if the posted speed limit is 35 miles per hour or less. (5) A golf cart may be operated only during the hours between sunrise and sunset, unless the responsible governmental entity has determined that a golf cart may be operated during the hours between sunset and sunrise and the golf cart is equipped with headlights, brake lights, turn signals, and a windshield. (6) A golf cart must be equipped with efficient brakes, reliable steering apparatus, safe tires, a rearview mirror, and red reflectorized warning devices in both the front and rear. (7) A golf cart may not be operated on public roads or streets by a person: (a) Who is under 18 years of age unless he or she possesses a valid learner’s driver license or valid driver license. (b) Who is 18 years of age or older unless he or she possesses a valid form of government-issued photographic identification. (8) A local governmental entity may enact an ordinance relating to: (a) Golf cart operation and equipment which is more restrictive than those enumerated in this section. Upon enactment of such ordinance, the local governmental entity shall post appropriate signs or otherwise inform the residents that such an ordinance exists and that it will be enforced within the local government’s jurisdictional territory. An ordinance referred to in this section must apply only to an unlicensed driver. (b) Golf cart operation on sidewalks adjacent to specific segments of municipal streets, county roads, or state highways within the jurisdictional territory of the local governmental entity if: 1. The local governmental entity determines, after considering the condition and current use of the sidewalks, the character of the surrounding community, and the locations of authorized golf cart crossings, that golf carts, bicycles, and pedestrians may safely share the sidewalk; 2. The local governmental entity consults with the Department of Transportation before adopting the ordinance; 3. The ordinance restricts golf carts to a maximum speed of 15 miles per hour and permits such use on sidewalks adjacent to state highways only if the sidewalks are at least 8 feet wide; 4. The ordinance requires the golf carts to meet the equipment requirements in subsection (6). However, the ordinance may require additional equipment, including horns or other warning devices required by s. 316.271; and 5. The local governmental entity posts appropriate signs or otherwise informs residents that the ordinance exists and applies to such sidewalks. (9) A violation of this section is a noncriminal traffic infraction, punishable pursuant to chapter 318 as a moving violation for infractions of subsections (1)-(5) or a local ordinance corresponding thereto and enacted pursuant to subsection (8), or punishable pursuant to chapter 318 as a nonmoving violation for infractions of subsection (6), subsection (7), or a local ordinance corresponding thereto and enacted pursuant to subsection (8).

(1) SERVICE BRAKES; ADEQUACY.—Every such vehicle and combination of vehicles, except special mobile equipment not designed to carry persons, shall be equipped with service brakes adequate to control the movement of and to stop and hold such vehicle under all conditions of loading, and on any grade incident to its operation. (2) PARKING BRAKES; ADEQUACY.—Every such vehicle and combination of vehicles shall be equipped with parking brakes adequate to hold the vehicle on any grade on which it is operated, under all conditions of loading, on a surface free of loose material. The parking brakes shall be capable of being applied in conformance with the foregoing requirements by the driver’s muscular effort or by spring action or by equivalent means. Their operation may be assisted by the service brakes or other source of power provided that failure of the service brake actuation system or other power assisting mechanism will not prevent the parking brakes from being applied in conformance with the foregoing requirements. The parking brakes shall be so designed that when once applied they shall remain applied with the required effectiveness despite exhaustion of any source of energy or leakage of any kind. The same brakedrums, brakeshoes and lining assemblies, brakeshoe anchors, and mechanical brakeshoe actuation mechanism normally associated with the wheel-brake assemblies may be used for both the service brakes and the parking brakes. If the means of applying the parking brakes and the service brakes are connected in any way, they shall be so constructed that failure of any one part shall not leave the vehicle without operative brakes. (3) BRAKES ON ALL WHEELS.—Every vehicle shall be equipped with brakes acting on all wheels except: (a) Trailers, semitrailers, or pole trailers of a gross weight not exceeding 3,000 pounds, provided that: 1. The total weight on and including the wheels of the trailer or trailers shall not exceed 40 percent of the gross weight of the towing vehicle when connected to the trailer or trailers; and 2. The combination of vehicles, consisting of the towing vehicle and its total towed load, is capable of complying with the performance requirements of s. 316.262. (b) Pole trailers with a gross weight in excess of 3,000 pounds manufactured prior to January 1, 1972, need not be equipped with brakes. (c) Any vehicle being towed in driveaway or towaway operations, provided the combination of vehicles is capable of complying with the performance requirements of s. 316.262. (d) Trucks and truck tractors having three or more axles need not have brakes on the front wheels, except that when such vehicles are equipped with at least two steerable axles, the wheels of one steerable axle need not have brakes. However, such trucks and truck tractors must be capable of complying with the performance requirements of s. 316.262. (e) Special mobile equipment not designed to carry persons. (f) “Antique cars” as defined in s. 320.08, and “horseless carriages” as defined in s. 320.086. (g) Four-wheeled motorized golf carts operated by municipal or county law enforcement officers on official business. (4) AUTOMATIC TRAILER BRAKE APPLICATION UPON BREAKAWAY.—Every trailer, semitrailer, and pole trailer with air or vacuum-actuated brakes, every trailer and semitrailer with a gross weight in excess of 3,000 pounds, and every pole trailer with a gross weight in excess of 3,000 pounds manufactured or assembled after January 1, 1972, shall be equipped with brakes acting on all wheels and of such character as to be applied automatically and promptly, and remain applied for at least 15 minutes, upon breakaway from the towing vehicle. (5) TRACTOR BRAKES PROTECTED.—Every motor vehicle manufactured or assembled after January 1, 1972, and used to tow a trailer, semitrailer, or pole trailer equipped with brakes, shall be equipped with means for providing that in case of breakaway of the towed vehicle, the towing vehicle will be capable of being stopped by the use of its service brakes. (6) TRAILER AIR RESERVOIRS SAFEGUARDED.—Air brake systems installed on trailers manufactured or assembled after January 1, 1972, shall be so designed that the supply reservoir used to provide air for the brakes shall be safeguarded against backflow of air from the reservoir through the supply line. (7) TWO MEANS OF EMERGENCY BRAKE OPERATION.— (a) Every towing vehicle, when used to tow another vehicle equipped with air-controlled brakes, in other than driveaway or towaway operations, shall be equipped with two means for emergency application of the trailer brakes. One of these means shall apply the brakes automatically in the event of a reduction of the towing vehicle air supply to a fixed pressure which shall not be lower than 20 pounds per square inch nor higher than 45 pounds per square inch. The other means shall be a manually controlled device for applying and releasing the brakes, readily operable by a person seated in the driving seat, and its emergency position or method of operation shall be clearly indicated. In no instance may the manual means be so arranged as to permit its use to prevent operation of the automatic means. The automatic and the manual means required by this section may be, but are not required to be, separate. (b) Every towing vehicle used to tow other vehicles equipped with vacuum brakes, in operations other than driveaway or towaway operations, shall have, in addition to the single-control device required by subsection (8), a second-control device which can be used to operate the brakes on towed vehicles in emergencies. The second control shall be independent of brake air, hydraulic, and other pressure, and independent of other controls, unless the braking system is so arranged that failure of the pressure upon which the second control depends will cause the towed vehicle brakes to be applied automatically. The second control is not required to provide modulated braking. (8) SINGLE CONTROL TO OPERATE ALL BRAKES.—Every motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer and pole trailer, and every combination of such vehicles, equipped with brakes shall have the braking system so arranged that one control device can be used to operate all service brakes. This requirement does not prohibit vehicles from being equipped with an additional control device to be used to operate brakes on the towed vehicles. This regulation does not apply to driveaway or towaway operations unless the brakes on the individual vehicles are designed to be operated by a single control on the towing vehicle. (9) RESERVOIR CAPACITY AND CHECK VALVE.— (a) Air brakes.—Every bus, truck or truck tractor with air-operated brakes shall be equipped with at least one reservoir sufficient to ensure that, when fully charged to the maximum pressure as regulated by the air compressor governor cutout setting, a full service-brake application may be made without lowering such reservoir pressure by more than 20 percent. Each reservoir shall be provided with means for readily draining accumulated oil or water. (b) Vacuum brakes.—Every truck with three or more axles equipped with vacuum assistor-type brakes and every truck tractor and truck used for towing a vehicle equipped with vacuum brakes shall be equipped with a reserve capacity or a vacuum reservoir sufficient to ensure that, with the reserve capacity or reservoir fully charged and with the engine stopped, a full service-brake application may be made without depleting the vacuum supply by more than 40 percent. (c) Reservoir safeguarded.—All motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, and pole trailers, when equipped with air or vacuum reservoirs or reserve capacity as required by this section, shall have such reservoirs or reserve capacity so safeguarded by a check valve or equivalent device that in the event of failure or leakage in its connection to the source of compressed air or vacuum, the stored air or vacuum shall not be depleted by the leak or failure. (10) WARNING DEVICES.— (a) Air brakes.—Every bus, truck or truck tractor using compressed air for the operation of its own brakes or the brakes on any towed vehicle shall be provided with a warning signal, other than a pressure gauge, readily audible or visible to the driver, which will operate at any time the air reservoir pressure of the vehicle is below 50 percent of the air compressor governor cutout pressure. In addition, each such vehicle shall be equipped with a pressure gauge visible to the driver, which indicates in pounds per square inch the pressure available for braking. (b) Vacuum brakes.—Every truck tractor and truck used for towing a vehicle equipped with vacuum operated brakes and every truck with three or more axles using vacuum in the operation of its brakes, except those in driveaway or towaway operations, shall be equipped with a warning signal, other than a gauge indicating vacuum, readily audible or visible to the driver, which will operate at any time the vacuum in the vehicle’s supply reservoir or reserve capacity is less than 8 inches of mercury. (c) Combination of warning devices.—When a vehicle required to be equipped with a warning device is equipped with both air and vacuum power for the operation of its own brakes or the brakes on a towed vehicle, the warning devices may be, but are not required to be, combined into a single device which will serve both purposes. A gauge or gauges indicating pressure or vacuum shall not be deemed to be an adequate means of satisfying this requirement. (11) VIOLATIONS.—A violation of this section is a noncriminal traffic infraction, punishable as a nonmoving violation as provided in chapter 318.

      "text": "316.3026 Unlawful operation of motor carriers.— (1) The Office of Commercial Vehicle Enforcement may issue out-of-service orders to motor carriers, as defined in s. 320.01, who, after proper notice, have failed to pay any penalty or fine assessed by the department, or its agent, against any owner or motor carrier for violations of state law, refused to submit to a compliance review and provide records pursuant to s. 316.302(6) or s. 316.70, or violated safety regulations pursuant to s. 316.302 or insurance requirements in s. 627.7415. Such out-of-service orders have the effect of prohibiting the operations of any motor vehicles owned, leased, or otherwise operated by the motor carrier upon the roadways of this state, until the violations have been corrected or penalties have been paid. Out-of-service orders must be approved by the director of the Division of the Florida Highway Patrol or his or her designee. An administrative hearing pursuant to s. 120.569 shall be afforded to motor carriers subject to such orders. (2) Any motor carrier enjoined or prohibited from operating by an out-of-service order by this state, any other state, or the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration may not operate on the roadways of this state until the motor carrier has been authorized to resume operations by the originating enforcement jurisdiction. Commercial motor vehicles owned or operated by any motor carrier prohibited from operation found on the roadways of this state shall be placed out of service by law enforcement officers of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, and the motor carrier assessed a $10,000 civil penalty pursuant to 49 C.F.R. s. 383.53, in addition to any other penalties imposed on the driver or other responsible person. Any person who knowingly drives, operates, or causes to be operated any commercial motor vehicle in violation of an out-of-service order issued by the department in accordance with this section commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082(3)(e). Any costs associated with the impoundment or storage of such vehicles are the responsibility of the motor carrier. Vehicle out-of-service orders may be rescinded when the department receives proof of authorization for the motor carrier to resume operation.

As used in this section, the term “wireless communications device” means any handheld device used or capable of being used in a handheld manner, that is designed or intended to receive or transmit text or character-based messages, access or store data, or connect to the Internet or any communications service as defined in s. 812.15 and that allows text communications. For the purposes of this paragraph, a motor vehicle that is stationary is not being operated and is not subject to the prohibition in this paragraph. (b) Paragraph (a) does not apply to a motor vehicle operator who is: 1. Performing official duties as an operator of an authorized emergency vehicle as defined in s. 322.01, a law enforcement or fire service professional, or an emergency medical services professional. 2.

Access the wireless communications device without a warrant. 2. Confiscate the wireless communications device while awaiting issuance of a warrant to access such device. 3. Obtain consent from the motor vehicle operator to search his or her wireless communications device through coercion or other improper method. Consent to search a motor vehicle operator’s wireless communications device must be voluntary and unequivocal. (d) Only in the event of a crash resulting in death or personal injury, a user’s billing records for a wireless communications device or the testimony of or written statements from appropriate authorities receiving such messages may be admissible as evidence in any proceeding to determine whether a violation of paragraph (a) has been committed. (4)(a) Any person who violates paragraph (3)(a) commits a noncriminal traffic infraction, punishable as a nonmoving violation as provided in chapter 318. (b) Any person who commits a second or subsequent violation of paragraph (3)(a) within 5 years after the date of a prior conviction for a violation of paragraph (3)(a) commits a noncriminal traffic infraction, punishable as a moving violation as provided in chapter 318.

The use of public roads that do not have at least one through lane of 12 feet or more in width in each direction, and the use of public roads deemed unsafe for wider vehicles on the basis of safety and engineering analyses, by vehicles exceeding 96 inches in width may be restricted by the Department of Transportation or by local officials for streets and roads under their respective jurisdictions. The total outside width of a noncommercial travel trailer, camping trailer, truck camper, motor home, or private motor coach as defined in s. 320.01 may be more than 102 inches if: (a) The excess width is attributable to appurtenances that do not extend beyond the exterior rearview mirrors installed on the motor home by the manufacturer or the exterior rearview mirrors of the tow vehicle; and (b) The exterior rearview mirrors only extend the distance necessary to provide the appropriate field of view for the vehicle before the appurtenances are attached. (2) HEIGHT LIMITATION.—No vehicle may exceed a height of 13 feet 6 inches, inclusive of load carried thereon. However, an automobile transporter may measure a height not to exceed 14 feet, inclusive of the load carried thereon. (3) LENGTH LIMITATION.—Except as otherwise provided in this section, length limitations apply solely to a semitrailer or trailer, and not to a truck tractor or to the overall length of a combination of vehicles. No combination of commercial motor vehicles coupled together and operating on the public roads may consist of more than one truck tractor and two trailing units. Unless otherwise specifically provided for in this section, a combination of vehicles not qualifying as commercial motor vehicles may consist of no more than two units coupled together; such nonqualifying combination of vehicles may not exceed a total length of 65 feet, inclusive of the load carried thereon, but exclusive of safety and energy conservation devices approved by the department for use on vehicles using public roads. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a truck tractor-semitrailer combination engaged in the transportation of automobiles or boats may transport motor vehicles or boats on part of the power unit; and, except as may otherwise be mandated under federal law, an automobile or boat transporter semitrailer may not exceed 50 feet in length, exclusive of the load; however, the load may extend up to an additional 6 feet beyond the rear of the trailer. The 50-feet length limitation does not apply to non-stinger-steered automobile or boat transporters that are 65 feet or less in overall length, exclusive of the load carried thereon, to stinger-steered boat transporters that are 75 feet or less in overall length, exclusive of the load carried thereon, or to stinger-steered automobile transporters that are 80 feet or less in overall length, exclusive of the load carried thereon. For purposes of this subsection, a “stinger-steered automobile or boat transporter” is an automobile or boat transporter configured as a semitrailer combination wherein the fifth wheel is located on a drop frame located behind and below the rearmost axle of the power unit. Automobile transporters operating under this subsection may backhaul cargo or general freight if the weight of such cargo or freight does not exceed the limits imposed under s. 316.535. Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b), any straight truck or truck tractor-semitrailer combination engaged in the transportation of horticultural trees may allow the load to extend up to an additional 10 feet beyond the rear of the vehicle, provided the trees are resting against a retaining bar mounted above the truck bed so that the root balls of the trees rest on the floor and to the front of the truck bed and the tops of the trees extend up over and to the rear of the truck bed, and provided the overhanging portion of the load is covered with protective fabric. (a) Straight trucks.—A straight truck may not exceed a length of 40 feet in extreme overall dimension, exclusive of safety and energy conservation devices approved by the department for use on vehicles using public roads. A straight truck may attach a forklift to the rear of the cargo bed, provided the overall combined length of the vehicle and the forklift does not exceed 50 feet. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a straight truck may tow no more than one trailer, and the overall length of the truck-trailer combination may not exceed 68 feet, including the load thereon. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, a truck-trailer combination engaged in the transportation of boats, or boat trailers whose design dictates a front-to-rear stacking method may not exceed the length limitations of this paragraph exclusive of the load; however, the load may extend up to an additional 6 feet beyond the rear of the trailer. (b) Semitrailers.— 1. A semitrailer operating in a truck tractor-semitrailer combination may not exceed 48 feet in extreme overall outside dimension, measured from the front of the unit to the rear of the unit and the load carried thereon, exclusive of safety and energy conservation devices approved by the department for use on vehicles using public roads, unless it complies with subparagraph 2. A semitrailer which exceeds 48 feet in length and is used to transport divisible loads may operate in this state only if issued a permit under s. 316.550 and if such trailer meets the requirements of this chapter relating to vehicle equipment and safety. Except for highways on the tandem trailer truck highway network, public roads deemed unsafe for longer semitrailer vehicles or those roads on which such longer vehicles are determined not to be in the interest of public convenience shall, in conformance with s. 316.006, be restricted by the Department of Transportation or by the local authority to use by semitrailers not exceeding a length of 48 feet, inclusive of the load carried thereon but exclusive of safety and energy conservation devices approved by the department for use on vehicles using public roads. Truck tractor-semitrailer combinations shall be afforded reasonable access to terminals; facilities for food, fuel, repairs, and rest; and points of loading and unloading. 2. A semitrailer which is more than 48 feet but not more than 57 feet in extreme overall outside dimension, as measured pursuant to subparagraph 1., may operate on public roads, except roads on the State Highway System which are restricted by the Department of Transportation or other roads restricted by local authorities, if: a. The distance between the kingpin or other peg that locks into the fifth wheel of a truck tractor and the center of the rear axle or rear group of axles does not exceed 41 feet, or, in the case of a semitrailer used exclusively or primarily to transport vehicles in connection with motorsports competition events, the distance does not exceed 46 feet from the kingpin to the center of the rear axles; and b. It is equipped with a substantial rear-end underride protection device meeting the requirements of 49 C.F.R. s. 393.86, “Rear End Protection.” (c) Tandem trailer trucks.— 1. Except for semitrailers and trailers of up to 28 1/2 feet in length which existed on December 1, 1982, and which were actually and lawfully operating on that date, no semitrailer or trailer operating in a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer combination may exceed a length of 28 feet in extreme overall outside dimension, measured from the front of the unit to the rear of the unit and the load carried thereon, exclusive of safety and energy conservation devices approved by the Department of Transportation for use on vehicles using public roads. 2. Tandem trailer trucks conforming to the weight and size limitations of this chapter and in immediate transit to or from a terminal facility as defined in this chapter may operate on the public roads of this state except for residential neighborhood streets restricted by the Department of Transportation or local jurisdictions. In addition, the Department of Transportation or local jurisdictions may restrict these vehicles from using streets and roads under their maintenance responsibility on the basis of safety and engineering analyses, provided that the restrictions are consistent with this chapter. The Department of Transportation shall develop safety and engineering standards to be used by all jurisdictions when identifying public roads and streets to be restricted from tandem trailer truck operations. 3. Except as otherwise provided in this section, within 5 miles of the Federal National Network for large trucks, tandem trailer trucks shall be afforded access to terminals; facilities for food, fuel, repairs, and rest; and points of loading and unloading. 4. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, all local system tandem trailer truck route review procedures must be consistent with those adopted by the Department of Transportation. 5. Tandem trailer trucks employed as household goods carriers and conforming to the weight and size limitations of this chapter shall be afforded access to points of loading and unloading on the public streets and roads of this state, except for streets and roads that have been restricted from use by such vehicles on the basis of safety and engineering analyses by the jurisdiction responsible for maintenance of the streets and roads. (d) Maxi-cube vehicles.—Maxi-cube vehicles shall be allowed to operate on routes open to tandem trailer trucks under the same conditions applicable to tandem trailer trucks as specified by this section. (4) LOAD EXTENSION LIMITATION.—The load upon any vehicle operated alone, or the load upon the front vehicle of a combination of vehicles, may not extend more than 3 feet beyond the front wheels of the vehicle or the front bumper of the vehicle if it is equipped with a bumper. However, the load upon any stinger-steered automobile transporter may not extend more than 4 feet beyond the front bumper of the vehicle. (a) The limitations of this subsection do not apply to bicycle racks carrying bicycles on public sector transit vehicles. (b) This subsection does not apply to a front-end loading collection vehicle, when: 1. The front-end loading mechanism and container or containers are in the lowered position; 2.

(2) The Department of Transportation, with respect to highways under its jurisdiction, or a local authority, with respect to highways under its jurisdiction, may, in its discretion and upon application and good cause shown therefor that the same is not contrary to the public interest, issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight exceeding the maximum specified in this chapter, or otherwise not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, upon any highway under the jurisdiction of the authority issuing such permit and for the maintenance of which the authority is responsible. The permit shall describe the vehicle or vehicles and load to be operated or moved and the highways for which the permit is requested. The Department of Transportation or local authority is authorized to issue or withhold such permit at its discretion or, if such permit is issued, to limit or prescribe the conditions of operation of such vehicle or vehicles; and the department or local authority may require such undertaking or other security as may be deemed necessary to compensate for any damage to any roadway or road structure. (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), the Department of Transportation may issue a mobile crane special blanket permit for any of the following purposes: (a) To authorize a mobile crane to operate on and off the Interstate Highway System while towing a motor vehicle that does not weigh more than 5,000 pounds if the combined weight of the crane and such motor vehicle does not exceed 95,000 pounds. Notwithstanding s. 320.01(7) or (12), mobile cranes that tow another motor vehicle under this subsection shall be taxed under s. 320.08(5)(b). (b) To authorize a mobile crane and accessory support vehicles that are up to 12 feet in width, 14 feet 6 inches in height, and 100 feet in length to operate on and off the Interstate Highway System at all hours except as restricted under a local travel-related curfew. (c) To authorize a mobile crane and accessory support vehicles that, due to their design for special use, exceed the weight limits established in s. 316.535 to operate on and off the Interstate Highway System. (4)(a) The Department of Transportation or local authority may issue permits that authorize commercial vehicles having weights not exceeding the limits of s. 316.535(5), plus the scale tolerance provided in s. 316.545(2), to operate off the interstate highway system on a designated route specified in the permit. Such permits shall be issued within 14 days after receipt of the request. (b) The designated route shall avoid any bridge which the department determines cannot safely accommodate vehicles with a gross vehicle weight authorized in paragraph (a). (c) Any vehicle or combination of vehicles which exceeds the weight limits authorized in paragraph (a) shall be unloaded, and all material so unloaded shall be cared for by the owner or operator. (5)(a) The Department of Transportation may issue a wrecker special blanket permit to authorize a wrecker as defined in s. 320.01 to tow a disabled motor vehicle as defined in s. 320.01 where the combination of the wrecker and the disabled vehicle being towed exceeds the maximum weight limits as established by s. 316.535. (b) The Department of Transportation must supply the permitted wrecker with a map showing the routes on which the wrecker may safely tow disabled vehicles for all special permit classifications for which the wrecker applies. (6) The Department of Transportation or such local authority is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations concerning the issuance of such permits and to charge a fee for the issuance thereof, which rules, regulations, and fees shall have the force and effect of law. The minimum fee for issuing any such permit shall be $5. The Department of Transportation may issue blanket permits for not more than 36 months. The department may charge an annualized fee for blanket permits not to exceed $500. (7) Every special permit shall be carried in the vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting such permit. No person shall violate any of the terms or conditions of such special permit. (8) The Department of Transportation may impose fines for the operation of a vehicle in violation of this section, as provided in subsection (10). (9) The Department of Transportation may not refuse to issue a permit under this section to any person solely on the basis that such person allegedly violated this chapter or the rules promulgated hereunder until a final order is entered with regard to such violation pursuant to chapter 120. (10) Whenever any motor vehicle, or the combination of a wrecker as defined in s. 320.01 and a towed motor vehicle, exceeds any weight or dimensional criteria or special operational or safety stipulation contained in a special permit issued under the provisions of this section, the penalty assessed to the owner or operator shall be as follows: (a) For violation of weight criteria contained in a special permit, the penalty per pound or portion thereof exceeding the permitted weight shall be as provided in s. 316.545. (b) For each violation of dimensional criteria in a special permit, the penalty shall be as provided in s. 316.516 and penalties for multiple violations of dimensional criteria shall be cumulative except that the total penalty for the vehicle shall not exceed $1,000. (c) For each violation of an operational or safety stipulation in a special permit, the penalty shall be an amount not to exceed $1,000 per violation and penalties for multiple violations of operational or safety stipulations shall be cumulative except that the total penalty for the vehicle shall not exceed $1,000. (d) For violation of any special condition that has been prescribed in the rules of the Department of Transportation and declared on the permit, the vehicle shall be determined to be out of conformance with the permit and the permit shall be declared null and void for the vehicle, and weight and dimensional limits for the vehicle shall be as established in s. 316.515 or s. 316.535, whichever is applicable, and: 1. For weight violations, a penalty as provided in s. 316.545 shall be assessed for those weights which exceed the limits thus established for the vehicle; and 2. For dimensional, operational, or safety violations, a penalty as established in paragraph (c) or s. 316.516, whichever is applicable, shall be assessed for each nonconforming dimensional, operational, or safety violation and the penalties for multiple violations shall be cumulative for the vehicle. (11) All penalties imposed by violations of this section shall be assessed, collected, and deposited in accordance with the provisions of s. 316.545(6).

For children aged through 3 years, such restraint device must be a separate carrier or a vehicle manufacturer’s integrated child seat. 2. For children aged 4 through 5 years, a separate carrier, an integrated child seat, or a child booster seat may be used. However, the requirement to use a child restraint device under this subparagraph does not apply when a safety belt is used as required in s. 316.614(4)(a) and the child: a. Is being transported gratuitously by an operator who is not a member of the child’s immediate family; b. Is being transported in a medical emergency situation involving the child; or c. Has a medical condition that necessitates an exception as evidenced by appropriate documentation from a health care professional. (b) The department shall provide notice of the requirement for child restraint devices, which notice shall accompany the delivery of each motor vehicle license tag. (2) As used in this section, the term “motor vehicle” means a motor vehicle as defined in s. 316.003 that is operated on the roadways, streets, and highways of the state. The term does not include: (a) A school bus as defined in s. 316.003. (b) A bus used for the transportation of persons for compensation, other than a bus regularly used to transport children to or from school, as defined in s. 316.615(1)(b), or in conjunction with school activities. (c) A farm tractor or implement of husbandry. (d) A truck having a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 26,000 pounds. (e) A motorcycle, a moped, a bicycle, or an electric bicycle. (3) The failure to provide and use a child passenger restraint shall not be considered comparative negligence, nor shall such failure be admissible as evidence in the trial of any civil action with regard to negligence. (4) It is the legislative intent that all state, county, and local law enforcement agencies, and safety councils, in recognition of the problems with child death and injury from unrestrained occupancy in motor vehicles, conduct a continuing safety and public awareness campaign as to the magnitude of the problem. (5) Any person who violates this section commits a moving violation, punishable as provided in chapter 318 and shall have 3 points assessed against his or her driver license as set forth in s. 322.27. In lieu of the penalty specified in s. 318.18 and the assessment of points, a person who violates this section may elect, with the court’s approval, to participate in a child restraint safety program approved by the chief judge of the circuit in which the violation occurs, and, upon completing such program, the penalty specified in chapter 318 and associated costs may be waived at the court’s discretion and the assessment of points shall be waived. The child restraint safety program must use a course approved by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, and the fee for the course must bear a reasonable relationship to the cost of providing the course. (6) The child restraint requirements imposed by this section do not apply to a chauffeur-driven taxi, limousine, sedan, van, bus, motor coach, or other passenger vehicle if the operator and the motor vehicle are hired and used for the transportation of persons for compensation.

(3) As used in this section: (a) “Motor vehicle” means a motor vehicle as defined in s. 316.003 which is operated on the roadways, streets, and highways of this state or when stationary at a traffic control device. The term does not include: 1. A school bus. 2. A bus used for the transportation of persons for compensation. 3. A farm tractor or implement of husbandry. 4.

(c) “Restrained by a safety belt” means being restricted by an appropriately adjusted safety belt which is properly fastened at all times when a motor vehicle is in motion. (4) It is unlawful for any person: (a) To operate a motor vehicle or an autocycle in this state unless each passenger and the operator of the vehicle or autocycle under the age of 18 years are restrained by a safety belt or by a child restraint device pursuant to s. 316.613, if applicable; or (b) To operate a motor vehicle or an autocycle in this state unless the person is restrained by a safety belt. (5) It is unlawful for any person 18 years of age or older to be a passenger in the front seat of a motor vehicle or an autocycle unless such person is restrained by a safety belt when the vehicle or autocycle is in motion. (6)(a) Neither a person who is certified by a physician as having a medical condition that causes the use of a safety belt to be inappropriate or dangerous nor an employee of a newspaper home delivery service while in the course of his or her employment delivering newspapers on home delivery routes is required to be restrained by a safety belt. (b) An employee of a solid waste or recyclable collection service is not required to be restrained by a safety belt while in the course of employment collecting solid waste or recyclables on designated routes.

(7) It is the intent of the Legislature that all state, county, and local law enforcement agencies, safety councils, and public school systems, in recognition of the fatalities and injuries attributed to unrestrained occupancy of motor vehicles, shall conduct a continuing safety and public awareness campaign as to the magnitude of the problem and adopt programs designed to encourage compliance with the safety belt usage requirements of this section. (8) Any person who violates the provisions of this section commits a nonmoving violation, punishable as provided in chapter 318. (9) Each law enforcement agency in this state shall adopt departmental policies to prohibit the practice of racial profiling. When a law enforcement officer issues a citation for a violation of this section, the law enforcement officer must record the race and ethnicity of the violator. All law enforcement agencies must maintain such information and forward the information to the department in a form and manner determined by the department. The department shall collect this information by jurisdiction and annually report the data to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The report must show separate statewide totals for the state’s county sheriffs and municipal law enforcement agencies, state law enforcement agencies, and state university law enforcement agencies. (10) A violation of the provisions of this section shall not constitute negligence per se, nor shall such violation be used as prima facie evidence of negligence or be considered in mitigation of damages, but such violation may be considered as evidence of comparative negligence, in any civil action.

The form shall also include a box that is to be checked by the law enforcement officer when the officer writes a uniform traffic citation for a violation of s. 316.074(1) or s. 316.075(1)(c)1. as a result of the driver failing to stop at a traffic signal. (b) The department shall prepare, and supply to every traffic enforcement agency in the state, an appropriate affidavit-of-compliance form that shall be issued along with the form traffic citation for any violation of s. 316.610 and that indicates the specific defect needing to be corrected. However, such affidavit of compliance may not be issued in the case of a violation of s. 316.610 by a commercial motor vehicle. Such affidavit-of-compliance form shall be distributed in the same manner and to the same parties as is the form traffic citation. (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b), a traffic enforcement agency may produce uniform traffic citations by electronic means. Such citations must be consistent with the state traffic court rules and the procedures established by the department and must be appropriately numbered and inventoried. Affidavit-of-compliance forms may also be produced by electronic means. (d) The department must distribute to every traffic enforcement agency and to any others who request it, a traffic infraction reference guide describing the class of the traffic infraction, the penalty for the infraction, the points to be assessed on a driver’s record, and any other information necessary to describe a violation and the penalties therefor. (2) Courts, enforcement agencies, and the department are jointly responsible to account for all uniform traffic citations in accordance with rules and procedures promulgated by the department. (3)(a) Except for a traffic citation issued pursuant to s. 316.1001, s. 316.0083, s. 316.173, or s. 316.1896, each traffic enforcement officer, upon issuing a traffic citation to an alleged violator of any provision of the motor vehicle laws of this state or of any traffic ordinance of any municipality or town, shall deposit the original traffic citation or, in the case of a traffic enforcement agency that has an automated citation issuance system, the agency shall provide by an electronic transmission a replica of the citation data to the court having jurisdiction over the alleged offense or with its traffic violations bureau within 5 business days after issuance to the violator. (b) If a traffic citation is issued pursuant to s. 316.1001, a traffic enforcement officer may deposit the original traffic citation or, in the case of a traffic enforcement agency that has an automated citation system, may provide by an electronic transmission a replica of the citation data to a court having jurisdiction over the alleged offense or with its traffic violations bureau within 45 days after the date of issuance of the citation to the violator. If the person cited for the violation of s. 316.1001 makes the election provided by s. 318.14(12) and pays the $25 fine, or such other amount as imposed by the governmental entity owning the applicable toll facility, plus the amount of the unpaid toll that is shown on the traffic citation directly to the governmental entity that issued the citation, or on whose behalf the citation was issued, in accordance with s. 318.14(12), the traffic citation will not be submitted to the court, the disposition will be reported to the department by the governmental entity that issued the citation, or on whose behalf the citation was issued, and no points will be assessed against the person’s driver license. (c) If a traffic citation is issued under s. 316.0083 or s. 316.1896, the traffic infraction enforcement officer shall provide by electronic transmission a replica of the traffic citation data to the court having jurisdiction over the alleged offense or its traffic violations bureau within 5 business days after the date of issuance of the traffic citation to the violator. If a hearing is requested, the traffic infraction enforcement officer shall provide a replica of the traffic notice of violation data to the clerk for the local hearing officer having jurisdiction over the alleged offense within 14 days. (4) The chief administrative officer of every traffic enforcement agency shall require the return to him or her of the officer-agency copy of every traffic citation issued by an officer under the chief administrative officer’s supervision to an alleged violator of any traffic law or ordinance and all copies of every traffic citation that has been spoiled or upon which any entry has been made and not issued to an alleged violator. In the case of a traffic enforcement agency that has an automated citation issuance system, the chief administrative officer shall require the return of all electronic traffic citation records. (5) Upon the deposit of the original traffic citation or upon an electronic transmission of a replica of citation data of the traffic citation with respect to traffic enforcement agencies that have an automated citation issuance system with a court having jurisdiction over the alleged offense or with its traffic violations bureau, the original citation, the electronic citation containing a replica of citation data, or a copy of such traffic citation may be disposed of only by trial in the court or other official action by a judge of the court, including forfeiture of the bail, or by the deposit of sufficient bail with, or payment of a fine to, the traffic violations bureau by the person to whom such traffic citation has been issued by the traffic enforcement officer. (6) The chief administrative officer shall transmit, on a form approved by the department, within 5 days after submission of the original, groups of issued citations and transmittal data to the court. Batches of electronic citations containing a replica of citation data may be transmitted to the court in an electronic fashion, in a format prescribed by the department within 5 days after issuance to the violator. (7) The chief administrative officer shall also maintain or cause to be maintained in connection with every traffic citation issued by an officer under his or her supervision a record of the disposition of the charge by the court or its traffic violations bureau in which the original or copy of the traffic citation or electronic citation was deposited. (8) It is unlawful and official misconduct for any traffic enforcement officer or other officer or public employee to dispose of a traffic citation or copies thereof or of the record of the issuance of the same in a manner other than as required herein. (9) Such citations shall not be admissible evidence in any trial, except when used as evidence of falsification, forgery, uttering, fraud, or perjury, or when used as physical evidence resulting from a forensic examination of the citation. (10) If a uniform traffic citation has not been issued with respect to a criminal traffic offense, or with respect to an offense that requires mandatory revocation of the driver license or driving privilege pursuant to s. 322.26 upon conviction of such offense, and the prosecution is by affidavit, information, or indictment, the prosecutor shall direct the arresting officer to prepare a citation. In the absence of an arresting officer, the prosecutor shall prepare the citation. For the purpose of this subsection, the term “arresting officer” means the law enforcement officer who apprehended or took into custody the alleged offender. (11)(a) As used in this subsection, the term “driver information” means a driver’s date of birth, driver license or identification card number, address excluding the five-digit zip code, telephone number, motor vehicle license plate number, and trailer tag number. The term does not include the driver’s name. (b)1. Driver information contained in a uniform traffic citation held by an agency is exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. This paragraph applies to driver information held by an agency before, on, or after the effective date of the exemption. 2. An agency may release driver information in accordance with any of the permissible uses listed in 18 U.S.C. s. 2721(b) in the same manner applicable to the release of personal information contained in a motor vehicle record pursuant to s. 119.0712(2)(b) and pursuant to the resale and redisclosure requirements in 18 U.S.C. s. 2721(c). 3. This paragraph is subject to the Open Government Sunset Review Act in accordance with s. 119.15 and shall stand repealed on October 2, 2027, unless reviewed and saved from repeal through reenactment by the Legislature. (c) Driver information contained in a uniform traffic citation, including the accused person’s name and address, shall not be used for commercial solicitation purposes. However, the use of such driver information contained in a uniform traffic citation shall not be considered a commercial purpose when used for publication in a newspaper or other news periodical, when used for broadcast by radio or television, or when used to inform a person of the availability of driver safety training.

(2) A driver convicted of a violation of any offense prohibited by this chapter or any other law of this state regulating motor vehicles, which resulted in an accident, may have his or her driving privileges revoked or suspended by the court if the court finds such revocation or suspension warranted by the totality of the circumstances resulting in the conviction and the need to provide for the maximum safety for all persons who travel on or who are otherwise affected by the use of the highways of the state. In determining whether suspension or revocation is appropriate, the court shall consider all pertinent factors, including, but not limited to, such factors as the extent and nature of the driver’s violation of this chapter, the number of persons killed or injured as the result of the driver’s violation of this chapter, and the extent of any property damage resulting from the driver’s violation of this chapter.
