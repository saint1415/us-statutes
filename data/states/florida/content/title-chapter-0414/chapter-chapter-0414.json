      "text": "414.045 Cash assistance program.—Cash assistance families include any families receiving cash assistance payments from the state program for temporary assistance for needy families as defined in federal law, whether such funds are from federal funds, state funds, or commingled federal and state funds. Cash assistance families may also include families receiving cash assistance through a program defined as a separate state program. (1) For reporting purposes, families receiving cash assistance shall be grouped into the following categories. The department may develop additional groupings in order to comply with federal reporting requirements, to comply with the data-reporting needs of the state board as defined in s. 445.002, or to better inform the public of program progress. (a) Work-eligible cases.—Work-eligible cases shall include: 1. Families containing an adult or a teen head of household, as defined by federal law. These cases are generally subject to the work activity requirements provided in s. 445.024 and the time limitations on benefits provided in s. 414.105. 2. Families with a parent where the parent’s needs have been removed from the case due to sanction or disqualification shall be considered work-eligible cases to the extent that such cases are considered in the calculation of federal participation rates or would be counted in such calculation in future months. 3. Families participating in transition assistance programs. 4. Families otherwise eligible for temporary cash assistance which receive diversion services, a severance payment, or participate in the relocation program. (b) Child-only cases.—Child-only cases include cases that do not have an adult or teen head of household as defined in federal law. Such cases include: 1. Children in the care of caretaker relatives, if the caretaker relatives choose to have their needs excluded in the calculation of the amount of cash assistance. 2. Families in the Relative Caregiver Program as provided in s. 39.5085. 3. Families in which the only parent in a single-parent family or both parents in a two-parent family receive supplemental security income (SSI) benefits under Title XVI of the Social Security Act, as amended. To the extent permitted by federal law, individuals receiving SSI shall be excluded as household members in determining the amount of cash assistance, and such cases shall not be considered families containing an adult. Parents or caretaker relatives who are excluded from the cash assistance group due to receipt of SSI may choose to participate in work activities. An individual whose ability to participate in work activities is limited who volunteers to participate in work activities shall be assigned to work activities consistent with such limitations. An individual who volunteers to participate in a work activity may receive child care or support services consistent with such participation. 4. Families in which the only parent in a single-parent family or both parents in a two-parent family are not eligible for cash assistance due to immigration status or other limitation of federal law. To the extent required by federal law, such cases shall not be considered families containing an adult. 5. To the extent permitted by federal law and subject to appropriations, difficult-to-place children who have been adopted pursuant to s. 409.166 and whose adopting family qualifies as a needy family under the state program for temporary assistance for needy families. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in s. 414.075, s. 414.085, or s. 414.095, a family shall be considered a needy family if: a. The family is determined by the department to have an income below 200 percent of the federal poverty level; b. The family meets the requirements of s. 414.095(2) and (3) related to residence, citizenship, or eligible noncitizen status; and c. The family provides any information that may be necessary to meet federal reporting requirements specified under Part A of Title IV of the Social Security Act. 6. Families in the Guardianship Assistance Program as provided in s. 39.6225. Families described in subparagraph 1., subparagraph 2., or subparagraph 3. may receive child care assistance or other supports or services so that the children may continue to be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives. Such assistance or services may be funded from the temporary assistance for needy families block grant to the extent permitted under federal law and to the extent funds have been provided in the General Appropriations Act. (2) Oversight by the state board as defined in s. 445.002 and the service delivery and financial planning responsibilities of the local workforce development boards apply to the families defined as work-eligible cases in paragraph (1)(a). The department shall be responsible for program administration related to families in groups defined in paragraph (1)(b), and the department shall coordinate such administration with the state board to the extent needed for operation of the program.

      "heading": "Noncompliance with work requirements.",
      "text": "414.065 Noncompliance with work requirements.— (1) PENALTIES FOR NONPARTICIPATION IN WORK REQUIREMENTS AND FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ALTERNATIVE REQUIREMENT PLANS.—The department shall establish procedures for administering penalties for nonparticipation in work requirements and failure to comply with the alternative requirement plan. If an individual in a family receiving temporary cash assistance fails to engage in work activities required in accordance with s. 445.024, the following penalties shall apply. Before the imposition of a sanction, the participant must be notified orally or in writing that the participant is subject to sanction and that action will be taken to impose the sanction unless the participant complies with the work activity requirements. The participant must be counseled as to the consequences of noncompliance and, if appropriate, referred for services that could assist the participant to fully comply with program requirements. If the participant has good cause for noncompliance or demonstrates satisfactory compliance, the sanction may not be imposed. If the requirements of s. 445.024(2)(a)1. are suspended pursuant to s. 445.024(2)(a)2., a participant in noncompliance because of such suspension is considered to have good cause for noncompliance for up to 6 weeks after the change in the participant’s work requirements. If the participant has subsequently obtained employment, the participant must be counseled regarding the transitional benefits that may be available and provided information about how to access such benefits. The department shall administer sanctions related to food assistance consistent with federal regulations. (a)1. First noncompliance: temporary cash assistance is terminated for the family for a minimum of 10 days or until the individual who failed to comply does so. 2. Second noncompliance: temporary cash assistance is terminated for the family for 1 month or until the individual who failed to comply does so, whichever is later. Upon meeting this requirement, temporary cash assistance must be reinstated to the date of compliance or the first day of the month following the penalty period, whichever is later. 3. Third noncompliance: temporary cash assistance is terminated for the family for 3 months or until the individual who failed to comply does so, whichever is later. The individual must comply with the required work activity upon completion of the 3-month penalty period, before reinstatement of temporary cash assistance. Upon meeting this requirement, temporary cash assistance must be reinstated to the date of compliance or the first day of the month following the penalty period, whichever is later. (b) If a participant receiving temporary cash assistance who is otherwise exempted from noncompliance penalties fails to comply with the alternative requirement plan required in accordance with this section, the penalties provided in paragraph (a) apply. If a participant fully complies with work activity requirements for at least 6 months, the participant must be reinstated as being in full compliance with program requirements for purpose of sanctions imposed under this section. (2) CONTINUATION OF TEMPORARY CASH ASSISTANCE FOR CHILDREN; PROTECTIVE PAYEES.— (a) Upon the second or third occurrence of noncompliance, temporary cash assistance and food assistance for the child or children in a family who are under age 16 may be continued. Any such payments must be made through a protective payee or, in the case of food assistance, through an authorized representative. Under no circumstances shall temporary cash assistance or food assistance be paid to an individual who has failed to comply with program requirements. (b) Protective payees shall be designated by the department and may include: 1. A relative or other individual who is interested in or concerned with the welfare of the child or children and agrees in writing to utilize the assistance in the best interest of the child or children. 2. A member of the community affiliated with a religious, community, neighborhood, or charitable organization who agrees in writing to utilize the assistance in the best interest of the child or children. 3. A volunteer or member of an organization who agrees in writing to fulfill the role of protective payee and to utilize the assistance in the best interest of the child or children. (c) The protective payee designated by the department shall be the authorized representative for purposes of receiving food assistance on behalf of a child or children under age 16. The authorized representative must agree in writing to use the food assistance in the best interest of the child or children. (d) If it is in the best interest of the child or children, as determined by the department, for the staff member of a private agency, a public agency, the department, or any other appropriate organization to serve as a protective payee or authorized representative, such designation may be made, except that a protective payee or authorized representative must not be any individual involved in determining eligibility for temporary cash assistance or food assistance for the family, staff handling any fiscal processes related to issuance of temporary cash assistance or food assistance, or landlords, grocers, or vendors of goods, services, or items dealing directly with the participant. (e) The department may pay incidental expenses or travel expenses for costs directly related to performance of the duties of a protective payee as necessary to implement the provisions of this subsection. (3) PROPORTIONAL REDUCTION OF TEMPORARY CASH ASSISTANCE RELATED TO PAY AFTER PERFORMANCE.—Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1), if an individual is receiving temporary cash assistance under a pay-after-performance arrangement and the individual participates, but fails to meet the full participation requirement, then the temporary cash assistance received shall be reduced and shall be proportional to the actual participation. Food assistance may be included in a pay-after-performance arrangement if permitted under federal law. (4) EXCEPTIONS TO NONCOMPLIANCE PENALTIES.—Unless otherwise provided, the situations listed in this subsection shall constitute exceptions to the penalties for noncompliance with participation requirements, except that these situations do not constitute exceptions to the applicable time limit for receipt of temporary cash assistance: (a) Noncompliance related to child care.—Temporary cash assistance may not be terminated for refusal to participate in work activities if the individual is a single parent caring for a child who has not attained 6 years of age, and the adult proves to the local workforce development board an inability to obtain needed child care for one or more of the following reasons, as defined in the Child Care and Development Fund State Plan required by 45 C.F.R. part 98: 1. Unavailability of appropriate child care within a reasonable distance from the individual’s home or worksite. 2. Unavailability or unsuitability of informal child care by a relative or under other arrangements. 3. Unavailability of appropriate and affordable formal child care arrangements. (b) Noncompliance related to domestic violence.—An individual who is determined to be unable to comply with the work requirements because such compliance would make it probable that the individual would be unable to escape domestic violence shall be exempt from work requirements. However, the individual shall comply with a plan that specifies alternative requirements that prepare the individual for self-sufficiency while providing for the safety of the individual and the individual’s dependents. A participant who is determined to be out of compliance with the alternative requirement plan shall be subject to the penalties under subsection (1). An exception granted under this paragraph does not automatically constitute an exception to the time limitations on benefits specified under s. 414.105. (c) Noncompliance related to treatment or remediation of past effects of domestic violence.—An individual who is determined to be unable to comply with the work requirements under this section due to mental or physical impairment related to past incidents of domestic violence may be exempt from work requirements, except that such individual shall comply with a plan that specifies alternative requirements that prepare the individual for self-sufficiency while providing for the safety of the individual and the individual’s dependents. A participant who is determined to be out of compliance with the alternative requirement plan shall be subject to the penalties under subsection (1). The plan must include counseling or a course of treatment necessary for the individual to resume participation. The need for treatment and the expected duration of such treatment must be verified by a physician licensed under chapter 458 or chapter 459; a psychologist licensed under s. 490.005(1), s. 490.006, or the provision identified as s. 490.013(2) in s. 1, chapter 81-235, Laws of Florida; a therapist as defined in s. 491.003(2) or (7); or a treatment professional who is registered under s. 39.905(1)(g), is authorized to maintain confidentiality under s. 90.5036(1)(d), and has a minimum of 2 years’ experience at a certified domestic violence center. An exception granted under this paragraph does not automatically constitute an exception from the time limitations on benefits specified under s. 414.105. (d) Noncompliance related to medical incapacity.—If an individual cannot participate in assigned work activities due to a medical incapacity, the individual may be excepted from the activity for a specific period, except that the individual shall be required to comply with the course of treatment necessary for the individual to resume participation. A participant may not be excused from work activity requirements unless the participant’s medical incapacity is verified by a physician licensed under chapter 458 or chapter 459, in accordance with procedures established by rule of the department. An individual for whom there is medical verification of limitation to participate in work activities shall be assigned to work activities consistent with such limitations. Evaluation of an individual’s ability to participate in work activities or development of a plan for work activity assignment may include vocational assessment or work evaluation. The department or a local workforce development board may require an individual to cooperate in medical or vocational assessment necessary to evaluate the individual’s ability to participate in a work activity. (e) Noncompliance related to outpatient mental health or substance abuse treatment.—If an individual cannot participate in the required hours of work activity due to a need to become or remain involved in outpatient mental health or substance abuse counseling or treatment, the individual may be exempted from the work activity for up to 5 hours per week, not to exceed 100 hours per year. An individual may not be excused from a work activity unless a mental health or substance abuse professional recognized by the department or local workforce development board certifies the treatment protocol and provides verification of attendance at the counseling or treatment sessions each week. (f) Noncompliance due to medical incapacity by applicants for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Income (SSDI).—An individual subject to work activity requirements may be exempted from those requirements if the individual provides information verifying that he or she has filed an application for SSI disability benefits or SSDI disability benefits and the decision is pending development and evaluation under social security disability law, rules, and regulations at the initial reconsideration, administrative law judge, or Social Security Administration Appeals Council levels. (g) Other good cause exceptions for noncompliance.—Individuals who are temporarily unable to participate due to circumstances beyond their control may be excepted from the noncompliance penalties. The department may define by rule situations that would constitute good cause. These situations must include caring for a disabled family member when the need for the care has been verified and alternate care is not available. (5) WORK ACTIVITY REQUIREMENTS FOR PARENTS.— (a) The court may order a parent who is delinquent in support payments, pursuant to the terms of a support order, to participate in work activities under this chapter, or as provided in s. 61.14(5)(b), so that the parent may obtain employment and fulfill the obligation to provide support payments. A parent who fails to satisfactorily engage in court-ordered work activities may be held in contempt. (b) The court may order a parent to participate in work activities under this chapter if the child of the parent has been placed with a relative, in an emergency shelter, in foster care, or in other substitute care, and: 1. The case plan requires the parent to participate in work activities; or 2. The parent would be eligible to participate in work activities and subject to work activity requirements if the child were living with the parent. If a parent fails to comply with the case plan, the parent may be removed from program participation.

For any family without an individual subject to the work participation requirement, one vehicle valued at not more than $8,500 shall be excluded. Any vehicle that is necessary to transport a physically disabled family member shall be excluded.

      "text": "414.095 Determining eligibility for temporary cash assistance.— (1) ELIGIBILITY.—An applicant must meet eligibility requirements of this section before receiving services or temporary cash assistance under this chapter, except that an applicant shall be required to register for work and engage in work activities in accordance with s. 445.024, as designated by the local workforce development board, and may receive support services or child care assistance in conjunction with such requirement. The department shall make a determination of eligibility based on the criteria listed in this chapter. The department shall monitor continued eligibility for temporary cash assistance through periodic reviews consistent with the food assistance eligibility process. Benefits may not be denied to an individual solely based on a felony drug conviction, unless the conviction is for trafficking pursuant to s. 893.135. To be eligible under this section, an individual convicted of a drug felony must be satisfactorily meeting the requirements of the temporary cash assistance program, including all substance abuse treatment requirements. Within the limits specified in this chapter, the state opts out of the provision of Pub. L. No. 104-193, s. 115, that eliminates eligibility for temporary cash assistance and food assistance for any individual convicted of a controlled substance felony. (2) ADDITIONAL ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS.— (a) To be eligible for services or temporary cash assistance and Medicaid: 1. An applicant must be a United States citizen, or a qualified noncitizen, as defined in this section. 2. An applicant must be a legal resident of the state. 3. Each member of a family must provide to the department the member’s social security number or shall provide proof of application for a social security number. An individual who fails to provide a social security number, or proof of application for a social security number, is not eligible to participate in the program. 4. A minor child must reside with a parent or parents, with a relative caretaker who is within the specified degree of blood relationship as defined by 45 C.F.R. part 233, or, if the minor is a teen parent with a child, in a setting approved by the department as provided in subsection (14). 5. Each family must have a minor child and meet the income and resource requirements of the program. All minor children who live in the family, as well as the parents of the minor children, shall be included in the eligibility determination unless specifically excluded. (b) The following members of a family are eligible to participate in the program if all eligibility requirements are met: 1. A minor child who resides with a parent or other adult caretaker relative. 2. The parent of a minor child with whom the child resides. 3. The caretaker relative with whom the minor child resides who chooses to have her or his needs and income included in the family. 4. Unwed minor children and their children if the unwed minor child lives at home or in an adult-supervised setting and if temporary cash assistance is paid to an alternative payee. 5. A pregnant woman. (3) ELIGIBILITY FOR NONCITIZENS.—A “qualified noncitizen” is an individual who is admitted to the United States as a refugee under s. 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act or who is granted asylum under s. 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act; a noncitizen whose deportation is withheld under s. 243(h) or s. 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; a noncitizen who is paroled into the United States under s. 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, for at least 1 year; a noncitizen who is granted conditional entry pursuant to s. 203(a)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act as in effect prior to April 1, 1980; a Cuban or Haitian entrant; or a noncitizen who has been admitted as a permanent resident. In addition, a “qualified noncitizen” includes an individual who, or an individual whose child or parent, has been battered or subject to extreme cruelty in the United States by a spouse, a parent, or other household member under certain circumstances, and has applied for or received protection under the federal Violence Against Women Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-322, if the need for benefits is related to the abuse and the batterer no longer lives in the household. A “nonqualified noncitizen” is a nonimmigrant noncitizen, including a tourist, business visitor, foreign student, exchange visitor, temporary worker, or diplomat. In addition, a “nonqualified noncitizen” includes an individual paroled into the United States for less than 1 year. A qualified noncitizen who is otherwise eligible may receive temporary cash assistance to the extent permitted by federal law. The income or resources of a sponsor and the sponsor’s spouse shall be included in determining eligibility to the maximum extent permitted by federal law. (a) A child who is a qualified noncitizen or who was born in the United States to an illegal or ineligible noncitizen is eligible for temporary cash assistance under this chapter if the family meets all eligibility requirements. (b) If the parent may legally work in this country, the parent must participate in the work activity requirements provided in s. 445.024, to the extent permitted under federal law. (c) The department shall participate in the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program (SAVE) established by the United States Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services in order to verify the validity of documents provided by noncitizens and to verify a noncitizen’s eligibility. (d) The income of an illegal noncitizen or ineligible noncitizen who is a mandatory member of a family, less a pro rata share for the illegal noncitizen or ineligible noncitizen, counts in determining a family’s eligibility to participate in the program. (e) The entire assets of an ineligible noncitizen or a disqualified individual who is a mandatory member of a family shall be included in determining the family’s eligibility. (4) CARETAKER RELATIVES.—A family that contains a caretaker relative of a minor child has the option to include or exclude the caretaker relative in determining eligibility. If the caretaker relative chooses to be included in the family, the caretaker relative must meet all eligibility requirements, including resource and income requirements, and must comply with work activity requirements as provided in s. 445.024. If the caretaker relative chooses to be excluded from the family, eligibility shall be determined for the minor child based on the child’s income and resources. The level of temporary cash assistance for the minor child shall be based on the shelter obligation paid to the caretaker relative. (5) PREGNANT WOMAN WITH NO OTHER CHILD.—Temporary cash assistance for a pregnant woman is not available until the last month of pregnancy. However, if the department determines that a woman is restricted from work activities by orders of a physician, temporary cash assistance shall be available during the last trimester of pregnancy and the woman may be required to attend parenting classes or other activities to better prepare for the responsibilities of raising a child. (6) CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT.—As a condition of eligibility for public assistance, the family must cooperate with the state agency responsible for administering the child support enforcement program in establishing the paternity of the child, if the child is born out of wedlock, and in obtaining support for the child or for the parent or caretaker relative and the child. Cooperation is defined as: (a) Assisting in identifying and locating a parent who does not live in the same home as the child and providing complete and accurate information on that parent; (b) Assisting in establishing paternity; and (c) Assisting in establishing, modifying, or enforcing a support order with respect to a child of a family member. This subsection does not apply if the state agency that administers the child support enforcement program determines that the parent or caretaker relative has good cause for failing to cooperate. (7) ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS TO SUPPORT.—As a condition of receiving temporary cash assistance, the family must assign to the Department of Revenue any rights a member of a family may have to support from any other person. This applies to any family member; however, the assigned amounts must not exceed the total amount of temporary cash assistance provided to the family. The assignment of support does not apply if the family leaves the program. (8) APPLICATIONS.—The date of application is the date the department or authorized entity receives a signed and dated request to participate in the temporary cash assistance program. The request shall be denied 30 days after the initial application if the applicant fails to respond to scheduled appointments, including appointments with the state agency responsible for administering the child support enforcement program, and does not contact the department or authorized entity regarding the application. (a) The beginning date of eligibility for temporary cash assistance is the date on which the application is approved or 30 days after the date of application, whichever is earlier. (b) The add date for a newborn child is the date of the child’s birth. (c) The add date for all other individuals is the date on which the client contacts the department to request that the individual be included in the grant for temporary cash assistance. (d) Medicaid coverage for a recipient of temporary cash assistance begins on the first day of the first month of eligibility for temporary cash assistance, and such coverage shall include any eligibility required by federal law which is prior to the month of application. (9) OPPORTUNITIES AND OBLIGATIONS.—An applicant for temporary cash assistance has the following opportunities and obligations: (a) To participate in establishing eligibility by providing facts with respect to circumstances that affect eligibility and by obtaining, or authorizing the department to obtain, documents or information from others in order to establish eligibility. (b) To have eligibility determined without discrimination based on race, color, sex, age, marital status, handicap, religion, national origin, or political beliefs. (c) To be advised of any reduction or termination of temporary cash assistance or food assistance. (d) To provide correct and complete information about the family’s circumstances that relate to eligibility, at the time of application and at subsequent intervals. (e) To keep the department informed of any changes that could affect eligibility. (f) To use temporary cash assistance and food assistance for the purpose for which the assistance is intended. (g) To receive information regarding services available from certified domestic violence centers or organizations that provide counseling and supportive services to individuals who are past or present victims of domestic violence or who are at risk of domestic violence and, upon request, to be referred to such organizations in a manner which protects the individual’s confidentiality. (10) DETERMINATION OF LEVEL OF TEMPORARY CASH ASSISTANCE.—Temporary cash assistance shall be based on a standard determined by the Legislature, subject to availability of funds. There shall be three assistance levels for a family that contains a specified number of eligible members, based on the following criteria: (a) A family that does not have a shelter obligation. (b) A family that has a shelter obligation greater than zero but less than or equal to $50. (c) A family that has a shelter obligation greater than $50 or that is homeless. The following chart depicts the levels of temporary cash assistance for implementation purposes: THREE-TIER SHELTER PAYMENT STANDARD Family Size Zero Shelter Obligation Greater than Zero Less than or Equal to $50 Greater than $50 Shelter Obligation 1 $95 $153 $180 2 $158 $205 $241 3 $198 $258 $303 4 $254 $309 $364 5 $289 $362 $426 6 $346 $414 $487 7 $392 $467 $549 8 $438 $519 $610 9 $485 $570 $671 10 $534 $623 $733 11 $582 $676 $795 12 $630 $728 $857 13 $678 $781 $919 (11) DISREGARDS.— (a) As an incentive to employment, the first $200 plus one-half of the remainder of earned income shall be disregarded. In order to be eligible for earned income to be disregarded, the individual must be: 1. A current participant in the program; or 2. Eligible for participation in the program without the earnings disregard. (b) A child’s earned income shall be disregarded if the child is a family member, attends high school or the equivalent, and is 19 years of age or younger. (12) CALCULATION OF LEVELS OF TEMPORARY CASH ASSISTANCE.— (a) Temporary cash assistance shall be calculated based on average monthly gross family income, earned and unearned, less any applicable disregards. The resulting monthly net income amount shall be subtracted from the applicable payment standard to determine the monthly amount of temporary cash assistance. (b) A deduction may not be allowed for child care payments. (c) The department may adopt rules governing the administration of this subsection and may establish criteria pertaining to types of budgeting, conversion factors, verification of income, treatment of self-employment income, treatment of child-support income, and treatment of other sources of income. (13) METHODS OF PAYMENT OF TEMPORARY CASH ASSISTANCE.—Temporary cash assistance may be paid as follows: (a) Direct payment through state warrant, electronic transfer of temporary cash assistance, or voucher. (b) Payment to an alternative payee. (c) Payment for subsidized employment. (d) Pay-after-performance arrangements with public or private not-for-profit agencies. (14) PROHIBITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS.— (a) A family without a minor child living in the home is not eligible to receive temporary cash assistance or services under this chapter. However, a pregnant woman is eligible for temporary cash assistance in the ninth month of pregnancy if all eligibility requirements are otherwise satisfied. (b) Temporary cash assistance, without shelter expense, may be available for a teen parent who is a minor child and for the child. Temporary cash assistance may not be paid directly to the teen parent but must be paid, on behalf of the teen parent and child, to an alternative payee who is designated by the department. The alternative payee may not use the temporary cash assistance for any purpose other than paying for food, clothing, shelter, and medical care for the teen parent and child and for other necessities required to enable the teen parent to attend school or a training program. In order for the child of the teen parent and the teen parent to be eligible for temporary cash assistance, the teen parent must: 1. Attend school or an approved alternative training program, unless the child is less than 12 weeks of age or the teen parent has completed high school; and 2. Reside with a parent, legal guardian, or other adult caretaker relative. The income and resources of the parent shall be included in calculating the temporary cash assistance available to the teen parent since the parent is responsible for providing support and care for the child living in the home. 3. Attend parenting and family classes that provide a curriculum specified by the department or the Department of Health, as available. (c) The teen parent is not required to live with a parent, legal guardian, or other adult caretaker relative if the department determines that: 1. The teen parent has suffered or might suffer harm in the home of the parent, legal guardian, or adult caretaker relative. 2. The requirement is not in the best interest of the teen parent or the child. If the department determines that it is not in the best interest of the teen parent or child to reside with a parent, legal guardian, or other adult caretaker relative, the department shall provide or assist the teen parent in finding a suitable home, a second-chance home, a maternity home, or other appropriate adult-supervised supportive living arrangement. Such living arrangement may include a shelter obligation in accordance with subsection (10). The department may not delay providing temporary cash assistance to the teen parent through the alternative payee designated by the department pending a determination as to where the teen parent should live and sufficient time for the move itself. A teen parent determined to need placement that is unavailable shall continue to be eligible for temporary cash assistance so long as the teen parent cooperates with the department and the Department of Health. The teen parent shall be provided with counseling to make the transition from independence to supervised living and with a choice of living arrangements. (d) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, if a parent or caretaker relative without good cause does not cooperate with the state agency responsible for administering the child support enforcement program in establishing, modifying, or enforcing a support order with respect to a child of a teen parent or other family member, or a child of a family member who is in the care of an adult relative, temporary cash assistance to the entire family shall be denied until the state agency indicates that cooperation by the parent or caretaker relative has been satisfactory. To the extent permissible under federal law, a parent or caretaker relative shall not be penalized for failure to cooperate with paternity establishment or with the establishment, modification, or enforcement of a support order when such cooperation could subject an individual to a risk of domestic violence. Such risk shall constitute good cause to the extent permitted by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, as amended, or other federal law. (e) If a parent or caretaker relative does not assign any rights a family member may have to support from any other person as required by subsection (7), temporary cash assistance to the entire family shall be denied until the parent or caretaker relative assigns the rights to the department. (f) An individual who is convicted in federal or state court of receiving benefits under this chapter, Title XIX, the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, or Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income), in two or more states simultaneously may not receive temporary cash assistance or services under this chapter for 10 years following the date of conviction. (g) An individual is ineligible to receive temporary cash assistance or services under this chapter during any period when the individual is fleeing to avoid prosecution, custody, or confinement after committing a crime, attempting to commit a crime that is a felony under the laws of the place from which the individual flees or a high misdemeanor in the State of New Jersey, or violating a condition of probation or parole imposed under federal or state law. (h) The parent or other caretaker relative must report to the department by the end of the 5-day period that begins on the date it becomes clear to the parent or caretaker relative that a minor child will be absent from the home for 30 or more consecutive days. A parent or caretaker relative who fails to report this information to the department shall be disqualified from receiving temporary cash assistance for 30 days for the first occurrence, 60 days for the second occurrence, and 90 days for the third or subsequent occurrence. (i) If the parents of a minor child live apart and equally share custody and control of the child, a parent is ineligible for temporary cash assistance unless the parent clearly demonstrates to the department that the parent provides primary day-to-day custody. (j) The payee of the temporary cash assistance payment is the caretaker relative with whom a minor child resides and who assumes primary responsibility for the child’s daily supervision, care, and control, except in cases where a protective payee is established. (k) Use of temporary cash assistance benefits out of state is limited to 30 consecutive days. The temporary cash assistance benefits of a recipient using his or her benefits out of state for more than 30 days shall be terminated. The department shall adopt rules providing for the determination of temporary absence and a recipient’s intent to return to the state. (l) A parent or caretaker relative who has been disqualified due to fraud must have a protective payee designated to receive temporary cash assistance benefits for an eligible child. The requirements for designation of a protective payee shall be the same as the requirements for designation of a protective payee for work sanctions in s. 414.065(2)(b). An individual disqualified for fraud cannot be designated as a protective payee. In a two-parent household, if only one parent is disqualified, the other parent may be designated as the payee of the benefit. (15) PREELIGIBILITY FRAUD SCREENING.—An applicant who meets an error-prone profile, as determined by the department, is subject to preeligibility fraud screening as a means of reducing misspent funds and preventing fraud. The department shall create an error-prone or fraud-prone case profile within its public assistance information system and shall screen each application for temporary cash assistance against the profile to identify cases that have a potential for error or fraud. Each case so identified shall be subjected to preeligibility fraud screening. (16) PROPORTIONAL REDUCTION.—If the Social Services Estimating Conference forecasts an increase in the temporary cash assistance caseload and there is insufficient funding, a proportional reduction as determined by the department shall be applied to the levels of temporary cash assistance in subsection (10). (17) ADDITIONAL FUNDING.—When warranted by economic circumstances, the department, in consultation with the Social Services Estimating Conference, shall apply for additional federal funding available from the Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs. (18) RULES.—The department may adopt rules governing the administration of this section and may establish criteria regarding verification requirements and limitations on eligibility.

      "text": "414.105 Time limitations of temporary cash assistance.—Except as otherwise provided in this section, an applicant or current participant shall receive temporary cash assistance for no more than a lifetime cumulative total of 48 months, unless otherwise provided by law. (1) Hardship exemptions from the time limitations provided in this section may not exceed 20 percent of the average monthly caseload, as determined by the department in cooperation with CareerSource Florida, Inc. Criteria for hardship exemptions include: (a) Diligent participation in activities, combined with inability to obtain employment. (b) Diligent participation in activities, combined with extraordinary barriers to employment, including the conditions which may result in an exemption to work requirements. (c) Significant barriers to employment, combined with a need for additional time. (d) Diligent participation in activities and a need by teen parents for an exemption in order to have 24 months of eligibility beyond receipt of the high school diploma or equivalent. (e) A recommendation of extension for a minor child of a participating family that has reached the end of the eligibility period for temporary cash assistance. The recommendation must be the result of a review that determines that the termination of the child’s temporary cash assistance would be likely to result in the child being placed into emergency shelter or foster care. (2) A victim of domestic violence may be granted a hardship exemption if the effects of such domestic violence delay or otherwise interrupt or adversely affect the individual’s participation in the program. (3) The department, in cooperation with CareerSource Florida, Inc., shall establish a procedure for approving hardship exemptions and for reviewing hardship cases at least once every 2 years. Local workforce development boards may assist in making these determinations. (4) For individuals who have moved from another state, the months in which temporary cash assistance was received under a block grant program that provided temporary assistance for needy families in any state shall count towards the cumulative 48-month benefit limit for temporary cash assistance. (5) For individuals subject to a time limitation under the Family Transition Act of 1993, that time limitation shall continue to apply. Months in which temporary cash assistance was received through the family transition program shall count towards the time limitations under this section. (6) Except when temporary cash assistance was received through the family transition program, the calculation of the time limitation for temporary cash assistance shall begin with the first month of receipt of temporary cash assistance after the effective date of this act. (7) Child-only cases are not subject to time limitations, and temporary cash assistance received while an individual is a minor child shall not count towards time limitations. (8) An individual who receives benefits under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program or the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program is not subject to time limitations. An individual who has applied for supplemental security income (SSI) or supplemental security disability income (SSDI) but has not yet received a determination must be granted an extension of time limits until the individual receives a final determination on the SSI or SSDI application. Determination shall be considered final once all appeals have been exhausted, benefits have been received, or denial has been accepted without any appeal. While awaiting a final determination, the individual must continue to meet all program requirements assigned to the participant based on medical ability to comply. If a final determination results in the denial of benefits for supplemental security income (SSI) or supplemental security disability income (SSDI), any period during which the recipient received assistance under this section shall be counted in the recipient’s 48-month lifetime limit. (9) A person who is totally responsible for the personal care of a disabled family member is not subject to time limitations if the need for the care is verified and alternative care is not available for the family member. The department shall annually evaluate an individual’s qualifications for this exemption. (10) A member of the staff of the local workforce development board shall interview and assess the employment prospects and barriers of each participant who is within 6 months of reaching the 48-month time limit. The staff member shall do all of the following: (a) Administer the exit survey required under s. 445.035. (b) Use a tool to demonstrate future financial impacts of the participant’s change in income and benefits over time. (c) Assist the participant in identifying actions necessary to become employed before reaching the benefit time limit for temporary cash assistance. (d) If appropriate, refer the participant for services that could facilitate employment, including, but not limited to, transitional benefits and services.

For a student who has been identified as a habitual truant, the temporary cash assistance must be reinstated after a subsequent grading period in which the child’s attendance has substantially improved. For a student who has been identified as a dropout, the temporary cash assistance must be reinstated after the student enrolls in a public school, receives a high school diploma or its equivalency, enrolls in preparation for the high school equivalency examination, or enrolls in other educational activities approved by the district school board. Good cause exemptions from the rule of unexcused absences include the following: (a) The student is expelled from school and alternative schooling is not available. (b) No licensed day care is available for a child of teen parents subject to Learnfare. (c) Prohibitive transportation problems exist (e.g., to and from day care). Within 10 days after sanction notification, the participant parent of a dependent child or the teenage participant may file an internal fair hearings process review procedure appeal, and no sanction shall be imposed until the appeal is resolved. (2) Each participant with a school-age child is required to have a conference with an appropriate school official of the child’s school during each semester to assure that the participant is involved in the child’s educational progress and is aware of any existing attendance or academic problems. The conference must address acceptable student attendance, grades, and behavior and must be documented by the school and reported to the department. The department shall notify a school of any student in attendance at that school who is a participant in the Learnfare program in order that the required conferences are held. A participant who without good cause fails to attend a conference with a school official is subject to the sanction provided in subsection (1). The temporary cash assistance shall be reinstated after the participant attends the conference with the appropriate school official and that conference is documented by the school and reported to the department. (3) The department shall develop an electronic data transfer system to enable the department to collect, report, and share data accurately and efficiently. In order to ensure accountability and assess the effectiveness of the Learnfare program, the department shall compile information including, but not limited to, the number of students and families reported by school districts as out of compliance, the number of students and families sanctioned as a result, and the number of students and families reinstated after becoming compliant. The information compiled shall be submitted in the form of an annual report to the presiding officers of the Legislature by March 1.

The State Office on Homelessness, with the concurrence of the Council on Homelessness, may accept and administer moneys appropriated to the Department of Children and Families to provide homelessness prevention grants annually to lead agencies for local homeless assistance continuums of care, as recognized by the State Office on Homelessness. These moneys shall consist of any sums that the state may appropriate, as well as money received from donations, gifts, bequests, or otherwise from any public or private source that is intended to assist families to prevent them from becoming homeless. (2) GRANT APPLICATIONS.—Grant applicants shall be ranked competitively. Preference shall be given to applicants who leverage additional private funds and public funds, who demonstrate the effectiveness of their homelessness prevention programs in keeping families housed, and who demonstrate the commitment of other assistance and services to address family health, employment, and education needs. (3) ELIGIBILITY.—In order to qualify for a grant, a lead agency must develop and implement a local homeless assistance continuum of care plan for its designated catchment area. The homelessness prevention program must be included in the continuum of care plan. (4) GRANT LIMITS.—The maximum grant amount per lead agency may not exceed $300,000. The grant assistance may be used to pay past due rent or mortgage payments, past due utility costs, provision of case management services, and program administration costs not to exceed 3 percent of the grant award. The homelessness prevention program must develop a case plan for each family to be assisted, setting forth what costs will be covered and the maximum level of assistance to be offered. (5) PERFORMANCE.—The lead agency must track, monitor, and report on each family assisted for at least 12 months after the last assistance provided to the family. The goal for the homelessness prevention program is to enable at least 85 percent of the families assisted to remain in their homes and avoid becoming homeless during the ensuing year.

Failure to notify the department within the time prescribed is a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (7) Repayment of public assistance benefits or services or return of authorization or identification wrongfully obtained is not a defense to, or ground for dismissal of, criminal charges brought under this section. (8)(a) The introduction into evidence of a paid state warrant made to the order of the defendant is prima facie evidence that the defendant did receive public assistance from the state. (b) The introduction into evidence of a transaction history generated by a Personal Identification Number (PIN) establishing a purchase or withdrawal by electronic benefit transfer is prima facie evidence that the identified recipient received public assistance from the state. (9) All records relating to investigations of public assistance fraud in the custody of the department and the Agency for Health Care Administration are available for examination by the Department of Financial Services pursuant to s. 414.411 and are admissible into evidence in proceedings brought under this section as business records within the meaning of s. 90.803(6). (10) The department shall create an error-prone or fraud-prone case profile within its public assistance information system and shall screen each application for public assistance, including food assistance, Medicaid, and temporary cash assistance, against the profile to identify cases that have a potential for error or fraud. Each case so identified shall be subjected to preeligibility fraud screening. (11)(a) Subject to availability of funds, the department or the director of the Office of Public Benefits Integrity shall, unless the person declines the reward, pay a reward to a person who furnishes and reports original information relating to a violation of the state’s public assistance fraud laws if the information and report: 1. Are made to the department, the Department of Financial Services, or the Department of Law Enforcement. 2. Relate to criminal fraud upon public assistance program funds or a criminal violation of public assistance fraud laws by another person. 3. Lead to the recovery of a fine, penalty, or forfeiture of property. (b) The reward may not exceed 10 percent of the amount recovered or $500,000, whichever is less, in a single case. (c) The reward shall be paid from the state share of the recovery in the Federal Grants Trust Fund from moneys collected pursuant to s. 414.41. (d) A person who receives a reward pursuant to this subsection is not eligible to receive funds pursuant to the Florida False Claims Act for Medicaid fraud for which the reward was received.

(2) The Department of Financial Services is directed to implement the Stop Inmate Fraud Program in accordance with the following guidelines: (a) The program shall establish procedures for sharing public records not exempt from the public records law among social services agencies regarding the identities of persons incarcerated in state correctional institutions, as defined in s. 944.02, or in county, municipal, or regional jails or other detention facilities of local governments under chapter 950 or chapter 951 who are wrongfully receiving public assistance benefits or entitlement benefits. (b) Pursuant to these procedures, the program shall have access to records containing correctional information not exempt from the public records law on incarcerated persons which have been generated as criminal justice information. As used in this paragraph, the terms “record” and “criminal justice information” have the same meanings as provided in s. 943.045. (c) Database searches shall be conducted of the inmate population at each correctional institution or other detention facility. A correctional institution or a detention facility shall provide the Stop Inmate Fraud Program with the information necessary to identify persons wrongfully receiving benefits in the medium requested by the Stop Inmate Fraud Program if the correctional institution or detention facility maintains the information in that medium. (d) Data obtained from correctional institutions or other detention facilities shall be compared with the client files of the Department of Children and Families, the Department of Commerce, and other state or local agencies as needed to identify persons wrongfully obtaining benefits. Data comparisons shall be accomplished during periods of low information demand by agency personnel to minimize inconvenience to the agency. (e) Results of data comparisons shall be furnished to the appropriate office for use in the county in which the data originated. The program may provide reports of the data it obtains to appropriate state, federal, and local government agencies or governmental entities, including, but not limited to: 1. The Child Support Enforcement Program of the Department of Revenue, so that the data may be used as locator information on persons being sought for purposes of child support. 2. The Social Security Administration, so that the data may be used to reduce federal entitlement fraud within the state. (f) Reports by the program to another agency or entity shall be generated bimonthly, or as otherwise directed, and shall be designed to accommodate that agency’s or entity’s particular needs for data. (g) Only those persons with active cases, or with cases that were active during the incarceration period, shall be reported, in order that the funding agency or entity, upon verification of the data, may take whatever action is deemed appropriate. (h) For purposes of program review and analysis, each agency or entity receiving data from the program shall submit reports to the program which indicate the results of how the data was used.

      "text": "414.41 Recovery of payments made due to mistake or fraud.— (1) Whenever it becomes apparent that any person or provider has received any public assistance under this chapter to which she or he is not entitled, through either simple mistake or fraud on the part of the department or on the part of the recipient or participant, the department shall take all necessary steps to recover the overpayment. Recovery may include Federal Income Tax Refund Offset Program collections activities in conjunction with the Food and Nutrition Service and the Internal Revenue Service to intercept income tax refunds due to clients who owe food assistance or temporary cash assistance debt to the state. The department will follow the guidelines in accordance with federal rules and regulations and consistent with the Food Assistance Program. The department may make appropriate settlements and shall establish a policy and cost-effective rules to be used in the computation and recovery of such overpayments. (a) The department will consider an individual who has willfully provided false information or omitted information to become or remain eligible for temporary cash assistance to have committed an intentional program violation. (b) When the intentional program violation or case facts do not warrant criminal prosecution for fraud as defined in s. 414.39, the department will initiate an administrative disqualification hearing. The administrative disqualification hearing will be initiated regardless of the individual’s current eligibility. (c) Upon a finding through the administrative disqualification hearing process that the individual did commit an intentional program violation, the department will impose a disqualification period consistent with those established for food assistance program purposes. (2) The department shall determine if recovery of an overpayment as a result of department error regarding cash assistance provided under the Temporary Cash Assistance Program or benefits provided to a recipient of aid to families with dependent children would create extreme hardship. The department shall provide by rule the circumstances that constitute an extreme hardship. The department may reduce the amount of repayment if a recipient or participant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the department that repayment of the entire overpayment would result in extreme hardship, but the department may not excuse repayment. A determination of extreme hardship is not grounds for a waiver of repayment in whole or in part. (3) The department, or its designee, shall enforce an order of income deduction by the court against the liable adult recipient or participant, including the head of a family, for overpayment received as an adult under the temporary cash assistance program, the AFDC program, the food assistance program, or the Medicaid program.

In the course of such investigation the department shall examine all records, including electronic benefits transfer records and make inquiry of all persons who may have knowledge as to any irregularity incidental to the disbursement of public moneys, food assistance, or other items or benefits authorizations to recipients. All public assistance recipients, as a condition precedent to qualification for public assistance under chapter 409, chapter 411, or this chapter, must first give in writing, to the Agency for Health Care Administration, the Department of Health, the Department of Education, and the Department of Children and Families, as appropriate, and to the Department of Financial Services, consent to make inquiry of past or present employers and records, financial or otherwise.

(b) Administer oaths and affirmations. (c) Issue and serve subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses or the production of business records, books, papers, correspondences, memoranda, and other records.

Failure to obey the court order may be punished, civilly or criminally, by the court as contempt. The person refusing the subpoena is liable for costs, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred by the department to obtain an order granting, in whole or in part, a petition to enforce the subpoena. (3) The results of such investigation shall be reported by the Department of Financial Services to the appropriate legislative committees, the Agency for Health Care Administration, the Department of Health, the Department of Education, and the Department of Children and Families, and to such others as the department may determine. (4) The Department of Health and the Department of Children and Families shall report to the Department of Financial Services the final disposition of all cases wherein action has been taken pursuant to s. 414.39, based upon information furnished by the Department of Financial Services. (5) All lawful fees and expenses of officers and witnesses, expenses incident to taking testimony and transcripts of testimony and proceedings are a proper charge to the Department of Financial Services.
