(2) A person applying to the department to take the licensure examination must create and maintain an online account with the department and provide an e-mail address to function as the primary means of contact for all communication to the applicant from the department. Each applicant is responsible for maintaining accurate contact information on file with the department and must submit any change in the applicant’s e-mail address or home address within 30 days after the change. All changes must be submitted through the department’s online system. (3) An applicant is entitled to take the licensure examination to practice in this state as a certified public accountant if: (a) The applicant has completed 120 semester hours or 180 quarter hours from an accredited college or university with a concentration in accounting and business courses as specified by the board by rule; and (b) The applicant shows that she or he has good moral character. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “good moral character” has the same meaning as provided in s. 473.308(7)(a). The board may refuse to allow an applicant to take the licensure examination for failure to satisfy this requirement if: 1. The board finds a reasonable relationship between the lack of good moral character of the applicant and the professional responsibilities of a certified public accountant; and 2. The finding by the board of lack of good moral character is supported by competent substantial evidence. If an applicant is found pursuant to this paragraph to be unqualified to take the licensure examination because of a lack of good moral character, the board shall furnish to the applicant a statement containing the findings of the board, a complete record of the evidence upon which the determination was based, and a notice of the rights of the applicant to a rehearing and appeal. (4) The board shall have the authority to establish the standards for determining and shall determine: (a) What constitutes a passing grade for each subject or part of the licensure examination; (b) Which educational institutions, in addition to the universities in the State University System of Florida, shall be deemed to be accredited colleges or universities; (c) What courses and number of hours constitute a major in accounting; and (d) What courses and number of hours constitute additional accounting courses acceptable under s. 473.308(4). (5) The board may adopt an alternative licensure examination for persons who have been licensed to practice public accountancy or its equivalent in a foreign country so long as the International Qualifications Appraisal Board of the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy has ratified an agreement with that country for reciprocal licensure. (6) For the purposes of maintaining the proper educational qualifications for licensure under this chapter, the board may appoint an Educational Advisory Committee, which shall be composed of one member of the board, two persons in public practice who are licensed under this chapter, and four academicians on faculties of universities in this state.

(2) The board shall certify for licensure any applicant who successfully passes the licensure examination and satisfies the requirements of subsections (4), (5), and (6), and shall certify for licensure any firm that satisfies the requirements of ss. 473.309 and 473.3101. The board may refuse to certify any applicant or firm that has violated any of the provisions of s. 473.322. (3) A person desiring to be licensed as a Florida certified public accountant or a firm desiring to engage in the practice of public accounting must create and maintain an online account with the department and provide an e-mail address to function as the primary means of contact for all communication from the department. Certified public accountants and firms are responsible for maintaining accurate contact information on file with the department and must submit any change in an e-mail address or street address within 30 days after the change. All changes must be submitted through the department’s online system. (4) An applicant for licensure must have at least 150 semester hours of college education, including a baccalaureate or higher degree conferred by an accredited college or university, with a concentration in accounting and business in the total educational program to the extent specified by the board. (5)(a) An applicant for licensure after December 31, 2008, must show that he or she has had 1 year of work experience. This experience shall include providing any type of service or advice involving the use of accounting, attest, compilation, management advisory, financial advisory, tax, or consulting skills, all of which must be verified by a certified public accountant who is licensed by a state or territory of the United States. This experience is acceptable if it was gained through employment in government, industry, academia, or public practice; constituted a substantial part of the applicant’s duties; and was verified by a certified public accountant licensed by a state or territory of the United States. The board shall adopt rules specifying standards and providing for the review and approval of the work experience required by this section. (b) However, an applicant who completed the requirements of subsection (4) on or before December 31, 2008, and who passes the licensure examination on or before June 30, 2010, is exempt from the requirements of this subsection. (6) An applicant for licensure shall show that the applicant has good moral character. (7)(a) “Good moral character” means a personal history of honesty, fairness, and respect for the rights of others and for the laws of this state and nation. (b) The board may refuse to certify an applicant for failure to satisfy this requirement if: 1. The board finds a reasonable relationship between the lack of good moral character of the applicant and the professional responsibilities of a certified public accountant; and 2. The finding by the board of lack of good moral character is supported by competent substantial evidence. (c) When an applicant is found to be unqualified for a license because of a lack of good moral character, the board shall furnish to the applicant a statement containing the findings of the board, a complete record of the evidence upon which the determination was based, and a notice of the rights of the applicant to a rehearing and appeal. (8) The board shall certify as qualified for a license by endorsement an applicant who: (a) Is not licensed and has not been licensed in any state or territory and who has met the requirements of this section for education, work experience, and good moral character and has passed a national, regional, state, or territorial licensing examination that is substantially equivalent to the examination required by s. 473.306; or (b)1. Holds a valid license to practice public accounting issued by another state or territory of the United States, if the criteria for issuance of such license were substantially equivalent to the licensure criteria that existed in this state at the time the license was issued; 2. Holds a valid license to practice public accounting issued by another state or territory of the United States but the criteria for issuance of such license did not meet the requirements of subparagraph 1.; has met the requirements of this section for education, work experience, and good moral character; and has passed a national, regional, state, or territorial licensing examination that is substantially equivalent to the examination required by s. 473.306; or 3. Holds a valid license to practice public accounting issued by another state or territory of the United States for at least 10 years before the date of application; has passed a national, regional, state, or territorial licensing examination that is substantially equivalent to the examination required by s. 473.306; and has met the requirements of this section for good moral character. (9) If the applicant has at least 5 years of experience in the practice of public accountancy in the United States or in the practice of public accountancy or its equivalent in a foreign country that the International Qualifications Appraisal Board of the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy has determined has licensure standards that are substantially equivalent to those in the United States, or has at least 5 years of work experience that meets the requirements of subsection (5), the board must waive the requirements of subsection (4) which are in excess of a baccalaureate degree. All experience that is used as a basis for waiving the requirements of subsection (4) must be while licensed as a certified public accountant by another state or territory of the United States or while licensed in the practice of public accountancy or its equivalent in a foreign country that the International Qualifications Appraisal Board of the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy has determined has licensure standards that are substantially equivalent to those in the United States. The board shall have the authority to establish the standards for experience that meet this requirement. (10) The board may refuse to certify for licensure any applicant who is under investigation in another state for any act that would constitute a violation of this act or chapter 455, until such time as the investigation is complete and disciplinary proceedings have been terminated.

      "text": "473.313 Inactive status; retired status.— (1) A Florida certified public accountant may request that her or his license be placed in an inactive status by making application to the department. The board may prescribe by rule fees for placing a license on inactive status, renewal of inactive status, and reactivation of an inactive license. (a) A license that has become inactive under this subsection or for failure to complete the requirements in s. 473.312 may be reactivated under s. 473.311 upon application to the department. The board may prescribe by rule continuing education requirements as a condition of reactivating a license. The maximum continuing education requirements for reactivating a license are 120 hours, including at least 30 hours in accounting-related and auditing-related subjects, not more than 30 hours in behavioral subjects, and a minimum of 8 hours in ethics subjects approved by the board, for the reactivation of a license that is inactive or delinquent. (b) A license that is delinquent for failure to report completion of the requirements in s. 473.312 may be reactivated under s. 473.311 upon application to the department. Reactivation requires the payment of an application fee as determined by the board and certification by the Florida certified public accountant that the applicant satisfactorily completed the continuing education requirements set forth under s. 473.311. If the license is delinquent on January 1 because of failure to report completed continuing education requirements, the applicant must submit a complete application to the board by March 15 immediately after the delinquent period. (c) Any Florida certified public accountant holding an inactive license may be permitted to reactivate such license in a conditional manner. The conditions of reactivation shall require the payment of fees and the completion of required continuing education. (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of s. 455.271, the board may, at its discretion, reinstate the license of an individual whose license has become null and void if the individual has made a good faith effort to comply with this section but has failed to comply because of illness or unusual hardship. The individual shall apply to the board for reinstatement in a manner prescribed by rules of the board and shall pay an application fee in an amount determined by rule of the board. The board shall require that the individual meet all continuing education requirements as provided in paragraph (a), pay appropriate licensing fees, and otherwise be eligible for renewal of licensure under this chapter. (2) A Florida certified public accountant who is at least 65 years of age, currently holds an active or inactive license in good standing under this chapter, and is not the subject of any sanction or disciplinary action may request that her or his license be placed on retired status by making application to the department. The board may prescribe by rule the application for placing a license on retired status, which must state that the applicant has no association with accounting or any of the services described in s. 473.302(8). If a licensee who has been granted retired status reenters the workforce in a position that has an association with accounting or any of the services described in s. 473.302(8), the licensee automatically loses her or his retired status. (a) A retired licensee may, without losing her or his retired status, serve without compensation on a board of directors or board of trustees, provide volunteer tax preparation services, participate in a government-sponsored business mentoring program such as the Internal Revenue Service’s Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program or the Small Business Administration’s SCORE program, or participate in an advisory role for a similar charitable, civic, or other non-profit organization. (b) The board shall require a retired licensee to affirm in writing her or his understanding of the limited types of activities in which she or he may engage while in retired status and that she or he has a professional duty to ensure that she or he holds the professional competencies necessary to participate in such activities. (c) A retired licensee may accept routine reimbursement for actual costs of travel and meals associated with volunteer services or de minimis per diem amounts paid to the licensee to cover such expenses as allowed by law. (d) A retired licensee may use the title of “retired CPA” on any business card or letterhead or any other printed or electronic document. However, such title must not be applied in such a manner that could confuse the public as to the current status of the licensee. The licensee is not required to have a certificate issued with the word “retired” on the certificate. (e) A retired licensee is not required to maintain the continuing education requirements under s. 473.312. (f) A retired licensee may not offer or render professional services that require her or his signature and the use of the CPA title, regardless of whether “retired” is attached to such title. (g) A retired licensee may be permitted to reactivate her or his license in a conditional manner as determined by the board. The conditions of reactivation must require the payment of fees and the completion of required continuing education. The board may prescribe by rule an application for reactivating a license placed on retired status and continuing education requirements as a condition of reactivating a license placed on retired status. The minimum continuing education requirements for reactivating a license placed on retired status are those of the most recent biennium plus one-half of the requirements in s. 473.312 for each biennium or part thereof during which the license was on retired status. For the purposes of this subsection, the term “retired licensee” means a licensee whose license has been placed in retired status by the department.

(b) A “client” is any person, public officer, corporation, association, or other organization or entity, either public or private, who agrees with an accountant or accountant’s employer to receive professional services. (c) A communication between an accountant and her or his client is “confidential” if it is not intended to be disclosed to third persons other than: 1. Those to whom disclosure is in furtherance of the rendition of accounting services to the client. 2. Those reasonably necessary for the transmission of the communication. (d) A “quality review” is a study, appraisal, or review of one or more aspects of the professional work of an accountant in the practice of public accountancy which is conducted by a professional organization for the purpose of evaluating quality assurance required by professional standards, including a quality assurance review. The term includes a peer review as defined in s. 473.3125. (e) A “review committee” is any person or persons who are not owners or employees of an accountant or firm that is the subject of a quality review and who carry out, administer, or oversee a quality review. (2) A client has a privilege to refuse to disclose, and to prevent any other person from disclosing, the contents of confidential communications with an accountant when such other person learned of the communications because they were made in the rendition of accounting services to the client. This privilege includes other confidential information obtained by the accountant from the client for the purpose of rendering accounting advice. (3) The privilege may be claimed by: (a) The client. (b) A guardian or conservator of the client. (c) The personal representative of a deceased client. (d) A successor, assignee, trustee in dissolution, or any similar representative of an organization, corporation, or association or other entity, either public or private, whether or not in existence. (e) The accountant, but only on behalf of the client. The accountant’s authority to claim the privilege is presumed in the absence of contrary evidence. (4) There is no accountant-client privilege under this section when: (a) The services of the accountant were sought or obtained to enable or aid anyone to commit or plan to commit what the client knew or should have known was a crime or fraud. (b) A communication is relevant to an issue of breach of duty by the accountant to her or his client or by the client to her or his accountant. (c) A communication is relevant to a matter of common interest between two or more clients, if the communication was made by any of them to an accountant retained or consulted in common when offered in a civil action between the clients. (5) Communications are not privileged from disclosure in any disciplinary investigation or proceeding conducted pursuant to this act by the department or before the board or in any judicial review of such a proceeding. In any such proceeding, a certified public accountant or public accountant, without the consent of her or his client, may testify with respect to any communication between the accountant and the accountant’s client or be compelled, pursuant to a subpoena of the department or the board, to testify or produce records, books, or papers. Such a communication disclosed to the board and records of the board relating to the communication shall for all other purposes and proceedings be a privileged communication in all of the courts of this state. (6) The proceedings, records, and workpapers of a review committee are privileged and are not subject to discovery, subpoena, or other means of legal process or to introduction into evidence in a civil action or arbitration, administrative proceeding, or state accountancy board proceeding. A member of a review committee or person who was involved in a quality review may not testify in a civil action or arbitration, administrative proceeding, or state accountancy board proceeding as to any matter produced or disclosed during the quality review or as to any findings, recommendations, evaluations, opinions, or other actions of the review committee or any members thereof. Public records and materials prepared for a particular engagement are not privileged merely because they were presented during the quality review.
