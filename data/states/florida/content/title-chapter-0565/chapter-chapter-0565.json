      "text": "565.02 License fees; vendors; clubs; caterers; and others.— (1) The following state license taxes apply to vendors who are permitted to sell any alcoholic beverages regardless of alcoholic content: (a) A vendor operating a place of business where beverages are sold only in sealed containers for consumption off the premises where sold shall pay an amount equal to 75 percent of the amount of the license tax for vendors in the same county as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f). (b) A vendor operating a place of business where consumption on the premises is permitted in a county having a population of over 100,000, according to the latest population estimate prepared pursuant to s. 186.901, for such county, shall pay $1,820. (c) A vendor operating a place of business where consumption on the premises is permitted in a county having a population over 75,000 and not over 100,000, according to the latest population estimate prepared pursuant to s. 186.901, for such county, shall pay $1,560. (d) A vendor operating a place of business where consumption on the premises is permitted in a county having a population of over 50,000 and not over 75,000, according to the latest population estimate prepared pursuant to s. 186.901, for such county, shall pay $1,300. (e) A vendor operating a place of business where consumption on the premises is permitted in a county having a population of over 25,000 and not over 50,000, according to the latest population estimate prepared pursuant to s. 186.901, for such county, shall pay $858. (f) A vendor operating a place of business where consumption on the premises is permitted in a county having a population of 25,000 or less, according to the latest population estimate prepared pursuant to s. 186.901, for such county, shall pay $624. (g) A vendor operating a place of business where consumption on the premises is permitted and which has more than three separate rooms or enclosures in which permanent bars or counters are located from which alcoholic beverages are served for consumption on the licensed premises shall pay, in addition to the license tax imposed in paragraphs (b)-(f), $1,000. However, such permanent bars or counters do not include service bars not accessible to the public or portable or temporary bars being used for a single occasion or event. A golf club licenseholder may operate service bars or portable or temporary bars on the grounds contiguous to its licensed premises and shall pay $100 for a certified copy of the club license, which shall be posted on the bar. The area contiguous to the licensed premises shall be considered an extension of the licensed premises upon payment of the fee, posting of the certified copy of the license, and notation of such extension upon the sketch accompanying the original license application. (2) An operator of railroads or sleeping cars, or a vendor in a railroad transit station, in this state may obtain a license to keep for sale and to sell the beverages mentioned in the Beverage Law upon the payment of an annual license tax of $2,500 to the division. A municipality or county may not require an additional license or levy a tax for the privilege of selling such beverages. (a) Operators of railroads or sleeping cars in this state are authorized to keep for sale and to sell all beverages mentioned in the Beverage Law for consumption upon any dining, club, parlor, buffet, or observation car of a passenger train in which certified copies of the licenses issued to the operators are posted. Certified copies of such licenses shall be issued by the division upon the payment of a $10 fee. A license for the sale of alcoholic beverages on a passenger train shall be good throughout the state. Except for alcoholic beverages sold within the licensed premises of a railroad transit station, it is unlawful for operators of interstate railroads and sleeping cars to purchase or sell any liquor on a passenger train except in miniature bottles of not more than 2 ounces. (b) A vendor in a railroad transit station is authorized to keep for sale and to sell all beverages mentioned in the Beverage Law. A license issued to a vendor in a railroad transit station may not be transferred to locations beyond the railroad transit station. The alcoholic beverages sold are for consumption on the licensed premises and may be consumed in all areas within the railroad transit station and on a passenger train. Operators of interstate railroads and sleeping cars shall keep separate the alcoholic beverages intended for sale on passenger trains and the alcoholic beverages intended for sale in the railroad transit station. (3)(a) Operators of steamships and steamship lines, buses and bus lines, or airplanes and airlines engaged in interstate or foreign commerce or plying between fixed terminals and upon fixed schedules in this state may obtain licenses to sell the beverages mentioned in the Beverage Law: 1. On steamships, buses, and airplanes operated by such operators, upon the payment of an annual license tax of $1,100; and 2. In no more than one passenger waiting lounge licensed by the division and operated by an airline licensed herein at each of its terminals in the state for ticketed passengers whose flights are scheduled to depart within 24 hours of service and guests in the company of such ticketholders, provided such licensed airline has first obtained an appropriate space lease or permit providing for payment of nondiscriminatory rental and concession fees and upon the payment of an additional license tax of $1,100 per lounge. All such license taxes shall be paid to the division. Such licenses shall authorize the holders thereof to keep for sale and sell all beverages mentioned in the Beverage Law upon any steamship, bus, or airplane or in any such airline passenger waiting lounge operated by such operators in this state, but such beverages may be sold only to passengers upon such steamships, buses, and airplanes and to ticketed passengers and their guests in such airline passenger waiting lounges and may be served only for consumption on such steamships, buses, and airplanes or in such airline passenger waiting lounges. It is unlawful for such licensees to purchase for resale any liquor except in miniature bottles of not more than 2 ounces or liquor in individual containers of not less than one-fifth of 1 gallon. Such sales are permitted while such steamships, buses, and airplanes are in transit; but such sales are not permitted on airplanes while such airplanes are in airports. Every such license shall be good throughout the state. No license may be required or tax levied by any municipality or county for the privilege of selling such beverages for consumption on such steamships, buses, or airplanes or in such airline passenger waiting lounges. The division shall issue a license to sell alcoholic beverages on steamships, buses, and airplanes to an operator of a steamship line, bus line, or airline, at a central location designated on the sworn application for license. The application for initial issuance of such a license must specify the number of steamships, buses, or airplanes in the fleet scheduled by the operator of the line for operation in this state. An application for renewal of such a license must specify the total number of steamships, buses, or airplanes in the fleet that operated in this state during the preceding license year. In addition to the annual license tax imposed under this subsection, a tax of $25 is imposed for each steamship, bus, or airplane which is disclosed on the application for license or renewal of license. Upon the payment of all applicable license taxes, each such steamship, bus, or airplane is considered a licensed premises under the Beverage Law. However, this paragraph does not apply to operators of pleasure, excursion, sightseeing, or charter boats not having regular round-trip runs of more than 100 miles in each direction; but operators of such boats may obtain licenses, with such boats being designated as their places of business, upon compliance with all the laws relating to vendors operating places of business where consumption on the premises is permitted. However, the operator of any pleasure, excursion, sightseeing, or charter boat which has a Coast Guard-approved capacity of at least 125 passengers may be granted a special liquor license to sell and serve alcoholic beverages to passengers during a period of no longer than 1 hour prior to departure on a scheduled or chartered cruise while the boat is docked at a docking facility or marina and the period during which the boat is in operation on the scheduled or chartered cruise for consumption on the premises only. The fee for such special license shall be the same as that charged pursuant to paragraphs (1)(b)-(f) based on the location of the home port of the boat. Also, no license to sell the beverages herein defined shall be issued to the operator of any boat which plies upon or is anchored upon the waters of any lake within this state. (b) Operators of railroads, sleeping cars, steamships, buses, and airplanes licensed under this section shall not be required to obtain their beverages from licensees under the Beverage Law, but such operators shall keep strict accounts of all such beverages sold within this state and shall make monthly reports to the division on the forms prepared and furnished by the division. Such operators are required to pay an excise tax for such beverages sold within this state as to which such excise tax has not theretofore been paid, equal to the tax assessed against manufacturers and distributors. Such operators shall pay such tax monthly to the division at the same time they furnish the reports hereinabove provided for. Such reports shall be filed on or before the 15th day of each month for sales for the previous calendar month. (4) Persons associated together as a chartered or incorporated club, including any social club incorporated by order of a circuit judge after its charter has been found to be for objects authorized by law and approved by the judge as organized for lawful purposes and not for the purpose of evading license taxes on dealers in beverages defined herein, which such organization is a bona fide club, and has been at the time of application for license hereunder in continuous active existence and operation for a period of not less than 2 years in the county where it exists, shall before serving or distributing to its members or nonresident guests the beverages defined herein, whether such service or distribution is made upon contribution to the club of money or by check or other device, pay an annual state license tax of $400. However, any golf club operated by or on behalf of any incorporated municipality in this state, and any veterans’ or fraternal organization of national scope, need not have been, or need not be, in continuous active existence or operation for any required period of time prior to an application for license hereunder. The payment of such club license tax shall authorize the service and distribution to members and nonresident guests of the club only, and such service and distribution to the members and nonresident guests shall not be deemed sales within the meaning of the law in this state; but any service or distribution to anyone other than a member or nonresident guest of such licensed club shall be deemed a sale, and any officer, member, or employee of any such licensed club who sells or distributes or serves any such beverages to any person other than a member or nonresident guest of such club for money or other value shall be deemed guilty of selling such beverages without a license and shall be punished as provided by law. The holders of a golf club license may sell alcoholic beverages to those other than members and their nonresident guests on days when the club is open to the public. For each such day of service to nonmembers, the club shall obtain from the division for a fee of $50 an extension of its license to permit such sales. Such license extensions shall be limited to one event per year, not to exceed 8 consecutive days. Any officer of any such club which has not paid such license who knowingly permits such service or distribution by such club of the beverages herein defined to members or nonresident guests of such club shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished as herein provided. However, this subsection does not apply to a club organized or used for the purpose of evading the payment of the license tax on vendors of such beverages; such club is subject to the payment of the license tax imposed by the Beverage Law upon vendors. The president, vice president, secretary, or treasurer, or officers of corresponding duties by any name they may be called, of any club required by this section to pay a license tax are required to see that such license tax is paid and, in default thereof, shall each be personally liable to the punishment provided by the Beverage Law for nonpayment of the license tax hereby required. Clubs which are not authorized to obtain licenses under this subsection or which do not obtain licenses under this subsection may, if they comply with this provision of the Beverage Law, obtain licenses as vendors. A club obtaining such club license shall not purchase any beverage herein defined from anyone other than a distributor or vendor licensed under the Beverage Law; nor shall such club dispense or serve any beverage defined herein unless such beverage has been purchased by such club from such licensed distributor or vendor; nor shall the club dispense or serve any such beverage on which a tax is required by the Beverage Law unless such beverage tax has been paid as required by that law. Such club license cannot be transferred in any manner whatsoever. (5) A caterer at a pari-mutuel facility licensed under chapter 550 may obtain a license upon the payment of an annual state license tax of $675. Such caterer’s license shall permit sales only within the enclosure in which pari-mutuel wagering is conducted under the authority of the Florida Gaming Control Commission. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, caterers licensed hereunder shall be treated as vendors licensed to sell by the drink the beverages mentioned herein and shall be subject to all the provisions hereof relating to such vendors. (6) A vendor who operates places of business where consumption on the premises is permitted, which premises are located within a theme park complex that is owned, managed, controlled, and operated by such vendor, may operate under a master license issued for the type of service offered if the theme park complex comprises at least 25 enclosed acres of land with permanent exhibitions and a variety of recreational activities, the enclosed area has a controlled entrance to, and exit from, the enclosed area, and at least 1 million visitors annually pay admission fees to the theme park complex. In addition to the license taxes imposed in paragraphs (1)(b)-(f), an additional tax of $1,500 shall be imposed for up to 5 additional bars, $2,500 for 6 to 10 additional bars, and $3,500 for more than 10 additional bars. The enclosed area within the theme park shall be considered an extension of the licensed premises upon the payment of the fee and the notation of such extension on the sketch accompanying the original license application. (7) A marine exhibition park complex may obtain, upon the payment of appropriate fees, a license for on-premises consumption of alcoholic beverages not subject to any quota or limitation if: (a) The marine exhibition park complex comprises at least 25 enclosed acres of land. (b) The enclosed area has a controlled entrance to, and exit from, the enclosed area. (c) At least 450,000 visitors annually pay admission fees to the marine exhibition park. (d) The marine exhibition park has been in continuous existence for at least 30 years. In addition to the license taxes imposed in paragraphs (1)(b)-(f), an additional tax of $1,500 shall be imposed for up to 5 additional bars, $2,500 for 6 to 10 additional bars, and $3,500 for more than 10 additional bars. The enclosed area within the marine exhibition park shall be considered the licensed premises upon the payment of the fee. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, entities licensed under this subsection shall be treated as vendors licensed to sell alcoholic beverages by the drink and shall be subject to all the provisions relating to such vendors. (8) A state-chartered legal entity not for profit organized principally for the purpose of supporting or managing the affairs of a symphony orchestra may obtain a license upon the payment of an annual license tax of $400. Such license shall permit sales only within the enclosure in which such symphony normally and regularly performs and in which alcoholic beverages are otherwise authorized; and such licensee shall be permitted to sell only during the hours in which the symphony premises are in use for a cultural event under the auspices or authorization of the licensee. The issuing of a license under this section is not subject to any quota or limitation, except that the license shall be issued only to an entity supporting a well-recognized symphony the reputation of which is known generally in the state or region of operation. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, entities licensed hereunder shall be treated as vendors licensed to sell by the drink the beverages mentioned herein and shall be subject to all the provisions hereof relating to such vendors.

(b) It is the finding of the Legislature that passenger vessels engaged exclusively in foreign commerce are susceptible to a distinct and separate classification for purposes of the sale of alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and other tobacco products under the Beverage Law and chapter 210. (c) Upon the filing of an application and payment of an annual fee of $1,100, the director is authorized to issue a permit authorizing the operator, or, if applicable, his or her concessionaire, of a passenger vessel which has cabin-berth capacity for at least 75 passengers, and which is engaged exclusively in foreign commerce, to sell alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and other tobacco products on the vessel for consumption on board only: 1. For no more than 24 hours before departure while the vessel is moored at a dock or wharf in a port of this state; or 2. At any time while the vessel is located in Florida territorial waters and is in transit to or from international waters. One such permit shall be required for each such vessel and shall name the vessel for which it is issued. No license shall be required or tax levied by any municipality or county for the privilege of selling beverages, cigarettes, or other tobacco products for consumption on board such vessels. The beverages, cigarettes, or other tobacco products so sold may be purchased outside the state by the permittee, and the same shall not be considered as imported for the purposes of s. 561.14(3) solely because of such sale. The permittee is not required to obtain its beverages, cigarettes, or other tobacco products from licensees under the Beverage Law or chapter 210. Each permittee shall keep a strict account of the quarterly capacity of each of its vessels and shall make quarterly reports to the division on forms prepared and furnished by the division. (d) Each permittee shall pay to the state a tax for beverages, cigarettes, and other tobacco products sold pursuant to this subsection in an amount equal to the base rate multiplied by the permittee’s quarterly capacity during the calendar quarter, less any tax or surcharge already paid by a licensed manufacturer or distributor pursuant to the Beverage Law or chapter 210 on beverages, cigarettes, and other tobacco products sold by the permittee pursuant to this subsection during the quarter for which tax is due.

One or more licensed craft distilleries sharing identical ownership. (b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Beverage Law, upon the payment of the appropriate fees, a craft distillery licensed in this state may be licensed as a vendor only for consumption on the premises of alcoholic beverages manufactured by other manufacturers and acquired through a distributor.

It is a violation of the prohibition in s. 562.11 to allow any person under the age of 21 to deliver alcoholic beverages on behalf of a vendor. The vendor or the agent or employee of the vendor must verify the age of the person making the delivery of the alcoholic beverage before allowing any person to take possession of an alcoholic beverage for the purpose of making a delivery on behalf of a vendor under this section. (2)(a) There shall not be sold at such places of business anything other than the beverages permitted, home bar and party supplies and equipment (including but not limited to glassware and party-type foods), cigarettes, and what is customarily sold in a restaurant. (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) do not apply to any vendor who has been issued, pursuant to local law, a special alcoholic beverage license for an entertainment or lodging complex; nor do they apply to any vendor who operates an establishment which is part of an international tourist attraction located within a special improvement district that is created by local law and that includes territory in more than one county. (3) The premises of all such vendors shall be subject to and meet all the applicable provisions of chapter 381 and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

It shall also include any applicant who directly purchases spirituous liquors from a manufacturer, rectifier, or bottler who represents that there is no primary American source of supply for the brand, and such applicant must petition the division for approval of licensure. (2) TAX CONTROL LICENSURE REQUIRED.—For purposes of tax revenue control, no person, firm, corporation, or other entity which is the primary American source of supply as defined herein may sell, offer for sale, accept orders for sale, ship, or cause to be shipped into this state any spirituous liquors to any distributor or importer within the state without having first obtained licensure as a primary American source of supply on forms provided by, and in such manner as prescribed by, the division. Applicants for licensure as a primary American source of supply shall be exempt from the requirements and qualification standards set forth in ss. 561.15 and 561.17. (3) LICENSE FEES.—Licensure as a primary American source of supply authorizes the shipment of distilled spirits manufactured within and without the state to licensed distributors, importers, manufacturers, bonded warehouses, and registered exporters within the state. The annual license fee for a primary American source of supply is $30 for each brand that requires a federal label approval and is scheduled for shipment to a licensed distributor or importer within this state for the purpose of being sold within the state. The annual license fee shall be submitted with the application for initial licensure. This license shall be renewed each year, and the renewal fee shall be $30 for each brand shipped into the state during the preceding year. (4) CERTAIN INTERSTATE AND FOREIGN SHIPMENTS PROHIBITED.—No holder of a distributor’s license or importer’s license as classified by s. 561.14(2) may ship or cause to be shipped into this state, or accept delivery of from another state or a foreign country, any spirituous liquors except directly from a primary American source of supply. (5) PRIVATE LABELS.—Nothing herein shall prohibit the ownership by vendors of brand names of distilled spirits and vinous beverages commonly known as private labels; provided, that such ownership and use thereof does not otherwise violate the Beverage Law. (6) RULEMAKING AUTHORITY.—The division shall promulgate rules as necessary to carry out the purpose of this section. History.—ss. 2, 3, ch. 78-135; s. 2, ch. 85-58; s. 11, ch. 96-419.
