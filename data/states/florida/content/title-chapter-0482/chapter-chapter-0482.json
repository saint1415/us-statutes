A certified operator in charge must be registered with the department pursuant to rules adopted pursuant to this section. A certified operator in charge may be in charge of one or more of all categories if she or he is certified for those categories. (b) A person may not be in charge of the performance of pest control activities of any category of a licensee unless she or he is certified for that category. (c) A certified operator may not be in charge of the performance of pest control activities at more than one business location for a licensee; however, the department shall prescribe by rule that, during the temporary absence of the certified operator currently registered in charge of a licensed business location, the licensee may, for a period not exceeding 30 days, designate another certified operator, certified in the same categories as the certified operator in charge, to be in charge of and responsible for performing those duties requiring the physical presence of a certified operator in charge. In any such case, the certified operator designated temporarily in charge and the licensee are jointly responsible for the pest control work performed and for compliance with other provisions of this chapter and of the rules adopted pursuant to this chapter. (7) The fee for the renewal of a certificate shall be set by the department but may not be more than $150 or less than $75; however, until rules setting these fees are adopted by the department, the issuance fee and the renewal fee shall each be $75. (8) A pest control operator’s certificate is not transferable to another person. (9) In the event of the loss of a certified operator in charge or other emergency, one or more emergency pest control certificates may be issued by the department, upon the request of the licensee, to one or more designated identification cardholders for a period of 30 days. The department may issue additional emergency certificates to one or more designated identification cardholders for periods not exceeding 30 days, for up to a maximum of 1 year. The sum of the periods for which emergency certificates are issued to the same licensee may not exceed 1 year during any 3-year period except in the event of the death of a certified operator in charge, in which case, additional emergency certificates may be issued for an extension of up to 120 days. The department shall collect $50 for each emergency certificate issued. Upon request by the department, the licensee shall submit interim reports at 30-day intervals containing documented evidence indicating specific actions being taken by the licensee to fill the vacancy created by the loss of a certified operator in charge. The department shall adopt rules and prescribe forms for this purpose; however, an emergency certificate may not be issued in the category of fumigation. (10) In order to renew a certificate, the certificateholder must complete 2 hours of approved continuing education on legislation, safety, pesticide labeling, and integrated pest management and 2 hours of approved continuing education in each category of her or his certificate or must pass an examination that the department shall provide in person and remotely through a third-party vendor. The third-party vendor may collect and retain a convenience fee. The department may not renew a certificate if the continuing education or examination requirement is not met. (a) Courses or programs, to be considered for credit, must include one or more of the following topics: 1. The law and rules of this state pertaining to pest control. 2. Precautions necessary to safeguard life, health, and property in the conducting of pest control and the application of pesticides. 3. Pests, their habits, recognition of the damage they cause, and identification of them by accepted common name. 4. Current accepted industry practices in the conducting of fumigation, termites and other wood-destroying organisms pest control, lawn and ornamental pest control, and household pest control. 5. How to read labels, a review of current state and federal laws on labeling, and a review of changes in or additions to labels used in pest control. 6. Integrated pest management. (b) The certificateholder must submit with her or his application for renewal a statement certifying that she or he has completed the required number of hours of continuing education. The statement must be on a form prescribed by the department and must identify at least the date, location, provider, and subject of the training and must provide such other information as required by the department. (c) The department shall charge the same fee for examination as provided in s. 482.141(2). (11) When a certified operator becomes a member of the Armed Forces of the United States on active duty, the renewal fee and continuing education requirements are waived while the individual remains on active duty as a member of the armed forces. If the individual is designated as the certified operator in charge and no other certified operator is available to be placed in charge, an emergency certificate may be granted without a time or fee requirement until the certified operator is no longer on active duty.

(3) Three years after a revocation, application may be made to the department for reinstatement; and the department may authorize reinstatement. (4) Any charge of a violation of this chapter or of the rules adopted pursuant to this chapter by a licensee affects only the license or permit of the business location from which the violation is alleged to have occurred. Another license or permit may not be issued to the same licensee, or to any person who has an ownership interest in the suspended or revoked business license of the licensee and who knew or should have known of the violation that resulted in the suspension or revocation, for a new business location in the same county or any contiguous county for a period of 3 years after the effective date of the suspension or revocation. (5) If, after appropriate hearing in accordance with chapter 120, the department finds that a licensee, certified operator, limited certificateholder, identification cardholder, or special identification cardholder has committed any act described in subsection (1), but further finds that such act is of such nature or occurred under such circumstances that suspension or revocation of the license, certificate, limited certificate, identification card, or special identification card would either be detrimental to the public or be unnecessarily harsh under the circumstances, it may, in lieu of executing the order of suspension or revocation, either: (a) Reprimand the party publicly or privately; or (b) Place the party on probation for a period of not more than 2 years. (6)(a) If the department finds that the terms of any such probation have been violated, it may revoke the probation order immediately; and its initial order takes effect.

In determining the amount of fine to be levied for a violation, the following factors shall be considered: (a) The severity of the violation, including the probability that the death, or serious harm to the health or safety, of any person will result or has resulted; the severity of the actual or potential harm; and the extent to which this chapter or the rules adopted pursuant to this chapter were violated; (b) Any actions taken by the licensee or certified operator in charge, or limited certificateholder, to correct the violation or to remedy complaints; (c) Any previous violations of this chapter or of the rules adopted pursuant to this chapter; and (d) The cost to the department of investigating the violation. (8) An administrative law judge may, in lieu of or in addition to imposition of a fine, recommend probation or public or private reprimand. A public reprimand must be made in a newspaper of general circulation in the county of the licensee. (9) The department shall publish quarterly a list of disciplinary actions taken pursuant to this section and shall provide such list to each licensee. (10) The department may require any licensee disciplined for a violation of s. 482.226 to submit to the department reports for wood-destroying organism inspections and treatments performed.

No local government or political subdivision of the state may enact or enforce an ordinance that regulates pest control, except that the preemption in this section does not prohibit a local government or political subdivision from enacting an ordinance regarding any of the following: (a) Local business taxes adopted pursuant to chapter 205. (b) Land development regulations adopted pursuant to chapter 163 which include regulation of any aspect of development, including a subdivision, building construction, sign regulation or any other regulation concerning the development of land, or landscaping or tree protection ordinances which do not include pesticide application restrictions. (c) Regulations that: 1. Require, for multicomplex dwellings in excess of 10 units, annual termite inspections for termite activity or damage, including Formosan termites, which must be performed by a person licensed under this chapter. 2. Require pest control treatments of structures that have termite activity or damage which must be performed by a person licensed under this chapter. 3. Require property owners or other persons to obtain inspections or pest control treatments performed by a person licensed under this chapter. An ordinance by a local government or political subdivision which requires an annual inspection or pest control treatment must conform to current law. (d) Protection of wellhead protection areas and high recharge areas. (e) Hazardous materials reporting as set forth in part II of chapter 252, storage, and containment including as relating to stormwater management. (f) Hazardous material unlawful discharge and disposal. (g) Hazardous materials remediation. (2) For the purposes of this section: (a) “Hazardous materials” shall be as defined in s. 403.74 and chapter 252. (b) “Wellhead protection area” means an area designated by local government to protect the groundwater source for a well intended for human consumption for a community water system and includes the surface and subsurface area surrounding such a potable water wellfield. The maximum boundaries of the wellfield shall be the zone of contribution and the minimum shall be 10 years’ travel time. Differing levels of protection may be established within the protection area zones based upon an evaluation of the risk to human health and the environment. Wellhead protection areas shall be delineated using such methods as reasonable or calculated fixed radii, simplified variable shapes, analytical methods, hydrogeological mapping, numerical flow or transport models, or other professionally accepted methodologies. (c) “High recharge area” means an area contributing a significant volume of water which adds to the storage of an aquifer through vertical flow. The term “significant” will vary geographically depending on the hydrologic characteristics of that aquifer. High recharge areas will receive higher protection than other areas due to their significance as current or future water use areas. (d) “Zone of contribution” means the area surrounding a well pumping water for human consumption that encompasses all areas or features that supply groundwater recharge to the well as determined by the relevant water management district or the local government.

(2) The council shall consist of 11 members as follows: a representative of the department; a citizen not involved in the conduct of pest control; a state university urban entomologist; and eight persons each holding a pest control operator’s certificate issued under s. 482.111, of whom two shall be actively involved in termite control, two shall be actively involved in general household pest control, two shall be actively involved in structural fumigation, and two shall be actively involved in lawn and landscape pest control. Each member shall be appointed for a term of 4 years and shall serve until a successor is appointed. (3) In conducting its meetings, the council shall use Robert’s Rules of Order. A majority of the members of the council constitutes a quorum for all purposes, and an act by a majority of such quorum at any meeting constitutes an official act of the council.
