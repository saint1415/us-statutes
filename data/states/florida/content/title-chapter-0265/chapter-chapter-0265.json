Each panel member shall be appointed to a 1-year term. Each panel shall consist of practicing artists or other professionals actively involved in the specific discipline or program for which the panel has been appointed. Each panel shall review and score grant applications and recommend to the council the applicants to which grants should be awarded. The panels shall submit lists of eligible applicants by score. The division shall adopt rules establishing a formula for such scoring. (2) The council and each panel shall provide a forum for public comment before voting on any grant application. (3) After the council reviews the lists of eligible applicants submitted by each review panel, it shall develop two lists, one of which must consist of eligible applicants for general program support funding and one of which must consist of eligible applicants for specific cultural project funding, and submit the lists to the secretary. The secretary shall review the council’s recommendations and, beginning July 1, 2010, include the lists of approved applicants in the department’s legislative budget request submitted to the Legislature. (4) Project grants shall be funded from the secretary’s approved list by score until all appropriated funds are depleted. If specific project grant funds are returned to the division, it shall award such funds to the next grant applicant on the secretary’s list of approved applicants. General program support grants shall be awarded to applicants on the secretary’s list in amounts determined by rule. (5) The division shall fund: (a) Grants for general program support for science museums, youth and children’s museums, historical museums, local arts agencies, state service organizations, and organizations that have cultural program activities in any of the art and cultural disciplines defined in s. 265.283. (b) Grants for specific cultural projects for arts in education, museums, Culture Builds Florida, or nonprofit public or private organizations having cultural project activity in any of the art and cultural disciplines. (c) Grants for a touring program that has a selection procedure that ensures the maximum opportunity for Florida artists and cultural groups. (d) An individual artist fellowship program. The division shall establish a selection procedure that identifies individual artists of exceptional talent and demonstrated ability and distribute grant appropriations as provided by rule. (e) Other programs consistent with the purpose of this act. (6) The division shall adopt rules establishing: (a) Eligibility criteria for the award of grants, which may include, but need not be limited to, application requirements, program quality, artistic quality, creativity, potential public exposure and benefit, the ability to properly administer grant funds, professional excellence, fiscal stability, state or regional impact, matching requirements, and other requirements to further the purposes of this act. (b) Particular grant programs, categories of grants, and procedures necessary for the prudent administration of the grant programs. (c) The panel review process, including, but not limited to, criteria for reviewing grant applications to ensure compliance with applicable federal and state law, including those related to discrimination and conflicts of interest. For the purposes of satisfying the nondiscrimination requirements of this section, each applicant must sign a certification form attesting to the fact that they are complying with all relevant antidiscrimination laws, including the anti-boycott rules of this state pursuant to ss. 215.4725 and 287.135, and will not engage in antisemitic discrimination as defined by s. 1.015, including refusals to deal based on an individual’s or entity’s real or perceived connection to the State of Israel, or engage in antisemitic speech as defined in s. 1.015, in conjunction with the program or project for which their grant is awarded. The division may not award any new grant that will, in whole or in part, inure to the personal benefit of any council or review panel member during the member’s term of office if the council or panel member participated in the vote of the council or panel recommending the award. This paragraph does not prohibit the division from awarding a grant to an entity with which a council or panel member is associated. (d) A grant applicant found to be engaging in any boycott action, antisemitic discrimination, or antisemitic speech in conjunction with the program or project for which the grant is awarded shall be disqualified from grant eligibility until 10 years after any such action has ceased. A grant recipient found to have engaged in a boycott of Israel or antisemitic discrimination during the duration of the project or program for which its grant was awarded shall be subject to a penalty payable to the State Treasury of three times the amount of the grant received for which the false certification was submitted. (e) If the Attorney General fails to pursue a cause of action within 90 days after a violation of paragraph (c), individuals have the right to file a written complaint to the Attorney General, who in turn will be required to provide a written response within 30 days after receipt of the complaint. (7) The division shall award grants: (a) To supplement the financial support of artistic and cultural activities and programs that, without the assistance, may otherwise be unavailable to Florida residents. (b) To activities and programs that have substantial artistic and cultural significance and emphasize creativity and professional excellence. (c) To activities and programs that meet the professional standards or standards of authenticity of significant merit, regardless of origin. (d) For other reasons consistent with this act. (8) Eligible grantees must: (a) Be a nonprofit, tax-exempt Florida corporation; or (b) A local or state governmental entity, school district, community college, college, university, agency of state government, or artist engaged in or concerned with arts and cultural activities. (9) In order to equitably distribute limited state funding, applicants may apply for and be awarded only one grant per annual grant cycle, except for cultural facilities, a cultural endowment, or touring program grants and individual artist fellowships. (10) Of the total amount of grant funds available from all sources for grants, except cultural facilities and cultural endowments, 70 percent shall be awarded on at least a dollar-to-dollar matching basis. Up to 50 percent of the grantee’s match may consist of in-kind funds. Up to 30 percent of all grant funds may be awarded on a nonmatching basis, including individual fellowships. (11) The division shall adopt rules to administer and implement this section.

It shall be remembered that each council member will be charged with the responsibility of serving the best interests of the arts in the county within the purposes of this act, and no council member shall view his or her role as that of representing any particular geographic area of the county, interest group, arts institution, community organization, or audience. No individual committed to, or owing allegiance to, any particular arts faction shall be eligible to serve on the council. (b)1. If a county is creating a council under the provisions of this act, the arts council shall consist of 15 members. Vacancies which exist on the council shall be filled by the board of county commissioners. However, in filling any vacancy which occurs, the board of county commissioners shall select the replacement council member from a list of three candidates to be submitted by the remaining members of the council. In the event that none of the three candidates suggested meets commission approval, the council shall submit another and entirely different list for commission consideration. This process shall continue until a suitable replacement has been found to fill the existing or anticipated vacancy. 2. The council shall make the general public aware of any vacancy which occurs, or which is expected, by complying with the notice and publication requirements established in paragraph (f). The council shall then consider suggestions or recommendations made by members of the public; representative civic, labor, and cultural associations; and groups concerned with encouraging the development and appreciation of the arts before submitting any list of candidates to the board of county commissioners. 3. There shall be an ex officio member who shall be a member of the board of county commissioners to be designated by it. The council may authorize additional ex officio members from any municipality within the county which it determines deserves representation, and any such member shall be designated by the city commission from its membership. The council may also authorize other ex officio members from the general public when such membership will serve the best interests of the arts and help carry out the objectives and duties of the council. (c) The term of office for each member shall be 4 years. All members of the council shall be qualified electors residing in the county. (d) No council member who serves two full terms shall be reappointed to the council during the 2-year period following expiration of his or her term.

(f) For purposes of this section, notice and publication requirements shall be deemed to have been met by daily advertisement in a newspaper, or in any of the electronic media, with countywide circulation or exposure for a period of 3 days at least 10 days prior to the taking of the intended action. (g) Council members may be removed for cause, and continued and unexcused absence shall constitute a form of, but not limit, such cause for removal.

The executive director may be empowered by the council to sign contracts, leases, and other agreements on its behalf. (5) POWERS OF THE COUNCIL.—Within the limit of funds available to it and the conditions set forth in this act, the council shall have all legal powers necessary and appropriate to effectuate its purposes and duties as set forth in this act and as enumerated in the bylaws of the council. The council shall adopt at the earliest possible opportunity a set of bylaws enumerating its purposes, duties, powers, and rules of organization and operation, which bylaws shall not be inconsistent with, or exceed the provisions of, this act. (6) BONDS AUTHORIZED.— (a) Upon resolution of the county commission approving such authority, each county arts council created pursuant to this act shall have the power to issue, refund, or take any other action with respect to revenue bonds to finance or refinance a capital project as part I of chapter 159 authorizes, insofar as the provisions of part I of chapter 159 are applicable. For the purposes of this act, the term “unit,” as defined in s. 159.02, shall be deemed to include any county fine arts council created pursuant to this act, and the term “governing body,” as defined in s. 159.02, shall be deemed to include any county fine arts council created pursuant to this act. (b) Bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall not constitute a debt of the county or any municipality therein or a pledge of the faith and credit of the county or any municipality therein, and a statement to that effect shall be recited on the face of the bonds. However, any county or municipality therein may, by express resolution, assume as its debt, or pledge its faith and credit as a guarantee of, the bonds of the county arts council if such bonds are issued to finance or refinance a capital project authorized by law and are approved by a vote of the electors.

(c) The council may establish such working committees of council members as it deems appropriate to carry out its objectives, duties, and powers. (d) The council may convene such advisory panels and may consult with such advisers and experts as it deems necessary and appropriate for carrying out its objectives, duties, and powers. (e) The council shall formulate and publish rules setting forth the criteria pursuant to which its financial aid is given and such other rules regarding its activities as it deems appropriate. (f) The county arts council may, from time to time and at any time, submit to the Florida Council on Arts and Culture a report summarizing its activities and setting forth any recommendations it considers appropriate, including recommendations with respect to present or proposed legislation concerning state encouragement and support of the arts. (8) ACT FOR PUBLIC PURPOSE; EFFECT ON EXISTING COUNCILS.— (a) This act, being for public purpose and for the welfare of the citizens of Florida, shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes hereof. (b) Nothing in this act shall affect the operation or structure of any existing arts council that provides service to any community or county and is so recognized by members of said community or county. Nonetheless, any existing council may be reorganized by resolution of the board of county commissioners into a public agency corporate and politic as provided in subsection (1); however, the council shall conform to the provisions of subsection (2) except as to number of appointed members. In such case, any and all prior enabling legislation pursuant to which said council was established shall be repealed and superseded by this act insofar as it is inconsistent with this act. Council members serving at the time of passage of the hereinbefore mentioned resolution may serve for the remaining portions of their terms. In the event that some council members are elected to their positions, those positions shall continue to be filled by election as they had been previously.
