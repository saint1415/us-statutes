(2)(a) The agency may issue bonds pursuant to this part which do not pledge the full faith and credit of the state in such principal amount as, in the opinion of the agency, is necessary to provide sufficient moneys for achieving its corporate purposes. (b) The bonds of the agency issued pursuant to this part, whether on original issuance or refunding, must be authorized by resolution of the agency after approval of the issuance of the bonds at a public hearing and may be either term or serial bonds; shall bear such date or dates; mature at such time or times; bear interest at such rate or rates; be payable semiannually; be in such denominations; be in such form, either coupon or fully registered; shall carry such registration, exchangeability, and interchangeability privileges; be payable in such medium of payment and at such place or places; be subject to such terms of redemption; and be entitled to such priorities on the revenues, rates, fees, rentals, or other charges or receipts of the agency, including any county gasoline tax funds received by the agency pursuant to the terms of any interlocal or lease-purchase agreement between the agency or a county, as such resolution or any resolution subsequent thereto may provide. The bonds must be executed by such officers as the agency determines under s. 279.06. (c) Such bonds shall be sold by the agency at public sale by competitive bid. However, if the agency, after receipt of a written recommendation from a financial adviser, determines by official action after public hearing by a two-thirds vote of all voting members of the agency that a negotiated sale of the bonds is in the best interest of the agency, the agency may negotiate for sale of the bonds with the underwriter or underwriters designated by the agency and the counties in which the agency exists. The agency shall provide specific findings in a resolution as to the reasons requiring the negotiated sale, which resolution shall incorporate and have attached thereto the written recommendation of the financial adviser required by this subsection. (d) Any such resolution or resolutions authorizing any bonds hereunder which do not pledge the full faith and credit of the state may contain provisions that are part of the contract with the holders of the bonds, as the agency determines proper. In addition, the agency may enter into trust indentures or other agreements with its fiscal agent, or with any bank or trust company within or without the state, as security for such bonds, and may, under the agreements, assign and pledge the revenues, rates, fees, rentals, tolls, or other charges or receipts of the agency, including any county gasoline tax funds received by the agency. (e) Any of the bonds issued pursuant to this part are negotiable instruments and have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the law merchant and the negotiable instruments law of the state. (f) Each project, building, or facility that has been or will be financed by the issuance of bonds or other evidence of indebtedness and that does not pledge the full faith and credit of the state under this part and any refinancing thereof is subject to review and approval by the Legislative Budget Commission.

In the event that the authority shall default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any of the bonds issued pursuant to the provisions of this part after such principal of or interest on the bonds shall have become due, whether at maturity or upon call for redemption, as provided in said resolution or indenture, or the lessee shall default in any payments under, or covenants made in, any lease-purchase agreement and such default shall continue for a period of 30 days, or in the event that the authority or the lessee shall fail or refuse to comply with the provisions of this part or any agreement made with, or for the benefit of, the holders of the bonds, the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the bonds then outstanding shall be entitled as of right to the appointment of a trustee to represent such bondholders for the purposes hereof; provided, however, that such holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the bonds then outstanding shall have first given written notice of their intention to appoint a trustee, to the authority and to such lessee. (2) Such trustee, and any trustee under any deed of trust, indenture or other agreement, may, and upon written request of the holders of 25 percent, or such other percentages as may be specified in any deed of trust, indenture or other agreement aforesaid, in principal amount of the bonds then outstanding, shall, in any court of competent jurisdiction, in his, her, or its own name: (a) By mandamus or other suit, action or proceeding at law, or in equity, enforce all rights of the bondholders, including the right to require the authority to fix, establish, maintain, collect and charge rates, fees, rentals, and other charges, adequate to carry out any agreement as to, or pledge of, the revenues, and to require the authority to carry out any other covenants and agreements with or for the benefit of the bondholders, and to perform its and their duties under this part. (b) By mandamus or other suit, action or proceeding at law, or in equity, enforce all rights of the bondholders under or pursuant to any lease-purchase agreement, including the right to require the lessee to make all rental payments required to be made by it under the provisions of any such lease-purchase agreement, whether from the Hillsborough County gasoline tax funds or other funds so agreed to be paid and to require the lessee to carry out any other covenants and agreements with or for the benefit of the bondholders and to perform its and their duties under this part. (c) Bring suit upon the bonds. (d) By action or suit in equity require the authority or any lessee under any lease-purchase agreement to account as if it were the trustee of an express trust for the bondholders. (e) By action or suit in equity enjoin any acts or things which may be unlawful or in violation of the rights of the bondholders. (3) Any trustee when appointed as aforesaid, or acting under a deed of trust, indenture or other agreement, and whether or not all bonds have been declared due and payable, shall be entitled as of right to the appointment of a receiver, who may enter upon and take possession of the system or the facilities or any part or parts thereof, the revenues and other pledged moneys and, subject to and in compliance with the provisions of any lease-purchase agreement, operate and maintain the same, for and on behalf of and in the name of, the authority, the lessee and the bondholders, and collect and receive all revenues and other pledged moneys in the same manner as the authority or the lessee might do, and shall deposit all such revenues and moneys in a separate account and apply the same in such manner as the court shall direct. In any suit, action or proceeding by the trustee, the fees, counsel fees, and expenses of the trustee, and said receiver, if any, and all costs and disbursements allowed by the court shall be a first charge on any revenues. Such trustee shall, in addition to the foregoing, have and possess all of the powers necessary or appropriate for the exercise of any functions specifically set forth herein or incident to the representation of the bondholders in the enforcement and protection of their rights. (4) Nothing in this section or any other section of this part shall authorize any receiver appointed pursuant hereto for the purpose, subject to and in compliance with the provisions of any lease-purchase agreement, of operating and maintaining the system or any facilities or part or parts thereof, to sell, assign, mortgage or otherwise dispose of any of the assets of whatever kind and character belonging to the authority. It is the intention of this part to limit the powers of such receiver, subject to and in compliance with the provisions of any lease-purchase agreement, to the operation and maintenance of the system, or any facility or part or parts thereof, as the court may direct, in the name and for and on behalf of the authority, the lessee and the bondholders, and no holder of bonds nor any trustee, shall ever have the right in any suit, action or proceeding at law, or in equity, to compel a receiver, nor shall any receiver be authorized or any court be empowered to direct the receiver, to sell, assign, mortgage or otherwise dispose of any assets of whatever kind or character belonging to the authority.
