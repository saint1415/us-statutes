Intent not to resume use may be inferred from circumstances. Nonuse for 3 consecutive years shall constitute prima facie evidence of abandonment. (b) When any course of conduct of the owner, including acts of omission or commission, causes the mark to lose its significance as a mark. (2) “Applicant” means the person filing an application for registration of a mark under this chapter and the legal representatives, successors, or assigns of such person. (3) “Certification mark” means any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, used by a person other than the owner of the mark to certify regional or other origin, material, mode of manufacture, quality, accuracy, or other characteristics of such person’s goods or services or that the work or labor on the goods or services was performed by members of a union or other organization. (4) “Collective mark” means a trademark or service mark used by the members of a cooperative, an association, or other collective group or organization, and includes marks used to indicate membership in a union, an association, or other organization. (5) “Department” means the Florida Department of State or its designee charged with the administration of this chapter.

(b) Likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception. (7) “Mark” includes any trademark, service mark, certification mark, or collective mark entitled to registration under this chapter, whether or not registered. (8) “Person,” and any other word or term used to designate the applicant or other party entitled to a benefit or privilege or rendered liable under the provisions of this chapter, means a juristic person as well as a natural person. “Juristic person” includes a firm, partnership, corporation, union, association, or other organization capable of suing and being sued in a court of law.

For purposes of this chapter, a mark is deemed to be in use: (a) On goods when: 1.

      "text": "495.021 Registrability.— (1) A mark by which the goods or services of any applicant for registration may be distinguished from the goods or services of others shall not be registered if it: (a) Consists of or comprises immoral, deceptive, or scandalous matter; (b) Consists of or comprises matter which may disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute; (c) Consists of or comprises the flag or coat of arms or other insignia of the United States, or of any state or municipality, or of any foreign nation, or any simulation thereof; (d) Consists of or comprises a name, signature, or portrait identifying a particular living individual, except by her or his written consent, or the name, signature, or portrait of a deceased President of the United States during the lifetime of his widow or her widower, if any, except by the written consent of the widow or widower; (e) Consists of a mark which: 1. When used on or in connection with the goods or services of the applicant, is merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them; 2. When used on or in connection with the goods or services of the applicant, is primarily geographically descriptive of them; 3. When used on or in connection with the goods or services of the applicant, is primarily geographically deceptively misdescriptive of them; 4. Is primarily merely a surname; or 5. Comprises any matter that, as a whole, is functional. Except as expressly excluded in subparagraphs 3. and 5., nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the registration of a mark used by the applicant which has become distinctive of the applicant’s goods or services. The department may accept as prima facie evidence that the mark has become distinctive, as used on or in connection with the applicant’s goods or services, proof of substantially exclusive and continuous use thereof as a mark by the applicant in this state or elsewhere for the 5 years before the date on which the claim of distinctiveness is made; or (f) Consists of or comprises a mark which so resembles a mark registered in this state or a mark or trade name previously used in this state by another and not abandoned, as to be likely, when applied to the goods or services of the applicant, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive. Registration shall not be denied solely on the basis of reservation or registration by another of a corporate name or fictitious name that is the same or similar to the mark for which registration is sought. (2) Subject to the provisions relating to the registration of trademarks and service marks, so far as they are applicable, collective and certification marks, including indications of regional origin, shall be registrable under this chapter, in the same manner and with the same effect as are trademarks and service marks, by persons, and nations, states, municipalities, and the like, exercising control over the use of the marks sought to be registered, even though not possessing an industrial or commercial establishment, and when registered they shall be entitled to the protection provided in this chapter in the case of trademarks and service marks. The Department of State may establish a separate register for such collective marks and certification marks.

(2) The applicant shall provide any additional pertinent information requested by the department, including a description of a design mark, and may make, or authorize the department to make, such amendments to the application as may be reasonably requested by the department or deemed by the applicant to be advisable to respond to any rejection or objection. (3) The department may require the applicant to disclaim an unregistrable component of a mark otherwise registrable, and an applicant may voluntarily disclaim a component of a mark sought to be registered. No disclaimer shall prejudice or affect the applicant’s or registrant’s rights then existing or thereafter arising in the disclaimed matter, or the applicant’s or registrant’s rights of registration on another application, if the disclaimed matter is or has become distinctive of the applicant’s or registrant’s goods or services. (4) Amendments may be made by the department upon the application submitted by the applicant upon the applicant’s agreement, or a new application may be required to be submitted. Amendments to an otherwise properly filed application shall not affect the application filing date for purposes of determining the applicant’s or registrant’s filing priority rights. (5) If the applicant is found not to be entitled to registration, the department shall advise the applicant of the rejection and of the reasons for rejection. The applicant shall have 3 months in which to reply or amend the application, in which event the application shall be reexamined. This procedure may be repeated until: (a) The department makes final its refusal to register the mark; or (b) The applicant fails to reply or amend the application within the specified period, whereupon the application shall be abandoned. For good cause shown, such as the pendency of litigation involving the mark, the department may extend the period of time in which to respond to the rejection or suspend examination of the application. (6) If the department makes final its refusal to register the mark, the applicant may seek review of such decision in accordance with ss. 120.569 and 120.57. (7) In the event of multiple applications concurrently being processed by the department which seek registration of the same or confusingly similar marks for the same or related goods or services, the department shall grant priority to the applications in order of receipt. If a prior-received application is granted a registration, the other application or applications shall then be rejected. The applicant of a rejected application may bring an action for cancellation of the registration upon grounds of prior or superior rights to the mark, in accordance with the provisions of s. 495.101(3).

In determining whether a mark is distinctive and famous, a court may consider factors, including, but not limited to: (a) The degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the mark in this state. (b) The duration and extent of use of the mark in connection with the goods and services with which the mark is used.

If such willful intent is proven, and the mark is registered in this state, the owner shall also be entitled to all remedies set forth in this chapter, subject to the discretion of the court and the principles of equity.
