In assessing profits the plaintiff shall be required to prove defendant’s sales only; defendant must prove all elements of cost or deduction claimed. In assessing damages the court may enter judgment, according to the circumstances of the case, for any sum above the amount found as actual damages, not exceeding three times such amount. If the court shall find that the amount of the recovery based on profits is either inadequate or excessive the court may in its discretion enter judgment for such sum as the court shall find to be just, according to the circumstances of the case. Such sum in either of the above circumstances shall constitute compensation and not a penalty.

In determining whether a mark is distinctive and famous, a court may consider factors, including, but not limited to:(a)The degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the mark in this state.(b)The duration and extent of use of the mark in connection with the goods and services with which the mark is used.(c)The duration and extent of advertising and publicity of the mark in this state.(d)The geographical extent of the trading area in which the mark is used.(e)The channels of trade for the goods or services with which the mark is used.(f)The degree of recognition of the mark in the trading areas and channels of trade in this state used by the mark’s owner and the person against whom the injunction is sought.(g)The nature and extent of use of the same or similar mark by third parties.(h)Whether the mark is the subject of a state registration in this state or a federal registration under the Federal Trademark Act of March 3, 1881, or the Federal Trademark Act of February 20, 1905, or a principal register registration under the Federal Trademark Act of July 5, 1946.(2)In an action brought under this section, the owner of a famous mark shall be entitled only to injunctive relief in this state unless the person against whom the injunctive relief is sought willfully intended to trade on the owner’s reputation or to cause dilution of the famous mark. If such willful intent is proven, and the mark is registered in this state, the owner shall also be entitled to all remedies set forth in this chapter, subject to the discretion of the court and the principles of equity.(3)The following shall not be actionable under this section:(a)Fair use of a famous mark by another person in comparative commercial advertising or promotion to identify the competing goods or services of the owner of the famous mark.(b)Noncommercial use of the mark.(c)All forms of news reporting and news commentary.History.—s. 1, ch. 67-58; s. 557, ch. 97-103; s. 17, ch. 2006-191.",
