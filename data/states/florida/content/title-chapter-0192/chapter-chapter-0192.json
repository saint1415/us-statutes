      "text": "192.0105 Taxpayer rights.—There is created a Florida Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights for property taxes and assessments to guarantee that the rights, privacy, and property of the taxpayers of this state are adequately safeguarded and protected during tax levy, assessment, collection, and enforcement processes administered under the revenue laws of this state. The Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights compiles, in one document, brief but comprehensive statements that summarize the rights and obligations of the property appraisers, tax collectors, clerks of the court, local governing boards, the Department of Revenue, and taxpayers. Additional rights afforded to payors of taxes and assessments imposed under the revenue laws of this state are provided in s. 213.015. The rights afforded taxpayers to assure that their privacy and property are safeguarded and protected during tax levy, assessment, and collection are available only insofar as they are implemented in other parts of the Florida Statutes or rules of the Department of Revenue. The rights so guaranteed to state taxpayers in the Florida Statutes and the departmental rules include: (1) THE RIGHT TO KNOW.— (a) The right to be sent a notice of proposed property taxes and proposed or adopted non-ad valorem assessments (see ss. 194.011(1), 200.065(2)(b) and (d) and (13)(a), and 200.069). The notice must also inform the taxpayer that the final tax bill may contain additional non-ad valorem assessments (see s. 200.069(9)). (b) The right to notification of a public hearing on each taxing authority’s tentative budget and proposed millage rate and advertisement of a public hearing to finalize the budget and adopt a millage rate (see s. 200.065(2)(c) and (d)). (c) The right to advertised notice of the amount by which the tentatively adopted millage rate results in taxes that exceed the previous year’s taxes (see s. 200.065(2)(d) and (3)). The right to notification of a comparison of the amount of the taxes to be levied from the proposed millage rate under the tentative budget change, compared to the previous year’s taxes, and also compared to the taxes that would be levied if no budget change is made (see ss. 200.065(2)(b) and 200.069(2), (3), (4), and (8)). (d) The right that the adopted millage rate will not exceed the tentatively adopted millage rate. If the tentative rate exceeds the proposed rate, each taxpayer shall be mailed notice comparing his or her taxes under the tentatively adopted millage rate to the taxes under the previously proposed rate, before a hearing to finalize the budget and adopt millage (see s. 200.065(2)(d)). (e) The right to be sent notice by first-class mail of a non-ad valorem assessment hearing at least 20 days before the hearing with pertinent information, including the total amount to be levied against each parcel. All affected property owners have the right to appear at the hearing and to file written objections with the local governing board (see s. 197.3632(4)(b) and (c) and (10)(b)2.b.). (f) The right of an exemption recipient to be sent a renewal application for that exemption, the right to a receipt for homestead exemption claim when filed, and the right to notice of denial of the exemption (see ss. 196.011(7), 196.131(1), 196.151, and 196.193(1)(c) and (5)). (g) The right, on property determined not to have been entitled to homestead exemption in a prior year, to notice of intent from the property appraiser to record notice of tax lien; information regarding why the taxpayer was not entitled to the exemption and how tax, penalties, and interest are calculated; and the right to pay tax, penalty, and interest before a tax lien is recorded for any prior year (see s. 196.161(1)(b)). (h) The right to be informed during the tax collection process, including: notice of tax due; notice of back taxes; notice of late taxes and assessments and consequences of nonpayment; opportunity to pay estimated taxes and non-ad valorem assessments when the tax roll will not be certified in time; notice when interest begins to accrue on delinquent provisional taxes; notice of the right to prepay estimated taxes by installment; a statement of the taxpayer’s estimated tax liability for use in making installment payments; and notice of right to defer taxes and non-ad valorem assessments on homestead property (see ss. 197.322(3), 197.3635, 197.343, 197.363(2)(c), 197.222(3) and (5), 197.2301(3), 197.3632(8)(a), 193.1145(10)(a), and 197.254(1)). (i) The right to an advertisement in a newspaper listing names of taxpayers who are delinquent in paying tangible personal property taxes, with amounts due, and giving notice that interest is accruing at 18 percent and that, unless taxes are paid, warrants will be issued, prior to petition made with the circuit court for an order to seize and sell property (see s. 197.402(2)). (j) The right to be sent a notice when a petition has been filed with the court for an order to seize and sell property and the right to be mailed notice, and to be served notice by the sheriff, before the date of sale, that application for tax deed has been made and property will be sold unless back taxes are paid (see ss. 197.413(5), 197.502(4)(a), and 197.522(1)(a) and (2)). (k) The right to have certain taxes and special assessments levied by special districts individually stated on the “Notice of Proposed Property Taxes and Proposed or Adopted Non-Ad Valorem Assessments” (see s. 200.069). Notwithstanding the right to information contained in this subsection, under s. 197.122 property owners are held to know that property taxes are due and payable annually and are charged with a duty to ascertain the amount of current and delinquent taxes and obtain the necessary information from the applicable governmental officials. (2) THE RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS.— (a) The right to an informal conference with the property appraiser to present facts the taxpayer considers to support changing the assessment and to have the property appraiser present facts supportive of the assessment upon proper request of any taxpayer who objects to the assessment placed on his or her property (see s. 194.011(2)). (b) The right to petition the value adjustment board over objections to assessments, denial of exemption, denial of agricultural classification, denial of historic classification, denial of high-water recharge classification, disapproval of tax deferral, and any penalties on deferred taxes imposed for incorrect information willfully filed. Payment of estimated taxes does not preclude the right of the taxpayer to challenge his or her assessment (see ss. 194.011(3), 196.011(7) and (10)(a), 196.151, 196.193(1)(c) and (5), 193.461(2), 193.503(7), 193.625(2), 197.2425, 197.301(2), and 197.2301(11)). (c) The right to file a petition for exemption or agricultural classification with the value adjustment board when an application deadline is missed, upon demonstration of particular extenuating circumstances for filing late (see ss. 193.461(3)(a) and 196.011(1), (8), (9), and (10)(e)). (d) The right to prior notice of the value adjustment board’s hearing date, the right to the hearing at the scheduled time, and the right to have the hearing rescheduled if the hearing is not commenced within a reasonable time, not to exceed 2 hours, after the scheduled time (see s. 194.032(2)). (e) The right to notice of date of certification of tax rolls and receipt of property record card if requested (see ss. 193.122(2) and (3) and 194.032(2)). (f) The right, in value adjustment board proceedings, to have all evidence presented and considered at a public hearing at the scheduled time, to be represented by a person specified in s. 194.034(1)(a), (b), or (c), to have witnesses sworn and cross-examined, and to examine property appraisers or evaluators employed by the board who present testimony (see ss. 194.034(1)(d) and (4), and 194.035(2)). (g) The right to be sent a timely written decision by the value adjustment board containing findings of fact and conclusions of law and reasons for upholding or overturning the determination of the property appraiser, and the right to advertised notice of all board actions, including appropriate narrative and column descriptions, in brief and nontechnical language (see ss. 194.034(2) and 194.037(3)). (h) The right at a public hearing on non-ad valorem assessments or municipal special assessments to provide written objections and to provide testimony to the local governing board (see ss. 197.3632(4)(c) and 170.08). (i) The right to bring action in circuit court to contest a tax assessment or appeal value adjustment board decisions to disapprove exemption or deny tax deferral (see ss. 194.036(1)(c) and (2), 194.171, 196.151, and 197.2425). (3) THE RIGHT TO REDRESS.— (a) The right to discounts for early payment on all taxes and non-ad valorem assessments collected by the tax collector, except for partial payments as defined in s. 197.374, the right to pay installment payments with discounts, and the right to pay delinquent personal property taxes under a payment program when implemented by the county tax collector (see ss. 197.162, 197.3632(8) and (10)(b)3., 197.222(1), and 197.4155). (b) The right, upon filing a challenge in circuit court and paying taxes admitted in good faith to be owing, to be issued a receipt and have suspended all procedures for the collection of taxes until the final disposition of the action (see s. 194.171(3)). (c) The right to have penalties reduced or waived upon a showing of good cause when a return is not intentionally filed late, and the right to pay interest at a reduced rate if the court finds that the amount of tax owed by the taxpayer is greater than the amount the taxpayer has in good faith admitted and paid (see ss. 193.072(4) and 194.192(2)). (d) The right to a refund when overpayment of taxes has been made under specified circumstances (see ss. 193.1145(8)(e) and 197.182(1)). (e) The right to an extension to file a tangible personal property tax return upon making proper and timely request (see s. 193.063). (f) The right to redeem real property and redeem tax certificates at any time before full payment for a tax deed is made to the clerk of the court, including documentary stamps and recording fees, and the right to have tax certificates canceled if sold where taxes had been paid or if other error makes it void or correctable. Property owners have the right to be free from contact by a certificateholder for 2 years after April 1 of the year the tax certificate is issued (see ss. 197.432(13) and (14), 197.442(1), 197.443, and 197.472(1) and (6)). (g) The right of the taxpayer, property appraiser, tax collector, or the department, as the prevailing party in a judicial or administrative action brought or maintained without the support of justiciable issues of fact or law, to recover all costs of the administrative or judicial action, including reasonable attorney’s fees, and of the department and the taxpayer to settle such claims through negotiations (see ss. 57.105 and 57.111). (4) THE RIGHT TO CONFIDENTIALITY.— (a) The right to have information kept confidential, including federal tax information, ad valorem tax returns, social security numbers, all financial records produced by the taxpayer, Form DR-219 returns for documentary stamp tax information, and sworn statements of gross income, copies of federal income tax returns for the prior year, wage and earnings statements (W-2 forms), and other documents (see ss. 192.105, 193.074, 193.114(5), 195.027(3) and (6), and 196.101(4)(c)). (b) The right to limiting access to a taxpayer’s records by a property appraiser, the Department of Revenue, and the Auditor General only to those instances in which it is determined that such records are necessary to determine either the classification or the value of taxable nonhomestead property (see s. 195.027(3)).

      "text": "192.032 Situs of property for assessment purposes.—All property shall be assessed according to its situs as follows: (1) Real property, in that county in which it is located and in that taxing jurisdiction in which it may be located. (2) All tangible personal property which is not immune under the state or federal constitutions from ad valorem taxation, in that county and taxing jurisdiction in which it is physically present on January 1 of each year unless such property has been physically present in another county of this state at any time during the preceding 12-month period, in which case the provisions of subsection (3) apply. Additionally, tangible personal property brought into the state after January 1 and before April 1 of any year shall be taxable for that year if the property appraiser has reason to believe that such property will be removed from the state prior to January 1 of the next succeeding year. However, tangible personal property physically present in the state on or after January 1 for temporary purposes only, which property is in the state for 30 days or less, shall not be subject to assessment. This subsection does not apply to goods in transit as described in subsection (4) or supersede the provisions of s. 193.085(4). (3) If more than one county of this state assesses the same tangible personal property in the same assessment year, resolution of such multicounty dispute shall be governed by the following provisions: (a) Tangible personal property which was physically present in one county of this state on January 1, but present in another county of this state at any time during the preceding year, shall be assessed in the county and taxing jurisdiction where it was habitually located or typically present. All tangible personal property which is removed from one county in this state to another county after January 1 of any year shall be subject to taxation for that year in the county where located on January 1; except that this subsection does not apply to tangible personal property located in a county on January 1 on a temporary or transitory basis if such property is included in the tax return being filed in the county in this state where such tangible personal property is habitually located or typically present. (b) For purposes of this subsection, an item of tangible personal property is “habitually located or typically present” in the county where it is generally kept for use or storage or where it is consistently returned for use or storage. For purposes of this subsection, an item of tangible personal property is located in a county on a “temporary or transitory basis” if it is located in that county for a short duration or limited utilization with an intention to remove it to another county where it is usually used or stored. (4)(a) Personal property manufactured or produced outside this state and brought into this state only for transshipment out of the United States, or manufactured or produced outside the United States and brought into this state for transshipment out of this state, for sale in the ordinary course of trade or business is considered goods-in-transit and shall not be deemed to have acquired a taxable situs within a county even though the property is temporarily halted or stored within the state. (b) The term “goods-in-transit” implies that the personal property manufactured or produced outside this state and brought into this state has not been diverted to domestic use and has not reached its final destination, which may be evidenced by the fact that the individual unit packaging device utilized in the shipping of the specific personal property has not been opened except for inspection, storage, or other process utilized in the transportation of the personal property. (c) Personal property transshipped into this state and subjected in this state to a subsequent manufacturing process or used in this state in the production of other personal property is not goods-in-transit. Breaking in bulk, labeling, packaging, relabeling, or repacking of such property solely for its inspection, storage, or transportation to its final destination outside the state shall not be considered to be a manufacturing process or the production of other personal property within the meaning of this subsection. However, such storage shall not exceed 180 days. (5)(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2), personal property used as a marine cargo container in the conduct of foreign or interstate commerce shall not be deemed to have acquired a taxable situs within a county when the property is temporarily halted or stored within the state for a period not exceeding 180 days. (b) “Marine cargo container” means a nondisposable receptacle which is of a permanent character, strong enough to be suitable for repeated use; which is specifically designed to facilitate the carriage of goods by one or more modes of transport, one of which shall be by ocean vessel, without intermediate reloading; and which is fitted with devices permitting its ready handling, particularly in the transfer from one transport mode to another. The term “marine cargo container” includes a container when carried on a chassis but does not include a vehicle or packaging. (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, tangible personal property used in traveling shows such as carnivals, ice shows, or circuses shall be deemed to be physically present or habitually located or typically present only to the extent the value of such property is multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days such property is present in Florida during the taxable year and the denominator of which is the number of days in the taxable year. However, railroad property of such traveling shows shall be taxable under s. 193.085(4)(b) and not under this section.

Each such taxing authority shall be billed an amount that bears the same proportion to the total amount of the budget as its share of ad valorem taxes bore to the total levied for the preceding year. All municipal and school district taxes shall be considered as taxes levied by the county for purposes of this computation. (b) Payments shall be made quarterly by each such taxing authority. The property appraiser shall notify the various taxing authorities of his or her estimated budget requirements and billings thereon at the same time as his or her budget request is submitted to the Department of Revenue pursuant to s. 195.087 and at the time the property appraiser receives final approval of the budget by the department. (2) The tax collectors of the several counties of the state shall be entitled to receive, upon the amount of all real and tangible personal property taxes and special assessments collected and remitted, the following commissions: (a) On the county tax: 1. Ten percent on the first $100,000; 2. Five percent on the next $100,000; 3. Three percent on the balance up to the amount of taxes collected and remitted on an assessed valuation of $50 million; and 4. Two percent on the balance. (b) On collections on behalf of each taxing district and special assessment district: 1.a. Three percent on the amount of taxes collected and remitted on an assessed valuation of $50 million; and b. Two percent on the balance; and 2. Actual costs of collection, not to exceed 2 percent, on the amount of special assessments collected and remitted. For the purposes of this subsection, the commissions on the amount of taxes collected from the nonvoted school millage, and on the amount of additional taxes that would be collected for school districts if the exemptions applicable to homestead property for school district taxation were the same as exemptions applicable for all other ad valorem taxation, shall be paid by the board of county commissioners. (3) In computing the amount of taxes levied on an assessed valuation of $50 million for the purposes of this section the valuation of nonexempt property and the taxes levied thereon shall be taken first. (4) The commissions for collecting taxes assessed for or levied by the state shall be audited, allowed, and paid by the Chief Financial Officer as other warrants are paid; and commissions for collecting the county taxes shall be audited and paid by the boards of county commissioners of the several counties of this state. The commissions for collecting all special school district taxes shall be audited by the school board of each respective district and taken out of the funds of the respective special school district under its control and allowed and paid to the tax collectors for collecting such taxes; and the commissions for collecting all other district taxes, whether special or not, shall be audited and paid by the governing board or commission having charge of the financial obligations of such district. All commissions for collecting special tax district taxes shall be paid at the time and in the manner now, or as may hereafter be, provided for the payment of the commissions for the collection of county taxes. All amounts paid as compensation to any tax collector under the provisions of this or any other law shall be a part of the general income or compensation of such officer for the year in which received, and nothing contained in this section shall be held or construed to affect or increase the maximum salary as now provided by law for any such officer. (5) The provisions of this section shall not apply to commissions on drainage district or drainage subdistrict taxes. (6) If any property appraiser or tax collector in the state is receiving compensation for expenses in conducting his or her office or by way of salary pursuant to any act of the Legislature other than the general law fixing compensation of property appraisers, such property appraiser or tax collector may file a declaration in writing with the board of county commissioners of his or her county electing to come under the provisions of this section, and thereupon such property appraiser or tax collector shall be paid compensation in accordance with the provisions hereof, and shall not be entitled to the benefit of the said special or local act. If such property appraiser or tax collector does not so elect, he or she shall continue to be paid such compensation as may now be provided by law for such property appraiser or tax collector.
