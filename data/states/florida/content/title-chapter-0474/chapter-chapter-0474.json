(3) The board has jurisdiction over a veterinarian practicing veterinary telehealth, regardless of where the veterinarian’s physical office is located. The practice of veterinary medicine is deemed to occur when the veterinarian, the patient, or both are located within this state at the time the veterinarian practices veterinary telehealth. (4) A veterinarian practicing veterinary telehealth: (a) May not engage in the practice of veterinary telehealth unless it is within the context of a veterinarian/client/patient relationship; (b) Shall practice in a manner consistent with his or her scope of practice and the prevailing professional standard of practice for a veterinarian who provides in-person veterinary services to patients in this state and shall employ sound, professional judgment to determine whether using veterinary telehealth is an appropriate method for delivering medical advice or treatment to the patient; (c) May use veterinary telehealth to perform an initial patient evaluation to establish the veterinarian/client/patient relationship if the evaluation is conducted using synchronous, audiovisual communication. The evaluation may not be performed using audio-only communications, text messaging, questionnaires, chatbots, or other similar means. If a veterinarian practicing telehealth conducts a patient evaluation sufficient to diagnose and treat the patient, the veterinarian is not required to research a patient’s medical history or conduct a physical examination of the patient before using veterinary telehealth to provide a veterinary health care service to the patient; (d) If the initial patient evaluation is performed using veterinary telehealth, must provide the client with a statement containing the veterinarian’s name, license number, and contact information and the contact information for at least one physical veterinary clinic in the vicinity of the patient’s location and instructions for how to receive patient follow-up care or assistance if the veterinarian and client are unable to communicate because of a technological or equipment failure or if there is an adverse reaction to treatment, and inform the client that, if medication is prescribed, the client may obtain a prescription that may be filled at the pharmacy of his or her choice. The veterinarian shall obtain from the client a signed and dated statement indicating the client has received the required information before practicing veterinary telehealth; (e) Shall prescribe all drugs and medications in accordance with all federal and state laws and the following requirements: 1. A veterinarian practicing veterinary telehealth may order, prescribe, or make available medicinal drugs or drugs specifically approved for use in animals by the United States Food and Drug Administration, the use of which conforms to the approved labeling. Prescriptions based solely on a telehealth evaluation may be issued for up to 1 month for products labeled solely for flea and tick control and up to 14 days of treatment for other animal drugs. Prescriptions based solely on a telehealth evaluation may not be renewed without an in-person examination. 2. A veterinarian practicing veterinary telehealth may not order, prescribe, or make available medicinal drugs or drugs as defined in s. 465.003 approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for human use or compounded antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, or antiparasitic medications, unless the veterinarian has conducted an in-person physical examination of the animal or made medically appropriate and timely visits to the premises where the animal is kept. 3. A veterinarian may not use veterinary telehealth to prescribe a controlled substance as defined in chapter 893 unless the veterinarian has conducted an in-person physical examination of the animal or made medically appropriate and timely visits within the past year to the premises where the animal is kept. 4. A veterinarian practicing veterinary telehealth may not prescribe a drug or other medication for use on a horse engaged in racing or training at a facility under the jurisdiction of the Florida Gaming Control Commission or on a horse that is a covered horse as defined in the federal Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act, 15 U.S.C. ss. 3051 et seq.; (f) Shall be familiar with available veterinary resources, including emergency resources, near the patient’s location and be able to provide the client with a list of nearby veterinarians who may be able to see the patient in person upon the request of the client; (g) Shall keep, maintain, and make available a summary of the patient record as provided in s. 474.2165; and (h) May not use veterinary telehealth to issue an international or interstate travel certificate or a certificate of veterinary inspection.

The licensing authority’s acceptance of a veterinarian’s relinquishment of a license, stipulation, consent order, or other settlement, offered in response to or in anticipation of the filing of administrative charges against the veterinarian’s license or authority to practice, shall be construed as action against the veterinarian’s license or authority to practice. (c) Being convicted or found guilty, regardless of adjudication, of a crime in any jurisdiction which directly relates to the practice of veterinary medicine or the ability to practice veterinary medicine. Any crime which demonstrates a lack of regard for animal life relates to the ability to practice veterinary medicine. In addition, crimes relating to the ability to practice veterinary medicine shall include, but not be limited to, crimes involving any violation of state or federal drug laws. (d) Making or filing a report or record which the licensee knows to be false, intentionally or negligently failing to file a report or record required by state or federal law, willfully impeding or obstructing such filing, or inducing another person to impede or obstruct such filing. Such reports or records shall include only those which are signed in the capacity of a licensed veterinarian. (e) Advertising goods or services in a manner which is fraudulent, false, deceptive, or misleading in form or content. (f) Violating any provision of this chapter or chapter 455, a rule of the board or department, or a lawful order of the board or department previously entered in a disciplinary hearing, or failing to comply with a lawfully issued subpoena of the department. (g) Practicing with a revoked, suspended, inactive, or delinquent license. (h) Being unable to practice veterinary medicine with reasonable skill or safety to patients by reason of illness, drunkenness, use of drugs, narcotics, chemicals, or any other material or substance or as a result of any mental or physical condition. In enforcing this paragraph, upon a finding by the secretary, the secretary’s designee, or the probable cause panel of the board that probable cause exists to believe that the licensee is unable to practice the profession because of the reasons stated in this paragraph, the department shall have the authority to compel a licensee to submit to a mental or physical examination by a physician designated by the department. If the licensee refuses to comply with the department’s order, the department may file a petition for enforcement in the circuit court of the circuit in which the licensee resides or does business. The licensee shall not be named or identified by initials in any other public court records or documents and the enforcement proceedings shall be closed to the public. The department shall be entitled to the summary procedure provided in s. 51.011. A licensee affected under this paragraph shall be afforded an opportunity at reasonable intervals to demonstrate that she or he can resume the competent practice for which she or he is licensed with reasonable skill and safety to patients. Neither the record of proceedings nor the orders entered by the board in any proceedings under this paragraph shall be used against a licensee in any other proceedings. (i) Judicially determined mental incompetency. However, a license suspended for this cause may be reinstated upon legal restoration of the competency of the individual whose license was so suspended. (j) Knowingly maintaining a professional connection or association with any person who is in violation of the provisions of this chapter or the rules of the board or department. However, if the licensee verifies that the person is actively participating in a board-approved program for the treatment of a physical or mental condition, the licensee is required only to report such person to the consultant. (k) Paying or receiving kickbacks, rebates, bonuses, or other remuneration for receiving a patient or client or for referring a patient or client to another provider of veterinary services or goods. (l) Performing or prescribing unnecessary or unauthorized treatment. (m) Fraud in the collection of fees from consumers or any person, agency, or organization paying fees to practitioners. (n) Attempting to restrict competition in the field of veterinary medicine other than for the protection of the public. However, this provision shall not apply to testimony made in good faith at a hearing or other proceeding in which the subject is the revocation of a license or a lesser penalty. (o) Fraud, deceit, negligence, incompetency, or misconduct, in or related to the practice of veterinary medicine. (p) Conviction on a charge of cruelty to animals. (q) Permitting or allowing another to use a veterinarian’s license for the purpose of treating or offering to treat animals. (r) Being guilty of incompetence or negligence by failing to practice medicine with that level of care, skill, and treatment which is recognized by a reasonably prudent veterinarian as being acceptable under similar conditions and circumstances. (s) Willfully making any misrepresentations in connection with the inspection of food for human consumption. (t) Fraudulently issuing or using any false health certificate, vaccination certificate, test chart, or other blank form used in the practice of veterinary medicine relating to the presence or absence of animal disease or transporting animals or issuing any false certificate relating to the sale of products of animal origin for human consumption. (u) Fraud or dishonesty in applying, treating, or reporting on tuberculin, diagnostic, or other biological tests. (v) Failing to keep the equipment and premises of the business establishment in a clean and sanitary condition, having a premises permit suspended or revoked pursuant to s. 474.215, or operating or managing premises that do not comply with requirements established by rule of the board.

(y) Using the privilege of ordering, prescribing, or making available medicinal drugs or drugs as defined in chapter 465, or controlled substances as defined in chapter 893, for use other than for the specific treatment of animal patients for which there is a documented veterinarian/client/patient relationship. Pursuant thereto, the veterinarian shall: 1. Have sufficient knowledge of the animal to initiate at least a general or preliminary diagnosis of the medical condition of the animal, which means that the veterinarian is personally acquainted with the keeping and caring of the animal and has recently seen the animal or has made medically appropriate and timely visits to the premises where the animal is kept. 2. Be available or provide for followup care and treatment in case of adverse reactions or failure of the regimen of therapy. 3. Maintain records which document patient visits, diagnosis, treatment, and other relevant information required under this chapter. (z) Providing, prescribing, ordering, or making available for human use medicinal drugs or drugs as defined in chapter 465, controlled substances as defined in chapter 893, or any material, chemical, or substance used exclusively for animal treatment. (aa) Failing to report to the department any person the licensee knows to be in violation of this chapter or of the rules of the department or board. However, if the licensee verifies that the person is actively participating in a board-approved program for the treatment of a physical or mental condition, the licensee is required only to report such person to the consultant. (bb) Violating any of the requirements of chapter 499, the Florida Drug and Cosmetic Act; 21 U.S.C. ss. 301-392, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; 21 U.S.C. ss. 821 et seq., the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, more commonly known as the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act; or chapter 893. (cc) Failing to provide adequate radiation safeguards. (dd) Failing to perform any statutory or legal obligation placed upon a licensee. (ee) Failing to keep contemporaneously written medical records as required by rule of the board. (ff) Prescribing or dispensing a legend drug as defined in chapter 499, including any controlled substance, inappropriately or in excessive or inappropriate quantities. (gg) Practicing or offering to practice beyond the scope permitted by law. (hh) Delegating professional responsibilities to a person when the licensee delegating such responsibilities knows or has reason to know that such person is not qualified by training, experience, or licensure to perform them. (ii) Presigning blank prescription forms. (jj) Failing to report to the board within 30 days, in writing, any action set forth in paragraph (b) that has been taken against the practitioner’s license to practice veterinary medicine by any jurisdiction, including any agency or subdivision thereof. (kk) Aiding or assisting another person in violating any provision of this chapter or any rule adopted pursuant thereto. (ll) Failing to respond within 60 days after receipt of a request to provide satisfactory proof of having participated in approved continuing education programs. (mm) Failing to maintain accurate records or reports as required by this chapter or by federal or state laws or rules pertaining to the storing, labeling, selling, dispensing, prescribing, and administering of controlled substances. (nn) Failing to report a change of address to the board within 60 days thereof. (oo) Failure of the responsible veterinarian to report a change of premises ownership or responsible veterinarian within 60 days thereof. (pp) Failing to give the owner of a patient, before dispensing any drug, a written prescription when requested. (2) When the board finds any applicant or veterinarian guilty of any of the grounds set forth in subsection (1), regardless of whether the violation occurred prior to licensure, it may enter an order imposing one or more of the following penalties: (a) Denial of certification for examination or licensure. (b) Revocation or suspension of a license. (c) Imposition of an administrative fine not to exceed $5,000 for each count or separate offense. (d) Issuance of a reprimand. (e) Placement of the veterinarian on probation for a period of time and subject to such conditions as the board may specify, including requiring the veterinarian to attend continuing education courses or to work under the supervision of another veterinarian. (f) Restricting the authorized scope of practice. (g) Imposition of costs of the investigation and prosecution. (h) Requiring the veterinarian to undergo remedial education. In determining appropriate action, the board must first consider those sanctions necessary to protect the public. Only after those sanctions have been imposed may the disciplining authority consider and include in its order requirements designed to rehabilitate the veterinarian. All costs associated with compliance with any order issued under this subsection are the obligation of the veterinarian. (3) The department shall reissue the license of a disciplined veterinarian upon certification by the board that the disciplined veterinarian has complied with all of the terms and conditions set forth in the final order and is capable of competently and safely engaging in the practice of veterinary medicine.

      "text": "474.215 Premises permits.— (1) Any establishment, permanent or mobile, where a licensed veterinarian practices must have a premises permit issued by the department. Upon application and payment of a fee not to exceed $250, as set by rule of the board, the department shall cause such establishment to be inspected. A premises permit shall be issued if the establishment meets minimum standards, to be adopted by rule of the board, as to sanitary conditions, recordkeeping, equipment, radiation monitoring, services required, and physical plant. (2) Each application for a premises permit shall set forth the name of the licensed veterinarian who will be responsible for the management of the establishment and the name and address of the owners of the establishment. (3) The premises permit may be revoked, suspended, or denied when inspection reveals that the establishment does not meet the standards set by rule or when the license of the responsible veterinarian has been suspended or revoked. (4) Any practitioner who provides veterinary service on a house-call basis and who does not maintain a veterinary establishment for receipt of patients shall not be required to obtain a premises permit, but must provide for minimum equipment and facilities as established by rule. (5) The department may issue a temporary premises permit to a responsible veterinarian who has submitted the application fee and a completed application form affirming compliance with the standards set by rule of the board. If the department inspects the establishment and discovers that it is not in compliance with the department’s standards, the department shall notify the veterinarian in writing of the deficiencies and shall provide 30 days for correction of the deficiencies and reinspection. Such temporary permit shall become void upon notification by the department that the establishment has failed, after reinspection, to meet those standards. Upon receipt of such notice, the responsible veterinarian shall close the establishment until completion of a subsequent inspection affirming that the required standards have been met and until another permit has been issued by the department. (6) Any practitioner who provides veterinary services solely to agricultural animals shall not be required to obtain a premises permit, but must provide for appropriate equipment and facilities, as established by rule. (7) The board by rule shall establish minimum standards for the operation of limited service veterinary medical practices. Such rules shall not restrict limited service veterinary medical practices and shall be consistent with the type of limited veterinary medical service provided. (a) Any person that offers or provides limited service veterinary medical practice shall obtain a biennial permit from the board the cost of which shall not exceed $250. The limited service permittee shall register each location where a limited service clinic is held and shall pay a fee set by rule not to exceed $25 to register each such location. (b) All permits issued under this subsection are subject to the provisions of ss. 474.213 and 474.214. (c) Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection to the contrary, any temporary rabies vaccination effort operated by a county health department in response to a public health threat, as declared by the State Health Officer in consultation with the State Veterinarian, is not subject to any preregistration, time limitation, or fee requirements, but must adhere to all other requirements for limited service veterinary medical practice as prescribed by rule. The fee charged to the public for a rabies vaccination administered during such temporary rabies vaccination effort may not exceed the actual cost of administering the rabies vaccine. Such rabies vaccination efforts may not be used for any purpose other than to address the public health consequences of the rabies outbreak. The board shall be immediately notified in writing of any temporary rabies vaccination effort operated under this paragraph. (8) Any person who is not a veterinarian licensed under this chapter but who desires to own and operate a veterinary medical establishment or limited service clinic shall apply to the board for a premises permit. If the board certifies that the applicant complies with the applicable laws and rules of the board, the department shall issue a premises permit. No permit shall be issued unless a licensed veterinarian is designated to undertake the professional supervision of the veterinary medical practice and the minimum standards set by rule of the board for premises where veterinary medicine is practiced. Upon application, the department shall submit the permittee’s name for a statewide criminal records correspondence check through the Department of Law Enforcement. The permittee shall notify the board within 10 days after any designation of a new licensed veterinarian responsible for such duties. A permittee under this subsection is subject to the provisions of subsection (9) and s. 474.214. (9)(a) The department or the board may deny, revoke, or suspend the permit of any permittee under this section and may fine, place on probation, or otherwise discipline any such permittee who has: 1. Obtained a permit by misrepresentation or fraud or through an error of the department or board; 2. Attempted to procure, or has procured, a permit for any other person by making, or causing to be made, any false representation; 3. Violated any of the requirements of this chapter or any rule of the board; or 4. Been convicted or found guilty of, or entered a plea of nolo contendere to, regardless of adjudication, a felony in any court of this state, of any other state, or of the United States. (b) If the permit is revoked or suspended, the owner, manager, or proprietor shall cease to operate the premises as a veterinary medical practice as of the effective date of the suspension or revocation. In the event of such revocation or suspension, the owner, manager, or proprietor shall remove from the premises all signs and symbols identifying the premises as a veterinary medical practice. The period of any such suspension shall be prescribed by rule of the board, but may not exceed 1 year. If the permit is revoked, the person owning or operating the establishment may not apply for a permit to operate a premises for a period of 1 year after the effective date of such revocation.
