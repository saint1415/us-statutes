An authority may issue such types of debentures as it may determine, including debentures on which the principal and interest are payable: (a) Exclusively from the income and revenues of the housing project financed with the proceeds of such debentures, or with such proceeds together with a grant from the Federal Government in aid of such project; (b) Exclusively from the income and revenues of certain designated housing projects whether or not they were financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of such debentures; or (c) From its revenues generally. Any of such debentures may be additionally secured by a pledge of any revenues of any housing project, projects or other property of the authority. (2) Neither the commissioners of an authority nor any person executing the debentures shall be liable personally on the debentures by reason of the issuance thereof. The debentures and other obligations of an authority, and such debentures and obligations shall so state on their face, shall not be a debt of the city, the county, the state or any political subdivision thereof, and neither the city or the county, nor the state or any political subdivision thereof shall be liable thereon, nor in any event shall such debentures or obligations be payable out of any funds or properties other than those of said authority. The debentures shall not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt or bond limitation or restriction.
