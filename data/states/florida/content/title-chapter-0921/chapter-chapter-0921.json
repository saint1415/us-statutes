      "text": "921.002 The Criminal Punishment Code.—The Criminal Punishment Code shall apply to all felony offenses, except capital felonies, committed on or after October 1, 1998. (1) The provision of criminal penalties and of limitations upon the application of such penalties is a matter of predominantly substantive law and, as such, is a matter properly addressed by the Legislature. The Legislature, in the exercise of its authority and responsibility to establish sentencing criteria, to provide for the imposition of criminal penalties, and to make the best use of state prisons so that violent criminal offenders are appropriately incarcerated, has determined that it is in the best interest of the state to develop, implement, and revise a sentencing policy. The Criminal Punishment Code embodies the principles that: (a) Sentencing is neutral with respect to race, gender, and social and economic status. (b) The primary purpose of sentencing is to punish the offender. Rehabilitation is a desired goal of the criminal justice system but is subordinate to the goal of punishment. (c) The penalty imposed is commensurate with the severity of the primary offense and the circumstances surrounding the primary offense. (d) The severity of the sentence increases with the length and nature of the offender’s prior record. (e) The sentence imposed by the sentencing judge reflects the length of actual time to be served, shortened only by the application of incentive and meritorious gain-time as provided by law, and may not be shortened if the defendant would consequently serve less than 85 percent of his or her term of imprisonment as provided in s. 944.275(4). The provisions of chapter 947, relating to parole, shall not apply to persons sentenced under the Criminal Punishment Code. (f) Departures below the lowest permissible sentence established by the code must be articulated in writing by the trial court judge and made only when circumstances or factors reasonably justify the mitigation of the sentence. The level of proof necessary to establish facts that support a departure from the lowest permissible sentence is a preponderance of the evidence. (g) The trial court judge may impose a sentence up to and including the statutory maximum for any offense, including an offense that is before the court due to a violation of probation or community control. (h) A sentence may be appealed on the basis that it departs from the Criminal Punishment Code only if the sentence is below the lowest permissible sentence or as enumerated in s. 924.06(1). (i) Use of incarcerative sanctions is prioritized toward offenders convicted of serious offenses and certain offenders who have long prior records, in order to maximize the finite capacities of state and local correctional facilities. (2) When a defendant is before the court for sentencing for more than one felony and the felonies were committed under more than one version or revision of the former sentencing guidelines or the code, each felony shall be sentenced under the guidelines or the code in effect at the time the particular felony was committed. This subsection does not apply to sentencing for any capital felony. (3) A court may impose a departure below the lowest permissible sentence based upon circumstances or factors that reasonably justify the mitigation of the sentence in accordance with s. 921.0026. The level of proof necessary to establish facts supporting the mitigation of a sentence is a preponderance of the evidence. When multiple reasons exist to support the mitigation, the mitigation shall be upheld when at least one circumstance or factor justifies the mitigation regardless of the presence of other circumstances or factors found not to justify mitigation. Any sentence imposed below the lowest permissible sentence must be explained in writing by the trial court judge. (4)(a) The Department of Corrections shall report on trends in sentencing practices and sentencing score thresholds and provide an analysis on the sentencing factors considered by the courts and shall submit this information to the Legislature by October 1 of each year. (b) The Criminal Justice Estimating Conference, with the assistance of the Department of Corrections, shall estimate the impact of any proposed change to the Criminal Punishment Code on future rates of incarceration and on the prison population. The Criminal Justice Estimating Conference shall base its projections on historical data concerning sentencing practices which have been accumulated by the Department of Corrections and other relevant data from other state agencies and records of the Department of Corrections which disclose the average time served for offenses covered by any proposed changes to the Criminal Punishment Code. (c) In order to produce projects that are either required by law or requested by the Legislature to assist the Legislature in making modifications to the Criminal Punishment Code, the Department of Corrections is authorized to collect and evaluate Criminal Punishment Code scoresheets from each of the judicial circuits after sentencing. Beginning in 1999, by October 1 of each year, the Department of Corrections shall provide an annual report to the Legislature that shows the rate of compliance of each judicial circuit in providing scoresheets to the department.

An offender may be sentenced to a nonstate prison sanction if the offender meets all of the following criteria: (a) The offender’s primary offense is a felony of the third degree. (b) The offender’s total sentence points score, as provided in s. 921.0024, is not more than 48 points, or the offender’s total sentence points score is 54 points and 6 of those points are for a violation of probation, community control, or other community supervision, and do not involve a new violation of law. (c) The offender has not been convicted or previously convicted of a forcible felony as defined in s. 776.08, but excluding any third degree felony violation under chapter 810. (d) The offender’s primary offense does not require a minimum mandatory sentence. (2) If the court elects to impose a sentence as provided in this section, the court shall sentence the offender to a term of probation, community control, or community supervision with mandatory participation in a prison diversion program of the Department of Corrections if such program is funded and exists in the judicial circuit in which the offender is sentenced. The prison diversion program shall be designed to meet the unique needs of each judicial circuit and of the offender population of that circuit. The program may require residential, nonresidential, or day-reporting requirements; substance abuse treatment; employment; restitution; academic or vocational opportunities; or community service work. (3) The court that sentences a defendant to a nonstate prison sanction pursuant to subsection (2) shall make written findings that the defendant meets the criteria in subsection (1); and the sentencing order must indicate that the offender was sentenced to the prison diversion program pursuant to subsection (2). The court may order the offender to pay all or a portion of the costs related to the prison diversion program if the court determines that the offender has the ability to pay.

      "text": "921.0026 Mitigating circumstances.—This section applies to any felony offense, except any capital felony, committed on or after October 1, 1998. (1) A downward departure from the lowest permissible sentence, as calculated according to the total sentence points pursuant to s. 921.0024, is prohibited unless there are circumstances or factors that reasonably justify the downward departure. Mitigating factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, those listed in subsection (2). The imposition of a sentence below the lowest permissible sentence is subject to appellate review under chapter 924, but the extent of downward departure is not subject to appellate review. (2) Mitigating circumstances under which a departure from the lowest permissible sentence is reasonably justified include, but are not limited to: (a) The departure results from a legitimate, uncoerced plea bargain. (b) The defendant was an accomplice to the offense and was a relatively minor participant in the criminal conduct. (c) The capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminal nature of the conduct or to conform that conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired. (d) The defendant requires specialized treatment for a mental disorder that is unrelated to substance abuse or addiction or for a physical disability, and the defendant is amenable to treatment. (e) The need for payment of restitution to the victim outweighs the need for a prison sentence. (f) The victim was an initiator, willing participant, aggressor, or provoker of the incident. (g) The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the domination of another person. (h) Before the identity of the defendant was determined, the victim was substantially compensated. (i) The defendant cooperated with the state to resolve the current offense or any other offense. (j) The offense was committed in an unsophisticated manner and was an isolated incident for which the defendant has shown remorse. (k) At the time of the offense the defendant was too young to appreciate the consequences of the offense. (l) The defendant is to be sentenced as a youthful offender. (m) The defendant’s offense is a nonviolent felony, the defendant’s Criminal Punishment Code scoresheet total sentence points under s. 921.0024 are 60 points or fewer, and the court determines that the defendant is amenable to the services of a postadjudicatory treatment-based drug court program and is otherwise qualified to participate in the program as part of the sentence. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “nonviolent felony” has the same meaning as provided in s. 948.08(6). (n) The defendant was making a good faith effort to obtain or provide medical assistance for an individual experiencing a drug-related overdose. (3) Except as provided in paragraph (2)(m), the defendant’s substance abuse or addiction, including intoxication at the time of the offense, is not a mitigating factor under subsection (2) and does not, under any circumstances, justify a downward departure from the permissible sentencing range.

Sentences of imprisonment for offenses not charged in the same indictment, information, or affidavit shall be served consecutively unless the court directs that two or more of the sentences be served concurrently. Any sentence for sexual battery as defined in chapter 794 or murder as defined in s. 782.04 must be imposed consecutively to any other sentence for sexual battery or murder which arose out of a separate criminal episode or transaction. (2) A county court or circuit court of this state may direct that the sentence imposed by such court be served concurrently with a sentence imposed by a court of another state or of the United States or, for purposes of this section, concurrently with a sentence to be imposed in another jurisdiction. In such case, the Department of Corrections may designate the correctional institution of the other jurisdiction as the place for reception and confinement of such person and may also designate the place in Florida for reception and confinement of such person in the event that confinement in the other jurisdiction terminates before the expiration of the Florida sentence. The sheriff shall forward commitment papers and other documents specified in s. 944.17 to the department. Upon imposing such a sentence, the court shall notify the Florida Commission on Offender Review as to the jurisdiction in which the sentence is to be served. Any prisoner so released to another jurisdiction shall be eligible for consideration for parole by the Florida Commission on Offender Review pursuant to chapter 947, except that the commission shall determine the presumptive parole release date and the effective parole release date by requesting such person’s file from the receiving jurisdiction. Upon receiving such records, the commission shall determine these release dates based on the relevant information in that file and shall give credit toward reduction of the Florida sentence for gain-time granted by the jurisdiction where the inmate is serving the sentence. The Florida Commission on Offender Review may concur with the parole release decision of the jurisdiction granting parole and accepting supervision. (3) A county court or circuit court of this state may not direct that the sentence imposed by such court be served coterminously with a sentence imposed by another court of this state or imposed by a court of another state.

If the offender does not receive a state prison sentence, the court may: (a) Impose a split sentence whereby the offender is to be placed on probation upon completion of any specified period of such sentence, which period may include a term of years or less. (b) Make any other disposition that is authorized by law. (c) Place the offender on probation with or without an adjudication of guilt pursuant to s. 948.01. (d) Impose a fine and probation pursuant to s. 948.011 when the offense is punishable by both a fine and imprisonment and probation is authorized. (e) Place the offender into community control requiring intensive supervision and surveillance pursuant to chapter 948. (f) Impose, as a condition of probation or community control, a period of treatment which shall be restricted to a county facility, a Department of Corrections probation and restitution center, a probation program drug punishment treatment community, or a community residential or nonresidential facility, excluding a community correctional center as defined in s. 944.026, which is owned and operated by any qualified public or private entity providing such services. Before admission to such a facility, the court shall obtain an individual assessment and recommendations on the appropriate treatment needs, which shall be considered by the court in ordering such placements. Placement in such a facility, except for a county residential probation facility, may not exceed 364 days. Placement in a county residential probation facility may not exceed 3 years. Early termination of placement may be recommended to the court, when appropriate, by the center supervisor, the supervising probation officer, or the probation program manager. (g) Sentence the offender pursuant to s. 922.051 to imprisonment in a county jail when a statute directs imprisonment in a state prison, if the offender’s cumulative sentence, whether from the same circuit or from separate circuits, is not more than 364 days. (h) Sentence the offender who is to be punished by imprisonment in a county jail to a jail in another county if there is no jail within the county suitable for such prisoner pursuant to s. 950.01. (i) Require the offender to participate in a work-release or educational or technical training program pursuant to s. 951.24 while serving a sentence in a county jail, if such a program is available. (j) Require the offender to perform a specified public service pursuant to s. 775.091. (k) Require the offender who violates chapter 893 or violates any law while under the influence of a controlled substance or alcohol to participate in a substance abuse program. (l)1. Require the offender who violates any criminal provision of chapter 893 to pay an additional assessment in an amount up to the amount of any fine imposed, pursuant to ss. 938.21 and 938.23. 2. Require the offender who violates any provision of s. 893.13 to pay an additional assessment in an amount of $100, pursuant to ss. 938.055 and 943.361. (m) Impose a split sentence whereby the offender is to be placed in a county jail or county work camp upon the completion of any specified term of community supervision. (n) Impose split probation whereby upon satisfactory completion of half the term of probation, the Department of Corrections may place the offender on administrative probation pursuant to s. 948.013 for the remainder of the term of supervision. (o) Require residence in a state probation and restitution center or private drug treatment program for offenders on community control or offenders who have violated conditions of probation. (p) Impose any other sanction which is provided within the community and approved as an intermediate sanction by the county public safety coordinating council as described in s. 951.26. (q) Impose, as a condition of community control, probation, or probation following incarceration, a requirement that an offender who has not obtained a high school diploma or high school equivalency diploma or who lacks basic or functional literacy skills, upon acceptance by an adult education program, make a good faith effort toward completion of such basic or functional literacy skills or high school equivalency diploma, as defined in s. 1003.435, in accordance with the assessed adult general education needs of the individual offender. (2) The court shall require an offender to make restitution under s. 775.089 unless the court finds clear and compelling reasons not to order such restitution. If the court does not order restitution, or orders restitution of only a portion of the damages, as provided in s. 775.089, the court shall state the reasons on the record in detail. An order requiring an offender to make restitution to a victim under s. 775.089 does not remove or diminish the requirement that the court order payment to the Crimes Compensation Trust Fund under chapter 960.

The full report shall include: (a) A complete description of the situation surrounding the criminal activity with which the offender has been charged, including a synopsis of the trial transcript, if one has been made; nature of the plea agreement including the number of counts waived, the pleas agreed upon, the sentence agreed upon, and additional terms of agreement; and, at the offender’s discretion, his or her version and explanation of the act. (b) The offender’s sentencing status, including whether the offender is a first offender, habitual offender, or youthful offender or is currently on probation. (c) The offender’s prior record of arrests and convictions. (d) The offender’s educational background. (e) The offender’s employment background, including any military record, his or her present employment status, and his or her occupational capabilities.

(i) The offender’s medical history and, as appropriate, a psychological or psychiatric evaluation. (j) Information about the environments to which the offender might return or to which the offender could be sent should a sentence of nonincarceration or community supervision be imposed by the court and consideration of the offender’s plan concerning employment supervision and treatment. (k) Information about any resources available to assist the offender, such as: 1. Treatment centers. 2. Residential facilities. 3. Vocational training programs. 4. Special education programs. 5. Services that may preclude or supplement commitment to the department. (l) The views of the person preparing the report as to the offender’s motivations and ambitions and an assessment of the offender’s explanations for his or her criminal activity. (m) An explanation of the offender’s criminal record, if any, including his or her version and explanation of any previous offenses. (n) A statement regarding the extent of the victim’s loss or injury. (o) A recommendation as to disposition by the court. It shall be the duty of the department to make a written determination as to the reasons for its recommendation. The department shall include an evaluation of the following factors: 1. The appropriateness or inappropriateness of community facilities, programs, or services for treatment or supervision. 2. The ability or inability of the department to provide an adequate level of supervision for the offender in the community and a statement of what constitutes an adequate level of supervision. 3. The existence of other treatment modalities which the offender could use but which do not exist at present in the community. If requested by the court, the department shall also provide to the court a summary report designed to expeditiously give the court information critical to its approval of any plea. The summary report shall include the information required by paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (j), (m), (n), and (o).

On examination at the sentencing hearing, the preparer of the report, if challenged on the issue of verification, shall bear the burden of explaining why it was not possible to verify the challenged information. (4) The nonconfidential portion of the presentence investigation shall constitute the basic classification and evaluation document of the Department of Corrections and shall contain a recommendation to the court on the treatment program most appropriate to the diagnosed needs of the offender, based upon the offender’s custody classification, rehabilitative requirements, and the utilization of treatment resources in proximity to the offender’s home environment.
