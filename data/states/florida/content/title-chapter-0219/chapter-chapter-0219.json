The receipt may be printed and registered by a cash register or validating machine, or may be by prenumbered license, or may be by prenumbered receipt blank. In addition to the foregoing alternative methods, any one or more of which may be used by the officer, he or she may use also any other form or method which will record collections of public money in a manner adequate for a proper postaudit. (2) It shall be the duty of each officer to keep safely all the public money collected by him or her. Each officer shall exercise all possible care for the protection of the public money in that officer’s custody, and all public money shall be kept separate in the depository and shall not be commingled with personal funds. (3) It shall be the duty of the several boards of county commissioners to provide suitable facilities, and adequate insurance, for the protection of the public money in the respective county offices; provided, that if it shall appear to an officer that the facilities or the insurance provided by the board of county commissioners are inadequate, that officer may provide the additional facilities and insurance found to be necessary, and may charge the cost thereof to the expense of his or her office.
