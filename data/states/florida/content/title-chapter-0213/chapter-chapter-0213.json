      "text": "213.0535 Registration Information Sharing and Exchange Program.— (1) The Registration Information Sharing and Exchange Program, or “RISE,” is established and shall be coordinated by the Department of Revenue. Periodically, each participant in the program shall share the tax administration information specified in this section in the format prescribed by the department. To the fullest extent practicable, the information 1 shall be shared in a computer-processable medium. (2) Information that is subject to sharing includes the registrant’s, licensee’s, or taxpayer’s name, mailing address, business location, and federal employer identification number or social security number; any applicable business type code; any applicable county code; and such other tax registration information as the department prescribes. (3) Each local government that participates in the program is responsible for transmitting its shared data to participating state agencies. Each state agency participating in the program is responsible for transmitting its shared data to the other participating state agencies and to the appropriate participating local governments. Data shall be transmitted within 20 days after the close of the reporting period. (4) There are two levels of participation: (a) Each unit of state or local government responsible for administering one or more of the provisions specified in subparagraphs 1.-8. is a level-one participant. Level-one participants shall exchange, monthly or quarterly, as determined jointly by each participant and the department, the data enumerated in subsection (2) for each new registrant, new filer, or initial reporter, permittee, or licensee, with respect to the following taxes, licenses, or permits: 1. The sales and use tax imposed under chapter 212. 2. The tourist development tax imposed under s. 125.0104. 3. The tourist impact tax imposed under s. 125.0108. 4. Local business taxes imposed under chapter 205. 5. Convention development taxes imposed under s. 212.0305. 6. Public lodging and food service establishment licenses issued pursuant to chapter 509. 7. Beverage law licenses issued pursuant to chapter 561. 8. A municipal resort tax as authorized under chapter 67-930, Laws of Florida. (b) Level-two participants include the Department of Revenue and local officials responsible for collecting the tourist development tax pursuant to s. 125.0104, the tourist impact tax pursuant to s. 125.0108, or a convention development tax pursuant to s. 212.0305, or a municipal resort tax as authorized under chapter 67-930, Laws of Florida. Level-two participants shall, in addition to the data shared by level-one participants, exchange data relating to tax payment history, audit assessments, and registration cancellations of dealers engaging in transient rentals, and such data may relate only to sales and use taxes, tourist development taxes, convention development taxes, and municipal resort tax. The department shall prescribe, by rule, the data elements to be shared and the frequency of sharing; however, audit assessments must be shared at least quarterly. (c) A level-two participant may disclose information as provided in paragraph (b) in response to a request for such information from any other level-two participant. Information relative to specific taxpayers shall be requested or disclosed under this paragraph only to the extent necessary in the administration of a tax or licensing provision as enumerated in paragraph (a). When a disclosure made under this paragraph involves confidential information provided to the participant by the Department of Revenue, the participant who provides the information shall maintain records of the disclosures, which records shall be subject to review by the Department of Revenue for a period of 5 years after the date of the disclosure. (5) A provision of law imposing confidentiality upon data shared under this section, including, but not limited to, a provision imposing penalties for disclosure, applies to recipients of this data and their employees. Data exchanged under this section may not be provided to a person or entity other than a person or entity administering the tax or licensing provisions of those provisions enumerated in paragraph (4)(a), and such data may not be used for any purpose other than for enforcing those tax or licensing provisions. This 2 subsection does not prevent a level-two participant from publishing statistics classified so as to prevent the identification of particular accounts, reports, declarations, or returns. However, statistics may not be published if they contain data pertaining to fewer than three taxpayers or if the statistics are prepared for geographic areas below the county level and contain data pertaining to fewer than 10 taxpayers. This subsection does not authorize the publishing of statistics that could be used to calculate the gross receipts or income of any individual taxpayer. Statistics may not be published under this section if a single taxpayer has remitted more than 33 percent of the tax that is the subject of the statistics. Statistics published under this subsection must relate only to tourist development taxes imposed under s. 125.0104, the tourist impact tax imposed under s. 125.0108, convention development taxes imposed under s. 212.0305, or the municipal resort tax authorized under chapter 67-930, Laws of Florida. This subsection does not prevent the Department of Revenue from meeting the requirements of s. 125.0104(3)(h). (6) In addition to data on new registrants, the information shared by level-one participants in the first month of the program shall include data for all active registrants, taxpayers, licensees, or permittees under the provisions of law enumerated in paragraph (4)(a).

Electronic transmission may be used only with the affirmative consent of the taxpayer or its representative. Documents sent pursuant to this section comply with the same timing and form requirements as documents sent by postal mail. If a document sent electronically is returned as undeliverable, the department must resend the document by postal mail. However, the original electronic transmission used with the affirmative consent of the taxpayer or its representative is the official mailing for purposes of this chapter. (2) A notice sent electronically will be considered to have been received by the recipient if the transmission is addressed to the address provided by the taxpayer or its representative. A notice sent electronically will be considered received even if no individual is aware of its receipt. In addition, a notice sent electronically shall be considered received if the department does not receive notification that the document was undeliverable. (3) For the purposes of this section, the term: (a) “Affirmative consent” means that the taxpayer or its representative expressly consented to receive notices electronically either in response to a clear and conspicuous request for the taxpayer’s or its representative’s consent, or at the taxpayer’s or its representative’s own initiative. (b) “Notice” means all communications from the department to the taxpayer or its representative, including, but not limited to, billings, notices issued during the course of an audit, proposed assessments, and final assessments authorized by this chapter and any other actions constituting final agency action within the meaning of chapter 120.

      "text": "213.21 Informal conferences; compromises.— (1)(a) The Department of Revenue may adopt rules for establishing informal conference procedures within the department for resolution of disputes relating to assessment of taxes, interest, and penalties and the denial of refunds, and for informal hearings under ss. 120.569 and 120.57(2). (b) The statute of limitations upon the issuance of final assessments and the period for filing a claim for refund as required by s. 215.26(2) for any transactions occurring during the audit period shall be tolled during the period in which the taxpayer is engaged in a procedure under this section. (c) During procedures under this section, the taxpayer has the right to be represented at the taxpayer’s cost and to record procedures electronically or manually at the taxpayer’s cost. (2)(a) The executive director of the department or his or her designee is authorized to enter into closing agreements with any taxpayer settling or compromising the taxpayer’s liability for any tax, interest, or penalty assessed under any of the chapters specified in s. 72.011(1). Such agreements must be in writing if the amount of tax, penalty, or interest compromised exceeds $30,000, or for lesser amounts, if the department deems it appropriate or if requested by the taxpayer. When a written closing agreement has been approved by the department and signed by the executive director or his or her designee and the taxpayer, it shall be final and conclusive; and, except upon a showing of fraud or misrepresentation of material fact or except as to adjustments pursuant to ss. 198.16 and 220.23, no additional assessment may be made by the department against the taxpayer for the tax, interest, or penalty specified in the closing agreement for the time period specified in the closing agreement, and the taxpayer is not entitled to institute any judicial or administrative proceeding to recover any tax, interest, or penalty paid pursuant to the closing agreement. The department is authorized to delegate to the executive director the authority to approve any such closing agreement resulting in a tax reduction of $500,000 or less. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), for the purpose of facilitating the settlement and distribution of an estate held by a personal representative, the executive director of the department may, on behalf of the state, agree upon the amount of taxes at any time due or to become due from such personal representative under the provisions of chapter 198; and payment in accordance with such agreement shall be full satisfaction of the taxes to which the agreement relates. (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), for the purpose of compromising the liability of any taxpayer for tax or interest on the grounds of doubt as to liability based on the taxpayer’s reasonable reliance on a written determination issued by the department as described in paragraph (3)(b), the department may compromise the amount of such tax or interest liability resulting from such reasonable reliance. (3)(a) A taxpayer’s liability for any tax or interest specified in s. 72.011(1) may be compromised by the department upon the grounds of doubt as to liability for or collectibility of such tax or interest. A taxpayer’s liability for interest under any of the chapters specified in s. 72.011(1) shall be settled or compromised in whole or in part whenever or to the extent that the department determines that the delay in the determination of the amount due is attributable to the action or inaction of the department. A taxpayer’s liability for penalties under any of the chapters specified in s. 72.011(1) may be settled or compromised if it is determined by the department that the noncompliance is due to reasonable cause and not to willful negligence, willful neglect, or fraud. The facts and circumstances are subject to de novo review to determine the existence of reasonable cause in any administrative proceeding or judicial action challenging an assessment of penalty under any of the chapters specified in s. 72.011(1). A taxpayer who establishes reasonable reliance on the written advice issued by the department to the taxpayer will be deemed to have shown reasonable cause for the noncompliance. In addition, a taxpayer’s liability for penalties under any of the chapters specified in s. 72.011(1) in excess of 25 percent of the tax shall be settled or compromised if the department determines that the noncompliance is due to reasonable cause and not to willful negligence, willful neglect, or fraud. The department shall maintain records of all compromises, and the records shall state the basis for the compromise. The records of compromise under this paragraph shall not be subject to disclosure pursuant to s. 119.07(1) and shall be considered confidential information governed by the provisions of s. 213.053. (b) Doubt as to liability of a taxpayer for tax and interest exists if the taxpayer demonstrates that he or she reasonably relied on a written determination of the department in any of the following circumstances: 1. The audit workpapers clearly show that the same issue was considered in a prior audit of the taxpayer conducted by or on behalf of the department and, after consideration of the issue, the department’s auditor determined that no assessment was appropriate in regard to that issue. 2. The same issue was raised in a prior audit of the taxpayer and, during the informal protest of the proposed assessment, the department issued a notice of decision withdrawing the issue from the assessment. 3. The taxpayer received a technical assistance advisement pursuant to s. 213.22 in regard to the issue. The circumstances listed in this paragraph are not intended to be the only circumstances in which doubt as to liability exists. Nothing contained in this section shall interfere with the state’s ability to structure a remedy to cure a judicially determined constitutional defect in a tax law. (c) A taxpayer shall not be deemed to have reasonably relied on a written determination of the department under any of the following circumstances: 1. The taxpayer misrepresented material facts or did not fully disclose material facts at the time the written determination was issued. 2. The specific facts and circumstances have changed in such a material manner that the written determination no longer applies. 3. The statutes or regulations on which the determination was based have been materially revised or a published judicial opinion constituting precedent in the taxpayer’s jurisdiction has overruled the department’s determination on the issue. 4. The department has informed the taxpayer in writing that its previous written determination has been revised and should no longer be relied upon. (d) A taxpayer’s liability for the service fee required by s. 215.34(2) may be settled or compromised if it is determined that the dishonored check, draft, or order was returned due to an unintentional error committed by the issuing financial institution, the taxpayer, or the department and the unintentional error is substantiated by the department. The department shall maintain records of all compromises, and the records shall state the basis for the compromise. (4) The department is authorized to enter into agreements for scheduling payments of taxes, interest, and penalties. (5) The department shall establish by rule guidelines and procedures for implementation of this section. (6) The Department of Revenue may modify the reporting or filing periods required for any tax enumerated in s. 213.05, for purposes of facilitating the calculation of penalty and interest due on tax payments made as a result of a taxpayer’s voluntary self-disclosure or the department’s selection of a taxpayer for self-analysis. Interest or penalty calculations may not be based on a filing period longer than 1 year. Modified reporting periods apply only to taxpayers not previously registered for the specific tax disclosed and to registered taxpayers with annual gross receipts of less than $500,000. Annual filing periods must be based on a calendar year or the fiscal year used for federal income tax reporting by the taxpayer. (7)(a) When a taxpayer voluntarily self-discloses a liability for tax to the department, the department may settle and compromise the tax and interest due under the voluntary self-disclosure to those amounts due for the 3 years immediately preceding the date that the taxpayer initially contacted the department concerning the voluntary self-disclosure. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “years” means tax years or calendar years, whichever is applicable to the tax that is voluntarily self-disclosed. A voluntary self-disclosure does not occur if the department has contacted or informed the taxpayer that the department is inquiring into the taxpayer’s liability for tax or whether the taxpayer is subject to tax in this state. (b) The department may further settle and compromise the tax and interest due under a voluntary self-disclosure when the department is able to determine that such further settlement and compromise is in the best interests of this state. When making this determination the department shall consider, but is not limited to, the following: 1. The amount of tax and interest that will be collected and compromised under the voluntary self-disclosure; 2. The financial ability of the taxpayer and the future outlook of the taxpayer’s business and the industry involved; 3. Whether the taxpayer has paid or will be paying other taxes to the state; 4. The future voluntary compliance of the taxpayer; and 5. Any other factor that the department considers relevant to this determination. (c) This subsection does not limit the department’s ability to enter into further settlement and compromise of the liability that is voluntarily self-disclosed based on any other provision of this section. (d) This subsection does not apply to a voluntary self-disclosure when the taxpayer collected, but failed to remit, the tax to the state. (8) In order to determine whether certified audits are an effective tool in the overall state tax collection effort, the executive director of the department or the executive director’s designee shall settle or compromise penalty liabilities of taxpayers who participate in the certified audits project. As further incentive for participating in the program, the department shall abate the first $25,000 of any interest liability and 25 percent of any interest due in excess of the first $25,000. A settlement or compromise of penalties or interest pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to the provisions of paragraph (3)(a), except for the requirement relating to confidentiality of records. The department may consider an additional compromise of tax or interest pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (3)(a). This subsection does not apply to any liability related to taxes collected but not remitted to the department. (9) A penalty for failing to collect a tax imposed by chapter 212 shall be settled or compromised upon payment of tax and interest if a taxpayer failed to collect the tax due to a good faith belief that tax was not due on the transaction and, because of that good faith belief, the taxpayer is now unable to charge and collect the tax from the taxpayer’s purchaser. The Department of Revenue shall adopt rules necessary to implement and administer this subsection, including rules establishing procedures and forms. (10)(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law and solely for the purpose of administering the taxes imposed by ss. 125.0104 and 125.0108 and chapter 212, except s. 212.0606, under the circumstances set forth in this subsection, the department shall settle or compromise a taxpayer’s liability for penalty without requiring the taxpayer to submit a written request for compromise or settlement. (b) For taxpayers who file returns and remit tax on a monthly basis: 1. Any penalty related to a noncompliant filing event shall be settled or compromised if the taxpayer has: a. No noncompliant filing event in the immediately preceding 12-month period and no unresolved liability under s. 125.0104, s. 125.0108, or chapter 212 resulting from a noncompliant filing event; or b. One noncompliant filing event in the immediately preceding 12-month period, resolution of the current noncompliant filing event through payment of tax and interest and the filing of a return within 30 days after notification by the department, and no unresolved liability under s. 125.0104, s. 125.0108, or chapter 212 resulting from a noncompliant filing event. 2. If a taxpayer has two or more noncompliant filing events in the immediately preceding 12-month period, the taxpayer shall be liable, absent a showing by the taxpayer that the noncompliant filing event was due to extraordinary circumstances, for the penalties provided in s. 125.0104 or s. 125.0108 and s. 212.12, including loss of collection allowance, and shall be reported to a credit bureau. (c) For taxpayers who file returns and remit tax on a quarterly basis, any penalty related to a noncompliant filing event shall be settled or compromised if the taxpayer has no noncompliant filing event in the immediately preceding 12-month period and no unresolved liability under s. 125.0104, s. 125.0108, or chapter 212 resulting from a noncompliant filing event. (d) For purposes of this subsection: 1. “Noncompliant filing event” means a failure to timely file a complete and accurate return required under s. 125.0104, s. 125.0108, or chapter 212 or a failure to timely pay the amount of tax reported on a return required by s. 125.0104, s. 125.0108, or chapter 212. 2. “Extraordinary circumstances” means the occurrence of events beyond the control of the taxpayer, such as, but not limited to, the death of the taxpayer, acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, fire, or other casualty, or the nonfeasance or misfeasance of the taxpayer’s employees or representatives responsible for compliance with s. 125.0104, s. 125.0108, or chapter 212. With respect to the acts of an employee or representative, the taxpayer must show that the principals of the business lacked actual knowledge of the noncompliance and that the noncompliance was resolved within 30 days after actual knowledge. 1 (11)(a) The department may consider a request to settle or compromise any tax, interest, penalty, or other liability under this section after the time to challenge an assessment or a denial of a refund under s. 72.011 has expired if the taxpayer demonstrates that the failure to initiate a timely challenge was due to any of the following: 1. The death or life-threatening injury or illness of: a. The taxpayer; b. An immediate family member of the taxpayer; or c. An individual with substantial responsibility for the management or control of the taxpayer. 2. An act of war or terrorism. 3. A natural disaster, fire, or other catastrophic loss. (b) The department may not consider a request received more than 180 days after the time has expired for contesting it under s. 72.011. (c) Any decision by the department regarding a taxpayer’s request to compromise or settle a liability under this subsection is not subject to review under chapter 120.

Technical assistance advisements shall have no precedential value except to the taxpayer who requests the advisement and then only for the specific transaction addressed in the technical assistance advisement, unless specifically stated otherwise in the advisement. Any modification of an advisement shall be prospective only. A technical assistance advisement is not an order issued pursuant to s. 120.565 or s. 120.569 or a rule or policy of general applicability under s. 120.54.

In furtherance of the agreement, the executive director of the department or his or her designee shall act jointly with other states that are members of the agreement to establish standards for certification of a certified service provider and certified automated system and establish performance standards for multistate sellers. (b) The executive director of the department or his or her designee shall take other actions reasonably required to administer this section. Other actions authorized by this section include, but are not limited to, the adoption of rules and the joint procurement, with other member states, of goods and services in furtherance of the cooperative agreement. (c) The executive director of the department or his or her designee may represent this state before the other states that are signatories to the agreement. (3) The executive director of the department may not enter into the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement unless the agreement requires each state to abide by the following requirements: (a) The agreement must set restrictions to limit, over time, the number of state tax rates. (b) The agreement must establish uniform standards for: 1. The sourcing of transactions to taxing jurisdictions. 2. The administration of exempt sales. 3. Sales and use tax returns and remittances. (c) The agreement must provide a central electronic registration system that allows a seller to register to collect and remit sales and use taxes for all signatory states. (d) The agreement must provide that registration with the central registration system and the collection of sales and use taxes in the signatory state will not be used as a factor in determining whether the seller has nexus with a state for any tax. (e) The agreement must provide for reduction of the burdens of complying with local sales and use taxes through: 1. Restricting variances between the state and local tax bases. 2. Requiring states to administer any sales and use taxes levied by local jurisdictions within the state so that sellers who collect and remit these taxes will not have to register or file returns with, remit funds to, or be subject to independent audits from local taxing jurisdictions. 3. Restricting the frequency of changes in the local sales and use tax rates and setting effective dates for the application of local jurisdictional boundary changes to local sales and use taxes. 4. Providing notice of changes in local sales and use tax rates and of local changes in the boundaries of local taxing jurisdictions. (f) The agreement must outline any monetary allowances that are to be provided by the states to sellers or certified service providers. The agreement must allow for a joint study by the public and private sectors, which must be completed by July 1, 2002, of the compliance cost to sellers and certified service providers of collecting sales and use taxes for state and local governments under various levels of complexity. (g) The agreement must require each state to certify compliance with the terms of the agreement before joining and to maintain compliance, under the laws of the member state, with all provisions of the agreement while a member. (h) The agreement must require each state to adopt a uniform policy for certified service providers which protects the privacy of consumers and maintains the confidentiality of tax information. (i) The agreement must provide for the appointment of an advisory council of private sector representatives and an advisory council of nonmember state representatives to consult within the administration of the agreement. (4) For the purposes of reviewing or amending the agreement to embody the simplification requirements as set forth in subsection (3), this state shall enter into multistate discussions. For purposes of such discussions, this state shall be represented by three delegates, one appointed by the President of the Senate, one appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the executive director of the department or his or her designee. (5) No provision of the agreement authorized by this section in whole or in part invalidates or amends any provision of the laws of this state. Adoption of the agreement by this state does not amend or modify any law of the state. Implementation of any condition of the agreement in this state, whether adopted before, at, or after membership of this state in the agreement, must be by the action of the state. (6) The agreement authorized by this section is an accord among individual cooperating sovereigns in furtherance of their governmental functions. The agreement provides a mechanism among the member states to establish and maintain a cooperative, simplified system for the application and administration of sales and use taxes under the duly adopted law of each member state. (7)(a) The agreement authorized by this act binds and inures only to the benefit of this state and the other member states. No person, other than a member state, is an intended beneficiary of the agreement. Any benefit to a person other than a state is established by the laws of this state and of other member states and not by the terms of the agreement. (b) Consistent with paragraph (a), no person has any cause of action or defense under the agreement or by virtue of this state’s approval of the agreement. No person may challenge, in any action brought under any provision of law, any action or inaction by any department, agency, or other instrumentality of this state, or of any political subdivision of this state, on the ground that the action or inaction is inconsistent with the agreement. (c) No law of this state, or the application thereof, may be declared invalid as to any person or circumstance on the ground that the provision or application is inconsistent with the agreement. (8)(a) A certified service provider is the agent of a seller with whom the certified service provider has contracted for the collection and remittance of sales and use taxes. As the seller’s agent, the certified service provider is liable for sales and use tax due each member state on all sales transactions it processes for the seller except as set out in this subsection. (b) A seller that contracts with a certified service provider is not liable to the state for sales or use tax due on transactions processed by the certified service provider unless the seller has misrepresented the type of items it sells or has committed fraud. In the absence of probable cause to believe that the seller has committed fraud or made a material misrepresentation, the seller is not subject to audit on the transactions processed by the certified service provider. A seller is subject to audit for transactions that have not been processed by the certified service provider. The member states acting jointly may perform a system check of the seller and review the seller’s procedures to determine if the certified service provider’s system is functioning properly and to determine the extent to which the seller’s transactions are being processed by the certified service provider. (c) A person that provides a certified automated system is responsible for the proper functioning of that system and is liable to the state for underpayments of tax attributable to errors in the functioning of the certified automated system. A seller that uses a certified automated system remains responsible and is liable to the state for reporting and remitting tax. (d) A seller that has a proprietary system for determining the amount of tax due on transactions and has signed an agreement establishing a performance standard for that system is liable for the failure of the system to meet the performance standard. (9) Disclosure of information necessary under this section must be pursuant to a written agreement between the executive director of the department or his or her designee and the certified service provider. The certified service provider is bound by the same requirements of confidentiality as the department. Breach of confidentiality is a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (10) On or before January 1 annually, the department shall provide recommendations to the President of the Senate, the Senate Minority Leader, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives for provisions to be adopted for inclusion within the system which are necessary to bring it into compliance with the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement.

It is further the intent of the Legislature that contracts not be used to supplant existing departmental staff or as an alternative to hiring staff when that would be more efficient. (2) Subject to appropriations by the Legislature, the Department of Revenue shall contract with certified public accountants to conduct an audit of any person who is subject to a Florida revenue law. Furthermore, the Department of Revenue may contract with a private firm to facilitate the securing of the services of certified public accountants, licensed outside this state, to conduct audits on persons who are subject to the revenue laws of this state and who are located outside the state. (3) Contracts for more than $25,000 but less than $50,000 shall be approved by the executive director of the Department of Revenue. Contracts for $50,000 or more must be approved by the head of the department. Contracts under this section shall be interpreted under Florida law, and any action for resolution of any dispute related to any such contract shall be brought under Florida law. Contracts may contain such other terms and conditions as the department deems appropriate under the circumstances, provided, no fee or any portion of a fee for audits contracted for pursuant to this section shall be based on the amount of tax assessed or collected as a result of the audit. (4) The department shall establish, by rule, procedures for the selection of certified public accounting firms wishing to enter into audit contracts pursuant to this section. Such procedures shall contain, but not be limited to, the development of a rating system that takes into account pertinent information, including the firms’ fee proposals, and rank such firms participating in the process, to determine which firms will receive audit contracts. (5) The department shall establish a training, certification, and review procedure that will ensure that audits performed pursuant to this section are of the highest quality. (6) Certified public accountants entering into such contracts must be in good standing under the laws of the state in which they are licensed. They shall be bound by the same confidentiality requirements and subject to the same penalties as the department under s. 213.053. Any return, return information, or documentation obtained from the Internal Revenue Service under an information-sharing agreement is confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution and shall not be divulged or disclosed in any manner by an officer or employee of the department to any certified public accountant under a contract authorized by this section, unless the department and the Internal Revenue Service mutually agree to such disclosure.

      "text": "213.285 Certified audits.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Certification program” means an instructional curriculum, examination, and process for certification, recertification, and revocation of certification of certified public accountants which is administered by an independent provider and which is officially approved by the department to ensure that a certified public accountant possesses the necessary skills and abilities to successfully perform an attestation engagement for tax compliance review in a certified audits project. (b) “Department” means the Department of Revenue. (c) “Participating taxpayer” means any person subject to the revenue laws administered by the department who enters into an engagement with a qualified practitioner for tax compliance review and who is approved by the department under the certified audits project. (d) “Qualified practitioner” means a certified public accountant who is licensed to practice in Florida and who has completed the certification program. (2)(a) The department is authorized to initiate a certified audits project to further enhance tax compliance reviews performed by qualified practitioners and to encourage taxpayers to hire qualified practitioners at their own expense to review and report on their tax compliance. The nature of certified audit work performed by qualified practitioners shall be agreed-upon procedures in which the department is the specified user of the resulting report. (b) As an incentive for taxpayers to incur the costs of a certified audit, the department shall compromise penalties and abate interest due on any tax liabilities revealed by a certified audit as provided in s. 213.21. This authority to compromise penalties or abate interest shall not apply to any liability for taxes that were collected by the participating taxpayer but that were not remitted to the department. (3) Any practitioner responsible for planning, directing, or conducting a certified audit or reporting on a participating taxpayer’s tax compliance in a certified audit must be a qualified practitioner. For the purposes of this subsection, a practitioner is considered responsible for: (a) “Planning” in a certified audit when performing work that involves determining the objectives, scope, and methodology of the certified audit, when establishing criteria to evaluate matters subject to the review as part of the certified audit, when gathering information used in planning the certified audit, or when coordinating the certified audit with the department. (b) “Directing” in a certified audit when the work involves supervising the efforts of others who are involved or when reviewing the work to determine whether it is properly accomplished and complete. (c) “Conducting” a certified audit when performing tests and procedures or field audit work necessary to accomplish the audit objectives in accordance with applicable standards. (d) “Reporting” on a participating taxpayer’s tax compliance in a certified audit when determining report contents and substance or reviewing reports for technical content and substance prior to issuance. (4)(a) The qualified practitioner shall notify the department of an engagement to perform a certified audit and shall provide the department with the information the department deems necessary to identify the taxpayer, to confirm that the taxpayer is not already under audit by the department, and to establish the basic nature of the taxpayer’s business and the taxpayer’s potential exposure to Florida revenue laws. The information provided in the notification shall include the taxpayer’s name, federal employer identification number or social security number, state tax account number, mailing address, business location, and the specific taxes and period proposed to be covered by the engagement for the certified audit. In addition, the notice shall include the name, address, identification number, contact person, and telephone number of the engaged firm. (b) If the taxpayer has not been issued a written notice of intent to conduct an audit, the taxpayer shall be a participating taxpayer and the department shall so advise the qualified practitioner in writing within 10 days after receipt of the engagement notice. However, the department may exclude a taxpayer from a certified audit or may limit the taxes or periods subject to the certified audit on the basis that the department has previously conducted an audit, that it is in the process of conducting an investigation or other examination of the taxpayer’s records, or for just cause determined solely by the department. (c) Notice of the qualification of a taxpayer for a certified audit shall toll the statute of limitations provided in s. 95.091 with respect to the taxpayer for the tax and periods covered by the engagement. (d) Within 30 days after receipt of the notice of qualification from the department, the qualified practitioner shall contact the department and submit a proposed audit plan and procedures for review and agreement by the department. The department may extend the time for submission of the plan and procedures for reasonable cause. The qualified practitioner shall initiate action to advise the department that amendment or modification of the plan and procedures is necessary in the event that the qualified practitioner’s inspection reveals that the taxpayer’s circumstances or exposure to the revenue laws is substantially different than as described in the engagement notice. (5) Upon the department’s designation of the agreed-upon procedures to be followed by the practitioner in the certified audit, the qualified practitioner shall perform the engagement and shall timely submit a completed report to the department. The report shall affirm completion of the agreed-upon procedures and shall provide any required disclosures. (6) The department shall review the report of the certified audit and shall accept it when it is determined to be complete. Once the report is accepted by the department, the department shall issue a notice of proposed assessment reflecting the determination of any additional liability reflected in the report and shall provide the taxpayer with all the normal payment, protest, and appeal rights with respect to the liability. In cases where the report indicates an overpayment has been made, the taxpayer shall submit a properly executed application for refund to the department. Otherwise, the certified audit report is a final and conclusive determination with respect to the tax and period covered. No additional assessment may be made by the department for the specific taxes and period referenced in the report, except upon a showing of fraud or misrepresentation of material facts and except for adjustments made under s. 198.16 or s. 220.23. This determination shall not prevent the department from collecting liabilities not covered by the report or from conducting an audit or investigation and making an assessment for additional tax, penalty, or interest for any tax or period not covered by the report. (7) To implement the certified audits project, the department shall have authority to adopt rules relating to: (a) The availability of the certification program required for participation in the project; (b) The requirements and basis for establishing just cause for approval or rejection of participation by taxpayers; (c) Procedures for assessment, collection, and payment of liabilities or refund of overpayments and provisions for taxpayers to obtain informal and formal review of certified audit results; (d) The nature, frequency, and basis for the department’s review of certified audits conducted by qualified practitioners, including the requirements for documentation, work-paper retention and access, and reporting; and (e) Requirements for conducting certified audits and for review of agreed-upon procedures.

Thereafter, any person notified may not transfer or make any other disposition of such credits, other personal property, or debts until the executive director or his or her designee consents to a transfer or disposition or until 60 days after the receipt of such notice. However, the credits, other personal property, or debts that exceed the delinquent amount stipulated in the notice are not subject to this section, wherever held, if the taxpayer does not have a prior history of tax delinquencies. If during the effective period of the notice to withhold, any person so notified makes any transfer or disposition of the property or debts required to be withheld under this section, he or she is liable to the state for any indebtedness owed to the department by the person with respect to whose obligation the notice was given to the extent of the value of the property or the amount of the debts thus transferred or paid if, solely by reason of such transfer or disposition, the state is unable to recover the indebtedness of the person with respect to whose obligation the notice was given. If the delinquent taxpayer contests the intended levy in circuit court or under chapter 120, the notice under this section remains effective until that final resolution of the contest. Any financial institution receiving such notice maintains a right of setoff for any transaction involving a debit card occurring on or before the date of receipt of such notice. (2) All persons who have been notified must, within 5 days after receipt of the notice, advise the executive director or his or her designee of the credits, other personal property, or debts in their possession, under their control, or owing them, and must advise the executive director or designee within 5 days after coming into possession or control of any subsequent credits, personal property, or debts owed during the time prescribed by the notice. Any such person coming into possession or control of such subsequent credits, personal property, or debts may not transfer or dispose of them during the time prescribed by the notice or before the department consents to a transfer. 1 (3) During the last 30 days of the 60-day period set forth in subsection (1), the executive director or his or her designee may levy upon such credits, other personal property, or debts. The levy must be accomplished by delivery of a notice of levy by registered mail, by personal service, or by electronic means, including, but not limited to, facsimile transmission or an electronic data exchange process using a web interface. Upon receipt of the notice of levy, the person possessing the credits, other personal property, or debts must transfer them to the department or pay to the department the amount owed to the delinquent taxpayer. (4) A notice that is delivered under this section is effective at the time of delivery against all credits, other personal property, or debts of the delinquent taxpayer which are not at the time of such notice subject to an attachment, garnishment, or execution issued through a judicial process. (5) Any person acting in accordance with the terms of the notice or levy issued by the executive director or his or her designee is expressly discharged from any obligation or liability to the delinquent taxpayer with respect to such credits, other personal property, or debts of the delinquent taxpayer affected by compliance with the notice of freeze or levy. 1 (6)(a) Levy may be made under subsection (3) upon credits, other personal property, or debt of any person with respect to any unpaid tax, penalties, interest, costs, surcharges, and fees authorized by law only after the executive director or his or her designee has notified such person in writing of the intention to make such levy. (b) No less than 30 days before the day of the levy, the notice of intent to levy required under paragraph (a) must be given in person or sent by certified or registered mail to the person’s last known address. (c) The notice required in paragraph (a) must include a brief statement that sets forth in simple and nontechnical terms: 1. The provisions of this section relating to levy and sale of property; 2. The procedures applicable to the levy under this section; 3. The administrative and judicial appeals available to the taxpayer with respect to such levy and sale, and the procedures relating to such appeals; and 4. Any alternatives available to taxpayers which could prevent levy on the property. (7) A taxpayer may contest the notice of intent to levy provided for under subsection (6) by filing an action in circuit court. Alternatively, the taxpayer may file a petition under the applicable provisions of chapter 120. After an action has been initiated under chapter 120 to contest the notice of intent to levy, an action relating to the same levy may not be filed by the taxpayer in circuit court, and judicial review is exclusively limited to appellate review pursuant to s. 120.68. Also, after an action has been initiated in circuit court, an action may not be brought under chapter 120. (8) An action may not be brought to contest a notice of intent to levy under chapter 120 or in circuit court, later than 21 days after the date of receipt of the notice of intent to levy. (9) The department shall provide notice to the Chief Financial Officer, in electronic or other form specified by the Chief Financial Officer, listing the taxpayers for which tax warrants are outstanding. Pursuant to subsection (1), the Chief Financial Officer shall, upon notice from the department, withhold all payments to any person or business, as defined in s. 212.02, which provides commodities or services to the state, leases real property to the state, or constructs a public building or public work for the state. The department may levy upon the withheld payments in accordance with subsection (3). The provisions of s. 215.422 do not apply from the date the notice is filed with the Chief Financial Officer until the date the department notifies the Chief Financial Officer of its consent to make payment to the person or 60 days after receipt of the department’s notice in accordance with subsection (1), whichever occurs earlier. (10) The department may bring an action in circuit court for an order compelling compliance with any notice issued under this section.

(2) The department shall issue to the taxpayer, with any jeopardy assessment, a notice or finding of the facts which constitute a jeopardy to the revenue. A warrant, lien, or other detainer of property may be issued and recorded as provided by law simultaneously with the issuance of a jeopardy assessment. Such warrant, lien, or detainer may proceed to execution, levy, and seizure as provided by law. However, the department shall not hold an execution sale or other sale of the property without order of a court of competent jurisdiction until the expiration of the time provided in s. 72.011 for filing an action in circuit court or petition for administrative proceeding or, if such an action or petition is filed, until the decision rendered in such action or proceeding is final. (3) The department shall also notify the taxpayer that the taxpayer shall have the opportunity to appear at a conference within 10 days and make an oral or written statement of why he or she believes no jeopardy to the revenue exists or why a jeopardy lien or warrant should be released, if one was recorded. Upon request of the taxpayer, the department shall meet with the taxpayer at a time set by the department within 10 days after the issuance of the assessment. (4) The conference shall be conducted informally and shall not be in the nature of a formal evidentiary proceeding. The taxpayer may present relevant information, orally or in writing; however, discovery and cross-examination shall not be allowed. The department shall not be required to transcribe the proceedings, but the taxpayer may transcribe the proceedings at the taxpayer’s cost. (5) If the taxpayer makes a statement under subsection (3), the department shall determine within 20 days after its receipt of such statement whether such jeopardy lien, warrant, or other detainer should be released. The department shall send written notice of such finding to the taxpayer. (6) If the department finds that the jeopardy lien, warrant, or other detainer should be released, the department shall release the subject property within a reasonable time. (7) If the department proceeds to seize or freeze the assets of a taxpayer upon a determination of jeopardy, the taxpayer shall have a right to a meeting with the department, as provided by subsection (3), immediately or within 24 hours after requesting such meeting. The department shall, within 24 hours after such meeting, determine whether to release the seizure or freeze. If the department does not release such seizure or freeze of property, the taxpayer shall have a right to request a hearing within 5 days before the circuit court, at which hearing the taxpayer and the department may present evidence with respect to the issue of jeopardy. Venue in such an action shall lie in the county in which the seizure was effected or, if there are multiple seizures based upon the same assessment, venue shall also lie in Leon County. Whenever an action is filed to seek review of a jeopardy finding under this subsection, the court shall set an immediate hearing and shall give the case priority over other pending cases other than those filed pursuant to s. 119.11.

Such certificate shall set forth a description of the property purchased, for whose taxes the same was sold, the name of the purchaser, and the price paid therefor. (2) In the case of any real property sold pursuant to a levy by the Department of Revenue, and not redeemed in the manner and within the time provided in s. 213.73, the executive director or his or her designee shall execute, in accordance with the laws of this state pertaining to the sale of real property under execution, to the purchaser of such real property at such sale, upon his or her surrender of the certificate of sale, a deed of the real property so purchased by that person, reciting the facts set forth in the certificate. (3) If real property is declared purchased for the state at a sale pursuant to a levy by the Department of Revenue, the executive director or his or her designee shall present a certificate of sale and execute a deed therefor to the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund, and the board of trustees shall, without delay, cause such deed to be duly recorded in the proper clerk’s office in the proper manner. (4) In all cases of sale of tangible or intangible personal property pursuant to a levy by the Department of Revenue, the certificate of sale shall be prima facie evidence of the right of the executive director or his or her designee to make such sale, and conclusive evidence of the regularity of his or her proceedings in making the sale, and shall transfer to the purchaser all right, title, and interest of the party delinquent in and to the property sold. If such property consists of intangibles such as stock and bonds, the certificate constitutes notice, when received, to any corporation, company, or association of such transfer, and constitutes authority to such corporation, company, or association to record the transfer on its books and records in the same manner as if the intangibles were transferred or assigned by the party holding the same, in lieu of any original or prior certificate, which shall be void, whether canceled or not. If the subject of the sale is securities or other evidences of debt, the certificate constitutes a good and valid receipt to the person holding the same, as against any person holding or claiming to hold possession of such securities or other evidences of debt. If such property consists of a motor vehicle, the certificate constitutes notice when received, to any public official charged with the registration of title of motor vehicles, of such transfer and constitutes authority to such official to record the transfer on his or her books and records in the same manner as if the certificate of title to such motor vehicle were transferred or assigned by the party holding the same, in lieu of any original or prior certificate of title, which shall be void whether canceled or not. (5) In the case of the sale of real property pursuant to a levy by the Department of Revenue, the deed of sale given pursuant to this section shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein; and if the proceedings by the executive director or his or her designee have been substantially in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the rules of the department, such deed constitutes a conveyance of all the right, title, and interest the party delinquent had in and to the real property thus sold at the time the lien of the Department of Revenue attached thereto.

(2)(a) In any action by a purchaser against a retailer, dealer, or vendor to obtain a refund of or to otherwise recover taxes, fees, or surcharges collected by the retailer, dealer, or vendor from the purchaser: 1. The purchaser in the action has the burden of proving all elements of its claim for a refund by clear and convincing evidence; 2. The sole remedy in the action is damages measured by the difference between what the retailer, dealer, or vendor collected as a tax, fee, or surcharge and what the retailer, dealer, or vendor paid to the taxing authority plus any discount or collection allowance authorized by law and taken by the retailer, dealer, or vendor; and 3. It is an affirmative defense to the action when the retailer, dealer, or vendor remitted the amount collected from the purchaser to the appropriate taxing authority, less any discount or collection allowance authorized by law.

      "text": "213.758 Transfer of tax liabilities.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Business” means any activity regularly engaged in by any person, or caused to be engaged in by any person, for the purpose of private or public gain, benefit, or advantage. The term does not include occasional or isolated sales or transactions involving property or services by a person who does not hold himself or herself out as engaged in business. A discrete division or portion of a business is not a separate business and must be aggregated with all other divisions or portions that constitute a business if the division or portion is not a separate legal entity. (b) “Financial institution” means a financial institution as defined in s. 655.005 and any person who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a financial institution as defined in s. 655.005. (c) “Insider” means: 1. Any person included within the meaning of insider as used in s. 726.102; or 2. A manager of, or a person who controls a transferor that is, a limited liability company or a relative as defined in s. 726.102 of any such persons. (d) “Involuntary transfer” means a transfer of a business, assets of a business, or stock of goods of a business made without the consent of the transferor, including, but not limited to, a transfer: 1. That occurs due to the foreclosure of a security interest issued to a person who is not an insider; 2. That results from an eminent domain or condemnation action; 3. Pursuant to chapter 61, chapter 702, or the United States Bankruptcy Code; 4. To a financial institution if the transfer is made to satisfy the transferor’s debt to the financial institution; or 5. To a third party to the extent that the proceeds are used to satisfy the transferor’s indebtedness to a financial institution. If the third party receives assets worth more than the indebtedness, the transfer of the excess may not be deemed an involuntary transfer. (e) “Stock of goods” means the inventory of a business held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. (f) “Tax” means any tax, interest, penalty, surcharge, or fee administered by the department pursuant to chapter 443 or any of the chapters specified in s. 213.05, excluding chapter 220, the corporate income tax code. (g) “Transfer” means every mode, direct or indirect, with or without consideration, of disposing of or parting with a business, assets of the business, or stock of goods of the business, and includes, but is not limited to, assigning, conveying, demising, gifting, granting, or selling, other than to customers in the ordinary course of business, to a transferee or to a group of transferees who are acting in concert. A business is considered transferred when there is a transfer of more than 50 percent of: 1. The business; 2. The assets of the business; or 3. The stock of goods of the business. (2) A taxpayer engaged in a business who is liable for any tax arising from the operation of that business and who quits the business without the benefit of a purchaser, successor, or assignee, or without transferring the business, assets of the business, or stock of goods of a business to a transferee, must file a final return for the business and make full payment of all taxes arising from the operation of that business within 15 days after quitting the business. The Department of Legal Affairs may seek an injunction at the request of the department to prevent further business activity of a taxpayer who fails to file a final return and make payment of the taxes associated with the operation of the business until such taxes are paid. A temporary injunction enjoining further business activity shall be granted by a circuit court if the department has provided at least 20 days’ prior written notice to the taxpayer. (3) A taxpayer who is liable for taxes with respect to a business who transfers the taxpayer’s business, assets of the business, or stock of goods of the business must file a final return and make full payment within 15 days after the date of transfer. (4)(a) A transferee, or a group of transferees acting in concert, of more than 50 percent of a business, assets of a business, or stock of goods of a business is liable for any unpaid tax owed by the transferor arising from the operation of that business unless: 1.a. The transferor provides a receipt or certificate of compliance from the department to the transferee showing that the transferor has not received a notice of audit and the transferor has filed all required tax returns and has paid all tax arising from the operation of the business identified on the returns filed; and b. There were no insiders in common between the transferor and the transferee at the time of the transfer; or 2. The department finds that the transferor is not liable for taxes, interest, or penalties after an audit of the transferor’s books and records. The audit may be requested by the transferee or the transferor and, if not done pursuant to the certified audit program under s. 213.285, must be completed by the department within 90 days after the records are made available to the department. The department may charge a fee for the cost of the audit if it has not issued a notice of intent to audit by the time the request for the audit is received. (b) A transferee may withhold a portion of the consideration for a business, assets of the business, or stock of goods of the business to pay the tax owed to the state by the transferor taxpayer arising from the operation of the business. The transferee shall pay the withheld consideration to the state within 30 days after the date of the transfer. If the consideration withheld is less than the transferor’s liability, the transferor remains liable for the deficiency. (c) The Department of Legal Affairs may seek an injunction at the request of the department to prevent further business activity of a transferee who is liable for unpaid tax of a transferor and who fails to pay or cause to be paid the transferee’s maximum liability for such tax due until such maximum liability for the tax is paid. A temporary injunction enjoining further business activity shall be granted by a circuit court if: 1. The assessment against the transferee is final and either: a. The time for filing a contest under s. 72.011 has expired; or b. Any contest filed pursuant to s. 72.011 resulted in a final and nonappealable judgment sustaining any part of the assessment; and 2. The department has provided at least 20 days’ prior written notice to the transferee of its intention to seek an injunction. (5) The transferee, or transferees acting in concert, of more than 50 percent of a business, assets of the business, or stock of goods of a business who are liable for any tax pursuant to this section shall be jointly and severally liable with the transferor for the payment of the tax owed to the state from the operation of the business by the transferor up to the transferee’s or transferees’ maximum liability for such tax due. (6) The maximum liability of a transferee pursuant to this section is equal to the fair market value of the business, assets of the business, or stock of goods of the business transferred to the transferee or the total purchase price paid by the transferee for the business, assets of the business, or stock of goods of the business, whichever is greater. (a) The fair market value must be determined net of any liens or liabilities, with the exception of liens or liabilities owed to insiders. (b) The total purchase price must be determined net of liens and liabilities against the assets, with the exception of: 1. Liens or liabilities owed to insiders. 2. Liens or liabilities assumed by the transferee that are not liens or liabilities owed to insiders. (7) After notice by the department of transferee liability under this section, the transferee has 60 days within which to file an action as provided in chapter 72. (8) This section does not impose liability on a transferee of a business, assets of a business, or stock of goods of a business when: (a) The transfer is pursuant to an involuntary transfer; or (b) The transferee is not an insider, and the asset transferred consists solely of a one- to four-family residential real property and furnishings and fixtures therein; real property that has not been improved with any building; or owner-occupied commercial real property; and, in each case, is not accompanied by a transfer of other assets of the business. (9) The department may adopt rules necessary to administer and enforce this section. History.—s. 8, ch. 2010-166; s. 1, ch. 2012-55; s. 3, ch. 2013-189; s. 14, ch. 2015-148.

      "text": "1(1)If a person is delinquent in the payment of any taxes, penalties, interest, costs, surcharges, and fees owed to the department, the executive director or his or her designee may give notice of the amount of such delinquency by registered mail, by personal service, or by electronic means, including, but not limited to, facsimile transmissions, electronic data interchange, or use of the Internet, to all persons having in their possession or under their control any credits or personal property, exclusive of wages, belonging to the delinquent taxpayer, or owing any debts to such delinquent taxpayer at the time of receipt by them of such notice. Thereafter, any person notified may not transfer or make any other disposition of such credits, other personal property, or debts until the executive director or his or her designee consents to a transfer or disposition or until 60 days after the receipt of such notice. However, the credits, other personal property, or debts that exceed the delinquent amount stipulated in the notice are not subject to this section, wherever held, if the taxpayer does not have a prior history of tax delinquencies. If during the effective period of the notice to withhold, any person so notified makes any transfer or disposition of the property or debts required to be withheld under this section, he or she is liable to the state for any indebtedness owed to the department by the person with respect to whose obligation the notice was given to the extent of the value of the property or the amount of the debts thus transferred or paid if, solely by reason of such transfer or disposition, the state is unable to recover the indebtedness of the person with respect to whose obligation the notice was given. If the delinquent taxpayer contests the intended levy in circuit court or under chapter 120, the notice under this section remains effective until that final resolution of the contest. Any financial institution receiving such notice maintains a right of setoff for any transaction involving a debit card occurring on or before the date of receipt of such notice.(2)All persons who have been notified must, within 5 days after receipt of the notice, advise the executive director or his or her designee of the credits, other personal property, or debts in their possession, under their control, or owing them, and must advise the executive director or designee within 5 days after coming into possession or control of any subsequent credits, personal property, or debts owed during the time prescribed by the notice.
