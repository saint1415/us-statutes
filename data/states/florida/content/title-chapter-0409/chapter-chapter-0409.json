      "text": "409.25656 Garnishment.— (1) If a person has a support obligation which is subject to enforcement by the department as the state Title IV-D program, the executive director or his or her designee may give notice of past due and/or overdue support by registered mail to all persons who have in their possession or under their control any credits or personal property, including wages, belonging to the support obligor, or owing any debts to the support obligor at the time of receipt by them of such notice. Thereafter, any person who has been notified may not transfer or make any other disposition, up to the amount provided for in the notice, of such credits, other personal property, or debts until the executive director or his or her designee consents to a transfer or disposition, or until 60 days after the receipt of such notice. If the obligor contests the intended levy in the circuit court or under chapter 120, the notice under this section shall remain in effect until final disposition of that circuit court or chapter 120 action. Any financial institution receiving such notice will maintain a right of setoff for any transaction involving a debit card occurring on or before the date of receipt of such notice. (2) Each person who is notified under this section must, within 5 days after receipt of the notice, advise the executive director or his or her designee of the credits, other personal property, or debts in their possession, under their control, or owed by them and must advise the executive director or designee within 5 days of coming into possession or control of any subsequent credits, personal property, or debts owed during the time prescribed by the notice. Any such person coming into possession or control of such subsequent credits, personal property, or debts shall not transfer or dispose of them during the time prescribed by the notice or until the department consents to a transfer. (3) During the last 30 days of the 60-day period set forth in subsection (1), the executive director or his or her designee may levy upon such credits, personal property, or debts. The levy must be accomplished by delivery of a notice of levy by registered mail, upon receipt of which the person possessing the credits, other personal property, or debts shall transfer them to the department or pay to the department the amount owed by the obligor. If the department levies upon securities and the value of the securities is less than the total amount of past due or overdue support, the person who possesses or controls the securities shall liquidate the securities in a commercially reasonable manner. After liquidation, the person shall transfer to the department the proceeds, less any applicable commissions or fees, or both, which are charged in the normal course of business. If the value of the securities exceeds the total amount of past due or overdue support, the obligor may, within 7 days after receipt of the department’s notice of levy, instruct the person who possesses or controls the securities which securities are to be sold to satisfy the obligation for past due or overdue support. If the obligor does not provide instructions for liquidation, the person who possesses or controls the securities shall liquidate the securities in a commercially reasonable manner in an amount sufficient to cover the obligation for past due or overdue support and any applicable commissions or fees, or both, which are charged in the normal course of business, beginning with the securities purchased most recently. After liquidation, the person who possesses or controls the securities shall transfer to the department the total amount of past due or overdue support. (4) A notice that is delivered under this section is effective at the time of delivery against all credits, other personal property, or debts of the obligor which are not at the time of such notice subject to an attachment, garnishment, or execution issued through a judicial process. Upon express written consent of a person who is or may be in possession of personal property belonging to the obligor, the department may deliver the notices required by this section to that person by secure electronic means. (5) The department is authorized to bring an action in circuit court for an order compelling compliance with any notice issued under this section. (6) Any person acting in accordance with the terms of the notice or levy issued by the executive director or his or her designee is expressly discharged from any obligation or liability to the obligor with respect to such credits, other personal property, or debts of the obligor affected by compliance with the notice of freeze or levy. (7)(a) Levy may be made under subsection (3) upon credits, other personal property, or debt of any person with respect to any past due or overdue support obligation only after the executive director or his or her designee has notified such person in writing of the intention to make such levy. (b) Not less than 30 days before the day of the levy, the notice of intent to levy required under paragraph (a) must be given in person or sent by certified or registered mail to the person’s last known address. (c) The notice required in paragraph (a) must include a brief statement that sets forth: 1. The provisions of this section relating to levy and sale of property; 2. The procedures applicable to the levy under this section; 3. The administrative and judicial appeals available to the obligor with respect to such levy and sale, and the procedures relating to such appeals; and 4. The alternatives, if any, available to the obligor which could prevent levy on the property. (d) The obligor may consent in writing to the levy at any time after receipt of a notice of intent to levy. (8) An obligor may contest the notice of intent to levy provided for under subsection (7) by filing a petition in the existing circuit court case. Alternatively, the obligor may file a petition under the applicable provisions of chapter 120. After an action has been initiated under chapter 120 to contest the notice of intent to levy, an action relating to the same levy may not be filed by the obligor in circuit court, and judicial review is exclusively limited to appellate review pursuant to s. 120.68. Also, after an action has been initiated in circuit court, an action may not be brought under chapter 120. (9) An action may not be brought to contest a notice of intent to levy under chapter 120 or in circuit court, later than 21 days after the date of receipt of the notice of intent to levy. (10) The department shall provide notice to the Chief Financial Officer, in electronic or other form specified by the Chief Financial Officer, listing the obligors for whom warrants are outstanding.

Thereafter, any person who has been notified may not transfer or make any other disposition, up to the amount provided for in the notice, of such credits, other personal property, or debts until the executive director or his or her designee consents to a transfer or disposition, or until 60 days after the receipt of such notice. If the obligor contests the intended levy in the circuit court or under chapter 120, the notice under this section shall remain in effect until final disposition of that circuit court or chapter 120 action.

The levy must be accomplished by delivery of a notice of levy by registered mail, upon receipt of which the person possessing the credits, other personal property, or debts shall transfer them to the department or pay to the department the amount owed by the obligor. If the department levies upon securities and the value of the securities is less than the total amount of past due or overdue support, the person who possesses or controls the securities shall liquidate the securities in a commercially reasonable manner. After liquidation, the person shall transfer to the department the proceeds, less any applicable commissions or fees, or both, which are charged in the normal course of business. If the value of the securities exceeds the total amount of past due or overdue support, the obligor may, within 7 days after receipt of the department’s notice of levy, instruct the person who possesses or controls the securities which securities are to be sold to satisfy the obligation for past due or overdue support. If the obligor does not provide instructions for liquidation, the person who possesses or controls the securities shall liquidate the securities in a commercially reasonable manner in an amount sufficient to cover the obligation for past due or overdue support and any applicable commissions or fees, or both, which are charged in the normal course of business, beginning with the securities purchased most recently. After liquidation, the person who possesses or controls the securities shall transfer to the department the total amount of past due or overdue support.(4)A notice that is delivered under this section is effective at the time of delivery against all credits, other personal property, or debts of the obligor which are not at the time of such notice subject to an attachment, garnishment, or execution issued through a judicial process. Upon express written consent of a person who is or may be in possession of personal property belonging to the obligor, the department may deliver the notices required by this section to that person by secure electronic means.(5)The department is authorized to bring an action in circuit court for an order compelling compliance with any notice issued under this section.(6)Any person acting in accordance with the terms of the notice or levy issued by the executive director or his or her designee is expressly discharged from any obligation or liability to the obligor with respect to such credits, other personal property, or debts of the obligor affected by compliance with the notice of freeze or levy.(7)(a)Levy may be made under subsection (3) upon credits, other personal property, or debt of any person with respect to any past due or overdue support obligation only after the executive director or his or her designee has notified such person in writing of the intention to make such levy.(b)Not less than 30 days before the day of the levy, the notice of intent to levy required under paragraph (a) must be given in person or sent by certified or registered mail to the person’s last known address.(c)The notice required in paragraph (a) must include a brief statement that sets forth:1.The provisions of this section relating to levy and sale of property;2.The procedures applicable to the levy under this section;3.The administrative and judicial appeals available to the obligor with respect to such levy and sale, and the procedures relating to such appeals; and4.The alternatives, if any, available to the obligor which could prevent levy on the property.(d)The obligor may consent in writing to the levy at any time after receipt of a notice of intent to levy.(8)An obligor may contest the notice of intent to levy provided for under subsection (7) by filing a petition in the existing circuit court case. Alternatively, the obligor may file a petition under the applicable provisions of chapter 120. After an action has been initiated under chapter 120 to contest the notice of intent to levy, an action relating to the same levy may not be filed by the obligor in circuit court, and judicial review is exclusively limited to appellate review pursuant to s. 120.68. Also, after an action has been initiated in circuit court, an action may not be brought under chapter 120.(9)An action may not be brought to contest a notice of intent to levy under chapter 120 or in circuit court, later than 21 days after the date of receipt of the notice of intent to levy.(10)The department shall provide notice to the Chief Financial Officer, in electronic or other form specified by the Chief Financial Officer, listing the obligors for whom warrants are outstanding. Pursuant to subsection (1), the Chief Financial Officer shall, upon notice from the department, withhold all payments to any obligor who provides commodities or services to the state, leases real property to the state, or constructs a public building or public work for the state. The department may levy upon the withheld payments in accordance with subsection (3). Section 215.422 does not apply from the date the notice is filed with the Chief Financial Officer until the date the department notifies the Chief Financial Officer of its consent to make payment to the person or 60 days after receipt of the department’s notice in accordance with subsection (1), whichever occurs earlier.(11)The Department of Revenue has the authority to adopt rules to implement this section.History.—s. 90, ch. 96-175; s. 12, ch. 96-189; s. 51, ch. 97-170; s. 15, ch. 99-375; ss. 34, 35, ch. 2001-158; s. 11, ch. 2002-173; s. 443, ch. 2003-261; s. 13, ch. 2004-334; s. 7, ch. 2021-103.",

      "text": "1 409.814 Eligibility.—A child who has not reached 19 years of age whose family income is equal to or below 300 percent of the federal poverty level is eligible for the Florida Kidcare program as provided in this section. If an enrolled individual is determined to be ineligible for coverage, he or she must be immediately disenrolled from the respective Florida Kidcare program component. (1) A child who is eligible for Medicaid coverage under s. 409.903 or s. 409.904 must be enrolled in Medicaid and is not eligible to receive health benefits under any other health benefits coverage authorized under the Florida Kidcare program. (2) A child who is not eligible for Medicaid, but who is eligible for the Florida Kidcare program, may obtain health benefits coverage under any of the other components listed in s. 409.813 if such coverage is approved and available in the county in which the child resides. (3) A Title XXI-funded child who is eligible for the Florida Kidcare program who is a child with special health care needs, as determined through a medical or behavioral screening instrument, is eligible for health benefits coverage from and shall be assigned to and may opt out of a plan under contract with the agency to serve children with special health care needs. (4) A Title XXI-funded child who reaches 19 years of age is eligible for continued Title XXI-funded coverage for the duration of a pregnancy and the postpartum period consisting of the 12-month period beginning on the last day of a pregnancy, if such pregnancy or postpartum period begins prior to the child reaching 19 years of age, and if the child is ineligible for Medicaid. (5) The following children are not eligible to receive Title XXI-funded premium assistance for health benefits coverage under the Florida Kidcare program, except under Medicaid if the child would have been eligible for Medicaid under s. 409.903 or s. 409.904 as of June 1, 1997: (a) A child who is covered under a family member’s group health benefit plan or under other private or employer health insurance coverage, if the cost of the child’s participation is not greater than 5 percent of the family’s income. If a child is otherwise eligible for a subsidy under the Florida Kidcare program and the cost of the child’s participation in the family member’s health insurance benefit plan is greater than 5 percent of the family’s income, the child may enroll in the appropriate subsidized Kidcare program. (b) A child who is seeking premium assistance for the Florida Kidcare program through employer-sponsored group coverage, if the child has been covered by the same employer’s group coverage during the 60 days before the family submitted an application for determination of eligibility under the program. (c) A child who is an alien but who does not meet the definition of a lawfully residing child. This paragraph does not extend eligibility for the Florida Kidcare program to an undocumented immigrant. (d) A child who is an inmate of a public institution or a patient in an institution for mental diseases. (e) A child who is otherwise eligible for premium assistance for the Florida Kidcare program and has had his or her coverage in an employer-sponsored or private health benefit plan voluntarily canceled in the last 60 days, except those children whose coverage was voluntarily canceled for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following circumstances: 1. The cost of participation in an employer-sponsored health benefit plan is greater than 5 percent of the family’s income; 2. The parent lost a job that provided an employer-sponsored health benefit plan for children; 3. The parent who had health benefits coverage for the child is deceased; 4. The child has a medical condition that, without medical care, would cause serious disability, loss of function, or death; 5. The employer of the parent canceled health benefits coverage for children; 6. The child’s health benefits coverage ended because the child reached the maximum lifetime coverage amount; 7. The child has exhausted coverage under a COBRA continuation provision; 8. The health benefits coverage does not cover the child’s health care needs; or 9. Domestic violence led to loss of coverage. (6) A child who is otherwise eligible for the Florida Kidcare program and who has a preexisting condition that prevents coverage under another insurance plan as described in paragraph (5)(a) which would have disqualified the child for the Florida Kidcare program if the child were able to enroll in the plan is eligible for Florida Kidcare coverage when enrollment is possible. (7) A child whose family income is above 300 percent of the federal poverty level or a child who is excluded under subsection (5) may participate in the Florida Kidcare program as provided in s. 409.8132 or, if the child is ineligible for Medikids by reason of age, in the Florida Healthy Kids program, subject to the following: (a) The family is not eligible for premium assistance payments and must pay the full cost of the combined-risk premium, including any administrative costs. (b) The board of directors of the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation may offer a reduced benefit package to these children in order to limit program costs for such families. (8) Once a child is enrolled in the Florida Kidcare program, the child is eligible for coverage for 12 months without a redetermination or reverification of eligibility, if the family continues to pay the applicable premium. Eligibility for program components funded through Title XXI of the Social Security Act terminates when a child attains the age of 19. A child who has not attained the age of 5 and who has been determined eligible for the Medicaid program is eligible for coverage for 12 months without a redetermination or reverification of eligibility. (9) When determining or reviewing a child’s eligibility under the Florida Kidcare program, the applicant shall be provided with reasonable notice of changes in eligibility which may affect enrollment in one or more of the program components. If a transition from one program component to another is authorized, there shall be cooperation between the program components and the affected family which promotes continuity of health care coverage. Any authorized transfers must be managed within the program’s overall appropriated or authorized levels of funding. Each component of the program shall establish a reserve to ensure that transfers between components will be accomplished within current year appropriations. These reserves shall be reviewed by each convening of the Social Services Estimating Conference to determine the adequacy of such reserves to meet actual experience. (10) In determining the eligibility of a child, an assets test is not required. If eligibility for the Florida Kidcare program cannot be verified using reliable data sources in accordance with federal requirements, each applicant shall provide documentation during the application process and the redetermination process, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) Proof of family income, which must be verified electronically to determine financial eligibility for the Florida Kidcare program. Written documentation, which may include wages and earnings statements or pay stubs, W-2 forms, or a copy of the applicant’s most recent federal income tax return, is required only if the electronic verification is not available or does not substantiate the applicant’s income. (b) A statement from all applicable, employed family members that: 1. Their employers do not sponsor health benefit plans for employees; 2. The potential enrollee is not covered by an employer-sponsored health benefit plan; or 3. The potential enrollee is covered by an employer-sponsored health benefit plan and the cost of the employer-sponsored health benefit plan is more than 5 percent of the family’s income. (c) To enroll in a plan under contract with the agency to service children with special health care needs, a completed application, including a Children’s Medical Services clinical screening. (11) Subject to paragraph (5)(a), the Florida Kidcare program shall withhold benefits from an enrollee if the program obtains evidence that the enrollee is no longer eligible, submitted incorrect or fraudulent information in order to establish eligibility, or failed to provide verification of eligibility. The applicant or enrollee shall be notified that because of such evidence program benefits will be withheld unless the applicant or enrollee contacts a designated representative of the program by a specified date, which must be within 10 working days after the date of notice, to discuss and resolve the matter. The program shall make every effort to resolve the matter within a timeframe that will not cause benefits to be withheld from an eligible enrollee. (12) The following individuals may be subject to prosecution in accordance with s. 414.39: (a) An applicant obtaining or attempting to obtain benefits for a potential enrollee under the Florida Kidcare program when the applicant knows or should have known the potential enrollee does not qualify for the Florida Kidcare program. (b) An individual who assists an applicant in obtaining or attempting to obtain benefits for a potential enrollee under the Florida Kidcare program when the individual knows or should have known the potential enrollee does not qualify for the Florida Kidcare program.

      "text": "409.818 Administration.—In order to implement ss. 409.810-409.821, the following agencies shall have the following duties: (1) The Department of Children and Families shall: (a) Develop a simplified eligibility application mail-in form to be used for determining the eligibility of children for coverage under the Florida Kidcare program, in consultation with the agency, the Department of Health, and the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation. The simplified eligibility application form must include an item that provides an opportunity for the applicant to indicate whether coverage is being sought for a child with special health care needs. Families applying for children’s Medicaid coverage must also be able to use the simplified application form without having to pay a premium. (b) Establish and maintain the eligibility determination process under the program except as specified in subsection (5). The department shall directly, or through the services of a contracted third-party administrator, establish and maintain a process for determining eligibility of children for coverage under the program. The eligibility determination process must be used solely for determining eligibility of applicants for health benefits coverage under the program. The eligibility determination process must include an initial determination of eligibility for any coverage offered under the program, as well as a redetermination or reverification of eligibility each subsequent 6 months. Effective January 1, 1999, a child who has not attained the age of 5 and who has been determined eligible for the Medicaid program is eligible for coverage for 12 months without a redetermination or reverification of eligibility. In conducting an eligibility determination, the department shall determine if the child has special health care needs. The department, in consultation with the Agency for Health Care Administration and the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation, shall develop procedures for redetermining eligibility which enable a family to easily update any change in circumstances which could affect eligibility. The department may accept changes in a family’s status as reported to the department by the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation without requiring a new application from the family. Redetermination of a child’s eligibility for Medicaid may not be linked to a child’s eligibility determination for other programs. (c) Inform program applicants about eligibility determinations and provide information about eligibility of applicants to the Florida Kidcare program and to insurers and their agents, through a centralized coordinating office. (d) Adopt rules necessary for conducting program eligibility functions. (2) The Department of Health shall: (a) Design an eligibility intake process for the program, in coordination with the Department of Children and Families, the agency, and the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation. The eligibility intake process may include local intake points that are determined by the Department of Health in coordination with the Department of Children and Families. (b) Chair a state-level Florida Kidcare coordinating council to review and make recommendations concerning the implementation and operation of the program. The coordinating council shall include representatives from the department, the Department of Children and Families, the agency, the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation, the Office of Insurance Regulation of the Financial Services Commission, local government, health insurers, health maintenance organizations, health care providers, families participating in the program, and organizations representing low-income families. (c) In consultation with the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation and the Department of Children and Families, establish a toll-free telephone line to assist families with questions about the program. (d) Adopt rules necessary to implement outreach activities. (3) The Agency for Health Care Administration, under the authority granted in s. 409.914(1), shall: (a) Calculate the premium assistance payment necessary to comply with the premium and cost-sharing limitations specified in s. 409.816. The premium assistance payment for each enrollee in a health insurance plan participating in the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation shall equal the premium approved by the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation and the Office of Insurance Regulation of the Financial Services Commission pursuant to ss. 627.410 and 641.31, less any enrollee’s share of the premium established within the limitations specified in s. 409.816. The premium assistance payment for each enrollee in an employer-sponsored health insurance plan approved under ss. 409.810-409.821 shall equal the premium for the plan adjusted for any benchmark benefit plan actuarial equivalent benefit rider approved by the Office of Insurance Regulation pursuant to ss. 627.410 and 641.31, less any enrollee’s share of the premium established within the limitations specified in s. 409.816. In calculating the premium assistance payment levels for children with family coverage, the agency shall set the premium assistance payment levels for each child proportionately to the total cost of family coverage. (b) Make premium assistance payments to health insurance plans on a periodic basis. The agency may use its Medicaid fiscal agent or a contracted third-party administrator in making these payments. The agency may require health insurance plans that participate in the Medikids program or employer-sponsored group health insurance to collect premium payments from an enrollee’s family. Participating health insurance plans shall report premium payments collected on behalf of enrollees in the program to the agency in accordance with a schedule established by the agency. (c) Monitor compliance with quality assurance and access standards developed under s. 409.820 and in accordance with s. 2103(f) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. s. 1397cc(f). (d) Establish a mechanism for investigating and resolving complaints and grievances from program applicants, enrollees, and health benefits coverage providers, and maintain a record of complaints and confirmed problems. In the case of a child who is enrolled in a health maintenance organization, the agency must use the provisions of s. 641.511 to address grievance reporting and resolution requirements. (e) Approve health benefits coverage for participation in the program, following certification by the Office of Insurance Regulation under subsection (4). (f) Adopt rules necessary for calculating premium assistance payment levels, making premium assistance payments, monitoring access and quality assurance standards, investigating and resolving complaints and grievances, administering the Medikids program, and approving health benefits coverage. The agency is designated the lead state agency for Title XXI of the Social Security Act for purposes of receipt of federal funds, for reporting purposes, and for ensuring compliance with federal and state regulations and rules. (4) The Office of Insurance Regulation shall certify that health benefits coverage plans that seek to provide services under the Florida Kidcare program, except those offered through the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation, meet, exceed, or are actuarially equivalent to the benchmark benefit plan and that health insurance plans will be offered at an approved rate. In determining actuarial equivalence of benefits coverage, the Office of Insurance Regulation and health insurance plans must comply with the requirements of s. 2103 of Title XXI of the Social Security Act. The department shall adopt rules necessary for certifying health benefits coverage plans. (5) The Florida Healthy Kids Corporation shall retain its functions as authorized in s. 624.91, including eligibility determination for participation in the Healthy Kids program. (6) The agency, the Department of Health, the Department of Children and Families, the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation, and the Office of Insurance Regulation, after consultation with and approval of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, are authorized to make program modifications that are necessary to overcome any objections of the United States Department of Health and Human Services to obtain approval of the state’s child health insurance plan under Title XXI of the Social Security Act.

(b) Physician services: up to $2 copayment for each visit with a physician licensed under chapter 458, chapter 459, chapter 460, chapter 461, or chapter 463. (c) Hospital emergency department visits for nonemergency care: 5 percent of up to the first $300 of the Medicaid payment for emergency room services, not to exceed $15. The agency shall seek federal approval to require Medicaid recipients to pay a $100 copayment for nonemergency services and care furnished in a hospital emergency department. Upon waiver approval, a Medicaid recipient who requests such services and care must pay a $100 copayment to the hospital for the nonemergency services and care provided in the hospital emergency department. (d) Prescription drugs: a coinsurance equal to 2.5 percent of the Medicaid cost of the prescription drug at the time of purchase. The maximum coinsurance shall be $7.50 per prescription drug purchased. (2) The agency shall, subject to federal regulations and any directions or limitations provided for in the General Appropriations Act, require copayments for the following additional services: hospital inpatient, laboratory and X-ray services, transportation services, home health care services, community mental health services, rural health services, federally qualified health clinic services, and nurse practitioner services. The agency may only establish copayments for prescribed drugs or for any other federally authorized service if such copayment is specifically provided for in the General Appropriations Act or other law. (3) In accordance with federal regulations, the agency shall not require copayments of the following Medicaid recipients: (a) Children under age 21. (b) Pregnant women when the services relate to the pregnancy or to any other medical condition which may complicate the pregnancy up to 6 weeks after delivery. (c) Any individual who is an inpatient in a hospital, long-term care facility, or other medical institution if, as a condition of receiving services in the institution, that individual is required to spend all but a minimal amount of her or his income required for personal needs for medical care costs. (d) Any individual who requires emergency services after the sudden onset of a medical condition which, left untreated, would place the individual’s health in serious jeopardy. (e) Any individual when the services or supplies relate to family planning. (f) Any individual who is enrolled in a Medicaid prepaid health plan or health maintenance organization. (4) No provider shall impose more than one copayment for any encounter upon a Medicaid recipient. (5) The agency shall develop a mechanism by which participating providers are able to identify those Medicaid recipients from whom they shall not collect copayments. (6) This section does not require a provider to bill or collect a copayment required or authorized under 1 this section from the Medicaid recipient. If the provider chooses not to bill or collect a copayment from a Medicaid recipient, the agency must still deduct the amount of the copayment from the Medicaid reimbursement made to the provider.

(i) Healthy start services, except as provided in s. 409.975(4). (j) Hearing services. (k) Home health agency services. (l) Hospice services. (m) Hospital inpatient services.

(cc) Transportation to access covered services. (2) CUSTOMIZED BENEFITS.—Managed care plans may customize benefit packages for nonpregnant adults, vary cost-sharing provisions, and provide coverage for additional services. The agency shall evaluate the proposed benefit packages to ensure services are sufficient to meet the needs of the plan’s enrollees and to verify actuarial equivalence. (3) HEALTHY BEHAVIORS.—Each plan operating in the managed medical assistance program shall establish a program to encourage and reward healthy behaviors. At a minimum, each plan must establish a medically approved tobacco cessation program, a medically directed weight loss program, and a medically approved alcohol recovery program or substance abuse recovery program that must include, but may not be limited to, opioid abuse recovery. Each plan must identify enrollees who smoke, are morbidly obese, or are diagnosed with alcohol or substance abuse in order to establish written agreements to secure the enrollees’ commitment to participation in these programs. (4) PRIMARY CARE INITIATIVE.—Each plan operating in the managed medical assistance program shall establish a program to encourage enrollees to establish a relationship with their primary care provider. Each plan shall: (a) Provide information to each enrollee on the importance of and procedure for selecting a primary care provider, and thereafter automatically assign to a primary care provider any enrollee who fails to choose a primary care provider. (b) If the enrollee was not a Medicaid recipient before enrollment in the plan, assist the enrollee in scheduling an initial appointment with the primary care provider. If possible, such enrollee’s initial appointment should be made within 30 days after enrollment in the plan. If an initial appointment is not made within such 30-day period, the plan must continue assisting the enrollee to schedule an initial appointment and must report the delay and the reason for the delay to the agency. The plan shall seek to ensure that such an enrollee has at least one appointment annually with his or her primary care provider. (c) Report to the agency the number of enrollees assigned to each primary care provider within the plan’s network. (d) Report to the agency the number of enrollees who have not had an appointment with their primary care provider within their first year of enrollment. (e) Report to the agency the number of emergency room visits by enrollees who have not had at least one appointment with their primary care provider. (f) Coordinate with a hospital that contacts the plan under the requirements of s. 395.1055(1)(j) for the purpose of establishing the appropriate delivery of primary care services for the plan’s members who present at the hospital’s emergency department for nonemergent care or emergency care that could potentially have been avoided through the regular provision of primary care. The plan shall coordinate with such member and the member’s primary care provider for such purpose. (5) PROVISION OF DENTAL SERVICES.— (a) The Legislature may use the findings of the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability’s report no. 16-07, December 2016, in setting the scope of minimum benefits set forth in this section for future procurements of eligible plans as described in s. 409.966. Specifically, the decision to include dental services as a minimum benefit under this section, or to provide Medicaid recipients with dental benefits separate from the Medicaid managed medical assistance program described in this part, may take into consideration the data and findings of the report. (b) In the event the Legislature takes no action before July 1, 2017, with respect to the report findings required under paragraph (a), the agency shall implement a statewide Medicaid prepaid dental health program for children and adults with a choice of at least two licensed dental managed care providers who must have substantial experience in providing dental care to Medicaid enrollees and children eligible for medical assistance under Title XXI of the Social Security Act and who meet all agency standards and requirements. To qualify as a provider under the prepaid dental health program, the entity must be licensed as a prepaid limited health service organization under part I of chapter 636 or as a health maintenance organization under part I of chapter 641. The contracts for program providers shall be awarded through a competitive procurement process. Beginning with the contract procurement process initiated during the 2023 calendar year, the contracts must be for 6 years and may not be renewed; however, the agency may extend the term of a plan contract to cover delays during a transition to a new plan provider. The agency shall include in the contracts a medical loss ratio provision consistent with s. 409.967(4). The agency is authorized to seek any necessary state plan amendment or federal waiver to commence enrollment in the Medicaid prepaid dental health program no later than March 1, 2019. The agency shall extend until December 31, 2024, the term of existing plan contracts awarded pursuant to the invitation to negotiate published in October 2017. (6) INTEGRATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE.—Each plan operating in the managed medical assistance program shall work with the managing entity in its service area to establish specific organizational supports and protocols that enhance the integration and coordination of primary care and behavioral health services for Medicaid recipients. Progress in this initiative shall be measured using the integration framework and core measures developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

The agency shall automatically enroll recipients in plans that meet or exceed the performance or quality standards established pursuant to s. 409.967 and may not automatically enroll recipients in a plan that is deficient in those performance or quality standards. When a specialty plan is available to accommodate a specific condition or diagnosis of a recipient, the agency shall assign the recipient to that plan. Except as otherwise provided in this part, the agency may not engage in practices that are designed to favor one managed care plan over another. (2) When automatically enrolling recipients in managed care plans, the agency shall automatically enroll based on the following criteria: (a) Whether the plan has sufficient network capacity to meet the needs of the recipients. (b) Whether the recipient has previously received services from one of the plan’s primary care providers. (c) Whether primary care providers in one plan are more geographically accessible to the recipient’s residence than those in other plans. (3) A newborn of a mother enrolled in a plan at the time of the child’s birth shall be enrolled in the mother’s plan. Upon birth, such a newborn is deemed enrolled in the managed care plan, regardless of the administrative enrollment procedures, and the managed care plan is responsible for providing Medicaid services to the newborn. The mother may choose another plan for the newborn within 90 days after the child’s birth. (4) The agency shall develop a process to enable a recipient with access to employer-sponsored health care coverage to opt out of all managed care plans and to use Medicaid financial assistance to pay for the recipient’s share of the cost in such employer-sponsored coverage. The agency shall also enable recipients with access to other insurance or related products providing access to health care services created pursuant to state law, including any product available under the Florida Health Choices Program, or any health exchange, to opt out. The amount of financial assistance provided for each recipient may not exceed the amount of the Medicaid premium that would have been paid to a managed care plan for that recipient. The agency shall require Medicaid recipients with access to employer-sponsored health care coverage to enroll in that coverage and use Medicaid financial assistance to pay for the recipient’s share of the cost for such coverage. The amount of financial assistance provided for each recipient may not exceed the amount of the Medicaid premium that would have been paid to a managed care plan for that recipient. The agency may exceed this amount for a high-cost patient if it determines it would be cost effective to do so. The agency shall annually, beginning June 30, 2026, submit an annual report on the program to the Legislature including, but not limited to, the level of participation; participant demographics, income levels, type of employer-based coverage, and amount of health care utilization; and a cost-effectiveness analysis both in the aggregate and on an individual patient basis.

      "text": "409.979 Eligibility.— (1) PREREQUISITE CRITERIA FOR ELIGIBILITY.—Medicaid recipients who meet all of the following criteria are eligible to receive long-term care services and must receive long-term care services by participating in the long-term care managed care program. The recipient must be: (a) Sixty-five years of age or older, or age 18 or older and eligible for Medicaid by reason of a disability. (b) Determined by the 1 Comprehensive Assessment and Review for Long-Term Care Services (CARES) preadmission screening program to require: 1. Nursing facility care as defined in s. 409.985(3); or 2. Hospital level of care, for individuals diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. (2) ENROLLMENT OFFERS.—Subject to the availability of funds, the Department of Elderly Affairs shall make offers for enrollment to eligible individuals based on a wait-list prioritization. Before making enrollment offers, the agency and the Department of Elderly Affairs shall determine that sufficient funds exist to support additional enrollment into plans. (a) A Medicaid recipient enrolled in one of the following Medicaid home and community-based services waiver programs who meets the eligibility criteria established in subsection (1) is eligible to participate in the long-term care managed care program and must be transitioned into the long-term care managed care program by January 1, 2018: 1. Traumatic Brain and Spinal Cord Injury Waiver. 2. Adult Cystic Fibrosis Waiver. 3. Project AIDS Care Waiver. (b) The agency shall seek federal approval to terminate the Traumatic Brain and Spinal Cord Injury Waiver, the Adult Cystic Fibrosis Waiver, and the Project AIDS Care Waiver once all eligible Medicaid recipients have transitioned into the long-term care managed care program. (3) WAIT LIST, RELEASE, AND OFFER PROCESS.—The Department of Elderly Affairs shall maintain a statewide wait list for enrollment for home and community-based services through the long-term care managed care program. (a) The Department of Elderly Affairs shall prioritize individuals for potential enrollment for home and community-based services through the long-term care managed care program using a frailty-based screening tool that results in a priority score. The priority score is used to set an order for releasing individuals from the wait list for potential enrollment in the long-term care managed care program. If capacity is limited for individuals with identical priority scores, the individual with the oldest date of placement on the wait list shall receive priority for release. 1. Pursuant to s. 430.2053, aging resource center personnel certified by the Department of Elderly Affairs shall perform the screening for each individual requesting enrollment for home and community-based services through the long-term care managed care program. The Department of Elderly Affairs shall request that the individual or the individual’s authorized representative provide alternate contact names and contact information. 2. The individual requesting the long-term care services, or the individual’s authorized representative, must participate in an initial screening or rescreening for placement on the wait list. The screening or rescreening must be completed in its entirety before placement on the wait list. 3. Pursuant to s. 430.2053, aging resource center personnel shall administer rescreening annually or upon notification of a significant change in an individual’s circumstances for an individual with a high priority score. Aging resource center personnel may administer rescreening annually or upon notification of a significant change in an individual’s circumstances for an individual with a low priority score. 4. The Department of Elderly Affairs shall adopt by rule a screening tool that generates the priority score and shall make publicly available on its website the specific methodology used to calculate an individual’s priority score. (b) Upon completion of the screening or rescreening process, the Department of Elderly Affairs shall notify the individual or the individual’s authorized representative that the individual has been placed on the wait list, unless the individual has a low priority score. The Department of Elderly Affairs must maintain contact information for each individual with a low priority score for purposes of any future rescreening. Aging resource center personnel shall inform individuals with low priority scores of community resources available to assist them and inform them that they may contact the aging resource center for a new assessment at any time if they experience a change in circumstances. (c) If the Department of Elderly Affairs is unable to contact the individual or the individual’s authorized representative to schedule an initial screening or rescreening, and documents the actions taken to make such contact, it shall send a letter to the last documented address of the individual or the individual’s authorized representative. The letter must advise the individual or his or her authorized representative that he or she must contact the Department of Elderly Affairs within 30 calendar days after the date of the notice to schedule a screening or rescreening and must notify the individual that failure to complete the screening or rescreening will result in his or her termination from the screening process and the wait list. (d) After notification by the agency of available capacity, the CARES program shall conduct a prerelease assessment. The Department of Elderly Affairs shall release individuals from the wait list based on the priority scoring process and prerelease assessment results. Upon release, individuals who meet all eligibility criteria may enroll in the long-term care managed care program. (e) The Department of Elderly Affairs may terminate an individual’s inclusion on the wait list if the individual: 1. Does not have a current priority score due to the individual’s action or inaction; 2. Requests to be removed from the wait list; 3. Does not keep an appointment to complete the rescreening without scheduling another appointment and has not responded to three documented attempts by the Department of Elderly Affairs to contact the individual; 4. Receives an offer to begin the eligibility determination process for the long-term care managed care program; or 5. Begins receiving services through the long-term care managed care program. An individual whose inclusion on the wait list is terminated must initiate a new request for placement on the wait list, and any previous priority considerations must be disregarded. (f) Notwithstanding this subsection, the following individuals are afforded priority enrollment for home and community-based services through the long-term care managed care program and do not have to complete the screening or wait-list process if all other long-term care managed care program eligibility requirements are met: 1. An individual who is 18, 19, or 20 years of age who has a chronic debilitating disease or condition of one or more physiological or organ systems which generally make the individual dependent upon 24-hour-per-day medical, nursing, or health supervision or intervention. 2. A nursing facility resident who requests to transition into the community and who has resided in a Florida-licensed skilled nursing facility for at least 60 consecutive days. 3. An individual who is referred by the Department of Children and Families pursuant to the Adult Protective Services Act, ss. 415.101-415.113, as high risk and who is placed in an assisted living facility temporarily funded by the Department of Children and Families. (g) The Department of Elderly Affairs and the agency may adopt rules to implement this subsection.
