Copayments may not be established in an amount that will prevent a person from receiving a covered service or benefit as specified in the subscriber contract approved by the office. (6) “Emergency medical condition” means: (a) A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity, which may include severe pain or other acute symptoms, such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in any of the following: 1. Serious jeopardy to the health of a patient, including a pregnant woman or a fetus. 2. Serious impairment to bodily functions. 3. Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. (b) With respect to a pregnant woman: 1. That there is inadequate time to effect safe transfer to another hospital prior to delivery; 2.

(7) “Emergency services and care” means medical screening, examination, and evaluation by a physician, or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by other appropriate personnel under the supervision of a physician, to determine if an emergency medical condition exists and, if it does, the care, treatment, or surgery for a covered service by a physician necessary to relieve or eliminate the emergency medical condition, within the service capability of a hospital. (8) “Entity” means any legal entity with continuing existence, including, but not limited to, a corporation, association, trust, or partnership.

Each female subscriber may select as her primary physician an obstetrician/gynecologist who has agreed to serve as a primary physician and is in the health maintenance organization’s provider network. Except in cases in which the health care provider is an employee of the health maintenance organization, the fact that the health maintenance organization arranges for the provision of health care services under this chapter does not create an actual agency, apparent agency, or employer-employee relationship between the health care provider and the health maintenance organization for purposes of vicarious liability for the medical negligence of the health care provider. (13) “Insolvent” or “insolvency” means that all the statutory assets of the health maintenance organization, if made immediately available, would not be sufficient to discharge all of its liabilities or that the health maintenance organization is unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business. In the event that all the assets of the health maintenance organization, if made immediately available, would not be sufficient to discharge all of its liabilities, but the organization has a written guarantee of the type and subject to the same provisions as outlined in s. 641.225, the organization shall not be considered insolvent unless it is unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business.

The reimbursement schedule may be stated as: (a) A percentage of the Medicare fee schedule for specific relative-value services; (b) A listing of the reimbursements to be paid by Current Procedural Terminology codes for physicians that pertain to each physician’s practice; or (c) Any other method agreed upon by the parties. Specific nonrelative-value services shall be stated separately from relative-value services, and reimbursement for unclassified services shall be on a reasonable basis. (17) “Statutory accounting principles” means accounting principles as defined in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual as of 2002. (18) “Subscriber” means an entity or individual who has contracted, or on whose behalf a contract has been entered into, with a health maintenance organization for health care coverage or other persons who also receive health care coverage as a result of the contract. (19) “Surplus” means total statutory assets in excess of total liabilities, except that assets pledged to secure debts not reflected on the books of the health maintenance organization shall not be included in surplus. Surplus includes capital stock, capital in excess of par, other contributed capital, retained earnings, and surplus notes. (20) “Uncovered expenditures” means the cost of health care services that are covered by a health maintenance organization, for which a subscriber would also be liable in the event of the insolvency of the organization.

(22) “Provider service network” means a network authorized under s. 409.912(1), reimbursed on a prepaid basis, operated by a health care provider or group of affiliated health care providers, and which directly provides health care services under a Medicare, Medicaid, or Healthy Kids contract.

The health maintenance organization has filed a notice with the office at least 30 days prior to the dividend payment or distribution, or such shorter period of time as approved by the office on a case-by-case basis. 4. The notice includes a certification by an officer of the health maintenance organization attesting that after payment of the dividend or distribution the health maintenance organization will have at least 115 percent of required statutory surplus. 5. The health maintenance organization has negative retained earnings, statutory surplus in excess of $50 million, and statutory surplus greater than or equal to 150 percent of its required statutory surplus before and after the dividend distribution is made based upon the health maintenance organization’s most recently filed annual financial statement. (2) The office shall not approve a dividend or distribution in excess of the maximum amount allowed in subsection (1) unless it determines that the distribution or dividend would not jeopardize the financial condition of the health maintenance organization, considering: (a) The liquidity, quality, and diversification of the health maintenance organization’s assets and the effect on its ability to meet its obligations. (b) Any reduction of investment portfolio and investment income. (c) History of capital contributions. (d) Prior dividend distributions of the health maintenance organization.

(4) Any stockholder receiving such an illegal dividend shall be liable in the amount thereof to the health maintenance organization. (5) The office may revoke or suspend the certificate of authority of a health maintenance organization which has declared or paid such an illegal dividend.
