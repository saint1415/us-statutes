(2) The courts may fulfill their obligation to advise crime victims by doing one of the following: (a) Making the following announcement at any arraignment, sentencing, or case-management proceeding: “If you are the victim of a crime with a case pending before this court, you are advised that you have the right, upon request: 1. To be informed. 2. To be present. 3. To be heard at all stages of criminal proceedings. 4. To receive advance notification, when possible, of judicial proceedings and notification of scheduling changes, pursuant to section 960.001, Florida Statutes. 5. To seek crimes compensation and restitution. 6. To consult with the state attorney’s office in certain felony cases regarding the disposition of the case. 7. To make an oral or written victim impact statement at the time of sentencing of a defendant. For further information regarding additional rights afforded to victims of crime, you may contact the state attorney’s office or obtain a listing of your rights from the Clerk of Court.” (b) Displaying prominently on the courtroom doors posters giving notification of the existence and general provisions of this chapter. The Department of Legal Affairs shall provide the courts with the posters specified by this paragraph. (3) The circuit court administrator shall coordinate efforts to ensure that victim rights information, as established in s. 960.001(1)(o), is provided to the clerk of the court. (4) This section is only for the benefit of crime victims. Accordingly, a failure to comply with this section shall not affect the validity of any hearing, conviction, or sentence.

Such persons or their dependents may thereby suffer disabilities, incur financial hardships, or become dependent upon public assistance. The Legislature finds and determines that there is a need for government financial assistance for such victims of adult and juvenile crime.

Upon a showing that a delay in filing a claim occurred because of delay in the testing of, or a delay in the DNA profile matching from, a sexual assault forensic examination kit or biological material collected as evidence related to a sexual offense, a person who is eligible for compensation under this subsection may receive a waiver of any claim filing deadline. For good cause based on any other reason, the department may extend the time period allowed for filing a claim under paragraph (b) for an additional period not to exceed 1 year or under paragraph (c) for an additional period not to exceed 2 years.

Upon a showing that a delay in filing a claim occurred because of delay in the testing of, or a delay in the DNA profile matching from, a sexual assault forensic examination kit or biological material collected as evidence related to a sexual offense, a person who is eligible for compensation under this subsection may receive a waiver of any claim filing deadline. (5) Claims may be filed in the Tallahassee office of the department in person or by mail. Any employee of the department receiving a claim for compensation shall, immediately upon receipt of such claim, mail the claim to the department at its office in Tallahassee. In no event and under no circumstances shall the rights of a claimant under this chapter be prejudiced or lost by the failure or delay of the employees of the department in mailing claims to the department in Tallahassee. (6) Upon filing of a claim pursuant to this chapter, in which there is an identified offender, the department shall promptly notify the state attorney of the circuit wherein the crime is alleged to have occurred. If within 10 days after such notification such state attorney advises the department that a criminal prosecution or delinquency petition is pending upon the same alleged crime and requests that action by the department be deferred, the department shall defer all proceedings under this chapter until such time as a trial verdict or delinquency adjudication has been rendered, and shall so notify such state attorney and claimant. When a trial verdict or delinquency adjudication has been rendered, such state attorney shall promptly notify the department. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority of the department to grant emergency awards pursuant to s. 960.12.

Such crime directly resulted in personal injury to, psychiatric or psychological injury to, or death of, the victim or intervenor; and 3. Such crime was promptly reported to the proper authorities. (b) In no case may an award be made when the record shows that such report was made more than: 1. Seventy-two hours after the occurrence of such crime, if the crime occurred before October 1, 2019; or 2. Five days after the occurrence of such crime, if the crime occurred on or after October 1, 2019, unless the department, for good cause shown, finds the delay to have been justified. The department, upon finding that any claimant or award recipient has not duly cooperated with the state attorney, all law enforcement agencies, and the department, may deny, reduce, or withdraw any award, as the case may be. (2) Any award shall be granted on an “actual need” basis and shall be provided subsequent to all benefits provided by primary insurance carriers, including, but not limited to, health and accident insurers, workers’ compensation, and automobile accident coverage. (3) Payment made in accordance with this section shall be considered payment of last resort that follows all other sources. (4) Any award made pursuant to this chapter shall be made in accordance with the schedule of benefits, degrees of disability, and wage-loss formulas specified in ss. 440.12 and 440.15, excluding subsection (5) of that section. (5) If there are two or more persons entitled to an award as a result of the death of a person which is the direct result of a crime, the award shall be apportioned among the claimants. (6) Any award made pursuant to this chapter, except an award for loss of support or catastrophic injury, shall be reduced by the amount of any payments or services received or to be received by the claimant as a result of the injury or death: (a) From or on behalf of the person who committed the crime; provided, however, that a restitution award ordered by a court to be paid to the claimant by the person who committed the crime shall not reduce any award made pursuant to this chapter unless it appears to the department that the claimant will be unjustly enriched thereby. (b) From any other public or private source or provider, including, but not limited to, an award of workers’ compensation pursuant to chapter 440. (c) From agencies mandated by other Florida statutes to provide or pay for services, except as provided in s. 960.28. (d) From an emergency award under s. 960.12. (7) In determining the amount of an award, the department shall determine whether, because of his or her conduct, the victim of such crime or the intervenor contributed to the infliction of his or her physical injury or psychiatric or psychological injury or to his or her death, and the department shall reduce the amount of the award or reject the claim altogether, in accordance with such determination. However, the department may disregard for this purpose the contribution of the intervenor to his or her own physical injury or psychiatric or psychological injury or death when the record shows that such contribution was attributed to efforts by an intervenor as set forth in s. 960.03. (8) If the department finds that the claimant, if not granted assistance pursuant to this chapter to meet the loss of earnings or support or out-of-pocket loss, will not suffer serious financial hardship as a result of the loss of earnings or support and the out-of-pocket loss incurred as a result of the injury, the department shall deny the award. In determining serious financial hardship, the department shall consider all the financial resources of the claimant. Unless a total dependency is established, members of a family are considered to be partially dependent upon a homemaker with whom they reside, without regard to actual earnings. (9)(a) An award may not exceed: 1. Ten thousand dollars for treatment; 2. Ten thousand dollars for continuing or periodic mental health care of a minor victim whose normal emotional development is adversely affected by being the victim of a crime; 3. A total of $25,000 for all compensable costs; or 4. Fifty thousand dollars when the department makes a written finding that the victim has suffered a catastrophic injury as a direct result of the crime. (b) The department may adopt rules that establish limits below the amounts set forth in paragraph (a) and establish criteria governing awards for catastrophic injury.

      "text": "960.29 Legislative findings and intent.—The Legislature finds that former approaches to the problem of compensating crime victims through restitution have proven inadequate or have been inconsistently applied in many cases. The Legislature also finds that there is an urgent need to alleviate the increasing financial burdens on the state and its local subdivisions caused by the expenses of incarcerating convicted offenders. (1) To remedy these problems, consistent with the preservation of all citizens’ constitutional rights, the Legislature intends: (a) To provide a legal mechanism, in the form of a civil restitution lien, that will enable crime victims, the state, and other aggrieved parties to recover damages and losses arising out of criminal acts, imposed against the real and personal property owned by the convicted offender who committed an offense that caused the damages and losses. (b) To prevent convicted offenders from increasing their assets after conviction, while their crime victims and the state and local subdivisions remain uncompensated for their damages and losses. To further this legislative purpose, the civil restitution lien shall attach not only to the offender’s current assets but also, should these assets fail to satisfy the lien, to any future assets or “windfall” proceeds which may accrue to the defendant, up to the full amount of the lien. (c) To ensure that the amount of each civil restitution lien equals the amount of the actual damages awarded in the civil action arising from the crime. (d) To impose a long-term civil liability for the costs of incarceration, by means of the civil restitution lien, against a convicted offender, regardless of the offender’s financial status at the time of conviction. (2) The Legislature also finds that crime victims, the state, and its local subdivisions are entitled to rough remedial justice and they may demand compensation for damage and losses. (3) The Legislature declares that: (a) The intent of the statute is rationally related to the goal of fully compensating crime victims, the state, and its local subdivisions for damages and losses incurred as a result of criminal conduct. (b) This civil restitution lien act rests upon the principle of remediation and not punishment, which is meted out by criminal sanctions afforded by law. (4) The Legislature recognizes that, in many individual cases, the liquidated damage amount awarded by the court in a civil action arising from the crime does not fully compensate crime victims for their actual damages and losses. It is the legislative intent that the civil restitution liens authorized in this act assist crime victims to collect the amounts awarded and authorized as actual and liquidated damages and losses a crime victim incurs as a result of a convicted offender’s conduct, and the state and its local subdivisions incur as a result of implementation of a convicted offender’s sentence.
