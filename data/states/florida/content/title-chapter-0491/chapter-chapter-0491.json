      "text": "491.002 Intent.—The Legislature finds that as society becomes increasingly complex, emotional survival is equal in importance to physical survival. Therefore, in order to preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the public, the Legislature must provide privileged communication for members of the public or those acting on their behalf to encourage needed or desired counseling, clinical and psychotherapy services, or certain other services of a psychological nature to be sought out. The Legislature further finds that, since such services assist the public primarily with emotional survival, which in turn affects physical and psychophysical survival, the practice of clinical social work, marriage and family therapy, and mental health counseling by persons not qualified to practice such professions presents a danger to public health, safety, and welfare. The Legislature finds that, to further secure the health, safety, and welfare of the public and also to encourage professional cooperation among all qualified professionals, the Legislature must assist the public in making informed choices of such services by establishing minimum qualifications for entering into and remaining in the respective professions.",

Courses in research, thesis or dissertation work, practicums, internships, or fieldwork may not be applied toward this requirement. b. A minimum of 3 semester hours or 4 quarter hours of graduate-level coursework addressing diagnostic processes, including differential diagnosis and the use of the current diagnostic tools, such as the current edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The graduate program must have emphasized the common core curricular experience. c. The equivalent, as determined by the board, of at least 700 hours of university-sponsored supervised clinical practicum, internship, or field experience that includes at least 280 hours of direct client services, as required in the accrediting standards of the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs for mental health counseling programs. This experience may not be used to satisfy the post-master’s clinical experience requirement. 2. Provided additional documentation if a course title that appears on the applicant’s transcript does not clearly identify the content of the coursework. The documentation must include, but is not limited to, a syllabus or catalog description published for the course. Education and training in mental health counseling must have been received in an institution of higher education that, at the time the applicant graduated, was fully accredited by an institutional accrediting body recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation or its successor organization or was a member in good standing with Universities Canada, or an institution of higher education located outside the United States and Canada which, at the time the applicant was enrolled and at the time the applicant graduated, maintained a standard of training substantially equivalent to the standards of training of those institutions in the United States which are accredited by an institutional accrediting body recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation or its successor organization. Such foreign education and training must have been received in an institution or program of higher education officially recognized by the government of the country in which it is located as an institution or program to train students to practice as mental health counselors. The applicant has the burden of establishing that the requirements of this provision have been met, and the board shall require documentation, such as an evaluation by a foreign equivalency determination service, as evidence that the applicant’s graduate degree program and education were equivalent to an accredited program in this country. Beginning July 1, 2025, an applicant must have a master’s degree from a program that is accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs, the Masters in Psychology and Counseling Accreditation Council, or an equivalent accrediting body which consists of at least 60 semester hours or 80 quarter hours to apply for licensure under this paragraph. (d) Completed at least 2 years of clinical experience in mental health counseling, which must be at the post-master’s level under the supervision of a licensed mental health counselor or the equivalent who is a qualified supervisor as determined by the board. An individual who intends to practice in Florida to satisfy the clinical experience requirements must register pursuant to s. 491.0045 before commencing practice. If a graduate has a master’s degree with a major related to the practice of mental health counseling which did not include all the coursework required under sub-subparagraphs (c)1.a. and b., credit for the post-master’s level clinical experience may not commence until the applicant has completed a minimum of seven of the courses required under sub-subparagraphs (c)1.a. and b., as determined by the board, one of which must be a course in psychopathology or abnormal psychology. A doctoral internship may be applied toward the clinical experience requirement. A licensed mental health professional must be on the premises when clinical services are provided by a registered intern in a private practice setting. (e) Passed a theory and practice examination designated by board rule. (f) Demonstrated, in a manner designated by board rule, knowledge of the laws and rules governing the practice of clinical social work, marriage and family therapy, and mental health counseling.

(4) Nothing in this compact affects the requirements established by a member state for the issuance of a single state license. (5) A professional counselor license issued by a home state to a resident of that state must be recognized by each member state as authorizing that licensed professional counselor to practice professional counseling, under a privilege to practice, in each member state.

The licensee must continue to meet the criteria specified in subsection (1) to renew the privilege to practice in the remote state. (3) For purposes of the compact, the practice of professional counseling occurs in the state where the client is located at the time of the counseling services. The compact does not affect the regulatory authority of states to protect public health and safety through their own system of state licensure. (4) A licensee providing professional counseling in a remote state under the privilege to practice must adhere to the laws and regulations of the remote state. (5) A licensee providing professional counseling services in a remote state is subject to that state’s regulatory authority. A remote state may, in accordance with due process and that state’s laws, remove a licensee’s privilege to practice in the remote state for a specified period of time, impose fines, or take any other action necessary to protect the health and safety of its residents. The licensee may be ineligible for a privilege to practice in any member state until the specific time for removal has passed and all fines are paid. (6) If a home state license is encumbered, a licensee loses the privilege to practice in any remote state until both of the following conditions are met: (a) The home state license is no longer encumbered. (b) The licensee has not had any encumbrance or restriction against any license or privilege to practice within the preceding 2 years. (7) Once an encumbered license in the licensee’s home state is restored to good standing, the licensee may obtain a privilege to practice in any remote state if he or she meets the requirements of subsection (1).

ARTICLE V OBTAINING A NEW HOME STATE LICENSE BASED ON A PRIVILEGE TO PRACTICE (1) A licensed professional counselor may hold a home state license, which allows for a privilege to practice in other member states, in only one member state at a time. (2) If a licensed professional counselor changes his or her primary state of residence by moving between two member states, then the licensed professional counselor must file an application for obtaining a new home state license based on a privilege to practice and notify the current and new home state in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the commission. (3) Upon receipt of an application for obtaining a new home state license based on a privilege to practice, the new home state must verify that the licensed professional counselor meets the criteria outlined in Article IV through the data system. The new home state does not need to seek primary source verification for information obtained from the data system, except for the following: (a) A Federal Bureau of Investigation fingerprint-based criminal background check, if not previously performed or updated pursuant to applicable rules adopted by the commission in accordance with Pub. L. No. 92-544; (b) Any other criminal background check as required by the new home state; and (c) Proof of completion of any requisite jurisprudence requirements of the new home state. (4) The former home state shall convert the former home state license into a privilege to practice once the new home state has activated the new home state license in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the commission. (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of the compact, if the licensed professional counselor does not meet the criteria in Article IV, the new home state may apply its own requirements for issuing a new single state license. (6) If a licensed professional counselor changes his or her primary state of residence by moving from a member state to a nonmember state or from a nonmember state to a member state, the new state’s own criteria apply for issuance of a single state license in the new state. (7) The compact does not interfere with a licensee’s ability to hold a single state license in multiple states. However, for the purposes of the compact, a licensee may have only one home state license. (8) The compact does not affect the requirements established by a member state for the issuance of a single state license. ARTICLE VI ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY PERSONNEL AND THEIR SPOUSES Active duty military personnel, or their spouse, shall designate a home state where the individual has a current license in good standing. The individual may retain the home state license designation during the period the servicemember is on active duty. Subsequent to designating a home state, the individual may change his or her home state only through application for licensure in the new state or through the process outlined in Article V. ARTICLE VII COMPACT PRIVILEGE TO PRACTICE TELEHEALTH (1) Member states shall recognize the right of a licensed professional counselor, licensed by a home state in accordance with Article III and under rules adopted by the commission, to practice professional counseling in any member state through telehealth under a privilege to practice as provided in the compact and rules adopted by the commission. (2) A licensee providing professional counseling services in a remote state through telehealth under the privilege to practice must adhere to the laws and rules of the remote state. ARTICLE VIII ADVERSE ACTIONS (1) In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a remote state has the authority, in accordance with existing state due process law, to do any of the following: (a) Take adverse action against a licensed professional counselor’s privilege to practice within that member state. (b) Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another member state must be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence is located. (2) Only the home state has the power to take adverse action against a licensed professional counselor’s license issued by the home state. (3) For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a member state as it would if the conduct had occurred within the home state. The home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action in such cases. (4) The home state shall complete any pending investigations of a licensed professional counselor who changes primary state of residence during the course of the investigations. The home state may also take appropriate action and shall promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the administrator of the data system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the new home state of any adverse actions. (5) A member state, if authorized by state law, may recover from the affected licensed professional counselor the costs of investigations and dispositions of any cases resulting from adverse action taken against that licensed professional counselor. (6) A member state may take adverse action against a licensed professional counselor based on the factual findings of a remote state, provided that the member state follows its own statutory procedures for taking adverse action. (7)(a) In addition to the authority granted to a member state by its respective professional counseling practice act or other applicable state law, any member state may participate with other member states in joint investigations of licensees. (b) Member states shall share any investigative, litigation, or compliance materials in furtherance of any joint or individual investigation initiated under the compact. (8) If adverse action is taken by the home state against the license of a professional counselor, the licensed professional counselor’s privilege to practice in all other member states must be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the home state license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against the license of a professional counselor must include a statement that the licensed professional counselor’s privilege to practice is deactivated in all member states while the order is in effect. (9) If a member state takes adverse action, it must promptly notify the administrator of the data system. The administrator shall promptly notify the licensee’s home state of any adverse actions by remote states. (10) Nothing in the compact overrides a member state’s decision to allow a licensed professional counselor to participate in an alternative program in lieu of adverse action.

(11) Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the commission shall consider all written and oral comments received. (12) The commission, by majority vote of all members, shall take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule. (13) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this section are retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For purposes of this subsection, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to: (a) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare; (b) Prevent a loss of commission or member state funds; (c) Meet a deadline for the adoption of an administrative rule established by federal law or rule; or (d) Protect public health and safety. (14) The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revision must be posted on the website of the commission. Revisions are subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. A revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge must be made in writing and delivered to the chair of the commission before the end of the notice period. If a challenge is not made, the revision takes effect without further action. If a revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission. ARTICLE XII OVERSIGHT; DEFAULT, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, AND TERMINATION; DISPUTE RESOLUTION; AND ENFORCEMENT (1) OVERSIGHT.— (a) The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce the compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact’s purposes and intent. The compact and the rules adopted thereunder have standing as statutory law. (b) All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of the compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the commission. (c) The commission is entitled to receive service of process in any judicial or administrative proceeding specified in paragraph (b) and has standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the commission renders a judgment or an order void as to the commission, the compact, or adopted rules. (2) DEFAULT, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, AND TERMINATION.— (a) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under the compact or adopted rules, the commission must: 1. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action to be taken by the commission; and 2. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. (b) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by the compact are terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default. (c) Termination of membership in the compact may be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. The commission shall submit a notice of intent to suspend or terminate a defaulting member state to that state’s governor, to the majority and minority leaders of that state’s legislature, and to each member state. (d) A member state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination. (e) The commission may not bear any costs related to a member state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting member state. (f) The defaulting member state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. (3) DISPUTE RESOLUTION.— (a) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact which arise among member states and between member and nonmember states. (b) The commission shall adopt rules providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate. (4) ENFORCEMENT.— (a) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of the compact. (b) By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the compact and its adopted rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. If judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. (c) The remedies under this article are not the exclusive remedies to the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law. ARTICLE XIII DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COUNSELING COMPACT COMMISSION AND ASSOCIATED RULES, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT (1) The compact becomes effective on the date on which the compact is enacted into law in the 10th member state. The provisions that become effective at that time are limited to the powers granted to the commission relating to assembly and the adoption of rules. Thereafter, the commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary for implementation and administration of the compact. (2) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commission’s initial adoption of the rules is subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission has the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state. (3) Any member state may withdraw from the compact by enacting a statute repealing the compact. (a) A member state’s withdrawal does not take effect until 6 months after enactment of the repealing statute. (b) Withdrawal does not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state’s professional counseling licensing board to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of the compact before the effective date of withdrawal. (4) The compact may not be construed to invalidate or prevent any professional counseling licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state which does not conflict with the compact. (5) The compact may be amended by the member states. An amendment to the compact is not effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states. ARTICLE XIV BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS (1) A licensee providing professional counseling services in a remote state under the privilege to practice shall adhere to the laws and regulations, including scope of practice, of the remote state. (2) The compact does not prevent the enforcement of any other law of a member state which is not inconsistent with the compact. (3) Any laws in a member state which conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict. (4) Any lawful actions of the commission, including all rules and bylaws properly adopted by the commission, are binding on the member states. (5) All permissible agreements between the commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms. (6) If any provision of the compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any member state, the provision shall be ineffective to the extent of the conflict with the constitutional provision in question in that member state. ARTICLE XV CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY The compact must be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of the compact are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of the compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any member state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of the compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is not affected thereby. If the compact is held contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact remains in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.
