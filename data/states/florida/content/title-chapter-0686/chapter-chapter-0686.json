(2)(a) Each claim for payment under such warranty agreements made by a dealer for such labor and parts shall be paid within 30 days following its approval. Each such claim shall be either approved or disapproved within 30 days after its receipt. When any such claim is disapproved, the dealer who submitted it shall be notified in writing of such disapproval within such period, and such notice shall state the specific grounds upon which the disapproval is based. (b) Any special handling of claims required of the dealer by the manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, factory branch or division, distributor branch or division, or wholesale branch or division, which handling is not uniformly required of all dealers of that make, may be enforced only after 30 days’ notice in writing to the dealer and upon good and sufficient reason. (3)(a) The minimum lawful basis for compensating a dealer for warranty work, as provided for in this section, shall be calculated for labor in accordance with the reasonable and customary amount of time required to complete such work, expressed in hours and fractions of hours multiplied by the dealer’s established hourly retail labor rate. Prior to filing a claim for reimbursement for warranty work, the dealer must notify the applicable manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler of his or her hourly retail labor rate. (b) The minimum lawful basis for compensation to the dealer for parts used in fulfilling such warranty work shall be at the dealer’s costs for such parts, including all freight and handling charges applicable to such parts, plus 15 percent of the sum of such costs and charges to reimburse the dealer’s reasonable cost of doing business and providing such warranty service on behalf of the manufacturer. (4) It shall be unlawful to deny, delay payment for, or restrict a claim by a dealer for warranty service or parts, incentives, hold-backs, or other amounts owed to a dealer unless the denial, delay, or restriction is the direct result of a material defect in the claim that affects its validity. (5) A manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler may audit warranty claims submitted by its dealers only for a period of up to 1 year following payment of such claims and may charge back to its dealers only those amounts based upon paid claims shown by the audit to be invalid. However, this limitation shall not apply in any case of fraudulent claims. (6) Any audit of a dealer by or on behalf of a manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler for sales incentives, service incentives, rebates, or other forms of incentive compensation shall be completed not later than 12 months after the date of termination of such incentive compensation program. However, this limitation shall not apply in any case of fraudulent claims. History.—s. 8, ch. 84-217; s. 736, ch. 97-102; s. 5, ch. 2004-257.

      "text": "686.413 Unlawful acts and practices.—Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of the manufacturing, distribution, wholesaling, franchising, sale, and advertising of equipment are declared to be unlawful. (1) It is deemed a violation of this section for any manufacturer, factory branch, factory representative, distributor, distributor branch, distributor representative, wholesaler, or dealer to engage in any action which is arbitrary, capricious, in bad faith, or unconscionable and which causes damage in terms of law or equity to any of the parties or to the public. (2) It is deemed a violation of this section for a manufacturer, factory branch or division, distributor, distributor branch or division, wholesaler, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent, or other representative thereof, to coerce, compel, or attempt to coerce or compel any dealer: (a) To order or accept delivery of any equipment, parts or accessories therefor, or other commodity or commodities which such dealer has not voluntarily ordered. (b) To order or accept delivery of any equipment with special features, accessories, or equipment not included in the base list price of such equipment as publicly advertised by the manufacturer of the equipment. (3) It is deemed a violation of this section for a manufacturer, factory branch or division, distributor, distributor branch or division, wholesaler, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent, or other representative thereof: (a) To refuse to deliver to any dealer having a franchise or contractual agreement for the retail sale of new equipment sold or distributed by such manufacturer, factory branch or division, distributor branch or division, or wholesale branch or division, in reasonable quantities and within a reasonable time after receipt of the dealer’s order, any equipment covered by such franchise or contract specifically advertised or represented by such manufacturer, factory branch or division, distributor, distributor branch or division, wholesaler, or wholesale branch or division to be available for immediate delivery. However, the failure to deliver any such equipment is not considered a violation of this section if such failure is due to a prudent and reasonable restriction on the extension of credit by the franchisor to the dealer, an act of God, a work stoppage or delay due to a strike or labor difficulty, a bona fide shortage of materials, a freight embargo, or another cause over which the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, or any agent thereof, has no control whatsoever. (b) To coerce, compel, or attempt to coerce or compel any dealer to enter into any agreement, whether written or oral, supplementary to an existing franchise with such manufacturer, factory branch or division, distributor, distributor branch or division, wholesaler, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent, or other representative thereof; or to do any other act prejudicial to such dealer by threatening to cancel any franchise or contractual agreement existing between such manufacturer, factory branch or division, distributor, distributor branch or division, wholesaler, or wholesale branch or division and such dealer. However, notice in good faith to any dealer of such dealer’s violation or breach of any terms or provisions of such franchise or contractual agreement does not constitute a violation of this section if such notice is in writing and is mailed by registered or certified mail to such dealer at her or his current business address and such notice contains the specific facts as to the dealer’s violation or breach of such franchise or contractual agreement. (c)1. To terminate the franchise or selling agreement of any dealer without due cause, as defined in subparagraph 2. The termination of a franchise or selling agreement, without due cause, constitutes an unfair termination, regardless of the specified time period of such franchise or selling agreement. Except when the ground for such termination falls within sub-subparagraph 2.c., such manufacturer, factory branch or division, distributor, distributor branch or division, wholesaler, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent, or other representative thereof, shall notify a dealer in writing of the termination of the franchise or selling agreement of such dealer at least 180 days before the effective date of the termination, stating the specific ground for such termination. In no event shall the contractual term of any such franchise or selling agreement expire, without the written consent of the dealer involved, prior to the expiration of at least 180 days following such written notice. During the 180-day period, either party may, in appropriate circumstances, petition a court of competent jurisdiction to modify such 180-day stay or to extend it pending a final determination of such proceeding on the merits. The court shall have authority to grant temporary, preliminary, and final injunctive relief. Should a dealer cure the claimed deficiency within the 180-day period, the franchise or selling agreement shall not be terminated. 2. As used in this subparagraph, tests for determining what constitutes due cause for a manufacturer or distributor to terminate a franchise agreement include whether the dealer: a. Has transferred an ownership interest in the dealership without the manufacturer’s or distributor’s consent; b. Has made a material misrepresentation in applying for or in acting under the franchise agreement; c. Has filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or has had an involuntary petition in bankruptcy filed against her or him which has not been discharged within 60 days after the filing, is in default under the provisions of a security agreement in effect with the manufacturer or distributor, or is in receivership; d. Has engaged in unfair business or trade practices; e. Has inadequately represented the manufacturer’s or distributor’s products with respect to sales, service, or warranty work; f. Has inadequate and insufficient sales and service facilities and personnel; g. Has failed to comply with an applicable federal, state, or local licensing law; h. Has been convicted of a crime, the effect of which would be detrimental to the manufacturer, distributor, or dealership; i. Has failed to operate in the normal course of business for 10 consecutive business days or has terminated her or his business; j. Has relocated her or his place of business without the manufacturer’s or distributor’s consent; or k. Has failed to comply with the terms that are not in conflict with this chapter or the terms of the dealership or franchise agreement. 3. Before termination of the franchise or selling agreement because of the dealer’s failure to meet marketing criteria or market penetration, the manufacturer, factory branch or division, distributor, distributor branch or division, wholesaler, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent, or other representative thereof, shall provide written notice of such intention at least 1 year in advance. After such notice, the manufacturer or other entity issuing the notice shall make good faith efforts to work with the dealer to gain the desired market share, including, without limitation, reasonably making available to the dealer an adequate inventory of new equipment and parts and competitive marketing programs. The manufacturer or other entity, at the end of the 1-year notice period, may terminate or elect not to renew the agreement only upon further written notice specifying the reasons for determining that the dealer failed to meet reasonable marketing criteria or market penetration. Such written notice must specify that termination is effective 90 days from the date of the notice. Either party may petition the court pursuant to subparagraph 1. for the relief specified in such subparagraph. Should a dealer cure the claimed deficiency within the 90-day period, the franchise or selling agreement shall not be terminated. (d) To resort to or use any false or misleading advertisement in connection with its business as such manufacturer, factory branch or division, distributor, distributor branch or division, wholesaler, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent, or other representative thereof. (e) To offer to sell or to sell any new equipment, or parts or accessories therefor, to any other dealer at a lower actual price therefor than the actual price offered to any other dealer for the same model equipment identically equipped or to utilize any device, including, but not limited to, sales promotion plans or programs, which results in such lesser actual price or results in a fixed price predetermined solely by the manufacturer or distributor. However, the provisions of this paragraph do not apply to sales to a dealer for resale to any unit or agency of the United States Government, the state or any of its political subdivisions, or any municipality located within this state. Further, the provisions of this paragraph do not apply so long as a manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, or any agent thereof, sells or offers to sell such new equipment, parts, or accessories to all of its franchised dealers at an equal price. (f) To willfully discriminate, either directly or indirectly, in price, programs, or terms of sale offered to franchisees, when the effect of such discrimination may be to substantially lessen competition or to give to one holder of a franchise any economic, business, or competitive advantage not offered to all holders of the same or similar franchise. (g) To prevent or attempt to prevent, by contract or otherwise, any dealer from changing the capital structure of her or his dealership or the means by or through which the dealer finances the operation of her or his dealership, provided the dealer at all times meets any reasonable capital standards agreed to between the dealership and the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler and provided such change by the dealer does not result in a change in the executive management of the dealership. (h) To prevent or attempt to prevent, by contract or otherwise, any dealer or any officer, member partner, or stockholder of any dealer from selling or transferring any part of the interest of any of them to any other person or persons or party or parties. However, no dealer, officer, partner, or stockholder has the right to sell, transfer, or assign the franchise or power of management or control thereunder without the written consent of the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, except that such consent may not be unreasonably withheld.

(2) In construing the degree of authenticity of authorship warranted, due regard shall be given to the terminology used in describing the authorship and the meaning accorded to such terminology by the customs and usage of the trade at the time and in the locality where the sale or exchange took place. A written instrument delivered pursuant to a sale which took place in this state which, in describing the work, states, for example: (a) That the work is by a named author or has a named authorship without any other limiting words: means unequivocally that the work is by the named author or has the named authorship. (b) That the work is attributed to a named author: means a work of the period of the author, attributed to her or him, but not with certainty by her or him. (c) That the work is of a school of a named author: means a work of the period of the author, by a pupil or close follower of the author but not by the author. (d) That the rare map, rare print, sculpture, drawing, or other work of art is of the authorship or from the period or date attributed to the work of art.

(2)(a) Each claim for payment under such warranty agreements made by a dealer for such labor and parts shall be paid within 30 days following its approval. Each such claim shall be either approved or disapproved within 30 days after its receipt. When any such claim is disapproved, the dealer who submitted it shall be notified in writing of such disapproval within such period, and such notice shall state the specific grounds upon which the disapproval is based. (b) Any special handling of claims required of the dealer by the manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, factory branch or division, distributor branch or division, or wholesale branch or division, which handling is not uniformly required of all dealers of that make, may be enforced only after 30 days’ notice in writing to the dealer and upon good and sufficient reason. (3)(a) The minimum lawful basis for compensating a dealer for warranty work, as provided for in this section, shall be calculated for labor in accordance with the reasonable and customary amount of time required to complete such work, expressed in hours and fractions of hours multiplied by the dealer’s established hourly retail labor rate. Prior to filing a claim for reimbursement for warranty work, the dealer must notify the applicable manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler of her or his hourly retail labor rate. (b) The minimum lawful basis for compensation to the dealer for parts used in fulfilling such warranty work shall be at the dealer’s costs for such parts, including all freight and handling charges applicable to such parts, plus 15 percent of the sum of such costs and charges to reimburse the dealer’s reasonable cost of doing business and providing such warranty service on behalf of the manufacturer.

(1) It is deemed a violation of this section for any manufacturer, factory branch, factory representative, distributor, distributor branch, distributor representative, wholesaler, or dealer to engage in any action which is arbitrary, capricious, in bad faith, or unconscionable and which causes damage in terms of law or equity to any of the parties or to the public. (2) It is deemed a violation of this section for a manufacturer, factory branch or division, distributor, distributor branch or division, wholesaler, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent, or other representative thereof, to coerce, compel, or attempt to coerce or compel any dealer: (a) To order or accept delivery of any outdoor power equipment or item of such equipment, parts or accessories therefor, or other commodity or commodities which such dealer has not voluntarily ordered. (b) To order or accept delivery of any outdoor power equipment with special features, accessories, or equipment not included in the base list price of such outdoor power equipment as publicly advertised by the manufacturer of the outdoor power equipment. (3) It is deemed a violation of this section for a manufacturer, factory branch or division, distributor, distributor branch or division, wholesaler, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent, or other representative thereof: (a) To refuse to deliver to any dealer having a contractual agreement for the retail sale of new outdoor power equipment sold or distributed by such manufacturer, factory branch or division, distributor branch or division, or wholesale branch or division, in reasonable quantities and within a reasonable time after receipt of the dealer’s order, any outdoor power equipment or item of such equipment covered by such agreement specifically advertised or represented by such manufacturer, factory branch or division, distributor, distributor branch or division, wholesaler, or wholesale branch or division to be available for immediate delivery. However, the failure to deliver any such outdoor power equipment or item of such equipment is not considered a violation of this section if such failure is due to a prudent and reasonable restriction on the extension of credit by the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler to the dealer, an act of God, a work stoppage or delay due to a strike or labor difficulty, a bona fide shortage of materials, a freight embargo, or another cause over which the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, or any agent thereof, has no control whatsoever. (b) To coerce, compel, or attempt to coerce or compel any dealer to enter into any agreement, whether written or oral, supplementary to an existing dealer agreement with such manufacturer, factory branch or division, distributor, distributor branch or division, wholesaler, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent, or other representative thereof; or to do any other act prejudicial to such dealer by threatening to cancel any contractual agreement existing between such manufacturer, factory branch or division, distributor, distributor branch or division, wholesaler, or wholesale branch or division and such dealer. However, notice in good faith to any dealer of such dealer’s violation or breach of any terms or provisions of such contractual agreement does not constitute a violation of this section if such notice is in writing and is mailed by registered or certified mail to such dealer at her or his current business address and such notice contains the specific facts as to the dealer’s violation or breach of such contractual agreement. (c)1. To terminate or cancel the selling agreement of any dealer without due cause, as defined in subparagraph 2. The nonrenewal of a selling agreement, without due cause, constitutes an unfair termination or cancellation, regardless of the specified time period of such selling agreement. Except when the ground for such termination or cancellation falls within sub-subparagraph 2.c., such manufacturer, factory branch or division, distributor, distributor branch or division, wholesaler, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent, or other representative thereof, shall notify a dealer in writing of the termination or cancellation of the selling agreement of such dealer at least 90 days before the effective date of the termination or cancellation, stating the specific ground for such termination or cancellation. In no event shall the contractual term of any such selling agreement expire, without the written consent of the dealer involved, prior to the expiration of at least 90 days following such written notice. During the 90-day period, either party may, in appropriate circumstances, petition a court of competent jurisdiction to modify such 90-day stay or to extend it pending a final determination of such proceeding on the merits. The court shall have authority to grant temporary, preliminary, and final injunctive relief. 2. As used in this subparagraph, tests for determining what constitutes due cause for a manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler to terminate, cancel, or refuse to renew a dealer agreement include whether the dealer: a. Has transferred a majority ownership interest in the dealership without the manufacturer’s, distributor’s, or wholesaler’s consent; b. Has made a material misrepresentation in applying for or in acting under the agreement; c. Has filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or has had an involuntary petition in bankruptcy filed against the dealer which has not been discharged within 60 days after the filing, is in default under the provisions of a security agreement in effect with the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, or is in receivership; d. Has engaged in unfair business or trade practices; e. Has inadequately represented the manufacturer’s, distributor’s, or wholesaler’s products with respect to sales, service, or warranty work; f. Has inadequate and insufficient sales and service facilities and personnel; g. Has failed to comply with an applicable federal, state, or local licensing law; h. Has been convicted of a crime, the effect of which would be detrimental to the manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, or dealership; i. Has failed to operate in the normal course of business for 10 consecutive business days or has terminated the dealer’s business; j. Has relocated the dealer’s place of business without the manufacturer’s, distributor’s, or wholesaler’s consent; or k. Has failed to comply with the terms of the agreement. (d) To resort to or use any false or misleading advertisement in connection with the dealer’s business as such manufacturer, factory branch or division, distributor, distributor branch or division, wholesaler, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent, or other representative thereof. (e) To offer to sell or to sell any new outdoor power equipment or item of such equipment, or parts or accessories therefor, to any other dealer at a lower actual price therefor than the actual price offered to any other dealer for the same model outdoor power equipment identically equipped or to utilize any device, including, but not limited to, sales promotion plans or programs, which results in such lesser actual price or results in a fixed price predetermined solely by the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler. However, the provisions of this paragraph do not apply to sales to a dealer for resale to any unit or agency of the United States Government, the state or any of its political subdivisions, or any municipality located within this state. Further, the provisions of this paragraph do not apply so long as a manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, or any agent thereof, sells or offers to sell such new outdoor power equipment, parts, or accessories to all dealers of such manufacturer’s, distributor’s, or wholesaler’s dealers at an equal price. (f) To willfully discriminate, either directly or indirectly, in price, programs, or terms of sale offered to dealers, when the effect of such discrimination may be to substantially lessen competition or to give to one holder of an agreement any economic, business, or competitive advantage not offered to all holders of the same or similar agreement. (g) To prevent or attempt to prevent, by contract or otherwise, any dealer from changing the capital structure of the dealership or the means by or through which the dealer finances the operation of the dealership, provided the dealer at all times meets any reasonable capital standards agreed to between the dealership and the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler and provided such change by the dealer does not result in a change in the executive management of the dealership. (h) To prevent or attempt to prevent, by contract or otherwise, any dealer or any officer, member partner, or stockholder of any dealer from selling or transferring any part of the interest of any of them to any other person or persons or party or parties. However, no dealer, officer, partner, or stockholder has the right to sell, transfer, or assign the agreement or power of management or control thereunder without the written consent of the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, except that such consent may not be unreasonably withheld. (i) To obtain money, goods, services, anything of value, or any other benefit from any other person with whom the dealer does business or employs on account of or in relation to the transactions between the dealer, the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, and such other person. (j) To require a dealer to assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver, or estoppel which would relieve any person from liability imposed by ss. 686.601-686.614. (4) It is deemed a violation of this section for a dealer: (a) To require a retail purchaser of new outdoor power equipment or item of such equipment, as a condition of sale and delivery of the item or equipment, also to purchase special features, appliances, equipment, parts, or accessories not desired or requested by the purchaser. However, this prohibition does not apply to special features, appliances, equipment, parts, or accessories which are already installed when the outdoor power equipment or item of outdoor power equipment is received by the dealer from the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler of such equipment or item of such equipment. (b) To represent and sell as new and unused any outdoor power equipment or item of such equipment which has been used and operated for demonstration or other purposes without stating to the purchaser prior to the sale the approximate amount of use the outdoor power equipment or item of such equipment has experienced or undergone. (c) To resort to or use any false or misleading advertisement in connection with the dealer’s business as such dealer. History.—s. 1, ch. 97-275; s. 53, ch. 99-7.

(b) Exercise of the option provided by this section shall not relieve the reimbursing party of its obligation to make the reimbursement as required by the contract, but shall affect only the timing of that reimbursement.
