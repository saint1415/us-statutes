      "text": "388.021 Creation of mosquito control special districts.— (1) The abatement or suppression of arthropods, whether disease-bearing or merely pestiferous, within any or all counties of this state is advisable and necessary for the maintenance and betterment of the comfort, health, and welfare of the people thereof and is found and declared to be for public purposes. Areas where arthropods incubate, hatch, or occur in significant numbers so as to constitute a public health, welfare, or nuisance problem may be controlled or abated as provided in this chapter or the rules promulgated hereunder. Therefore, any municipality, town, or county, or any portion or portions thereof, whether such portion or portions include incorporated territory or portions of two or more counties in the state, may be created into a special taxing district for the control of arthropods under the provisions of this chapter. (2) It is the legislative intent that mosquito control districts established prior to July 1, 1980, pursuant to the petition process contained in former s. 388.031, may continue to operate as outlined in this chapter. However, on and after that date, no mosquito control districts may be created except pursuant to s. 125.01.

The three persons receiving the highest number of votes cast in the general election shall serve 4 years and shall take office at the same time as do other county officers, on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in January next after their election, and serve on the same cycle as do other constitutional county officers. (2) The district board of commissioners may, by resolution, elect to increase the membership of the board to five commissioners to be elected on a nonpartisan basis in the manner specified by subsection (1) to terms of 4 years each. (3) The district board of commissioners may, by resolution, elect to stagger the terms of office of the members of the board. If the board of commissioners is composed of three members, at the first general election following the resolution the electors of the district shall elect three commissioners, one to a term of office of 2 years and the other two to terms of office of 4 years. If the board of commissioners is composed of five members, the electors of the district shall, at the first general election following the resolution, elect five commissioners, two to terms of office of 2 years and three to terms of office of 4 years. The board of commissioners shall, in their resolution, designate the term of office of each seat on the board for the purposes of the initial election following the resolution. Each commissioner shall hold his or her office until a successor is elected and qualified. Thereafter, each commissioner shall be elected to a 4-year term of office. (4) The district board of commissioners, if it resolves to increase the membership of the board or stagger the terms of office of the members of the board, must do so at least 1 month prior to the opening of the qualifying period for the next general election. Resolutions to increase board membership and stagger terms of office may be effective at the same general election. (5) The board of county commissioners shall call and provide for said election. Members of the district board of commissioners shall be resident registered electors. History.—s. 2, ch. 59-195; s. 1, ch. 63-236; s. 10, ch. 80-281; s. 4, ch. 86-203; s. 690, ch. 95-148.

(b) Criteria regarding aerial spraying on private lands of pesticides, petroleum products, or other substances for control of adult arthropods which minimize the deposition onto and the potential for substantial adverse effects to environmentally sensitive and biologically highly productive public lands caused by such airborne substances. In the promulgation of such rules, the department shall consider the recommendations of the Florida Coordinating Council on Mosquito Control. (c) Requirements that all arthropod control pesticides, including adulticides and larvicides, be used only in accordance with the registered label and labeling or be otherwise accepted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency or the department. (d) Protection of the health, safety, and welfare of arthropod control employees, the general public, and the natural resources of this state in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. (3) The department is authorized to adopt rules which are more detailed or stringent than, but not otherwise inconsistent with, the label requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. (4) The department shall adopt rules which establish criteria for the licensure or certification of all private and public arthropod control applicators and program directors and require recordkeeping and reporting of applicator activities in furtherance of the goal of integrated arthropod control. No licensure or certification shall be required of private applicators controlling arthropods upon their own individual residential or agricultural property. (5) In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, the department’s duly authorized arthropod control operation inspectors may enter upon any licensee’s premises or any location where the licensee keeps or stores records or equipment, at reasonable times, in order to have access for the purpose of inspecting records or any equipment, to inspect lands actually or reported to be exposed to arthropod control pesticides applied by the licensee, to inspect licensee storage or disposal areas, to inspect or investigate complaints against licensees of injury to humans or land resulting from arthropod control pesticides applied by the licensee, or to sample arthropod control pesticides being applied or to be applied by the licensee.

(2)(a) The department shall adopt rules to specify procedures for development and promulgation of a public lands control plan. Such rules shall require that all land management agencies identify environmentally sensitive and biologically highly productive public lands under their control which shall be subject to a public lands control plan. Such public lands shall be identified to the department and the local arthropod control agency along with a description of the purpose for which the lands are managed. All public lands not identified by a land management agency as environmentally sensitive or biologically highly productive shall be subject to the local arthropod control agency’s general work plan.

If the land management agency and the local arthropod control agency fail to agree to such recommended public lands control plan within 30 days of the rendering of such plan, either agency may petition the Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission to determine whether the proposed control plan employs methods which are the minimum necessary and economically feasible to abate a public health or nuisance problem and which impose the least hazard to fish, wildlife, and other natural resources protected or managed in such areas. Unless both parties waive their right to a hearing, the Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission shall direct a hearing officer to hold a hearing within the jurisdiction of the local arthropod control agency pursuant to the provisions of ss. 120.569 and 120.57 and submit a recommended order. The commission shall, within 60 days of receipt of the recommended order, issue a final order adopting a public lands control plan. Consistent with s. 120.57(1)(l), the commission may adopt or modify the proposed control plan. The commission shall adopt rules on the conduct of appeals before the commission. (d) If the adopted public lands control plan provides that the local arthropod control agency shall perform no arthropod control on designated parcels of publicly owned property within the local arthropod control agency’s jurisdiction, the local arthropod control agency shall be deemed to be relieved of responsibility for arthropod control on that parcel for the effective period of the adopted public lands control plan.
