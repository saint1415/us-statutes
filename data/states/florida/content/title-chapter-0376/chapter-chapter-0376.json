Any such vessel shall have on board a “discharge officer,” designated by the contingency plan, who is responsible for training crew members to carry out discharge response efforts required in the contingency plan and coordinating all on-board response efforts in case of a discharge. An adequate plan shall include provisions for on-board response, including notification, verification, pollutant incident assessment, vessel stabilization, discharge mitigation, and on-board discharge containment, in accordance with this chapter, department rules, and the Florida Coastal Pollutant Discharge Contingency Plan. A plan in compliance with the federal requirement for a ship-specific discharge contingency plan shall satisfy the requirements for an adequate ship-specific discharge contingency plan required by this section. (2)(a) A master of a vessel that violates subsection (1) commits a noncriminal infraction and shall be cited for such infraction. The civil penalty for such an infraction shall be $7,500, except as otherwise provided in this subsection. (b) A person charged with a noncriminal infraction under this section may: 1. Pay the civil penalty; 2. Post bond equal to the amount of the applicable civil penalty; or 3. Sign and accept a citation indicating a promise to appear before the county court for the county in which the violation occurred or the county closest to the location at which the violation occurred. The department employee authorized to issue these citations may indicate on the citation the time and location of the scheduled hearing and shall indicate the applicable civil penalty. (c) A person who willfully refuses to post bond or accept and sign a citation commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (d) After complying with the provisions of subparagraph (b)2. or subparagraph (b)3., a person charged with a noncriminal infraction under this section may: 1. Pay the civil penalty, either by mail or in person, within 30 days after the date of receiving the citation; or 2. If the person has posted bond, forfeit the bond by not appearing at the designated time and location. A person cited for an infraction under this section who pays the civil penalty or forfeits the bond has admitted the infraction and waives the right to a hearing on the issue of commission of the infraction. Such admission may not be used as evidence in any other proceedings. (e) A person who elects to appear before the county court or who is required to appear waives the limitations of the civil penalty specified in paragraph (a). The court, after a hearing, shall make a determination as to whether an infraction has been committed. If the commission of the infraction is proved, the court shall impose a civil penalty of $7,500. (f) At a hearing under this subsection, the commission of a charged infraction must be proved by the greater weight of the evidence. (g) A person who is found by the hearing official to have committed an infraction may appeal that finding to the circuit court. (h) A person who has not posted bond and who fails either to pay the civil penalty specified in paragraph (a) within 30 days after receipt of the citation or to appear before the court commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.

Notwithstanding the above requirement, the department may undertake the removal of the discharge and may contract and retain agents who shall operate under the direction of the department. (2) If the person causing a discharge, or the person in charge of facilities at which a discharge has taken place, fails to act, the department may arrange for the removal of the pollutant, except that if the pollutant was discharged into or upon the navigable waters of the United States, the department shall act in accordance with the national contingency plan for removal of such pollutant as established pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, or other federal law, and the costs of removal incurred by the department shall be paid in accordance with the applicable provisions of federal law. Federal funds shall be used to the maximum extent possible prior to the expenditure of state funds. (3) In the event of discharge the source of which is unknown, any local discharge cleanup organization shall, upon the request of the department or its designee, immediately contain and remove the discharge. No action taken by any person to contain or remove a discharge, whether such action is taken voluntarily or at the request of the department or its designee, shall be construed as an admission of liability for the discharge. (4) No person who, voluntarily or at the request of the department or its designee, renders assistance in containing or removing pollutants shall be liable for any civil damages to third parties resulting solely from acts or omissions of such person in rendering such assistance, except for acts or omissions amounting to gross negligence or willful misconduct. (5) Notwithstanding the provisions in subsection (4), any person who is authorized by the department or the Federal Government or the person alleged to be responsible for the discharge, or by a designee thereof, to render assistance in containing or removing pollutants shall not be liable for costs, expenses, and damages, unless such costs, expenses, and damages are a proximate result of acts or omissions caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct of such authorized person. (6) Nothing in ss. 376.011-376.21 shall affect the right of any person to render assistance in containing or removing any pollutant or any rights which that person may have against any third party whose acts or omissions in any way have caused or contributed to the discharge of the pollutant. (7)(a) Any person, other than the responsible party, who renders assistance in containing or removing any pollutant may assert a claim against the fund, under s. 376.12, for reimbursement of the reasonable costs expended for containment, abatement, or removal, provided prior approval for such reimbursement is granted by the department. The department may, upon petition and for good cause shown, waive the prior-approval prerequisite. (b) A responsible party may assert a claim against the fund only under the following circumstances: 1. A responsible party who complies with the requests of the state and federal on-scene coordinators and later pleads and proves a valid defense under s. 376.12 may assert a claim against the fund, pursuant to s. 376.123, for reimbursement of the reasonable costs expended for containment, abatement, or removal. 2. A responsible party who complies with the requests of the state and federal on-scene coordinators and later pleads and proves a valid limitation of liability under s. 376.12 may assert a claim against the fund, pursuant to s. 376.123, for reimbursement of the reasonable costs expended in excess of the applicable limitation of liability. 3. If the department has determined, pursuant to s. 376.12(3)(b)2., that a particular request by a state or federal on-scene coordinator for the responsible party’s cooperation or assistance was unreasonable, the responsible party may assert a claim against the fund, pursuant to s. 376.123, for reimbursement of the costs expended in complying with the particular request. (8) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including provisions relating to discharge prohibitions or permit requirements, the federal on-scene coordinator or the department may authorize discharges in connection with activities related to removal of pollutants that have entered the waters of the state.

Interest received on such investment shall be credited to the fund, except as otherwise specified herein. (6) Moneys in the Florida Coastal Protection Trust Fund may be used for the following purposes: (a) To carry out the purposes of ss. 376.011-376.21.

When the teams and equipment are not needed for these purposes they may be used for any other valid purpose of the department. (j) To provide a temporary transfer of funds in an amount not to exceed $10 million to the Minerals Trust Fund as set forth in s. 376.40. (k) Funding for marine law enforcement. (7) Any interest in lands acquired using moneys in the Florida Coastal Protection Trust Fund shall be held by the Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund, and such lands shall be acquired pursuant to the procedures set forth in s. 253.025.

      "text": "376.121 Liability for damage to natural resources.—The Legislature finds that extensive damage to the state’s natural resources is the likely result of a pollutant discharge and that it is essential that the state adequately assess and recover the cost of such damage from responsible parties. It is the state’s goal to recover the costs of restoration from the responsible parties and to restore damaged natural resources to their predischarge condition. In many instances, however, restoration is not technically feasible. In such instances, the state has the responsibility to its citizens to recover the cost of all damage to natural resources. To ensure that the public does not bear a substantial loss as a result of the destruction of natural resources, the procedures set out in this section shall be used to assess the cost of damage to such resources. Natural resources include coastal waters, wetlands, estuaries, tidal flats, beaches, lands adjoining the seacoasts of the state, and all living things except human beings. The Legislature recognizes the difficulty historically encountered in calculating the value of damaged natural resources. The value of certain qualities of the state’s natural resources is not readily quantifiable, yet the resources and their qualities have an intrinsic value to the residents of the state, and any damage to natural resources and their qualities should not be dismissed as nonrecoverable merely because of the difficulty in quantifying their value. In order to avoid unnecessary speculation and expenditure of limited resources to determine these values, the Legislature hereby establishes a schedule for compensation for damage to the state’s natural resources and the quality of said resources. As an alternative to the compensation schedule described in subsections (4), (5), (6), and (9), the department, when no responsible party is identified, when a responsible party opts out of the formula pursuant to paragraph (10)(a), or when the department conducts a cooperative damage assessment with federal agencies, may use methods of calculating natural resources damages in accordance with federal rules implementing the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended. (1) The department shall assess and recover from responsible parties the compensation for the injury or destruction of natural resources, including, but not limited to, the death or injury of living things and damage to or destruction of habitat, resulting from pollutant discharges prohibited by s. 376.041. The amount of compensation and any costs of assessing damage and recovering compensation received by the department shall be deposited into the Florida Coastal Protection Trust Fund pursuant to s. 376.12 and disbursed according to subsection (11). Whoever violates, or causes to be violated, s. 376.041 shall be liable to the state for damage to natural resources. (2) The compensation schedule for damage to natural resources is based upon the cost of restoration and the loss of ecological, consumptive, intrinsic, recreational, scientific, economic, aesthetic, and educational values of such injured or destroyed resources. The compensation schedule takes into account: (a) The volume of the discharge. (b) The characteristics of the pollutant discharged. The toxicity, dispersibility, solubility, and persistence characteristics of a pollutant as affects the severity of the effects on the receiving environment, living things, and recreational and aesthetic resources. Pollutants have varying propensities to injure natural resources based upon their potential exposure and effects. Exposure to natural resources is determined by the dispersibility and degradability of the pollutant. Effects to natural resources result from mechanical injury and toxicity and include physical contamination, smothering, feeding prevention, immobilization, respiratory distress, direct mortality, lost recruitment of larvae and juveniles killed, changes in the food web, and chronic effects of sublethal levels of contaminates in tissues or the environment. For purposes of the compensation schedule, pollutants have been ranked for their propensity to cause injury to natural resources based upon a combination of their acute toxicity, mechanical injury, degradability, and dispersibility characteristics on a 1-to-3 relative scale with Category 1 containing the pollutants with the greatest propensity to cause injury to natural resources. The following pollutants are categorized: 1. Category 1: bunker and residual fuel. 2. Category 2: waste oils, crude oil, lubricating oil, asphalt, and tars. 3. Category 3: hydraulic fluids, numbers 1 and 2 diesel fuels, heating oil, jet aviation fuels, motor gasoline, including aviation gasoline, kerosene, stationary turbine fuels, ammonia and its derivatives, and chlorine and its derivatives. (c) The type and sensitivity of natural resources affected by a discharge, determined by the following factors: 1. The location of a discharge. Inshore discharges are discharges that occur within waters under the jurisdiction of the department and within an area extending seaward from the coastline of the state to a point 1 statute mile seaward of the coastline. Nearshore discharges are discharges that occur more than 1 statute mile, but within 3 statute miles, seaward of the coastline. Offshore discharges are discharges that occur more than 3 statute miles seaward of the coastline. 2. The location of the discharge with respect to special management areas designated because of their unique habitats; living resources; recreational use; aesthetic importance; and other ecological, educational, consumptive, intrinsic, scientific, and economic values of the natural resources located therein. Special management areas are state parks; recreation areas; national parks, seashores, estuarine research reserves, marine sanctuaries, wildlife refuges, and national estuary program water bodies; state aquatic preserves and reserves; classified shellfish harvesting areas; areas of critical state concern; federally designated critical habitat for endangered or threatened species; and outstanding Florida waters. 3. The areal or linear extent of the natural resources impacted. (3) Compensation for damage to natural resources for any discharge of less than 25 gallons of gasoline or diesel fuel shall be $50. (4) Compensation schedule: (a) The amount of compensation assessed under this schedule is calculated by: multiplying $1 per gallon or its equivalent measurement of pollutant discharged, by the number of gallons or its equivalent measurement, times the location of the discharge factor, times the special management area factor. (b) Added to the amount obtained in paragraph (a) is the value of the observable natural resources damaged, which is calculated by multiplying the areal or linear coverage of impacted habitat by the corresponding habitat factor, times the special management area factor. (c) The sum of paragraphs (a) and (b) is then multiplied by the pollutant category factor. (d) The final damage assessment figure is the sum of the amount calculated in paragraph (c) plus the compensation for death of endangered or threatened species, plus the cost of conducting the damage assessment as determined by the department. (5)(a) The factors used in calculating the damage assessment are: 1. Location of discharge factor: a. Discharges that originate inshore have a factor of eight. Discharges that originate nearshore have a factor of five. Discharges that originate offshore have a factor of one. b. Compensation for damage to natural resources resulting from discharges that originate outside of state waters but that traverse the state’s boundaries and therefore have an impact upon the state’s natural resources shall be calculated using a location factor of one. c. Compensation for damage to natural resources resulting from discharges of less than 10,000 gallons of pollutants which originate within 100 yards of an established terminal facility or point of routine pollutant transfer in a designated port authority as defined in s. 315.02 shall be assessed a location factor of one. 2. Special management area factor: Discharges that originate in special management areas described in subparagraph (2)(c)2. have a factor of two. Discharges that originate outside a special management area described in subparagraph (2)(c)2. have a location factor of one. For discharges that originate outside of a special management area but impact the natural resources within a special management area, the value of the natural resources damaged within the area shall be multiplied by the special management area factor of two. 3. Pollutant category factor: Discharges of category 1 pollutants have a factor of eight. Discharges of category 2 pollutants have a factor of four. Discharges of category 3 pollutants have a factor of one. 4. Habitat factor: The amount of compensation for damage to the natural resources of the state is established as follows: a. $10 per square foot of coral reef impacted. b. $1 per square foot of mangrove or seagrass impacted. c. $1 per linear foot of sandy beach impacted. d. $0.50 per square foot of live bottom, oyster reefs, worm rock, perennial algae, saltmarsh, or freshwater tidal marsh impacted. e. $0.05 per square foot of sand bottom or mud flats, or combination thereof, impacted. (b) The areal and linear coverage of habitat impacted shall be determined by the department using a combination of field measurements, aerial photogrammetry, and satellite imagery. An area is impacted when the pollutant comes in contact with the habitat. (6) It is understood that a pollutant will, by its very nature, result in damage to the flora and fauna of the waters of the state and the adjoining land. Therefore, compensation for such resources, which is difficult to calculate, is included in the compensation schedule. Not included, however, in this base figure is compensation for the death of endangered or threatened species directly attributable to the pollutant discharged. Compensation for the death of any animal designated by rule as endangered by the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is $10,000. Compensation for the death of any animal designated by rule as threatened by the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is $5,000. These amounts are not intended to reflect the actual value of said endangered or threatened species, but are included for the purposes of this section. (7) The owner or operator of the vessel or facility responsible for a discharge may designate a representative or agent to work with the department in assessing the amount of damage to natural resources resulting from the discharge. (8) When assessing the amount of damages to natural resources, the department shall be assisted, if requested by the department, by representatives of other state agencies and local governments that would enhance the department’s damage assessment. The Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission shall assist the department in the assessment of damages to wildlife impacted by a pollutant discharge and shall assist the department in recovering the costs of such damages. (9) Compensation for damage resulting from the discharge of two or more pollutants shall be calculated for the volume of each pollutant discharged. If the separate volume for each pollutant discharged cannot be determined, the highest multiplier for the pollutants discharged shall be applied to the entire volume of the spill. Compensation for commingled discharges that contact habitat shall be calculated on a proportional basis of discharged volumes. The highest multiplier for such commingled pollutants may only be applied if a reasonable proportionality of the commingled pollutants cannot be determined at the point of any contact with natural resources. (10) For cases in which the department is authorized to use a method of natural resources damage assessment other than the compensation schedules described in subsections (4), (5), (6), and (9), the department may use the methods described in federal rules implementing the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended. (a) When a responsible party is identified and the department is not conducting a cooperative damage assessment with federal agencies, the person responsible has the option to pay the amount of compensation calculated pursuant to the compensation schedule established in subsection (4) or pay the amount determined by a damage assessment performed by the department. If the person responsible for the discharge elects to have a damage assessment performed, then such person shall notify the department in writing of such decision within 30 days after identification of the discharge by the department. The decision to have a damage assessment performed to determine compensation for a discharge shall be final; the person responsible for a discharge may not later elect to use the compensation schedule for computing compensation. Failure to make such notice shall result in the amount of compensation for the total damage to natural resources being calculated based on the compensation schedule. The compensation shall be paid within 90 days after receipt of a written request from the department. (b) In the event the person responsible for a discharge elects to have a damage assessment performed, said person shall pay to the department an amount equal to the compensation calculated pursuant to subsection (4) for the discharge using the lesser of the volume of the discharge or a volume of 30,000 gallons. The payment shall be made within 90 days after receipt of a written request from the department. (c) After completion of the damage assessment, the department shall advise the person responsible for the discharge of the amount of compensation due to the state. A credit shall be given for the amount paid pursuant to paragraph (b). Payment shall be made within 90 days after receipt of a written request from the department. (11)(a) Moneys recovered by the department as compensation for damage to natural resources shall be expended only for the following purposes: 1. To the maximum extent practicable, the restoration of natural resources damaged by the discharge for which compensation is paid. 2. Restoration of damaged resources. 3. Developing restoration and enhancement techniques for natural resources. 4. Investigating methods for improving and refining techniques for containment, abatement, and removal of pollutants from the environment, especially from mangrove forests, corals, seagrasses, benthic communities, rookeries, nurseries, and other habitats which are unique to Florida’s coastal environment. 5. Developing and updating the “Sensitivity of Coastal Environments and Wildlife to Spilled Oil in Florida” atlas. 6. Investigating the long-term effects of pollutant discharges on natural resources, including pelagic organisms, critical habitats, and marine ecosystems. 7. Developing an adequate wildlife rescue and rehabilitation program. 8. Expanding and enhancing the state’s pollution prevention and control education program. 9. Restoring natural resources previously impacted by pollutant discharges, but never completely restored. 10. Funding alternative projects selected by the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund. Any such project shall be selected on the basis of its anticipated benefits to the marine natural resources available to the residents of this state who previously benefited from the injured or destroyed nonrestorable natural resources. (b) All interest earned from investment of moneys recovered by the department for damage to natural resources shall be expended only for the activities described in paragraph (a). (c) The person or parties responsible for a discharge for which the department has requested compensation for damage pursuant to this section shall pay the department, within 90 days after receipt of the request, the entire amount due to the state. In the event that payment is not made within the 90 days, the person or parties are liable for interest on the outstanding balance, which interest shall be calculated at the rate prescribed under s. 55.03. (12) Any determination or assessment of damage to natural resources for the purposes of this section by the department in accordance with the compensation sections or in accordance with the rules adopted under subsection (10) shall have the force and effect of rebuttable presumption on behalf of the department in any administrative or judicial proceeding. (13) There shall be no double recovery under this law for natural resource damage resulting from a discharge, including the costs of damage assessment or restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition for the same incident and natural resource. The department shall meet with and develop memoranda of understanding with appropriate federal trustees as defined in Pub. L. No. 101-380 (Oil Pollution Act of 1990) to provide further assurances of no double recovery.

A violation is punishable by a civil penalty of up to $75,000 per violation per day to be assessed by the department. Each day during any portion of which the violation occurs constitutes a separate offense. The penalty provisions of this subsection do not apply to any discharge promptly reported and removed by a person responsible, in accordance with the rules and orders of the department, or to any discharge of pollutants equal to or less than 5 gallons. (2) In addition to the penalty provisions which may apply under subsection (1), a person responsible for two or more discharges of any pollutant reported pursuant to s. 376.12 within a 12-month period at the same facility commits a noncriminal infraction and shall be cited by the department for such infraction. (a) For discharges of gasoline or diesel over 5 gallons, the civil penalty for the second discharge shall be $750 and the civil penalty for each subsequent discharge within a 12-month period shall be $1,500, except as otherwise provided in this section. (b) For discharges of any pollutant other than gasoline or diesel, the civil penalty for a second discharge shall be $3,750 and the civil penalty for each subsequent discharge within a 12-month period shall be $7,500, except as otherwise provided in this section. (3) A person responsible for two or more discharges of any pollutant reported pursuant to s. 376.12 within a 12-month period at the same facility commits a noncriminal infraction and shall be cited by the department for such infraction. (a) For discharges of gasoline or diesel equal to or less than 5 gallons, the civil penalty shall be $75 for each discharge subsequent to the first. (b) For discharges of pollutants other than gasoline or diesel equal to or less than 5 gallons, the civil penalty shall be $150 for each discharge subsequent to the first. (4) A person charged with a noncriminal infraction pursuant to subsection (2) or subsection (3) may: (a) Pay the civil penalty; (b) Post a bond equal to the amount of the applicable civil penalty; or (c) Sign and accept a citation indicating a promise to appear before the county court. The department employee authorized to issue these citations may indicate on the citation the time and location of the scheduled hearing and shall indicate the applicable civil penalty. (5) Any person who willfully refuses to post bond or accept and sign a citation commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (6) After compliance with paragraph (4)(b) or paragraph (4)(c), any person charged with a noncriminal infraction under subsection (2) or subsection (3) may: (a) Pay the civil penalty, either by mail or in person, within 30 days after the date of receiving the citation; or (b) If the person has posted bond, forfeit the bond by not appearing at the designated time and location. A person cited for an infraction under this section who pays the civil penalty or forfeits the bond has admitted the infraction and waives the right to a hearing on the issue of commission of the infraction. Such admission may not be used as evidence in any other proceeding. (7) Any person who elects to appear before the county court or who is required to appear waives the limitations of the civil penalties specified in subsection (2). The court, after a hearing, shall make a determination as to whether an infraction has been committed. If the commission of an infraction is proved, the court may impose a civil penalty up to, but not exceeding, $750 for the second discharge of gasoline or diesel and a civil penalty up to, but not exceeding, $1,500 for each subsequent discharge of gasoline or diesel within a 12-month period. (8) Any person who elects to appear before the county court or who is required to appear waives the limitations of the civil penalties specified in subsection (2) or subsection (3). The court, after a hearing, shall make a determination as to whether an infraction has been committed. If the commission of an infraction is proved, the court may impose a civil penalty up to, but not exceeding, $7,500 for the second discharge of pollutants other than gasoline or diesel and a civil penalty up to, but not exceeding, $15,000 for each subsequent discharge of pollutants other than gasoline or diesel within a 12-month period. (9) At a hearing under this section, the commission of a charged offense must be proved by the greater weight of the evidence. (10) A person who is found by a hearing official to have committed an infraction may appeal that finding to the circuit court. (11) Any person who has not posted bond and who neither pays the applicable civil penalty, as specified in subsection (2) or subsection (3) within 30 days of receipt of the citation nor appears before the court commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (12) Any person who makes or causes to be made a false statement that the person does not believe to be true in response to requirements of ss. 376.011-376.21 commits a felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.

However, such an undertaking to contain, remove, or abate a discharge shall not be deemed an admission of responsibility for the discharge by the person taking such action. Notwithstanding this requirement, the department may undertake the removal of the discharge and may contract and retain agents who shall operate under the direction of the department. (2) If the person causing the discharge, or the person in charge of facilities at which the discharge has taken place, fails to act immediately, the department may arrange for the removal of the pollutant; except that, if the pollutant was discharged into or upon the navigable waters of the United States, the department shall act in accordance with the national contingency plan for removal of such pollutant as established pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, and the costs of removal incurred by the department shall be paid in accordance with the applicable provisions of that law. Federal funds provided under that act shall be used to the maximum extent possible prior to the expenditure of state funds. (3) No action taken by any person to contain or remove a discharge, whether such action is taken voluntarily or at the request of the department or its designee, shall be construed as an admission of liability for the discharge. (4) No person who, voluntarily or at the request of the department or its designee, renders assistance in containing or removing any pollutant shall be liable for any civil damages to third parties resulting solely from the acts or omissions of such person in rendering such assistance, except for acts or omissions amounting to gross negligence or willful misconduct. (5) Nothing in ss. 376.30-376.317 shall affect the right of any person to render assistance in containing or removing any pollutant or any rights which that person may have against any third party whose acts or omissions in any way have caused or contributed to the discharge of the pollutant. (6) The Legislature created the Abandoned Tank Restoration Program in response to the need to provide financial assistance for cleanup of sites that have abandoned petroleum storage systems. For purposes of this subsection, the term “abandoned petroleum storage system” means a petroleum storage system that has not stored petroleum products for consumption, use, or sale since March 1, 1990. The department shall establish the Abandoned Tank Restoration Program to facilitate the restoration of sites contaminated by abandoned petroleum storage systems. (a) To be included in the program: 1. An application must be submitted to the department certifying that the system has not stored petroleum products for consumption, use, or sale at the facility since March 1, 1990. 2. The owner or operator of the petroleum storage system when it was in service must have ceased conducting business involving consumption, use, or sale of petroleum products at that facility on or before March 1, 1990. 3. The site is not otherwise eligible for the cleanup programs pursuant to s. 376.3072. 4. The site is not otherwise eligible for the Petroleum Cleanup Participation Program under s. 376.3071(13) based on any discharge reporting form received by the department before January 1, 1995, or a written report of contamination submitted to the department on or before December 31, 1998. (b) In order to be eligible for the program, petroleum storage systems from which a discharge occurred must be closed pursuant to department rules before an eligibility determination. However, if the department determines that the owner of the facility cannot financially comply with the department’s petroleum storage system closure requirements and all other eligibility requirements are met, the petroleum storage system closure requirements shall be waived. The department shall take into consideration the owner’s net worth and the economic impact on the owner in making the determination of the owner’s financial ability. (c) Sites accepted in the program are eligible for site rehabilitation funding as provided in s. 376.3071. (d) The following sites are excluded from eligibility: 1. Sites on property of the Federal Government; 2. Sites contaminated by pollutants that are not petroleum products; or 3. Sites where the department has been denied site access. (e) Participating sites are subject to a deductible as determined by rule, not to exceed $10,000.

(b) Most cattle-dipping vats were constructed with public funds and operated under local, state, and Federal Government supervision and control. (c) Most vats were used to dip cattle and other livestock owned by several different persons, irrespective of ownership of the property on which the vat was located. (d) Throughout most of the tick eradication program, the state established criteria for chemical solutions to be used in the vats; annually bid, purchased, and distributed materials to be used in said chemical solutions; and expressly authorized use of chemicals, including, but not limited to, various arsenicals, DDT, and Toxaphene. (e) Cattle-dipping vats are located on lands presently both privately and publicly owned. (f) Participation in the cattle fever tick eradication program was mandated by state law. Livestock owners who failed to participate were subjected to criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment, and civil penalties, including, but not limited to, condemnation and killing of their livestock, payment of costs for the killing and disposal of carcasses by the sheriff or her or his deputies, and payment of fees for dipping performed by the state. (g) Private owners of property upon which cattle-dipping vats are located should not be held liable for any costs, damages, or penalties arising or resulting from participation in the cattle fever tick eradication program. (2) Any private owner of property in this state upon which cattle-dipping vats are located shall not be liable to the state under any state law, or to any other person seeking to enforce state law, for any costs, damages, or penalties associated with the discharge, evaluation, contamination, assessment, or remediation of any substances or derivatives thereof that were used in the vat for the eradication of the cattle fever tick. This provision shall be broadly construed to the benefit of said private owner. History.—s. 1, ch. 96-351; s. 48, ch. 97-96.

      "text": "376.307 Water Quality Assurance Trust Fund.— (1) The Water Quality Assurance Trust Fund is intended to serve as a broad-based fund for use in responding to incidents of contamination that pose a serious danger to the quality of groundwater and surface water resources or otherwise pose a serious danger to the public health, safety, or welfare. Moneys in this fund may be used: (a) To carry out the provisions of ss. 376.30-376.317, relating to assessment, cleanup, restoration, monitoring, and maintenance of any site involving spills, discharges, or escapes of pollutants or hazardous substances which occur as a result of procedures taken by private and governmental entities involving the storage, transportation, and disposal of such products. (b) To carry out the provisions of s. 376.3078, relating to assessment, cleanup, restoration, monitoring, and maintenance of sites involving drycleaning products. (c) For activities to expeditiously restore or replace potable water supplies as provided in s. 376.30(3)(c)1. (d) For response actions under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. (e) To restore or replace contaminated private potable water wells or water systems. However, funds used as provided in this paragraph must be expended for water supply systems or filters for contaminated potable water wells only as follows: 1. Persons who have contaminated potable water wells that were permitted and constructed after January 1, 1989, in accordance with standards adopted under s. 373.309 are eligible for: a. Subsidies to connect to existing water supply systems or extensions thereof. However, the subsidy may not exceed the present worth of the 10-year cost of providing and maintaining filters for residents served by the connections; or b. Filters and filter maintenance to provide treatment for water from contaminated wells sufficient to ensure its potability. However, a filter may not be provided for a potable water well designed to provide water to a household that is part of a subdivision or development of a size that would, according to the department, be more effectively served by a water supply system, if the subdivision or development received its development order after January 1, 1989. 2. Subsidies to develop new water supply systems to be permitted and constructed after January 1, 1989, in accordance with standards adopted pursuant to s. 373.309 because of actual or potential contamination of potable water wells. However, a subsidy may not exceed one-half of the present worth of the 10-year cost of providing and maintaining filters for the residents to be served by the system. 3. The most cost-effective remedy, as determined by the department, for wells drilled before January 1, 1989. 4. Persons permitting and constructing potable water wells on or after July 1, 1997, in accordance with standards adopted pursuant to s. 373.309 because of actual or potential contamination, may be eligible for: a. Subsidies or filters as identified in sub-subparagraphs 1.a. and b.; or b. Subsidies for any increased costs associated with potable water well construction pursuant to s. 373.309(1)(e)4., provided that no such subsidy shall exceed one-half the cost of the well including testing, or one-half the present worth of the 10-year cost of providing and maintaining filters for the residents to be served by said well, whichever is less, provided that the household is not part of a subdivision or development of a size that would, according to the department, be more effectively served by a water supply system, if such subdivision or development received its development order on or after July 1, 1997. (f) For activities by the department to administer brownfield sites. (g) For detailed planning for and implementation of programs for the management and restoration of ecosystems. (h) For development and implementation of surface water improvement and management plans and programs under ss. 373.451-373.4595. (i) For activities to restore polluted areas of the state, as defined by the department, to their condition before pollution occurred or to otherwise enhance pollution control activities. (j) For activities undertaken by the department to recover moneys as a result of actions against a person for a violation of chapter 373. (k) For funding activities described in s. 403.086(10) which are authorized for implementation under the Leah Schad Memorial Ocean Outfall Program. (l) For funding activities to restore or rehabilitate injured or destroyed coral reefs. (2) Moneys in the fund may not be expended for sites eligible for funding under ss. 376.3071 and 376.3073, relating to the Inland Protection Trust Fund. (3) Moneys in the fund may not be expended to clean up hazardous waste that a federal agency is removing from navigable waters in accordance with the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan, established pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Pub. L. No. 92-500, as amended, or that the department is removing from any coastal waters, estuaries, tidal flats, beaches, or lands adjoining the coastline of the state pursuant to this chapter. (4) The trust fund shall be funded as follows: (a) An annual transfer of interest funds from the Florida Coastal Protection Trust Fund pursuant to s. 376.11(6)(g). (b) All excise taxes levied, collected, and credited to the Water Quality Assurance Trust Fund in accordance with the provisions of ss. 206.9935(2) and 206.9945(1)(b). (c) All penalties, judgments, recoveries, reimbursements, and other fees and charges related to the enforcement of ss. 376.30-376.317, other than penalties, judgments, and other fees and charges related to the enforcement of ss. 376.3071 and 376.3073. (d) The fee on the retail sale of lead-acid batteries credited to the Water Quality Assurance Trust Fund under s. 403.7185. (e) All penalties, judgments, recoveries, reimbursements, loans, and other fees and charges collected under s. 376.3078; tax revenues levied, collected, and credited under ss. 376.70 and 376.75; and registration fees collected under s. 376.303(1)(d). (f) All civil penalties recovered pursuant to s. 373.129(5)(a). (g) Funds appropriated by the Legislature for the purposes of ss. 373.451-373.4595. (h) Moneys collected pursuant to s. 403.121 and designated for deposit into the Water Quality Assurance Trust Fund. (i) Moneys recovered by the state as a result of actions initiated by the department against a person for a violation of chapter 373 or chapter 403. (j) Damages recovered pursuant to s. 403.93345 for coral reef protection. (k) Funds available for the Leah Schad Memorial Ocean Outfall Program pursuant to s. 403.08601. (l) Funds received by the state for injury to or destruction of coral reefs, which funds would otherwise be deposited into the General Revenue Fund or the Internal Improvement Trust Fund. The department may enter into settlement agreements that require responsible parties to pay a third party to fund projects related to the restoration of a coral reef, to accomplish mitigation for injury to a coral reef, or to support the activities of law enforcement agencies related to coral reef injury response, investigation, and assessment. Participation of a law enforcement agency in the receipt of funds through this mechanism shall be at the law enforcement agency’s discretion. (m) Moneys from sources otherwise specified by law. (5) Except as otherwise provided by law, the department shall recover to the use of the fund from a person or persons at any time causing or having caused the discharge or from the Federal Government, jointly and severally, all sums owed or expended from the fund, pursuant to s. 376.308, except that the department may decline to pursue such recovery if it finds the amount involved too small or the likelihood of recovery too uncertain. Sums recovered as a result of damage due to discharge of a pollutant or other similar disaster shall be apportioned between the fund and the General Revenue Fund so as to repay the full costs to the General Revenue Fund of any sums disbursed therefrom as a result of such disaster. Any request for reimbursement to the fund for such costs, if not paid within 30 days of demand, shall be turned over to the department for collection. (6) Moneys in the fund which are not needed currently to meet the obligations of the department in the exercise of its responsibilities under this section shall be deposited with the Chief Financial Officer to the credit of the fund and may be invested in such manner as is provided for by statute. The interest received on such investment shall be credited to the fund. Any provisions of law to the contrary notwithstanding, such interest may be freely transferred between this trust fund and the Inland Protection Trust Fund, in the discretion of the department. (7) Except as otherwise provided by law, the department, in administering the fund, shall diligently pursue the reimbursement to the fund of any sum expended from the fund in accordance with this section for cleanup and abatement, unless the department finds the amount involved too small or the likelihood of recovery too uncertain. For the purposes of s. 95.11, the limitation period within which to institute an action to recover such sums commences on the last date on which any such sums were expended, and not the date that the discharge occurred. (8) A settlement entered into by the department may not limit the Legislature’s authority to appropriate moneys from the trust fund; however, the department may enter into a settlement in which the department agrees to request that moneys received pursuant to the settlement will be included in its legislative budget request for purposes set out in the settlement; and further, the department may enter into a settlement in cases involving joint enforcement with the Hillsborough County pollution control program, as a program approved by the department pursuant to s. 403.182, in which the department agrees that moneys are to be deposited into that local program’s pollution recovery fund and used for projects directed toward addressing the environmental damage that was the subject of the cause of action for which funds were received.

      "text": "376.30702 Contamination notification.— (1) FINDINGS; INTENT; APPLICABILITY.—The Legislature finds and declares that when contamination is discovered by any person as a result of site rehabilitation activities conducted pursuant to the risk-based corrective action provisions found in s. 376.3071(5), s. 376.3078(4), s. 376.81, or s. 376.30701, it is in the public’s best interest that potentially affected persons be notified of the existence of such contamination. Therefore, persons discovering such contamination shall notify the department of such discovery in accordance with the requirements of this section, and the department shall be responsible for notifying the affected public. The Legislature intends for the provisions of this section to govern the notice requirements for early notification of the discovery of contamination. (2) INITIAL NOTICE OF CONTAMINATION BEYOND PROPERTY BOUNDARIES.—If at any time during site rehabilitation conducted pursuant to s. 376.3071(5), s. 376.3078(4), s. 376.81, or s. 376.30701 the person responsible for site rehabilitation, the person’s authorized agent, or another representative of the person discovers from laboratory analytical results that comply with appropriate quality assurance protocols specified in department rules that contamination as defined in applicable department rules exists in any medium beyond the boundaries of the property at which site rehabilitation was initiated pursuant to s. 376.3071(5), s. 376.3078(4), s. 376.81, or s. 376.30701, the person responsible for site rehabilitation shall give actual notice as soon as possible, but no later than 10 days from such discovery, to the Division of Waste Management at the department’s Tallahassee office. The actual notice shall be provided on a form adopted by department rule and mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested. The person responsible for site rehabilitation shall simultaneously mail a copy of such notice to the appropriate department district office, county health department, and all known lessees and tenants of the source property. The notice shall include the following information: (a) The location of the property at which site rehabilitation was initiated pursuant to s. 376.3071(5), s. 376.3078(4), s. 376.81, or s. 376.30701 and contact information for the person responsible for site rehabilitation, the person’s authorized agent, or another representative of the person. (b) A listing of all record owners of any real property, other than the property at which site rehabilitation was initiated pursuant to s. 376.3071(5), s. 376.3078(4), s. 376.81, or s. 376.30701, at which contamination has been discovered; the parcel identification number for any such real property; the owner’s address listed in the current county property tax office records; and the owner’s telephone number. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply to the notice to known tenants and lessees of the source property. (c) Separate tables by medium, such as groundwater, soil, surface water, or sediment, that list sampling locations; sampling dates; names of contaminants detected above cleanup target levels; their corresponding cleanup target levels; the contaminant concentrations; and whether the cleanup target level is based on health, nuisance, organoleptic, or aesthetic concerns. (d) A vicinity map that shows each sampling location with corresponding laboratory analytical results and the date on which the sample was collected and that identifies the property boundaries of the property at which site rehabilitation was initiated pursuant to s. 376.3071(5), s. 376.3078(4), s. 376.81, or s. 376.30701 and the other properties at which contamination has been discovered during such site rehabilitation. (3) DEPARTMENT’S NOTICE RESPONSIBILITIES.—Within 30 days after receiving the actual notice required pursuant to subsection (2), or within 30 days of the effective date of this act if the department already possesses information equivalent to that required by the notice, the department shall send a copy of such notice, or an equivalent notification, to all record owners of any real property, other than the property at which site rehabilitation was initiated pursuant to s. 376.3071(5), s. 376.3078(4), s. 376.81, or s. 376.30701, at which contamination has been discovered. If the property at which contamination has been discovered is the site of a school as defined in s. 1003.01, the department shall also send a copy of the notice to the chair of the school board of the district in which the property is located and direct said school board to provide actual notice to teachers and parents or guardians of students attending the school during the period of site rehabilitation. Along with the copy of the notice or its equivalent, the department shall include a letter identifying sources of additional information about the contamination and a telephone number to which further inquiries should be directed. The department may collaborate with the Department of Health to develop such sources of information and to establish procedures for responding to public inquiries about health risks associated with contaminated sites. (4) RULEMAKING AUTHORITY.—The department shall adopt rules and forms pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 to implement the requirements of this section. History.—s. 2, ch. 2005-50.

      "text": "376.30713 Advanced cleanup.— (1) In addition to the legislative findings provided in s. 376.3071, the Legislature finds and declares: (a) That the inability to conduct site rehabilitation in advance of a site’s priority ranking pursuant to s. 376.3071(5)(a) may substantially impede or prohibit property redevelopment, property transactions, or the proper completion of public works projects. (b) While the first priority of the state is to provide for protection of the public health, safety, and welfare; water resources; and the environment, the viability of commerce is of equal importance to the state. (c) It is in the public interest and of substantial economic benefit to the state to provide an opportunity for site rehabilitation to be conducted on a limited basis at contaminated sites, in advance of the site’s priority ranking, to encourage redevelopment and facilitate property transactions or public works projects. (d) It is appropriate for a person who is responsible for site rehabilitation to share the costs associated with managing and conducting advanced cleanup, to facilitate the opportunity for advanced cleanup, and to mitigate the additional costs that will be incurred by the state in conducting site rehabilitation in advance of the site’s priority ranking. Such cost sharing will result in more contaminated sites being cleaned up and greater environmental benefits to the state. This section is only available for sites eligible for restoration funding under EDI, ATRP, or PLRIP. This section is available for discharges eligible for restoration funding under the petroleum cleanup participation program for the state’s cost share of site rehabilitation. Applications must include a cost-sharing commitment for this section in addition to the 25-percent-copayment requirement of the petroleum cleanup participation program. This section is not available for any discharge under a petroleum cleanup participation program where the 25-percent-copayment requirement of the petroleum cleanup participation program has been reduced or eliminated pursuant to s. 376.3071(13)(d). (2) The department may approve an application for advanced cleanup at eligible sites, including applications submitted pursuant to paragraph (c), notwithstanding the site’s priority ranking established pursuant to s. 376.3071(5)(a), pursuant to this section. Only the facility owner or operator or the person otherwise responsible for site rehabilitation qualifies as an applicant under this section. (a) Advanced cleanup applications may be submitted between May 1 and June 30 and between November 1 and December 31 of each fiscal year. Applications submitted between May 1 and June 30 shall be for the fiscal year beginning July 1. An application must consist of: 1. A commitment to pay 25 percent or more of the total cleanup cost deemed recoverable under this section along with proof of the ability to pay the cost share. The department shall determine whether the cost savings demonstration is acceptable. Such determination is not subject to chapter 120. a. Applications for the aggregate cleanup of five or more sites may be submitted in one of two formats to meet the cost-share requirement: (I) For an aggregate application proposing that the department enter into a performance-based contract, the applicant may use a commitment to pay, a demonstrated cost savings to the department, or both to meet the requirement. (II) For an aggregate application relying on a demonstrated cost savings to the department, the applicant shall, in conjunction with the proposed agency term contractor, establish and provide in the application the percentage of cost savings in the aggregate that is being provided to the department for cleanup of the sites under the application compared to the cost of cleanup of those same sites using the current rates provided to the department by the proposed agency term contractor. b. Applications for the cleanup of individual sites may be submitted in one of two formats to meet the cost-share requirement: (I) For an individual application proposing that the department enter into a performance-based contract, the applicant may use a commitment to pay, a demonstrated cost savings to the department, or both to meet the requirement. (II) For an individual application relying on a demonstrated cost savings to the department, the applicant shall, in conjunction with the proposed agency term contractor, establish and provide in the application a 25-percent cost savings to the department for cleanup of the site under the application compared to the cost of cleanup of the same site using the current rates provided to the department by the proposed agency term contractor. 2. A nonrefundable review fee of $250 to cover the administrative costs associated with the department’s review of the application. 3. A property owner or responsible party agreement in which the property owner or responsible party commits to continue to participate in the advanced cleanup program upon completion of the limited contamination assessment and finalization of the proposed course of action. 4. A conceptual proposed course of action. 5. A department site access agreement, or similar agreements approved by the department that do not violate state law, entered into with the property owner or owners, as applicable, and evidence of authorization from such owner or owners for petroleum site rehabilitation program tasks consistent with the proposed course of action where the applicant is not the property owner for any of the sites contained in the application. 6. A certification that the applicant has the prerequisite authority to enter into an advanced cleanup contract with the department. The certification must be submitted with the application. (b) The department shall rank the applications based on the percentage of cost-sharing commitment proposed by the applicant, with the highest ranking given to the applicant who proposes the highest percentage of cost sharing. If the department receives applications that propose identical cost-sharing commitments and that exceed the funds available to commit to all such proposals during the advanced cleanup application period, the department shall proceed to rerank those applicants. Those applicants submitting identical cost-sharing proposals that exceed funding availability must be so notified by the department and offered the opportunity to raise their individual cost-share commitments, in a period specified in the notice. At the close of the period, the department shall proceed to rerank the applications pursuant to this paragraph. (c) Applications for the advanced cleanup of individual sites scheduled for redevelopment are not subject to the application period limitations or the requirement to pay 25 percent of the total cleanup cost specified in paragraph (a) or to the cost-sharing commitment specified in paragraph (1)(d). Applications must be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis and are not subject to the ranking provisions of paragraph (b). Applications for the advanced cleanup of individual sites scheduled for redevelopment must include: 1. A nonrefundable review fee of $250 to cover the administrative costs associated with the department’s review of the application. 2. A limited contamination assessment report. The report must be sufficient to support the proposed course of action and to estimate the cost of the proposed course of action. Costs incurred related to conducting and preparing the report are not refundable from the Inland Protection Trust Fund. 3. A proposed course of action for cleanup of the site. 4. If the applicant is not the property owner for any of the sites contained in the application, a department site access agreement, or a similar agreement approved by the department and not in violation of state law, entered into with the property owner or owners, as applicable, and evidence of authorization from such owner or owners for petroleum site rehabilitation program tasks consistent with the proposed course of action. 5. A certification to the department stating that the applicant has the prerequisite authority to enter into an advanced cleanup contract with the department. The advanced cleanup contract must include redevelopment and site rehabilitation milestones. 6. Documentation, in the form of a letter from the local government having jurisdiction over the area where the site is located, which states that the local government is in agreement with or approves the proposed redevelopment and that the proposed redevelopment complies with applicable law and requirements for such redevelopment. 7. A demonstrated reasonable assurance that the applicant has sufficient financial resources to implement and complete the redevelopment project. (d) Upon acceptance of an advanced cleanup application, the applicant’s selected agency term contractor shall submit to the department a scope of work for a limited contamination assessment. When the scope of work is negotiated and agreed upon, the department shall issue one or more purchase orders of up to $35,000 each for the limited contamination assessment. The limited contamination assessment report must be sufficient to support the proposed course of action and to estimate the cost of the proposed course of action. (e) Site eligibility under this section is not an entitlement to advanced cleanup funding or continued restoration funding. (3)(a) Based on the ranking established under paragraph (2)(b), the department shall begin negotiation with such applicants. If the department and the applicant agree on the course of action, the department may enter into a contract with the applicant. The department may negotiate the terms and conditions of the contract. (b) Advanced cleanup shall be conducted pursuant to s. 376.3071(5)(b) and (6) and rules adopted under ss. 287.0595 and 376.3071. If the terms of the advanced cleanup contract are not fulfilled, the applicant forfeits any right to future payment for any site rehabilitation work conducted under the contract. (c) The department’s decision not to enter into an advanced cleanup contract with the applicant is not subject to chapter 120. If the department cannot complete negotiation of the course of action and the terms of the contract within 60 days after beginning negotiations, the department shall terminate negotiations with that applicant. (4) The department may enter into contracts for a total of up to $30 million of advanced cleanup work in each fiscal year. Up to $5 million of these funds may be designated by the department for advanced cleanup of individual sites scheduled for redevelopment under paragraph (2)(c). (a) A facility or an applicant who bundles multiple sites as specified in subparagraph (2)(a)1. may not be approved for more than $5 million of cleanup activity in each fiscal year. (b) A facility or an applicant applying for advanced cleanup of individual sites scheduled for redevelopment pursuant to paragraph (2)(c) may not be approved for more than $1 million of cleanup activity in any one fiscal year. (c) A property owner or responsible party may enter into a voluntary cost-share agreement in which the property owner or responsible party commits to bundle multiple sites and lists the facilities that will be included in those future bundles. The facilities listed are not subject to agency term contractor assignment pursuant to department rule. The department must reserve the right to terminate or amend the voluntary cost-share agreement for any identified site under the voluntary cost-share agreement if the property owner or responsible party fails to submit an application to bundle any site, not already covered by an advance cleanup contract, under such voluntary cost-share agreement within three subsequent open application periods or 18 months, whichever period is shorter, during which it is eligible to participate. The property owner or responsible party must agree to conduct limited site assessments on the identified sites within 12 months after the execution of the voluntary cost-share agreement. For the purposes of this section, the term “facility” includes, but is not limited to, multiple site facilities such as airports, port facilities, and terminal facilities even though such enterprises may be treated as separate facilities for other purposes under this chapter. (5) All funds collected by the department pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the Inland Protection Trust Fund to be used as provided in this section.

      "text": "376.30714 Site rehabilitation agreements.— (1) In addition to the legislative findings provided in s. 376.3071, the Legislature finds and declares: (a) The provisions of s. 376.3071(5)(a) have delayed cleanup of low-priority sites determined to be eligible for state funding under that section and ss. 376.305 and 376.3072. (b) While compliance with the department’s rules pertaining to storage tank systems is expected to significantly diminish the occurrence and extent of discharges of petroleum products from petroleum storage systems, discharges from these systems and discharges at sites with existing contamination which have been determined to be eligible for state-funded cleanup may still occur. In some cases, it may be difficult to distinguish between discharges that have been determined to be eligible for state funding and those discharges reported after December 31, 1998, which are not eligible for state funding. (c) Restoration coverage under s. 376.3072(2)(d) is no longer provided for discharges of petroleum products from petroleum storage systems that are reported to the department after December 31, 1998. This situation may result in discharges that are not eligible for state-funded cleanup occurring on sites with existing contamination determined to be eligible for state-funded cleanup. (d) It is necessary for the discharger, and may be desirable for the department, to address the cleanup of discharges of petroleum products reported to the department after December 31, 1998, including discharges that occur at sites with existing contamination determined to be eligible under ss. 376.305, 376.3071, and 376.3072. (e) It is appropriate for persons assuming responsibility for cleanup of such discharges occurring after December 31, 1998, at sites with existing contamination determined to be eligible for state-funded cleanup, to share the costs associated with managing and conducting cleanup of those discharges upon application to the department and in accordance with a priority established for such cleanup in a negotiated site rehabilitation agreement. (2) For the purposes of this section only, the term: (a) “Applicant” means a facility owner, operator, discharger, or entity who accepts responsibility for cleanup of a new discharge on a qualified site and who applies for and enters into a site rehabilitation agreement with the department. Application for or execution of the site rehabilitation agreement shall not constitute an admission of liability for the new discharge by the applicant. (b) “Existing contamination” means contamination that has been determined by the department to be eligible for state-funded cleanup under s. 376.305, s. 376.3071, or s. 376.3072 prior to the new discharge. (c) “New discharge” means a discharge of petroleum products reported after December 31, 1998, occurring at a site with existing contamination. (d) “Qualified site” means a site with a new discharge and for which the applicant has entered into a site rehabilitation agreement with the department. (3) Free product attributable to a new discharge shall be removed to the extent practicable and pursuant to department rules adopted pursuant to s. 376.3071(5) at the expense of the owner, operator, or other responsible party. Free product attributable to existing contamination shall be removed pursuant to s. 376.3071(5) and (6) and department rules adopted pursuant thereto. (4) Beginning January 1, 1999, the department may negotiate and enter into site rehabilitation agreements with applicants at sites with eligible existing contamination at which a new discharge occurs. The site rehabilitation agreement must include, but is not limited to, allocation of the funding responsibilities of the department and the applicant for cleanup of the qualified site, establishment of a mechanism to guarantee the applicant’s commitment to pay its agreed amount of site rehabilitation as set forth in the agreement, and establishment of the priority in which cleanup of the qualified site will occur. Under such a negotiated site rehabilitation agreement, the applicant may not be responsible for more than the cleanup costs that are attributable to the new discharge. However, the payment of applicable deductibles, copayments, or other program eligibility requirements under ss. 376.305, 376.3071, and 376.3072 shall continue to apply to the existing contamination and must be accounted for in the negotiated site rehabilitation agreement. The department may, pursuant to this section, conduct additional assessment activities at the site. (5)(a) Applications for such site rehabilitation agreements may be submitted to the department not later than 120 days after discovery of the new discharge, on forms and instructions provided by the department, and shall include, but not be limited to: 1. A limited contamination assessment report, which shall be sufficient to demonstrate the extent of the new discharge and which may include any other evidence relevant to establish the extent or volume of the new discharge, or the impact of the new discharge relative to the existing contamination, in order to allocate the appropriate funding responsibilities of the applicant and the department. The limited contamination assessment report shall be used as a basis for establishing the respective site rehabilitation funding responsibilities of the applicant and the department for the new discharge and the existing contamination and for establishing the priority in which cleanup of the new discharge and the existing contamination will occur, based on the provisions of s. 376.3071(5)(a) and taking into consideration the cost-effectiveness associated with the timing of site rehabilitation activities. 2. Certification by the applicant that the applicant has the prerequisite authority to enter into the site rehabilitation agreement. (b) Any costs incurred by the applicant to comply with this subsection are not refundable from the Inland Protection Trust Fund. (c) Only one application may be submitted for any new discharge under this section. (d) The application forms and instructions, and the terms and conditions of the site rehabilitation agreement, except as set forth in subsection (6), shall not be subject to the provisions of chapter 120. (6) In the event the department and the applicant are unable to agree on the apportionment of the funding responsibilities and on the establishment of priority of cleanup for a site otherwise qualified under this section, the provisions of ss. 120.569 and 120.57 shall apply. The administrative law judge shall, in making any determinations or recommendations about the apportionment of the funding responsibilities of the department and the applicant for the new discharge and the existing contamination, consider any admissible evidence relating to apportionment of the discharges. (7) The following shall be excluded from participation under this section: (a) New discharges from storage systems owned or operated by the Federal Government when the new discharge occurred. (b) New discharges at facilities which failed to correct a violation cited at a previous compliance inspection and at which the failure to correct the violation contributed to or caused the new discharge. (c) New discharges intentionally caused by the owner, operator, responsible party, or applicant. (d) Sites at which the department has been denied site access. (e) New discharges at sites that are identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to be on, or which qualify for listing on, the National Priorities List under Superfund. This exception does not apply to those sites for which eligibility has been requested or granted as of the effective date of this act under the Early Detection Incentive Program. (f) New discharges at sites where the person or entity required to report the new discharge upon its discovery as required by department rule, or where the person or entity required to initiate free product recovery upon discovery as required by department rule, adopted pursuant to ss. 376.303 and 376.3071(5), failed to do so. (8) If the department, at its discretion, determines that it is not able to complete negotiation of the agreement within 90 days after commencing negotiations, except as set forth in subsection (6), the department shall terminate negotiations with the applicant and the site shall receive no further consideration under this section. However, if the parties are negotiating in good faith and require additional time in which to continue negotiations, then the parties may mutually agree to continue negotiations. (9) Site rehabilitation conducted at qualified sites shall be conducted pursuant to s. 376.3071(5)(b) and (6). If the terms of the agreement are not fulfilled by the applicant, the applicant forfeits the right to continued funding for site rehabilitation work under the agreement and is subject to enforcement action by the department or local government to compel cleanup of the new discharge. (10) New discharges otherwise meeting the criteria of this section, or any site rehabilitation agreement made under this section, shall not constitute an independent entitlement to continued restoration funding or to cleanup of the existing contamination in advance of its previous priority order. (11) Upon execution of the site rehabilitation agreement, retroactive to the date of discovery of the new discharge, the provisions of s. 376.308(5) shall extend to contamination covered by a site rehabilitation agreement as long as the applicant remains in compliance with the terms and conditions of the agreement. However, if state funding of any agreement entered into under this section is discontinued, the provisions of this subsection shall no longer apply to the new discharge. For purposes of chapter 95, a cause of action to compel cleanup of the new discharge or to compel payment of costs of the new discharge shall not accrue during the time that the site rehabilitation agreement is in effect.

      "text": "376.30716 Cleanup of certain sites.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Exclusion zone” means the subsurface area within 10 feet of an underground storage tank, integral piping, and dispenser, and the area between the underground storage tank and dispenser. (b) “Subsequently discovered discharge” means a discharge or suspected discharge that is discovered on or after July 1, 2005, at a site eligible for state funding under s. 376.305, s. 376.3071, or s. 376.3072. (2) As noted in s. 376.30714, it may be difficult to distinguish between a discharge of petroleum products from a petroleum storage system which is eligible for state funding and a discharge reported after December 31, 1998, which is not eligible for state funding. Until the secondary containment upgrade of underground storage tanks, as required under rule 62-761, Florida Administrative Code, is complete at a site, a subsequently discovered discharge at the site is presumed to be part of the original discharge that qualifies for state funding. However, this presumption does not apply: (a) If the department presents competent and substantial evidence demonstrating that the subsequently discovered discharge occurred from a source that is independent and separate from the discharge that qualifies for state funding. (b) To a site where petroleum storage systems have been upgraded, prior to July 1, 2005, to secondary containment in accordance with rule 62-761, Florida Administrative Code. (c) To a site having newly discovered free product outside the exclusion zone. (d) To a site having an increase in the concentration of existing petroleum contamination outside the exclusion zone of 1,000 percent or greater. (e) To a site for which the department has, by a current valid order, determined that the discharge that is eligible for state funding has been cleaned up or no further action is necessary. (3) Section 376.30714 does not apply to a subsequently discovered discharge. The department shall not, as part of a closure report or assessment for a site that is eligible for state funding under s. 376.305, s. 376.3071, or s. 376.3072, require soil or groundwater sampling. (4) Regardless of whether the presumption specified in subsection (2) applies, a facility owner or operator shall: (a) Report all incidents or discharges in accordance with rules of the department.

Amounts annually appropriated and applied to make payments under such service contracts may not include any funds derived from penalties or other payments received from any property owner or private party, including payments received under s. 376.3071(7)(b). In compliance with s. 287.0641 and other applicable provisions of law, the obligations of the department under such service contracts do not constitute a general obligation of the state or a pledge of the faith and credit or taxing power of the state and such obligations are not an obligation of the State Board of Administration or entities for which it invests funds, other than the department as provided in this section, but are payable solely from amounts available in the Inland Protection Trust Fund, subject to annual appropriation. In compliance with this subsection and s. 287.0582, the service contract must expressly include the following statement: “The State of Florida’s performance and obligation to pay under this contract is contingent upon an annual appropriation by the Legislature.” (5) The corporation may issue and incur notes, bonds, certificates of indebtedness, or other obligations or evidences of indebtedness payable from and secured by amounts payable to the corporation by the department under a service contract entered into pursuant to subsection (4) for the purpose of financing the rehabilitation of petroleum contamination sites pursuant to ss. 376.30-376.317. The term of any such note, bond, certificate of indebtedness, or other obligation or evidence of indebtedness may not have a financing term that exceeds 15 years. The corporation may select its financing team and issue its obligations through competitive bidding or negotiated contracts, whichever is most cost-effective. Indebtedness of the corporation does not constitute a debt or obligation of the state or a pledge of the faith and credit or taxing power of the state but is payable from and secured by payments made by the department under the service contract pursuant to s. 376.3071(4)(n). (6) The fulfillment of the purposes of the corporation promotes the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the state and serves as essential governmental functions and a paramount public purpose. (7) The corporation is exempt from taxation and assessments of any nature upon its income and any property, assets, or revenues acquired, received, or used in the furtherance of the purposes provided in this chapter. The obligations of the corporation incurred pursuant to subsection (5) and the interest and income thereon and all security agreements, letters of credit, liquidity facilities, or other obligations or instruments arising out of, entered into in connection therewith, or given to secure payment thereof are exempt from all taxation, provided such exemption does not apply to any tax imposed by chapter 220 on the interest, income, or profits on debt obligations owned by corporations. (8) The corporation may validate obligations to be incurred pursuant to subsection (5) and the validity and enforceability of any service contracts providing for payments pledged to the payment thereof by proceedings under chapter 75. The validation complaint shall be filed only in the Circuit Court for Leon County. The notice required to be published by s. 75.06 must be published in Leon County, and the complaint and order of the circuit court shall be served only on the State Attorney for the Second Judicial Circuit. Sections 75.04(2) and 75.06(2) do not apply to a complaint for validation filed under this subsection. (9) The corporation is not a special district for the purposes of chapter 189 or a unit of local government for the purposes of part III of chapter 218. The provisions of chapters 120 and 215, except the limitation on interest rates provided by s. 215.84 which applies to obligations of the corporation issued pursuant to this section, and part I of chapter 287, except ss. 287.0582 and 287.0641, do not apply to this section, the corporation, the service contracts entered into pursuant to this section, or debt obligations issued by the corporation as contemplated in this section.

In order to assist drycleaning facilities and wholesale supply facilities in obtaining such insurance coverage, the department may contract with an insurance company, a reinsurance company, or other insurance consultant to issue third-party liability policies. If such third-party insurance is not available, the department shall not provide such insurance from state funds. (2)(a) Any owner or operator of a drycleaning facility or wholesale supply facility may be eligible for third-party liability insurance coverage if the facility is registered with the department pursuant to s. 376.303(1)(d) and is otherwise in compliance with the department’s rules relating to drycleaning facilities or wholesale supply facilities. (b) The following drycleaning facilities or wholesale supply facilities are not eligible for state-assisted third-party liability insurance: 1. Sites owned or operated by the state or Federal Government. 2. Sites where the owner or operator has denied the department site access or where the facility has been determined not to be in compliance with the department’s rules relating to drycleaning facilities or wholesale supply facilities.

The department need only plead and prove that the prohibited discharge or other polluting condition has occurred. The following persons shall be liable to the department for any discharges or polluting condition: (a) Any person who caused a discharge or other polluting condition or who owned or operated the facility, or the stationary tanks or the nonresidential location which constituted the facility, at the time the discharge occurred. (b) In the case of a discharge of hazardous substances, all persons specified in s. 403.727(4). (c) In the case of a discharge of petroleum, petroleum products, or drycleaning solvents, the owner of the facility, the drycleaning facility, or the wholesale supply facility, unless the owner can establish that he or she acquired title to property contaminated by the activities of a previous owner or operator or other third party, that he or she did not cause or contribute to the discharge, and that he or she did not know of the polluting condition at the time the owner acquired title. If the owner acquired title subsequent to July 1, 1992, or, in the case of a drycleaning facility or wholesale supply facility, subsequent to July 1, 1994, he or she must also establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she undertook, at the time of acquisition, all appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and use of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice in an effort to minimize liability. The court or hearing officer shall take into account any specialized knowledge or experience on the part of the defendant, the relationship of the purchase price to the value of the property if uncontaminated, commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property, the obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect such contamination by appropriate inspection. In an action relating to a discharge of petroleum, petroleum products, or drycleaning solvents under chapter 403, the defenses and definitions set forth herein shall apply. (2) In addition to the defense described in paragraph (1)(c), the only other defenses of a person specified in subsection (1) are to plead and prove that the occurrence was solely the result of any of the following or any combination of the following: (a) An act of war; (b) An act of government, either state, federal, or local, unless the person claiming the defense is a governmental body, in which case the defense is available only by acts of other governmental bodies; (c) An act of God, which means only an unforeseeable act exclusively occasioned by the violence of nature without the interference of any human agency; or (d) An act or omission of a third party, other than an employee or agent of the defendant or other than one whose act or omission occurs in connection with a contractual relationship existing, directly or indirectly, with the defendant, except when the sole contractual arrangement arises from a published tariff and acceptance for carriage by a common carrier or by rail, and the defendant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that: 1. The defendant exercised due care with respect to the pollutant concerned, taking into consideration the characteristics of such pollutant, in light of all relevant facts and circumstances. 2. The defendant took precautions against any foreseeable acts or omissions of any such third party and against the consequences that could foreseeably result from such acts or omissions. (3) For purposes of this section, the following additional defenses shall apply to sites contaminated with petroleum or petroleum products: (a) The defendant is a lender serving as a trustee, personal representative, or other type of fiduciary, provided the defendant did not otherwise cause or contribute to the discharge; (b) The defendant is a lender which holds indicia of ownership in the site primarily to protect a security interest, and which has not divested the borrower of, or otherwise engaged in, decisionmaking control over site operations, particularly with respect to the storage, use, or disposal of petroleum or petroleum products, or which otherwise caused or contributed to the discharge; provided, that the financial institution may direct or compel the borrower to maintain compliance with environmental statutes and rules and may act to prevent or abate a discharge; or (c) The defendant is a lender which held a security interest in the site and has foreclosed or otherwise acted to acquire title primarily to protect its security interest, and seeks to sell, transfer, or otherwise divest the assets for subsequent sale at the earliest possible time, taking all relevant facts and circumstances into account, and has not undertaken management activities beyond those necessary to protect its financial interest, to effectuate compliance with environmental statutes and rules, or to prevent or abate a discharge; however, if the facility is not eligible for cleanup pursuant to s. 376.305(6), s. 376.3071, or s. 376.3072, any funds expended by the department for cleanup of the property shall constitute a lien on the property against any subsequent sale after the amount of the former security interest (including the cost of collection, management, and sale) is satisfied. (4) Liability pursuant to this chapter shall be joint and several. However, if more than one discharge occurred and the damage is divisible and may be attributed to a particular defendant or defendants, each defendant is liable only for the costs associated with his or her damages. The burden shall be on the defendant to demonstrate the divisibility of damages. (5) Effective July 1, 1996, and operating retroactively to March 29, 1995, notwithstanding any other provision of law, judgment, consent order, order, or ordinance, no person who owns or operates a facility or who otherwise could be responsible for costs as a result of contamination eligible for restoration funding from the Inland Protection Trust Fund shall be subject to administrative or judicial action, brought by or on behalf of the state or any local government or any other person, to compel rehabilitation in advance of commitment of restoration funding in accordance with a site’s priority ranking pursuant to s. 376.3071(5)(a) or to pay for the costs of rehabilitation of environmental contamination resulting from a discharge of petroleum products that is eligible for restoration funding from the Inland Protection Trust Fund. For purposes of chapter 95, a cause of action to compel rehabilitation of environmental contamination at a facility resulting from a discharge of petroleum products that is eligible for restoration funding, or to compel payment of costs for environmental contamination resulting from a discharge of petroleum products that is eligible for restoration funding, shall not accrue until restoration funding can be committed to the facility or environmental contamination in accordance with the priority ranking.

(2) Except as provided in subsection (3), the state preempts the regulation of the prevention and removal of pollutant discharges from a facility described in subsection (1) which has no single tank having a capacity exceeding 40,000 gallons at any time. (3) A county government is authorized to adopt countywide ordinances that regulate underground storage tanks, as described herein, which ordinances are the same as or more stringent or extensive than any state law or rule regulating such tanks, provided: (a) The original ordinance was legally adopted and in force before September 1, 1984; or (b) The ordinance establishing a more stringent or extensive local program is approved by the department pursuant to subsection (5) after the county demonstrates to the department that it has effectively administered the state law or rules for a period of 2 years prior to filing a petition for approval. However, any county which has sought approval of a local tank program from the department prior to January 1, 1988, shall not be required to demonstrate that it has effectively administered the state program for any minimum period. (4) The department shall either approve or disapprove a request to contract for a compliance verification program authorized pursuant to s. 376.3073 within 90 days after receipt of the complete application. If approved, the department shall provide full funding to the local government to carry out the contracted compliance and enforcement responsibilities pursuant to s. 376.3073. The department may not disapprove an application due to the population size of a county and may delegate compliance verification and enforcement to those local governments who agree to enforce the state’s program jointly. (5) The department is authorized to permit any county government to establish, in accordance with s. 403.182, a program regulating underground storage tanks, which program is more stringent or extensive than that established by any state law or rule regulating underground storage tanks. The department shall approve or deny a request by a county for approval of an ordinance establishing such a program according to the procedures and time limits of s. 120.60. The department shall consider local conditions that warrant such more stringent or extensive regulation of underground storage tanks, including, but not limited to, the proximity of the county to a sole or single-source aquifer, the potential threat to the public water supply because of the proximity of underground storage tanks to public wells or groundwater, or the detection of petroleum products in public or private water supplies. (6) A county government may adopt an ordinance regulating underground storage tanks that is the same as any state law or rule regulating such tanks upon approval by the department of a completed application.

      "text": "376.40 Petroleum exploration and production; purposes; funding.— (1) FINDINGS.—The Legislature declares that the financial resources of the state in the form of a bond trust fund, the limits of which are in excess of limits available to most operators, should be available to provide the Department of Environmental Protection the surety for any cleanup and remedial action for operations which are not conducted in a safe and environmentally compatible manner. (2) INTENT AND PURPOSE.—It is the intent of the Legislature that the Minerals Trust Fund serve as a repository for funds which will enable the Department of Environmental Protection to respond without delay to incidents which affect safety or threaten to cause environmental damage or contamination as a result of incidents involving petroleum exploration and production activities and which are not otherwise handled in a timely manner by the operator or permittee. The useful life of facilities used to produce oil and natural gas in the state can be from 15 to 40 years and it is the Legislature’s intent that safe and environmentally compatible operations be conducted for the economic life of any well, field, or production facility. It is the further intent of the Legislature that this trust fund make available immediately to the department funds sufficient to correct violations such as an operator’s failure to adequately plug, abandon, or restore production sites or other test sites and facilities after operations cease, if the permittee or operator cannot or will not correct the violations within a reasonable time. Furthermore, it is the Legislature’s intent that if an amount in excess of the funds on deposit in the trust fund is needed for remedial action, money from the Florida Coastal Protection Trust Fund be made available in the form of a temporary transfer of funds. The temporary transfer shall be repaid as soon as possible after the department obtains penalties, judgments, recoveries, or reimbursements. (3) USES.— (a) When the department has reason to believe that incidents of contamination related to the conduct of operations, including, but not limited to, drilling of exploratory or production wells, operation and maintenance of producing wells, pressure maintenance wells, or disposal wells, and related gathering lines, may pose a threat to the environment or the public health, safety, or welfare, or if the permittee, owner, or operator of such facility does not take immediate remedial or other approved corrective action, the department shall obligate moneys available from fees collected and deposited pursuant to subsection (4) in the trust fund to provide for: 1. Prompt investigation and assessment of surface or underground contamination or other permit violations; 2. Prompt remedial action to repair, replace, or restore to a safe condition test sites, wells, and facilities at the affected site or location; 3. Rehabilitation of contamination at sites, which rehabilitation shall include cleanup of contaminated soils, groundwater, and surface waters to minimize environmental damage; 4. Maintenance and monitoring of sites or facilities that have been repaired, replaced, or restored; 5. Inspection and supervision of activities described in this section; 6. Payment of expenses incurred by the department in its efforts to obtain from responsible parties the payment or recovery of reasonable costs resulting from activities described in this section; or 7. Payment of any other reasonable costs of administration. (b) The department may also use moneys from the trust fund to conduct routine inspections of exploratory or production wells, pressure maintenance wells, disposal wells, and related gathering lines. (4) FUNDING.—There shall be deposited in the Minerals Trust Fund: (a) All fees charged permittees under ss. 377.24(1), 377.2408(1), and 377.2425(1)(b). (b) All penalties, judgments, recoveries, reimbursements, and other fees and charges related to the implementation of this section. (c) Any other funds required to be deposited in the trust fund under provisions of law. If moneys on deposit in the trust fund are not sufficient to satisfy the needed remedial or corrective action, and if the responsible party does not take remedial and corrective action in a timely manner or if a catastrophic event occurs, a temporary transfer of the required amount, or a maximum of $10 million, from the Florida Coastal Protection Trust Fund pursuant to s. 376.11(6)(j) is authorized. The Florida Coastal Protection Trust Fund shall be reimbursed immediately upon deposit into the Minerals Trust Fund of moneys referred to in paragraph (b). (5) RECOVERY.—The department shall recover to the use of the trust fund from the permittee for any facilities for petroleum exploration or production, petroleum gathering, or other exploration or production activities all sums expended from the trust fund pursuant to this section. Requests for reimbursement to the trust fund for such costs, if not paid within 120 days after demand, shall be turned over to the Department of Legal Affairs for collection. (6) INVESTMENTS; INTEREST.—Moneys in the trust fund which are not needed currently to meet the obligations of the department in the exercise of its responsibilities under this section shall be deposited with the Chief Financial Officer to the credit of the trust fund and may be invested as provided by law.

The tax shall be at a rate of 2 percent of all charges imposed by the drycleaning facility or the dry drop-off facility for the drycleaning or laundering of clothing or other fabrics. Gross receipts from coin-operated laundry machines and from laundry done on a wash, dry, and fold basis shall not be subject to tax. (2) Each drycleaning facility or dry drop-off facility imposing a charge for the drycleaning or laundering of clothing or other fabrics is required to register with the Department of Revenue and become licensed for the purposes of this section. The owner or operator of the facility shall register the facility with the Department of Revenue. Drycleaning facilities or dry drop-off facilities operating at more than one location are only required to have a single registration. (3) The tax imposed by this section is due on the 1st day of the month succeeding the month in which the charge is imposed and shall be paid on or before the 20th day of each month. The tax shall be reported on forms and in the manner prescribed by the Department of Revenue by rule. The proceeds of the taxes, after deducting the administrative costs incurred by the Department of Revenue in administering, auditing, collecting, distributing, and enforcing the tax, shall be transferred by the Department of Revenue into the Water Quality Assurance Trust Fund and shall be used as provided in s. 376.3078. For the purposes of this section, the proceeds of the tax include all funds collected and received by the Department of Revenue, including interest and penalties on delinquent taxes. (4) Any drycleaning facility which includes in the total retail charge to a consumer of drycleaning services any portion of the tax imposed pursuant to this section shall disclose on the receipt for the amount charged for such services the amount of such tax and a statement that the imposition of the tax was requested by the Florida Dry Cleaners Coalition. (5) Gross receipts arising from charges for services taxable pursuant to this section to persons who also impose charges to others for those same services are exempt from the tax imposed pursuant to this section. (6)(a) The Department of Revenue shall administer, collect, and enforce the tax imposed under this section pursuant to the procedures for administration, collection, and enforcement of the general state sales tax imposed under chapter 212, except as provided in this subsection. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, those regarding the filing of consolidated returns, the granting of sale for resale exemptions, and the interest and penalties on delinquent taxes. The tax shall not be included in the computation of estimated taxes pursuant to s. 212.11, nor shall the dealer’s credit for collecting taxes or fees in s. 212.12 apply. The provisions of s. 212.07(4) shall not apply to the tax imposed by this section. (b) The Department of Revenue is authorized to employ persons and incur other expenses for which funds are appropriated by the Legislature. The Department of Revenue is empowered to adopt such rules and shall prescribe and publish such forms as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section. (c) The Department of Revenue is authorized to establish audit procedures and to assess delinquent taxes. (7) The department shall not deny eligibility in the drycleaning solvent cleanup program because of the facility owner’s, the facility operator’s, and the real property owner’s failure to remit all taxes due pursuant to this section and s. 376.75, unless the Department of Revenue: (a) Ascertains the amount of the delinquent tax, if any, and communicates this amount in writing to the drycleaning solvent cleanup program applicant and the real property owner; and (b) Provides a method to the facility owner, the facility operator, and the real property owner for the payment of the taxes. Pursuant to this subsection, the owner or operator of a drycleaning facility must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department of Revenue that failure to remit all taxes due in a timely manner was not due to willful and overt actions to avoid payment of taxes. (8) The Legislature declares that the failure to promptly implement the provisions of this section would present an immediate threat to the welfare of the state. Therefore, the executive director of the Department of Revenue is authorized to adopt emergency rules pursuant to s. 120.54(4) to implement this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, such emergency rules shall remain effective for 180 days from the date of adoption. Other rules of the Department of Revenue related to and in furtherance of the orderly implementation of this section shall not be subject to a s. 120.56(2) rule challenge or a s. 120.54(3)(c)2. drawout proceeding, but, once adopted, shall be subject to a s. 120.56(3) invalidity challenge.

      "text": "376.78 Legislative intent.—The Legislature finds and declares the following: (1) The reduction of public health and environmental hazards on sites proposed to be rehabilitated and redeveloped is vital to their use and reuse as sources of employment, housing, recreation, and open space areas. The reuse of such sites is an important component of sound land use policy for productive urban purposes which will help prevent the premature development of farmland, open space areas, and natural areas, and reduce public costs for installing new water, sewer, and highway infrastructure. (2) The abandonment or underuse of brownfield sites also results in the inefficient use of public facilities and services, as well as land and other natural resources, extends conditions of blight in local communities, and contributes to concerns about environmental equity and the distribution of environmental risks across population groups. (3) Incentives should be put in place to encourage responsible persons to voluntarily develop and implement cleanup plans without the use of taxpayer funds or the need for enforcement actions by state and local governments. (4) Environmental and public health hazards cannot be eliminated without clear, predictable remediation standards that provide for the protection of the environment and public health. (5) Site rehabilitation should be based on the actual risk that contamination may pose to the environment and public health, taking into account current and future land and water use and the degree to which contamination may spread and place the public or the environment at risk. (6) According to the statistical proximity study contained in the final report of the Environmental Equity and Justice Commission, minority and low-income communities are disproportionately impacted by targeted environmentally hazardous sites. The results indicate the need for the health and risk exposure assessments of minority and poverty populations around environmentally hazardous sites in this state. Redevelopment of hazardous sites should address questions relating to environmental and health consequences. (7) Environmental justice considerations should be inherent in meaningful public participation elements of a brownfields redevelopment program. (8) The existence of brownfields within a community may contribute to, or may be a symptom of, overall community decline, including issues of human disease and illness, crime, educational and employment opportunities, and infrastructure decay. The environment is an important element of quality of life in any community, along with economic opportunity, educational achievement, access to health care, housing quality and availability, provision of governmental services, and other socioeconomic factors. Brownfields redevelopment, properly done, can be a significant element in community revitalization, especially within community redevelopment areas, enterprise zones, empowerment zones, closed military bases, or designated brownfield pilot project areas. (9) Cooperation among federal, state, and local agencies, local community development organizations, and current owners and prospective purchasers of brownfield sites is required to accomplish timely cleanup activities and the redevelopment or reuse of brownfield sites.

(7) “Contaminant” means any physical, chemical, biological, or radiological substance present in any medium which may result in adverse effects to human health or the environment or which creates an adverse nuisance, organoleptic, or aesthetic condition in groundwater. (8) “Contaminated site” means any contiguous land, sediment, surface water, or groundwater areas that contain contaminants that may be harmful to human health or the environment. (9) “Department” means the Department of Environmental Protection. (10) “Engineering controls” means modifications to a site to reduce or eliminate the potential for exposure to chemicals of concern from petroleum products, drycleaning solvents, or other contaminants. Such modifications may include, but are not limited to, physical or hydraulic control measures, capping, point of use treatments, or slurry walls. (11) “Environmental justice” means the fair treatment of all people of all races, cultures, and incomes with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. (12) “Institutional controls” means the restriction on use of or access to a site to eliminate or minimize exposure to chemicals of concern from petroleum products, drycleaning solvents, or other contaminants. Such restrictions may include, but are not limited to, deed restrictions, restrictive covenants, or conservation easements. (13) “Local pollution control program” means a local pollution control program that has received delegated authority from the Department of Environmental Protection under ss. 376.80(9) and 403.182.

Right to be removed from proposed brownfield area.—If a property owner within the area proposed for designation by the local government requests in writing to have his or her property removed from the proposed designation, the local government must grant the request. 4. Notice and public hearing requirements for designation of a proposed brownfield area outside a redevelopment area or by a nongovernmental entity. Compliance with the following provisions is required before designation of a proposed brownfield area under paragraph (2)(a) or paragraph (2)(c): a. At least one of the required public hearings must be conducted as closely as is reasonably practicable to the area to be designated to provide an opportunity for public input on the size of the area, the objectives for rehabilitation, job opportunities and economic developments anticipated, neighborhood residents’ considerations, and other relevant local concerns. b. Notice of a public hearing must be made in a newspaper of general circulation in the area, must be made in ethnic newspapers or local community bulletins, must be posted in the affected area, and must be announced at a scheduled meeting of the local governing body before the actual public hearing. (2)(a) Local government-proposed brownfield area designation outside specified redevelopment areas.—If a local government proposes to designate a brownfield area that is outside a community redevelopment area, enterprise zone, empowerment zone, closed military base, or designated brownfield pilot project area, the local government shall provide notice, adopt the resolution, and conduct public hearings pursuant to paragraph (1)(c). At a public hearing to designate the proposed brownfield area, the local government must consider: 1. Whether the brownfield area warrants economic development and has a reasonable potential for such activities; 2. Whether the proposed area to be designated represents a reasonably focused approach and is not overly large in geographic coverage; 3. Whether the area has potential to interest the private sector in participating in rehabilitation; and 4. Whether the area contains sites or parts of sites suitable for limited recreational open space, cultural, or historical preservation purposes. (b) Local government-proposed brownfield area designation within specified redevelopment areas.—Paragraph (a) does not apply to a proposed brownfield area if the local government proposes to designate the brownfield area inside a community redevelopment area, enterprise zone, empowerment zone, closed military base, or designated brownfield pilot project area and the local government complies with paragraph (1)(c). (c) Brownfield area designation proposed by persons other than a governmental entity.—For designation of a brownfield area that is proposed by a person other than the local government, the local government with jurisdiction over the proposed brownfield area shall provide notice and adopt a resolution to designate the brownfield area pursuant to paragraph (1)(c) if, at the public hearing to adopt the resolution, the person establishes all of the following: 1. A person who owns or controls a potential brownfield site is requesting the designation and has agreed to rehabilitate and redevelop the brownfield site. 2. The rehabilitation and redevelopment of the proposed brownfield site will result in economic productivity of the area, along with the creation of at least 5 new permanent jobs at the brownfield site that are full-time equivalent positions not associated with the implementation of the brownfield site rehabilitation agreement and that are not associated with redevelopment project demolition or construction activities pursuant to the redevelopment of the proposed brownfield site or area. However, the job creation requirement does not apply to the rehabilitation and redevelopment of a brownfield site that will provide affordable housing as defined in s. 420.0004 or the creation of recreational areas, conservation areas, or parks. 3. The redevelopment of the proposed brownfield site is consistent with the local comprehensive plan and is a permittable use under the applicable local land development regulations. 4. Notice of the proposed rehabilitation of the brownfield area has been provided to neighbors and nearby residents of the proposed area to be designated pursuant to paragraph (1)(c), and the person proposing the area for designation has afforded to those receiving notice the opportunity for comments and suggestions about rehabilitation. Notice pursuant to this subparagraph must be posted in the affected area. 5. The person proposing the area for designation has provided reasonable assurance that he or she has sufficient financial resources to implement and complete the rehabilitation agreement and redevelopment of the brownfield site. (d) Negotiation of brownfield site rehabilitation agreement.—The designation of a brownfield area and the identification of a person responsible for brownfield site rehabilitation simply entitles the identified person to negotiate a brownfield site rehabilitation agreement with the department or approved local pollution control program. (3) When there is a person responsible for brownfield site rehabilitation, the local government must notify the department of the identity of that person. If the agency or person who will be responsible for the coordination changes during the approval process specified in subsections (4), (5), and (6), the department or the affected approved local pollution control program must notify the affected local government when the change occurs. (4) Local governments or persons responsible for rehabilitation and redevelopment of brownfield areas must establish an advisory committee or use an existing advisory committee that has formally expressed its intent to address redevelopment of the specific brownfield area for the purpose of improving public participation and receiving public comments on rehabilitation and redevelopment of the brownfield area, future land use, local employment opportunities, community safety, and environmental justice. Such advisory committee should include residents within or adjacent to the brownfield area, businesses operating within the brownfield area, and others deemed appropriate. The person responsible for brownfield site rehabilitation must notify the advisory committee of the intent to rehabilitate and redevelop the site before executing the brownfield site rehabilitation agreement, and provide the committee with a copy of the draft plan for site rehabilitation which addresses elements required by subsection (5). This includes disclosing potential reuse of the property as well as site rehabilitation activities, if any, to be performed. The advisory committee shall review any proposed redevelopment agreements prepared pursuant to paragraph (5)(i) and provide comments, if appropriate, to the board of the local government with jurisdiction over the brownfield area. The advisory committee must receive a copy of the executed brownfield site rehabilitation agreement. When the person responsible for brownfield site rehabilitation submits a site assessment report or the technical document containing the proposed course of action following site assessment to the department or the local pollution control program for review, the person responsible for brownfield site rehabilitation must hold a meeting or attend a regularly scheduled meeting to inform the advisory committee of the findings and recommendations in the site assessment report or the technical document containing the proposed course of action following site assessment. (5) The person responsible for brownfield site rehabilitation must enter into a brownfield site rehabilitation agreement with the department or an approved local pollution control program if actual contamination exists at the brownfield site. The brownfield site rehabilitation agreement must include: (a) A brownfield site rehabilitation schedule, including milestones for completion of site rehabilitation tasks and submittal of technical reports and rehabilitation plans as agreed upon by the parties to the agreement. (b) A commitment to conduct site rehabilitation activities under the observation of professional engineers or geologists who are registered in accordance with the requirements of chapter 471 or chapter 492, respectively. Submittals provided by the person responsible for brownfield site rehabilitation must be signed and sealed by a professional engineer registered under chapter 471, or a professional geologist registered under chapter 492, certifying that the submittal and associated work comply with the law and rules of the department and those governing the profession. In addition, upon completion of the approved remedial action, the department shall require a professional engineer registered under chapter 471 or a professional geologist registered under chapter 492 to certify that the corrective action was, to the best of his or her knowledge, completed in substantial conformance with the plans and specifications approved by the department. (c) A commitment to conduct site rehabilitation in accordance with department quality assurance rules. (d) A commitment to conduct site rehabilitation consistent with state, federal, and local laws and consistent with the brownfield site contamination cleanup criteria in s. 376.81, including any applicable requirements for risk-based corrective action. (e) Timeframes for the department’s review of technical reports and plans submitted in accordance with the agreement. The department shall make every effort to adhere to established agency goals for reasonable timeframes for review of such documents. (f) A commitment to secure site access for the department or approved local pollution control program to all brownfield sites within the eligible brownfield area for activities associated with site rehabilitation. (g) Other provisions that the person responsible for brownfield site rehabilitation and the department agree upon, that are consistent with ss. 376.77-376.86, and that will improve or enhance the brownfield site rehabilitation process. (h) A commitment to consider appropriate pollution prevention measures and to implement those that the person responsible for brownfield site rehabilitation determines are reasonable and cost-effective, taking into account the ultimate use or uses of the brownfield site. Such measures may include improved inventory or production controls and procedures for preventing loss, spills, and leaks of hazardous waste and materials, and include goals for the reduction of releases of toxic materials. (i) Certification that the person responsible for brownfield site rehabilitation has consulted with the local government with jurisdiction over the brownfield area about the proposed redevelopment of the brownfield site, that the local government is in agreement with or approves the proposed redevelopment, and that the proposed redevelopment complies with applicable laws and requirements for such redevelopment. Certification shall be accomplished by referencing or providing a legally recorded or officially approved land use or site plan, a development order or approval, a building permit, or a similar official document issued by the local government that reflects the local government’s approval of proposed redevelopment of the brownfield site; providing a copy of the local government resolution designating the brownfield area that contains the proposed redevelopment of the brownfield site; or providing a letter from the local government that describes the proposed redevelopment of the brownfield site and expresses the local government’s agreement with or approval of the proposed redevelopment. (6) Any contractor performing site rehabilitation program tasks must demonstrate to the department that the contractor: (a) Meets all certification and license requirements imposed by law; and (b) Will conduct sample collection and analyses pursuant to department rules. (7) During the cleanup process, if the department or local program fails to complete review of a technical document within the timeframe specified in the brownfield site rehabilitation agreement, the person responsible for brownfield site rehabilitation may proceed to the next site rehabilitation task. However, the person responsible for brownfield site rehabilitation does so at its own risk and may be required by the department or local program to complete additional work on a previous task. Exceptions to this subsection include requests for “no further action,” “monitoring only proposals,” and feasibility studies, which must be approved prior to implementation. (8) If the person responsible for brownfield site rehabilitation fails to comply with the brownfield site rehabilitation agreement, the department shall allow 90 days for the person responsible for brownfield site rehabilitation to return to compliance with the provision at issue or to negotiate a modification to the brownfield site rehabilitation agreement with the department for good cause shown. If an imminent hazard exists, the 90-day grace period shall not apply. If the project is not returned to compliance with the brownfield site rehabilitation agreement and a modification cannot be negotiated, the immunity provisions of s. 376.82 are revoked. (9) The department is specifically authorized and encouraged to enter into delegation agreements with local pollution control programs approved under s. 403.182 to administer the brownfield program within their jurisdictions, thereby maximizing the integration of this process with the other local development processes needed to facilitate redevelopment of a brownfield area. When determining whether a delegation pursuant to this subsection of all or part of the brownfield program to a local pollution control program is appropriate, the department shall consider the following. The local pollution control program must: (a) Have and maintain the administrative organization, staff, and financial and other resources to effectively and efficiently implement and enforce the statutory requirements of the delegated brownfield program; and (b) Provide for the enforcement of the requirements of the delegated brownfield program, and for notice and a right to challenge governmental action, by appropriate administrative and judicial process, which shall be specified in the delegation. The local pollution control program shall not be delegated authority to take action on or to make decisions regarding any brownfield site on land owned by the local government. Any delegation agreement entered into pursuant to this subsection shall contain such terms and conditions necessary to ensure the effective and efficient administration and enforcement of the statutory requirements of the brownfield program as established by the act and the relevant rules and other criteria of the department. (10) Local governments are encouraged to use the full range of economic and tax incentives available to facilitate and promote the rehabilitation of brownfield areas, to help eliminate the public health and environmental hazards, and to promote the creation of jobs and economic development in these previously run-down, blighted, and underutilized areas. (11)(a) The Legislature finds and declares that: 1. Brownfield site rehabilitation and redevelopment can improve the overall health of a community and the quality of life for communities, including for individuals living in such communities. 2. The community health benefits of brownfield site rehabilitation and redevelopment should be better measured in order to achieve the legislative intent as expressed in s. 376.78. 3. There is a need in this state to define and better measure the community health benefits of brownfield site rehabilitation and redevelopment. 4. Funding sources should be established to support efforts by the state and local governments, in collaboration with local health departments, community health providers, and nonprofit organizations, to evaluate the community health benefits of brownfield site rehabilitation and redevelopment. (b) Local governments may and are encouraged to evaluate the community health benefits and effects of brownfield site rehabilitation and redevelopment in connection with brownfield areas located within their jurisdictions. Factors that may be evaluated and monitored before and after brownfield site rehabilitation and redevelopment include, but are not limited to: 1. Health status, disease distribution, and quality of life measures regarding populations living in or around brownfield sites that have been rehabilitated and redeveloped. 2. Access to primary and other health care or health services for persons living in or around brownfield sites that have been rehabilitated and redeveloped. 3. Any new or increased access to open, green, park, or other recreational spaces that provide recreational opportunities for individuals living in or around brownfield sites that have been rehabilitated and redeveloped. 4. Other factors described in rules adopted by the Department of Environmental Protection or the Department of Health, as applicable. (c) The Department of Health may and is encouraged to assist local governments, in collaboration with local health departments, community health providers, and nonprofit organizations, in evaluating the community health benefits of brownfield site rehabilitation and redevelopment. (12) A local government that designates a brownfield area pursuant to this section is not required to use the term “brownfield area” within the name of the brownfield area designated by the local government.

      "text": "376.82 Eligibility criteria and liability protection.— (1) ELIGIBILITY.— (a) All of the following persons are eligible to participate in the brownfield program established in ss. 376.77-376.85: 1. Notwithstanding subparagraph 2., a person who has not caused or contributed to the contamination of a brownfield site on or after July 1, 1997. 2. A local governmental entity, including any other person who may be organized or united with the local governmental entity for a business purpose, if such entity or person did not cause or contribute to the contamination of a brownfield site on or after July 1, 2025. (b) A person eligible to participate in the brownfield program pursuant to paragraph (a) is subject to the following: 1. Potential brownfield sites that are subject to an ongoing formal judicial or administrative enforcement action or corrective action pursuant to federal authority, including, but not limited to, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. ss. 9601 et seq., as amended; the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. ss. 300f-300i, as amended; the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. ss. 1251-1387, as amended; or under an order from the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to s. 3008(h) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (42 U.S.C.A. s. 6928(h)); or that have obtained or are required to obtain a permit for the operation of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility; a postclosure permit; or a permit pursuant to the federal Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984, are not eligible for participation in the brownfield program established in ss. 376.77-376.85 unless, pursuant to paragraph (2)(g), the United States Environmental Protection Agency issues a letter stating it has no objection to such participation and the department issues a letter of concurrence. A brownfield site within an eligible brownfield area that subsequently becomes subject to formal judicial or administrative enforcement action or corrective action under such federal authority shall have its eligibility revoked unless, pursuant to paragraph (2)(g), the United States Environmental Protection Agency issues a letter stating it has no objection to such participation and the department issues a letter of concurrence. 2. A person who is eligible to participate in the brownfield program pursuant to paragraph (a) and who, before the department’s approval of a brownfield site rehabilitation agreement, is subject to ongoing corrective action or enforcement under state authority established in this chapter or chapter 403, including those persons subject to a pending consent order with the state, is eligible for participation in a brownfield site rehabilitation agreement if: a. The proposed brownfield site is currently idle or underutilized as a result of the contamination, and participation in the brownfield program will immediately, after cleanup or sooner, result in increased economic productivity at the site, including at a minimum the creation of 10 new permanent jobs, whether full-time or part-time, which are not associated with implementation of the brownfield site rehabilitation agreement. However, the job creation requirement does not apply to the rehabilitation and redevelopment of a brownfield site that will provide housing that is affordable as defined in s. 420.0004; create recreational areas, conservation areas, or parks; or be maintained for cultural or historical preservation purposes; and b. The person is complying in good faith with the terms of an existing consent order or department-approved corrective action plan, or responding in good faith to an enforcement action, as evidenced by a determination issued by the department or an approved local pollution control program. (c) Potential brownfield sites owned by the state or a local government which contain contamination for which a governmental entity is potentially responsible and which are already designated as federal brownfield pilot projects or have filed an application for designation to the United States Environmental Protection Agency are eligible for participation in a brownfield site rehabilitation agreement. (d) After July 1, 1997, petroleum and drycleaning contamination sites shall not receive both restoration funding assistance available for the discharge under this chapter and any state assistance available under s. 288.107. Nothing in this act shall affect the cleanup criteria, priority ranking, and other rights and obligations inherent in petroleum contamination and drycleaning contamination site rehabilitation under ss. 376.30-376.317, or the availability of economic incentives otherwise provided for by law. (2) LIABILITY PROTECTION.— (a) Any person, including his or her successors and assigns, who executes and implements to successful completion a brownfield site rehabilitation agreement, is relieved of: 1. Further liability for remediation of the contaminated site or sites to the state and to third parties. 2. Liability in contribution to any other party who has or may incur cleanup liability for the contaminated site or sites. 3. Liability for claims of property damages, including, but not limited to, diminished value of real property or improvements; lost or delayed rent, sale, or use of real property or improvements; or stigma to real property or improvements caused by contamination addressed by a brownfield site rehabilitation agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, this subparagraph applies to causes of action accruing on or after July 1, 2014. This subparagraph does not apply to a person who discharges contaminants on property subject to a brownfield site rehabilitation agreement, who commits fraud in demonstrating site conditions or completing site rehabilitation of a property subject to a brownfield site rehabilitation agreement, or who exacerbates contamination of a property subject to a brownfield site rehabilitation agreement in violation of applicable laws which causes property damages. (b) This section does not limit the right of a third party other than the state to pursue an action for damages to persons for bodily harm; however, such an action may not compel site rehabilitation in excess of that required in the approved brownfield site rehabilitation agreement or otherwise required by the department or approved local pollution control program. (c) This section shall not affect the ability or authority to seek contribution from any person who may have liability with respect to the contaminated site and who did not receive cleanup liability protection under this act. (d) The liability protection provided under this section shall become effective upon execution of a brownfield site rehabilitation agreement and shall remain effective, provided the person responsible for brownfield site rehabilitation complies with the terms of the site rehabilitation agreement. Any statute of limitations that would bar the department from pursuing relief in accordance with its existing authority is tolled from the time the agreement is executed until site rehabilitation is completed or immunity is revoked pursuant to s. 376.80(8). (e) Completion of the performance of the remediation obligations at the brownfield site shall be evidenced by a site rehabilitation completion order issued by the department or the approved local pollution control program, which letter shall include the following statement: “Based upon the information provided by (property owner) concerning property located at (address) , it is the opinion of (the Florida Department of Environmental Protection or approved local pollution control program) that (party) has successfully and satisfactorily implemented the approved brownfield site rehabilitation agreement schedule and, accordingly, no further action is required to assure that any land use identified in the brownfield site rehabilitation agreement is consistent with existing and proposed uses.” (f) Compliance with s. 376.80(5)(i) must be evidenced as set forth in that paragraph. (g)1. The Legislature recognizes the benefits of promoting the reuse of brownfield sites, even when subject to federal pollution control programs, including those enumerated in subparagraph (1)(b)1. In an effort to encourage such reuse for persons willing to undertake responsibility for site rehabilitation at a brownfield site, the department may, upon receipt of a letter from the United States Environmental Protection Agency stating it has no objection to a site’s participation pursuant to subparagraph (1)(b)1. and upon a reasonable demonstration by the person seeking to participate in the brownfield program that he or she will conduct site rehabilitation pursuant to s. 376.81, issue a letter of no objection that states the person may participate in the brownfield program. The department may not require, as a condition of such letter of concurrence, that the United States Environmental Protection Agency agree to forego enforcement of federal corrective action authority at brownfield sites that have received a site rehabilitation completion order from the department or the approved local pollution control program or that are in the process of implementing a brownfield site rehabilitation agreement in accordance with this act. The letter of no objection from the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the letter of concurrence from the department must be added as attachments to the brownfield site rehabilitation agreement. 2. Proposed brownfield sites that are subject to ongoing formal judicial or administrative enforcement action or corrective action pursuant to an order from the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to s. 3008(h) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended by 42 U.S.C. s. 6928(h), or that have obtained or are required to obtain a permit for the operation of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility, a postclosure permit, or a permit pursuant to the federal Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 are eligible for participation in the brownfield program established in ss. 376.77-376.85, provided that the sites: a. Obtain the necessary letters of no objection and concurrence pursuant to subparagraph (1)(b)1. and subparagraph 1.; or b. Comply with the provisions of Section V of the Memorandum of Agreement between the department and the United States Environmental Protection Agency Region 4 covering Florida’s Brownfield Program, dated November 28, 2005, as may be amended. (h) No unit of state or local government may be held liable for implementing corrective actions at a contaminated site within an eligible brownfield area as a result of the involuntary ownership of the site through bankruptcy, tax delinquency, abandonment, or other circumstances in which the state or local government involuntarily acquires title by virtue of its function as a sovereign, or as a result of ownership from donation, gift, or foreclosure unless the state or local government has otherwise caused or contributed to a release of a contaminant at the brownfield site. (i) The Legislature finds and declares that certain brownfield sites may be redeveloped for open space, or limited recreational, cultural, or historical preservation purposes, and that such facilities enhance the redeveloped environment, attract visitors, and provide wholesome activities for employees and residents of the area. Further, the Legislature finds that purchasers of contaminated sites who are nonprofit conservation organizations acting for the public interest and who did not cause or contribute to the release of contamination on the site warrant protection from liability. (j) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, chapter 403, other laws, or ordinances of local governments, a nonprofit, charitable, federal tax-exempt, s. 501(c)(3) national land conservation corporation which purchases title to property in the state for the purpose of conveying such land to any governmental entity for conservation, historical preservation or cultural resource, park, greenway, or other similar uses shall not be liable to the state, local government, or any third party for penalties or remediation costs in connection with environmental contamination found in the soil or groundwater of such property, provided that such corporation did not cause the original deposit or release of the environmental contaminants, and provided the department and local pollution control program and responsible parties have access to the land for investigation, remediation, or monitoring purposes. (k) A person whose property becomes contaminated due to geophysical or hydrologic reasons, including the migration of contaminants onto their property from the operation of facilities and activities on a nearby designated brownfield area, and whose property has never been occupied by a business that utilized or stored the contaminants or similar constituents is not subject to administrative or judicial action brought by or on behalf of another to compel the rehabilitation of or the payment of the costs for the rehabilitation of sites contaminated by materials that migrated onto the property from the designated brownfield area, if the person: 1. Does not own and has never held an ownership interest in, or shared in the profits of, activities in the designated brownfield area operated at the source location; 2. Did not participate in the operation or management of the activities in the designated brownfield area operated at the source location; and 3. Did not cause, contribute to, or exacerbate the release or threat of release of any hazardous substance through any act or omission. (l) When a property, including a brownfield site, escheats to a county, the county is not subject to any liability imposed by this chapter or chapter 403 for preexisting soil or groundwater contamination due solely to its ownership. However, this paragraph does not affect the rights or liabilities of any past or future owners of the escheated property and does not affect the liability of any governmental entity for the results of its actions that create or exacerbate a pollution source. The county and the Department of Environmental Protection may enter into a written agreement for the performance, funding, and reimbursement of the investigative and remedial acts necessary for a property that escheats to the county. (3) REOPENERS.—Upon completion of site rehabilitation in compliance with ss. 376.77-376.85, no additional site rehabilitation shall be required unless it is demonstrated: (a) That fraud was committed in demonstrating site conditions or completion of site rehabilitation; (b) That new information confirms the existence of an area of previously unknown contamination which exceeds the site-specific rehabilitation levels established in accordance with s. 376.81, or which otherwise poses the threat of real and substantial harm to public health, safety, or the environment in violation of the terms of ss. 376.77-376.85; (c) That the remediation efforts failed to achieve the site rehabilitation criteria established under s. 376.81; (d) That the level of risk is increased beyond the acceptable risk established under s. 376.81 due to substantial changes in exposure conditions, such as a change in land use from nonresidential to residential use. Any person who changes the land use of the brownfield site thus causing the level of risk to increase beyond the acceptable risk level may be required by the department to undertake additional remediation measures to assure that human health, public safety, and the environment are protected to levels consistent with s. 376.81; or (e) That a new release occurs at the brownfield site subsequent to a determination of eligibility for participation in the brownfield program established under s. 376.80. (4) ADDITIONAL LIABILITY PROTECTION FOR LENDERS.— (a) The Legislature declares that, in order to achieve the economic redevelopment and site rehabilitation of brownfield sites in accordance with this act, it is imperative to encourage financing of real property transactions involving brownfield site rehabilitation plans. Accordingly, lenders, including those serving as a trustee, personal representative, or in any other fiduciary capacity, in connection with a loan, are entitled to the liability protection established in subsection (2) if they have not caused or contributed to a release of a contaminant at the brownfield site. (b) Lenders who hold indicia of ownership of a parcel within a brownfield area primarily to protect a security interest or who own a parcel within a brownfield area as a result of foreclosure or a deed in lieu of foreclosure of a security interest and who seek to sell, transfer, or otherwise divest the parcel via sale at the earliest practicable time are not liable for the release or discharge of a contaminant from the parcel; for the failure of the person responsible for brownfield site rehabilitation to comply with the brownfield site rehabilitation agreement; or for future site rehabilitation activities required pursuant to a reopener provision established in subsection (3) where the lender has not divested the borrower of, or otherwise engaged in, decisionmaking control of the site rehabilitation or site operations or undertaken management activities beyond those required to protect its financial interest while making a good faith effort to sell the site as soon as practicable and when an act or omission of the lender has not otherwise caused or contributed to a release of a contaminant at the brownfield site. (c) The economic incentives that were granted to a person responsible for site rehabilitation by state or local governments shall not accrue to a lender who obtains ownership of the brownfield site by one of the methods described in this subsection. The economic incentives are abated during the lender’s ownership, but they may be transferred and reinstated upon the sale of the brownfield site.

      "text": "376.84 Brownfield redevelopment economic incentives.—It is the intent of the Legislature that brownfield redevelopment activities be viewed as opportunities to significantly improve the utilization, general condition, and appearance of these sites. Different standards than those in place for new development, as allowed under current state and local laws, should be used to the fullest extent to encourage the redevelopment of a brownfield. State and local governments are encouraged to offer redevelopment incentives for this purpose, as an ongoing public investment in infrastructure and services, to help eliminate the public health and environmental hazards, and to promote the creation of jobs in these areas. Such incentives may include financial, regulatory, and technical assistance to persons and businesses involved in the redevelopment of the brownfield pursuant to this act. (1) Financial incentives and local incentives for redevelopment may include, but not be limited to: (a) Tax increment financing through community redevelopment agencies pursuant to part III of chapter 163. (b) Enterprise zone tax exemptions for businesses pursuant to chapters 196 and 290. (c) Safe neighborhood improvement districts as provided in ss. 163.501-163.516. (d) Waiver, reduction, or limitation by line of business with respect to business taxes pursuant to chapter 205. (e) Tax exemption for historic properties as provided in s. 196.1997.

(g) Minority business enterprise programs as provided in s. 287.0943. (h) Electric and gas tax exemption as provided in s. 166.231(6). (i) Economic development tax abatement as provided in s. 196.1995. (j) Grants, including community development block grants. (k) Pledging of revenues to secure bonds. (l) Low-interest revolving loans and zero-interest loan pools. (m) Local grant programs for facade, storefront, signage, and other business improvements. (n) Governmental coordination of loan programs with lenders, such as microloans, business reserve fund loans, letter of credit enhancements, gap financing, land lease and sublease loans, and private equity. (o) Payment schedules over time for payment of fees, within criteria, and marginal cost pricing. (2) Regulatory incentives may include, but not be limited to: (a) Cities’ absorption of developers’ concurrency needs. (b) Developers’ performance of certain analyses. (c) Exemptions and lessening of state and local review requirements. (d) Water and sewer regulatory incentives. (e) Waiver of transportation impact fees and permit fees. (f) Zoning incentives to reduce review requirements for redevelopment changes in use and occupancy; establishment of code criteria for specific uses; and institution of credits for previous use within the area. (g) Flexibility in parking standards and buffer zone standards. (h) Environmental management through specific code criteria and conditions allowed by current law. (i) Maintenance standards and activities by ordinance and otherwise, and increased security and crime prevention measures available through special assessments. (j) Traffic-calming measures. (k) Historic preservation ordinances, loan programs, and review and permitting procedures. (l) One-stop permitting and streamlined development and permitting process. (3) Technical assistance incentives may include, but not be limited to: (a) Expedited development applications. (b) Formal and informal information on business incentives and financial programs. (c) Site design assistance. (d) Marketing and promotion of projects or areas. History.—s. 8, ch. 97-277; s. 72, ch. 2007-5; s. 16, ch. 2021-131.
