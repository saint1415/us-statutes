      "text": "For purposes of this part:(1)“Intermediate holding company” means:(a)A holding company that is a subsidiary of a mutual insurance holding company, and which directly or through a subsidiary intermediate holding company owns a majority of the voting shares of the capital stock of one or more subsidiary insurance companies; or(b)A holding company that is a not-for-profit corporation and a subsidiary of a mutual insurance holding company, of which a majority of the voting membership interests entitled to elect the board of directors of such corporation are owned, directly or through a subsidiary intermediate holding company, by the mutual insurance holding company.(2)“Mutual insurance holding company” means an incorporated entity without permanent capital stock which is organized under this part and whose members are determined in accordance with this part.(3)“Nonprofit health care plan” means a not-for-profit domestic or foreign hospital or medical and surgical service plan or corporation that is licensed in one or more states, issues no capital stock, and is engaged in the business of providing prepaid indemnity or health care benefits.(4)“Paid premiums” means all premiums paid for insurance by a member of a mutual insurance holding company to a subsidiary insurance company.(5)“Subsidiary insurance company” means:(a)A stock insurance company, of which the majority of the voting shares of the capital stock are at all times owned by a mutual insurance holding company. As used in this part, the term “majority of the voting shares of the capital stock” means the shares of the capital stock of such company which carry the right to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by all of the outstanding shares of the capital stock for the election of directors. The ownership of a majority of the voting shares of the capital stock of a former mutual reorganized insurance company which are required by this part to be at all times owned by a mutual insurance holding company includes indirect ownership through one or more intermediate holding companies. However, indirect ownership through one or more intermediate holding companies may not result in a mutual insurance holding company owning less than the equivalent of a majority of the voting shares of the capital stock of the former mutual reorganized insurance company; or(b)A not-for-profit insurance company or nonprofit health care plan, of which the majority of the voting membership interests are at all times owned by a mutual insurance holding company, which entitles the mutual insurance holding company to elect the board of directors of the not-for-profit insurance company or nonprofit health care plan. This also applies to the indirect ownership of the not-for-profit insurance company or nonprofit health care plan through one or more intermediate holding companies. A not-for-profit insurance company subsidiary resulting from reorganization into a not-for-profit mutual insurance company under this part, or which is subsequently organized as an additional subsidiary insurance company of the holding company, is subject to the Florida Insurance Code, and chapter 617 applies to the organization of such company.History.—s. 1, ch. 97-216; s. 1, ch. 2003-76; s. 5, ch. 2013-125.",
