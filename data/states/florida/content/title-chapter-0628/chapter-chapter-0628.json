(2) Directors must be elected by the members or stockholders of a domestic insurer at the annual meeting of stockholders or members. Directors may be elected for terms of not more than 3 years each and until their successors are elected and have qualified; and, if to be elected for terms of more than 1 year, the insurer’s bylaws shall provide for a staggered-terms system under which the terms of a proportionate part of the members of the board of directors will expire on the date of each annual meeting of stockholders or members. (3) A majority of the directors must be citizens of the United States. (4) If so provided in a stock insurer’s bylaws, a director of such stock insurer shall be a stockholder thereof; and, if so provided in a mutual insurer’s bylaws, a director of such mutual insurer shall be a policyholder thereof. (5) In discharging his or her duties, a director may consider such factors as the directors deem relevant, including, but not limited to, the long-term prospects and interests of the corporation and its shareholders, the social, economic, legal, or other effects of any action on the employees, suppliers, or policyholders of the corporation or its subsidiaries, the communities and society in which the corporation or its subsidiaries operate, and the economy of the state and the nation. The director may also consider the short-term and long-term interests of the insurer, including, but not limited to, benefits that may accrue to the insured from the insurer’s long-term plans, the possibility that such interests may be best served by the continued independence of the insurer, the resources, intent, and past, present, and potential conduct of any person seeking to acquire control of the insurer, and any other relevant factors.

      "text": "628.703 Definitions.—For purposes of this part: (1) “Intermediate holding company” means: (a) A holding company that is a subsidiary of a mutual insurance holding company, and which directly or through a subsidiary intermediate holding company owns a majority of the voting shares of the capital stock of one or more subsidiary insurance companies; or (b) A holding company that is a not-for-profit corporation and a subsidiary of a mutual insurance holding company, of which a majority of the voting membership interests entitled to elect the board of directors of such corporation are owned, directly or through a subsidiary intermediate holding company, by the mutual insurance holding company. (2) “Mutual insurance holding company” means an incorporated entity without permanent capital stock which is organized under this part and whose members are determined in accordance with this part. (3) “Nonprofit health care plan” means a not-for-profit domestic or foreign hospital or medical and surgical service plan or corporation that is licensed in one or more states, issues no capital stock, and is engaged in the business of providing prepaid indemnity or health care benefits. (4) “Paid premiums” means all premiums paid for insurance by a member of a mutual insurance holding company to a subsidiary insurance company. (5) “Subsidiary insurance company” means: (a) A stock insurance company, of which the majority of the voting shares of the capital stock are at all times owned by a mutual insurance holding company. As used in this part, the term “majority of the voting shares of the capital stock” means the shares of the capital stock of such company which carry the right to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by all of the outstanding shares of the capital stock for the election of directors. The ownership of a majority of the voting shares of the capital stock of a former mutual reorganized insurance company which are required by this part to be at all times owned by a mutual insurance holding company includes indirect ownership through one or more intermediate holding companies. However, indirect ownership through one or more intermediate holding companies may not result in a mutual insurance holding company owning less than the equivalent of a majority of the voting shares of the capital stock of the former mutual reorganized insurance company; or (b) A not-for-profit insurance company or nonprofit health care plan, of which the majority of the voting membership interests are at all times owned by a mutual insurance holding company, which entitles the mutual insurance holding company to elect the board of directors of the not-for-profit insurance company or nonprofit health care plan. This also applies to the indirect ownership of the not-for-profit insurance company or nonprofit health care plan through one or more intermediate holding companies. A not-for-profit insurance company subsidiary resulting from reorganization into a not-for-profit mutual insurance company under this part, or which is subsequently organized as an additional subsidiary insurance company of the holding company, is subject to the Florida Insurance Code, and chapter 617 applies to the organization of such company.

If a person’s membership is based upon that person holding an insurance policy from a life insurer, the right to vote may be limited to those members whose policies are other than term and group policies and have been in effect for more than 1 year. A member has the right to vote in person or by her or his written proxy. No such proxy shall be made irrevocable or for longer than a reasonable period of time. (b) For the election of directors by the members and the number, qualifications, terms of office, and powers of the directors. (c) The time, notice, quorum, and conduct of annual and special meetings of members and voting thereat. The bylaws may provide that the annual meeting shall be held at a place, date, and time to be set forth in the policy and without giving other notice of such meeting. (d) The number, designation, election, terms, and powers and duties of the respective corporate officers. (e) For deposit, custody, and disbursement of and accounting for corporate funds. (f) That a quorum at all annual and special meetings of members will consist of all members present and voting in person or by proxy, after due notice of such meeting. (g) For any other reasonable provisions customary, necessary, or convenient for the management or regulation of the company’s corporate affairs, not inconsistent with law. (3) The mutual insurance holding company shall file within 30 days with the office a copy, certified by the mutual insurance holding company’s secretary, of its bylaws and of every modification thereof or addition thereto. The office shall promptly disapprove any bylaw provision deemed by it to be unlawful, unreasonable, inadequate, unfair, or detrimental to the proper interests or protection of the mutual insurance holding company’s members or any class thereof. The insurer shall not, after receiving written notice of such disapproval and during the existence thereof, effectuate any bylaw provision disapproved.

(2) Every director or officer of an insurance holding company system who knowingly violates or participates in, or who knowingly directs any of the officers or agents of the company to engage in transactions or make investments which have not been properly filed or approved or which violate commission rules relating to this part, shall pay, in their individual capacity, a civil forfeiture of not more than $5,000 per violation. In determining the amount of the civil forfeiture, the office shall take into account the appropriateness of the forfeiture with respect to the gravity of the violation, and the history of previous violations. (3) Whenever it appears to the office that any insurer subject to this part or any director, officer, employee, or agent thereof has engaged in any transaction or entered into a contract which violates commission rules relating to this part, the office may order the insurer to cease and desist immediately any further activity under that transaction or contract. The office may also order the insurer to void any such transaction or contract and restore the status quo if this action is in the best interest of the policyholders, creditors, or public. (4) If the office determines that any person violated s. 628.461, s. 628.801, or s. 628.8015, the violation may serve as an independent basis for disapproving dividends or distributions and for placing the insurer under an order of supervision in accordance with part VI of chapter 624.
