      "text": "319.141 Rebuilt motor vehicle inspection program.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Facility” means a rebuilt motor vehicle inspection facility authorized and operating under this section. (b) “Rebuilt inspection services” means an examination of a rebuilt vehicle and a properly endorsed certificate of title, salvage certificate of title, or manufacturer’s statement of origin and an application for a rebuilt certificate of title, a rebuilder’s affidavit, a photograph of the junk or salvage vehicle taken before repairs began, if available, a photograph of the interior driver and passenger sides of the vehicle if airbags were previously deployed and replaced, receipts or invoices for all major component parts, as defined in s. 319.30, and repairs which were changed, and proof that notice of rebuilding of the vehicle has been reported to the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System. (2) By October 1, 2022, the department shall implement a program in Bay, Broward, Duval, Escambia, Hillsborough, Leon, Manatee, Marion, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, and Volusia Counties for rebuilt inspection services offered by private sector participants. (3) Upon selection by the department, each participant shall enter into a memorandum of understanding with the department that allows such participant to conduct rebuilt motor vehicle inspections and specifies requirements for oversight, bonding and insurance, procedures, and forms and requires the electronic transmission of documents. The department may examine all records pertaining to any inspection or related service performed under the rebuilt motor vehicle inspection program. (4) Before a participant is authorized to perform such rebuilt inspection services, the department shall ensure that the participant meets basic criteria designed to protect the public. At a minimum, the participant shall meet all of the following requirements: (a) Have and maintain a surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $100,000 executed in favor of the department. Such surety bond or letter of credit shall be issued by entities licensed to do business in this state. (b) Secure and maintain a facility at a permanent fixed structure, as evidenced by proof of ownership or written lease at an address recognized by the United States Postal Service where the only services provided on such property are rebuilt inspection services. The facility must have permanent signage which advertises that only private rebuilt inspection services are provided at that location; posted business hours; a designated office area and customer waiting area; a rebuilt inspection area separate and visually obstructed from any area accessible to the customer; surveillance cameras with recording capabilities for the rebuilt inspection areas; and sufficient onsite customer parking. The location must be large enough to accommodate all of the vehicles being inspected and have a covered area to accommodate at least two vehicles during inclement weather. The participant shall annually attest that he or she does not have a direct or indirect interest in any motor vehicle that a facility has inspected or proposes to inspect; he or she is not employed by or does not have an ownership interest in or other financial arrangement with the owner, operator, manager, or employee of a motor vehicle repair shop as defined in s. 559.903, a motor vehicle dealer as defined in s. 320.27(1)(c), a towing company, a vehicle storage company, a vehicle auction, an insurance company, a salvage yard, a metal retailer, or a metal rebuilder from which he or she receives remuneration, directly or indirectly, for the referral of customers for rebuilt inspection services; there have been no changes to the ownership structure of the approved facility; and the only services being provided by such participant at the facility are rebuilt inspection services. Only a participant selected and approved by the department may charge or receive a fee for providing or facilitating such services. (c) Have and maintain garage liability with a minimum of $100,000 single-limit liability coverage including bodily injury and property damage protection and any other insurance required by the department. (d) Have completed criminal background checks of the owners, partners, and corporate officers and the inspectors employed by the facility which demonstrate that such persons have not been convicted of a felony, pled guilty to a felony, pled nolo contendere to a felony, or been incarcerated for a felony in the previous 10 years. (e) Meet any additional criteria the department determines necessary to conduct proper inspections. (5) A participant may not conduct an inspection of a vehicle in complete rebuilt condition without prior approval by the department. A person or entity other than the department or a participant authorized by the department may not conduct rebuilt inspection services. (6) A participant in the program shall access vehicle and title information and enter inspection results through an electronic filing system authorized by the department and shall maintain records of each rebuilt vehicle inspection processed at such facility for at least 5 years. (7) A vehicle owner who fails an initial rebuilt inspection may only have that vehicle reinspected by the department or the facility that conducted the original inspection. (8) The department shall conduct an onsite facility inspection at least once per quarter and shall immediately terminate any participant from the program who fails to meet the minimum eligibility requirements specified in subsection (4). Before a change in ownership of a rebuilt inspection facility, the current operator must give the department 45 days’ written notice of the intended sale or transfer. The prospective owner must meet the eligibility requirements of this section and execute a new memorandum of understanding with the department before operating the facility. (9) The department may adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 to implement and enforce this section.

Have been certified in accordance with federal regulations in 49 C.F.R. part 567 as being in compliance with applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards. 2. Bear the required certification label or labels including reference to any exemption granted under applicable federal law. (b) Be capable of being operated in compliance with the applicable traffic and motor vehicle laws of this state, regardless of whether the vehicle is operating with the automated driving system engaged. (2) If the autonomous vehicle is not fully autonomous, the vehicle must have a system to safely alert a licensed human operator physically present in the vehicle if an automated driving system failure is detected while the automated driving system is engaged. When an alert is given, the system must require the licensed human operator to take control of the autonomous vehicle or must achieve a minimal risk condition. The term “minimal risk condition” means a reasonably safe state, such as bringing the vehicle to a complete stop and activating the vehicle’s hazard lamps. (3) If the autonomous vehicle is fully autonomous, it must be able to achieve a minimal risk condition if a failure of the automated driving system occurs which renders that system unable to perform the entire dynamic driving task relevant to its intended operational design domain. (4) Federal regulations promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shall supersede this section when found to be in conflict with this section.

Except as otherwise provided herein, no court shall recognize the right, title, claim, or interest of any person in or to any motor vehicle or mobile home sold, disposed of, mortgaged, or encumbered, unless evidenced by a certificate of title duly issued to that person, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. (2)(a) An owner or co-owner who has made a bona fide sale or transfer of a motor vehicle or mobile home and has delivered possession thereof to a purchaser shall not, by reason of any of the provisions of this chapter, be deemed the owner or co-owner of such vehicle or mobile home so as to be subject to civil liability for the operation of such vehicle or mobile home thereafter by another when such owner or co-owner has fulfilled either of the following requirements: 1. When such owner or co-owner has made proper endorsement and delivery of the certificate of title as provided by this chapter. Proper endorsement shall be: a. When a motor vehicle or mobile home is registered in the names of two or more persons as co-owners in the alternative by the use of the word “or,” such vehicle shall be held in joint tenancy. Each co-owner shall be deemed to have granted to the other co-owner the absolute right to dispose of the title and interest in the vehicle or mobile home, and the signature of any co-owner shall constitute proper endorsement. Upon the death of a co-owner, the interest of the decedent shall pass to the survivor as though title or interest in the vehicle or mobile home was held in joint tenancy. This provision shall apply even if the co-owners are husband and wife. b. When a vehicle or mobile home is registered in the names of two or more persons as co-owners in the conjunctive by the use of the word “and,” the signature of each co-owner or his or her personal representative shall be required to transfer title to the vehicle or mobile home. The department shall adopt suitable language to appear upon the certificate of title to effectuate the manner in which the interest in or title to the motor vehicle or mobile home is held. 2. When such owner or co-owner has delivered to the department, or placed in the United States mail, addressed to the department, either the certificate of title properly endorsed or a notice in the form prescribed by the department. In addition to the information required by the department under this subparagraph, the notice must also contain the information required under paragraph (b) when the title being transferred is to a motor vehicle. (b) An owner or co-owner who has made a bona fide sale or transfer of a motor vehicle and has delivered possession thereof to a purchaser shall notify the department within 30 days after the sale or transfer in the form prescribed by the department. Notice by such owner or co-owner under this paragraph shall satisfy the notice requirement under subparagraph (a)2. for limitation of liability under paragraph (a). The notification shall include the vehicle identification number and the buyer’s full first name, middle initial, last name, and personal or business identification, which may include, but need not be limited to, a driver license number, Florida identification card number, or federal employer identification number, and any information required by the department. This paragraph shall not apply to any transfer or sale to or by a licensed motor vehicle dealer or to an insurer who has taken possession or is taking possession of the vehicle or the title thereto pursuant to a policy of insurance. (c) The department shall inform the motor vehicle owner or co-owner of the requirements of this subsection with the issuance of each certificate of title to a motor vehicle. The information may be printed on the certificate of title or on a separate form that is included with the certificate. (3) In the case of a private or casual sale, except for transfers by a surviving spouse as provided by s. 319.28, no title shall be accepted for transfer unless the name of the person who is selling the vehicle is shown as the owner on the face of the title. For the purposes of this subsection, a private or casual sale is a sale or assignment of motor vehicle or mobile home ownership in which none of the parties to the transaction is a licensed dealer and none of the parties is an insurer who has taken possession or is taking possession of the vehicle or the title thereto pursuant to a policy of insurance. (4) Each certificate of title shall contain a labeled place for the seller’s price to be indicated. No title shall be accepted for transfer by any county tax collector or other agent of the state unless the sales price is entered in the appropriately labeled place on the certificate of title by the seller, if a labeled place is provided. This subsection does not apply to any transfer of motor vehicle or mobile home ownership by a licensed dealer. (5) It is illegal to transfer title to a motor vehicle when the purchaser’s name does not appear on the title. Any buyer or seller who knowingly and willfully violates this subsection with intent to commit fraud commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.

If a certificate of title has previously been issued for a motor vehicle or mobile home in this state, the application for a certificate of title shall be accompanied by the certificate of title duly assigned, or assigned and reassigned, unless otherwise provided for in this chapter. If the motor vehicle or mobile home for which application for a certificate of title is made is a new motor vehicle or new mobile home for which one or more manufacturers’ statements of origin are required by the provisions of s. 319.21, the application for a certificate of title shall be accompanied by all such manufacturers’ statements of origin. (2) The applicant for a certificate of title shall indicate on the application if the motor vehicle is to be used as a taxicab, police vehicle, or lease vehicle or if the motor vehicle or mobile home is a rebuilt vehicle, as those terms are defined in s. 319.14. Upon issuance of a certificate of title for such vehicle, the department shall stamp, in a conspicuous place on the title, words stating the nature of the proposed use of the vehicle or stating that the vehicle has been rebuilt and may have previously been declared a total loss vehicle due to damage. This subsection applies to a mobile home, travel trailer, camping trailer, truck camper, or fifth-wheel recreation trailer only when the mobile home or vehicle is a rebuilt vehicle as defined in s. 319.14. (3) If a certificate of title has not previously been issued for a motor vehicle or mobile home in this state, the application, unless otherwise provided for in this chapter, shall be accompanied by a proper bill of sale or sworn statement of ownership, or a duly certified copy thereof, or by a certificate of title, bill of sale, or other evidence of ownership required by the law of the state or county from which the motor vehicle or mobile home was brought into this state. The application shall also be accompanied by: (a)1. A sworn affidavit from the seller and purchaser verifying that the vehicle identification number shown on the affidavit is identical to the vehicle identification number shown on the motor vehicle; or 2. An appropriate departmental form evidencing that a physical examination has been made of the motor vehicle by the owner and by a duly constituted law enforcement officer in any state, a licensed motor vehicle dealer, a license inspector as provided by s. 320.58, or a notary public commissioned by this state and that the vehicle identification number shown on such form is identical to the vehicle identification number shown on the motor vehicle; and (b) If the vehicle is a used car original, a sworn affidavit from the owner verifying that the odometer reading shown on the affidavit is identical to the odometer reading shown on the motor vehicle in accordance with the requirements of 49 C.F.R. s. 580.5 at the time that application for title is made. For the purposes of this section, the term “used car original” means a used vehicle coming into and being titled in this state for the first time. (c) If the vehicle is an ancient or antique vehicle, as defined in s. 320.086, the application shall be accompanied by a certificate of title; a bill of sale and a registration; or a bill of sale and an affidavit by the owner defending the title from all claims. The bill of sale must contain a complete vehicle description to include the vehicle identification or engine number, year make, color, selling price, and signatures of the seller and purchaser. Verification of the vehicle identification number is not required for any new motor vehicle; any mobile home; any trailer or semitrailer with a net weight of less than 2,000 pounds; or any travel trailer, camping trailer, truck camper, or fifth-wheel recreation trailer. (4) The application for a certificate of title for a motor vehicle or mobile home previously titled or registered outside this state shall show on its face such fact and shall indicate the time and place of the last issuance of certificate of title, or registration, of such motor vehicle or mobile home outside this state and the name and address of the governmental officer, agency, or authority making such registration, together with such further information relative to its previous registration as may reasonably be required by the department, including the time and place of original registration, if known, and if different from the last foreign registration. The applicant shall surrender to the department all certificates, registration cards, or other evidence of foreign registration as may be in his or her possession or under his or her control. (5) The certificate of title issued by the department for a motor vehicle or mobile home previously registered outside this state shall give the name of the state or country in which the vehicle was last registered outside this state. The department shall use reasonable diligence in ascertaining whether or not the facts in the application are true; and, if satisfied that the applicant is the owner of the motor vehicle or mobile home and that the application is in the proper form, it shall issue a certificate of title. (6)(a) In the case of the sale of a motor vehicle or mobile home by a licensed dealer to a general purchaser, the certificate of title must be obtained in the name of the purchaser by the dealer upon application signed by the purchaser, and in each other case the certificate must be obtained by the purchaser. In each case of transfer of a motor vehicle or mobile home, the application for a certificate of title, a corrected certificate, or an assignment or reassignment must be filed within 30 days after the delivery of the motor vehicle or after consummation of the sale of the mobile home to the purchaser. An applicant must pay a fee of $20, in addition to all other fees and penalties required by law, for failing to file such application within the specified time. In the case of the sale of a motor vehicle by a licensed motor vehicle dealer to a general purchaser who resides in another state or country, the dealer is not required to apply for a certificate of title for the motor vehicle; however, the dealer must transfer ownership and reassign the certificate of title or manufacturer’s certificate of origin to the purchaser, and the purchaser must sign an affidavit, as approved by the department, that the purchaser will title and register the motor vehicle in another state or country. (b) If a licensed dealer acquires a motor vehicle or mobile home as a trade-in, the dealer must file with the department, within 30 days, a notice of sale signed by the seller. The department shall update its database for that title record to indicate “sold.” A licensed dealer need not apply for a certificate of title for any motor vehicle or mobile home in stock acquired for stock purposes except as provided in s. 319.225. (7) If an applicant for a certificate of title is unable to provide the department with a certificate of title that assigns the prior owner’s interest in the motor vehicle, the department may accept a bond in the form prescribed by the department, along with an affidavit in a form prescribed by the department, which includes verification of the vehicle identification number and an application for title. (a) The bond must be: 1. In a form prescribed by the department; 2. Executed by the applicant; 3. Issued by a person authorized to conduct a surety business in this state; 4. In an amount equal to two times the value of the vehicle as determined by the department; and 5. Conditioned to indemnify all prior owners and lienholders and all subsequent purchasers of the vehicle or persons who acquire a security interest in the vehicle, and their successors in interest, against any expense, loss, or damage, including reasonable attorney fees, occurring because of the issuance of the certificate of title for the vehicle or for a defect in or undisclosed security interest on the right, title, or interest of the applicant to the vehicle. (b) An interested person has a right to recover on the bond for a breach of the bond’s condition. The aggregate liability of the surety to all persons may not exceed the amount of the bond. (c) A bond under this subsection expires on the third anniversary of the date the bond became effective. (d) The affidavit must: 1. Be in a form prescribed by the department; 2. Include the facts and circumstances under which the applicant acquired ownership and possession of the motor vehicle; 3. Disclose that no security interests, liens, or encumbrances against the motor vehicle are known to the applicant against the motor vehicle; and 4.

The database record shall serve as the duplicate title certificate required herein. One printed copy may be retained on file by the department. The department shall record and maintain a current odometer reading for vehicles covered by s. 319.225(4) at the time of any title activity. 1 (2) A duly authorized person shall sign the original certificate of title and each corrected certificate and, if there are no liens or encumbrances on the motor vehicle or mobile home, as shown in the records of the department or as shown in the application, shall deliver the certificate to the applicant or to another person as directed by the applicant or person, agent, or attorney submitting such application. The motor vehicle dealer license number must be submitted to the department when a dealer applies for or receives a duplicate title. The current odometer reading must be submitted on an application for a duplicate title. If there are one or more liens or encumbrances on the motor vehicle or mobile home, the certificate shall be delivered by the department to the first lienholder as shown by department records or to the owner as indicated in the notice of lien filed by the first lienholder pursuant to s. 319.27. If the notice of lien filed by the first lienholder indicates that the certificate should be delivered to the first lienholder, the department shall deliver to the first lienholder, along with the certificate, a form to be subsequently used by the lienholder as a satisfaction. If the notice of lien filed by the first lienholder directs the certificate of title to be delivered to the owner, then, upon delivery of the certificate of title by the department to the owner, the department shall deliver to the first lienholder confirmation of the receipt of the notice of lien and the date the certificate of title was issued to the owner at the owner’s address shown on the notice of lien and a form to be subsequently used by the lienholder as a satisfaction. If the application for certificate shows the name of a first lienholder different from the name of the first lienholder as shown by the records of the department or if the application does not show the name of a judgment lienholder as shown by the records of the department, the certificate shall not be issued to any person until after all parties who appear to hold a lien and the applicant for the certificate have been notified of the conflict in writing by the department by certified mail. If the parties do not amicably resolve the conflict within 10 days from the date such notice was mailed, then the department shall serve notice in writing by certified mail on all persons appearing to hold liens on that particular vehicle, including the applicant for the certificate, to show cause within 15 days from the date the notice is mailed why it should not issue and deliver the certificate to the person indicated in the notice of lien filed by the lienholder whose name appears in the application as the first lienholder without showing any lien or liens as outstanding other than those appearing in the application or those which may have been filed subsequent to the filing of the application for the certificate. If, within the 15-day period, any person other than the lienholder shown in the application or a party filing a subsequent lien, in answer to such notice to show cause, appears in person or by a representative, or responds in writing, and files a written statement under oath that his or her lien on that particular vehicle is still outstanding, the department shall not issue the certificate to anyone until after such conflict has been settled by the lien claimants involved or by a court of competent jurisdiction. If the conflict is not settled amicably within 10 days of the final date for filing an answer to the notice to show cause, the complaining party shall have 10 days to obtain a ruling, or a stay order, from a court of competent jurisdiction; if no ruling or stay order is issued and served on the department within the 10-day period, it shall issue the certificate showing no liens except those shown in the application or thereafter filed to the original applicant if there are no liens shown in the application and none are thereafter filed, or to the person indicated in the notice of lien filed by the lienholder whose name appears in the application as the first lienholder if there are liens shown in the application or thereafter filed. A duplicate certificate or corrected certificate shall only show such lien or liens as were shown in the application and subsequently filed liens that may be outstanding. (3) Except as provided in subsection (4), the certificate of title shall be retained by the first lienholder or the owner as indicated in the notice of lien filed by the first lienholder. If the first lienholder is in possession of the certificate, the first lienholder shall be entitled to retain the certificate until the first lien is satisfied. (4)(a)1. If the owner of the motor vehicle or mobile home, as shown on the title certificate, or the director of the state child support enforcement program, or the director’s designee, desires to place a second or subsequent lien or encumbrance against the motor vehicle or mobile home when the title certificate is in the possession of the first lienholder, the owner shall send a written request to the first lienholder by certified mail, and such first lienholder shall forward the certificate to the department for endorsement. If the title certificate is in the possession of the owner, the owner shall forward the certificate to the department for endorsement. 2. If the holder of a judgment lien acquired under s. 55.202(2) on personal property of the owner desires to place a lien on the motor vehicle or a vessel, the judgment lienholder must send a written request to the department, together with a copy of the lienholder’s judgment lien certificate. The department shall add the name of the judgment lienholder to the records of the department. The judgment lienholder must also send a written request to the person in possession of the title certificate by certified mail, and that person shall forward the certificate to the department for endorsement. (b) The department shall return the certificate to either the first lienholder or to the owner, as indicated in the notice of lien filed by the first lienholder, after endorsing the second or subsequent lien on the certificate and on the duplicate. If the first lienholder or owner fails, neglects, or refuses to forward the certificate of title to the department within 10 days after the date of the owner’s, the judgment lienholder’s, or the director’s or designee’s request, the department, on the written request of the subsequent lienholder or an assignee thereof, shall demand of the first lienholder or the owner the return of such certificate for the notation of the second or subsequent lien or encumbrance. If the first lienholder or owner fails, neglects, or refuses to return the certificate to the department as requested, the department must void the certificate of title and issue a replacement certificate showing the notation of the subsequent lien or encumbrance. (5)(a) Upon satisfaction of any first lien, judgment lien, or encumbrance recorded at the department or upon lapse of a judgment lien, the owner of the motor vehicle or mobile home, as shown on the title certificate, or the person satisfying the lien is entitled to demand and receive from the lienholder a satisfaction of the lien. If the lienholder, upon satisfaction of the lien and upon demand, fails or refuses to furnish a satisfaction thereof within 30 days after demand, he or she shall be held liable for all costs, damages, and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, lawfully incurred by the titled owner or person satisfying the lien in any suit brought in this state for cancellation of the lien. A motor vehicle dealer acquiring ownership of a motor vehicle with an outstanding purchase money lien, shall pay and satisfy the outstanding lien within 10 working days of acquiring ownership. The lienholder receiving final payment as defined in s. 674.215 shall mail or otherwise deliver a lien satisfaction and the certificate of title indicating the satisfaction within 10 working days of receipt of such final payment or notify the person satisfying the lien that the title is not available within 10 working days of receipt of such final payment. If the lienholder is unable to provide the certificate of title and notifies the person of such, the lienholder shall provide a lien satisfaction and shall be responsible for the cost of a duplicate title, including fast title charges as provided in s. 319.323. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to electronic transactions pursuant to subsection (9). (b) Following satisfaction of a lien or upon satisfaction or lapse of a judgment lien, the lienholder shall enter a satisfaction thereof in the space provided on the face of the certificate of title. If the certificate of title was retained by the owner, the owner shall, within 5 days of the satisfaction of a lien, deliver the certificate of title to the lienholder and the lienholder shall enter a satisfaction thereof in the space provided on the face of the certificate of title. If there are no subsequent liens shown thereon, the certificate shall be delivered by the lienholder to the person satisfying the lien or encumbrance and an executed satisfaction on a form provided by the department shall be forwarded to the department by the lienholder within 10 days of satisfaction of the lien. (c) If the certificate of title shows a subsequent lien not then being discharged, an executed satisfaction of the first lien shall be delivered by the lienholder to the person satisfying the lien and the certificate of title showing satisfaction of the first lien shall be forwarded by the lienholder to the department within 10 days of satisfaction of the lien. (d) If, upon receipt of a title certificate showing satisfaction of the first lien, the department determines from its records that there are no subsequent liens or encumbrances upon the motor vehicle or mobile home, the department shall forward to the owner, as shown on the face of the title, a corrected certificate showing no liens or encumbrances. If there is a subsequent lien not being discharged, the certificate of title shall be reissued showing the second or subsequent lienholder as the first lienholder and shall be delivered to either the new first lienholder or to the owner as indicated in the notice of lien filed by the new first lienholder. If the certificate of title is to be retained by the first lienholder on the reissued certificate, the first lienholder shall be entitled to retain the certificate of title except as provided in subsection (4) until his or her lien is satisfied. Upon satisfaction of the lien, the lienholder shall be subject to the procedures required of a first lienholder by subsection (4) and this subsection. (6) When the original certificate of title cannot be returned to the department by the lienholder and evidence satisfactory to the department is produced that all liens or encumbrances have been satisfied, upon application by the owner for a duplicate copy of the certificate upon the form prescribed by the department, accompanied by the fee prescribed in this chapter, a duplicate copy of the certificate of title, without statement of liens or encumbrances, shall be issued by the department and delivered to the owner. (7) Any person who fails, within 10 days of receipt of a demand by the department by certified mail, to return a certificate of title to the department as required by subsection (4) or who, upon satisfaction of a lien, fails within 10 days after receipt of such demand to forward the appropriate document to the department as required by paragraph (5)(b) or paragraph (5)(c) is guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (8) Notwithstanding any requirements in this section or in s. 319.27 indicating that a lien on a motor vehicle or mobile home shall be noted on the face of the Florida certificate of title, if there are one or more liens or encumbrances on the motor vehicle or mobile home, the department shall electronically transmit the lien to the first lienholder and notify the first lienholder of any additional liens. Subsequent lien satisfactions shall be electronically transmitted to the department and must include the name and address of the person or entity satisfying the lien. When electronic transmission of liens and lien satisfactions is used, the issuance of a certificate of title may be waived until the last lien is satisfied and a clear certificate of title is issued to the owner of the vehicle. In subsequent transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle, it shall be presumed that the motor vehicle title is subject to a lien as set forth in s. 319.225(6)(a) until the title to be issued pursuant to this subsection is received by the person or entity satisfying the lien. (9) The department shall in the sending of any notice only be required to use the last known address as shown by its records.

Tax collectors, as authorized agents of the department, may deliver original certificates of title and corrected certificates by mail or make such certificates available to applicants at tax collectors’ offices. The motor vehicle dealer license number must be submitted to the department when a dealer applies for or receives a duplicate title. The current odometer reading must be submitted on an application for a duplicate title. If there are one or more liens or encumbrances on the motor vehicle or mobile home, the certificate must be delivered by the department to the first lienholder as shown by department records or to the owner as indicated in the notice of lien filed by the first lienholder pursuant to s. 319.27. If the notice of lien filed by the first lienholder indicates that the certificate should be delivered to the first lienholder, the department must deliver to the first lienholder, along with the certificate, a form to be subsequently used by the lienholder as a satisfaction. If the notice of lien filed by the first lienholder directs the certificate of title to be delivered to the owner, then, upon delivery of the certificate of title by the department to the owner, the department must deliver to the first lienholder confirmation of the receipt of the notice of lien and the date the certificate of title was issued to the owner at the owner’s address shown on the notice of lien and a form to be subsequently used by the lienholder as a satisfaction. If the application for certificate shows the name of a first lienholder different from the name of the first lienholder as shown by the records of the department or if the application does not show the name of a judgment lienholder as shown by the records of the department, the certificate may not be issued to any person until after all parties who appear to hold a lien and the applicant for the certificate have been notified of the conflict in writing by the department by certified mail. If the parties do not amicably resolve the conflict within 10 days from the date such notice was mailed, the department must serve notice in writing by certified mail on all persons appearing to hold liens on that particular vehicle, including the applicant for the certificate, to show cause within 15 days from the date the notice is mailed why it should not issue and deliver the certificate to the person indicated in the notice of lien filed by the lienholder whose name appears in the application as the first lienholder without showing any lien or liens as outstanding other than those appearing in the application or those which may have been filed subsequent to the filing of the application for the certificate. If, within the 15-day period, any person other than the lienholder shown in the application or a party filing a subsequent lien, in answer to such notice to show cause, appears in person or by a representative, or responds in writing, and files a written statement under oath that his or her lien on that particular vehicle is still outstanding, the department may not issue the certificate to anyone until after such conflict has been settled by the lien claimants involved or by a court of competent jurisdiction. If the conflict is not settled amicably within 10 days of the final date for filing an answer to the notice to show cause, the complaining party must have 10 days to obtain a ruling, or a stay order, from a court of competent jurisdiction; if no ruling or stay order is issued and served on the department within the 10-day period, it must issue the certificate showing no liens except those shown in the application or thereafter filed to the original applicant if there are no liens shown in the application and none are thereafter filed, or to the person indicated in the notice of lien filed by the lienholder whose name appears in the application as the first lienholder if there are liens shown in the application or thereafter filed. A duplicate certificate or corrected certificate may only show such lien or liens as were shown in the application and subsequently filed liens that may be outstanding.

The application shall be accompanied by evidence satisfactory to the department that the applicant has notified the lienholder by certified mail, not less than 20 days prior to the date of the application, of his or her intention to apply to the department for removal of the lien. Ten days after receipt of the application, the department may remove the lien from its files or from the certificate of title, as the case may be, if no statement in writing protesting removal of the lien is received by the department from the lienholder within the 10-day period. If, however, the lienholder files with the department within the 10-day period a written statement that the lien is still outstanding or that a second judgment lien certificate has been filed with the Department of State, the department shall not remove the lien until the lienholder presents a satisfaction of lien to the department. If a second judgment lien certificate was filed with the Department of State, the department must remove the notice of the first judgment lien certificate and add notation of the second judgment lien certificate at the end of all noted liens. Ten days after the receipt of an application for a derelict motor vehicle certificate and notification to the lienholder, the department may remove the lien from the derelict motor vehicle record if a written statement protesting removal of the lien is not received by the department from the lienholder within the 10-day period.

      "text": "319.28 Transfer of ownership by operation of law.— (1)(a) In the event of the transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle or mobile home by operation of law as upon inheritance, devise or bequest, order in bankruptcy, insolvency, replevin, attachment, execution, or other judicial sale or whenever the engine of a motor vehicle is replaced by another engine or whenever a motor vehicle is sold to satisfy storage or repair charges or repossession is had upon default in performance of the terms of a security agreement, chattel mortgage, conditional sales contract, trust receipt, or other like agreement, and upon the surrender of the prior certificate of title or, when that is not possible, presentation of satisfactory proof to the department of ownership and right of possession to such motor vehicle or mobile home, and upon payment of the fee prescribed by law and presentation of an application for certificate of title, the department may issue to the applicant a certificate of title thereto. (b) When the application for a certificate of title is made by an heir of a previous owner who died intestate, it shall not be necessary to accompany the application with an order of a probate court if the applicant files with the department an affidavit that the estate is not indebted and the surviving spouse, if any, and the heirs, if any, have amicably agreed among themselves upon a division of the estate. If the previous owner died testate, the application shall be accompanied by a certified copy of the will, if probated, and an affidavit that the estate is solvent with sufficient assets to pay all just claims or, if the will is not being probated, by a sworn copy of the will and an affidavit that the estate is not indebted. (c) If the previous owner died testate and the application for a certificate of title is made by, and accompanied by an affidavit attested by, a Florida-licensed attorney in good standing with The Florida Bar, such affidavit shall, for purposes of paragraph (a), establish a presumption of ownership, absent information received to the contrary, and right of possession to the motor vehicle or mobile home, so long as the affidavit sets forth the rightful heir or heirs and the attorney attests in the affidavit that such heir or heirs are lawfully entitled to the rights of ownership and possession of the motor vehicle or mobile home. It is not necessary for the application for certificate of title filed under this paragraph to be accompanied by a copy of the will or other testamentary instrument. (d) If a surviving spouse who would be entitled to issuance of a certificate of title under paragraph (b) wishes to dispose of the vehicle rather than retaining it for his or her own use, the surviving spouse shall not be required to obtain a certificate of title in his or her own name, but may assign to the transferee the certificate of title which was issued to the decedent. An application for a certificate of title by an applicant taken through such a surviving spouse under this paragraph shall be accompanied by the same documentation as would an application by a surviving spouse under paragraph (b), which documentation shall be supplied to the transferee by the surviving spouse. (e) A mobile home that is repossessed is exempt from registration if the mobile home is not transferred or titled for occupancy. (2)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), only an affidavit by the person, or agent of the person, to whom possession of such motor vehicle or mobile home has so passed, setting forth facts entitling him or her to such possession and ownership, together with a copy of the journal entry, court order, or instrument upon which such claim of possession and ownership is founded, shall be considered satisfactory proof of ownership and right of possession. (b) In case of repossession of a motor vehicle or mobile home pursuant to the terms of a security agreement or similar instrument, an affidavit by the party to whom possession has passed stating that the vehicle or mobile home was repossessed upon default in the terms of the security agreement or other instrument shall be considered satisfactory proof of ownership and right of possession. At least 5 days prior to selling the repossessed vehicle, any subsequent lienholder named in the last issued certificate of title shall be sent notice of the repossession by certified mail, on a form prescribed by the department. If such notice is given and no written protest to the department is presented by a subsequent lienholder within 15 days after the date on which the notice was mailed, the certificate of title shall be issued showing no liens. If the former owner or any subsequent lienholder files a written protest under oath within such 15-day period, the department shall not issue the certificate of title for 10 days thereafter. If within the 10-day period no injunction or other order of a court of competent jurisdiction has been served on the department commanding it not to deliver the certificate of title, the department shall deliver the certificate of title to the applicant or as may otherwise be directed in the application showing no other liens than those shown in the application. Any lienholder who has repossessed a vehicle in this state in compliance with the provisions of this section must apply to a tax collector’s office in this state or to the department for a certificate of title pursuant to s. 319.323. Proof of the required notice to subsequent lienholders shall be submitted together with regular title fees. Any person found guilty of violating any requirements of this paragraph shall be guilty of a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. (c) If the applicant for a certificate of title under this section cannot produce satisfactory proof of ownership and right of possession, he or she may submit such evidence as he or she may have, and the department may thereupon, if it finds the evidence sufficient, issue a certificate of title. (3) A dealer of industrial equipment who conducts a repossession, as defined in s. 493.6101(22), of such equipment is not subject to licensure as a recovery agent or recovery agency if the dealer is regularly engaged in the sale of the equipment for a particular manufacturer, the lender is affiliated with that manufacturer, and the dealer uses his or her own employees to make such repossessions.

(2) Any purchaser of such motor vehicle or mobile home may at the time of purchase require the seller to indemnify him or her and all subsequent purchasers of the motor vehicle or mobile home against any loss which he, she, or they may suffer by reason of any claim or claims presented upon the original certificate.
