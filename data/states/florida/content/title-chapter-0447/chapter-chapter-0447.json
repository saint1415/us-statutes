(b) Placing unreasonable restrictions on the other party as a prerequisite to meeting. (c) Failure to discuss bargainable issues. (d) Refusing, upon reasonable written request, to provide public information, excluding work products as defined in s. 447.605. (e) Refusing to negotiate because of an unwanted person on the opposing negotiating team. (f) Negotiating directly with employees rather than with their certified bargaining agent. (g) Refusing to reduce a total agreement to writing. (18) “Student representative” means the representative selected by each community college or university student government association.
