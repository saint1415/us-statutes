However, on and after that date, no water control district may be created except pursuant to s. 125.01 or a special act of the Legislature. Upon formation of a water control district by a special act of the Legislature, the circuit court of the county in which a majority of the land within the district is located shall thereafter maintain and have original and exclusive jurisdiction, coextensive with the boundaries and limits of the water control district without regard to county lines, for all purposes of this chapter.

(b) A map delineating the legal boundary of the water control district and identifying any subdistricts or units within the district. (c) Narrative descriptions of land use within the district and all existing district facilities and their purpose and function, and a map depicting their locations. (d) Engineering drawings and narrative sufficient to describe each facility’s capacity for the management and storage of surface waters and potable water supply, if applicable.

(4) Information contained within a district’s facilities plan prepared pursuant to s. 189.08 which satisfies any of the provisions of subsection (3) may be used as part of the district water control plan. (5) Before final adoption of the water control plan or plan amendment under s. 298.301, the board of supervisors must submit the proposed plan or amendment to the jurisdictional water management district for review. Within 60 days after receipt of the proposed water control plan or amendment, the governing board of the jurisdictional water management district, or the executive director or designee, if delegated, must review the proposed plan or amendment for consistency with the applicable water resource plans and policies and recommend to the board of supervisors any proposed changes. If the jurisdictional water management district determines that the proposed plan or amendment is incomplete, it may notify the water control district and request additional information. Upon such request, the deadline for review may be extended as agreed by the water control district and the jurisdictional water management district. Within 60 days after receipt of the applicable water management district’s recommended changes, the board of supervisors shall include the recommendations in the water control plan or plan amendment to the extent practicable. If the recommendations are not incorporated, the board of supervisors must specify its reasons in the water control plan or plan amendment adopted. A copy of the water control plan must be filed with the jurisdictional water management district and each local general purpose government within which all or a portion of the district’s lands are located. A district which has an adopted water control plan and is located entirely within an unincorporated portion of a county shall be the exclusive provider within the district for services and facilities as authorized by this chapter or special act and included in an adopted water control plan. (6) The review or approval of the water control plan by the applicable water management district shall not constitute the granting of any permit necessary for the construction or operation of any water control district work and cannot be relied upon as any future agency action on a permit application. (7) The board of supervisors must review the water control plan at least every 5 years following its initial development and adoption, and to the extent necessary, amend the plan in accordance with s. 298.301. (8) If the preparation of a water control plan, engineer’s report, or amendments thereto under this section do not result in revision of the district’s current plan or require the increase of any levy of assessments or taxes beyond the maximum amount previously authorized by general law, special law, or judicial proceeding, a change in the use of said assessments or taxes, or substantial change to district facilities, the provisions of s. 298.301(2)-(9) do not apply to the plan adoption process. This section and s. 298.301 do not apply to minor, insubstantial amendments to district plans or engineer’s reports, and such amendments or reports may be adopted by resolution of the board of supervisors. Minor, insubstantial amendments include amendments to the water control plan which replace, relocate, reconstruct, or improve and upgrade district facilities and operations consistent with the adopted water control plan, but which do not require increasing assessments beyond the maximum amount authorized by law, or amendments to engineer’s reports which do not increase the total assessment of benefits.

(2) The aforesaid bond of said treasurer may, if the said board shall so direct, be furnished by a surety or bonding company, which may be approved by said board of supervisors; provided, if it should be deemed more expedient to the board of supervisors, as to money derived from the sale of bonds issued, said board may, by resolution, select some suitable bank or banks, or other depository, as temporary treasurer or treasurers, to hold and disburse said moneys on the orders of the board as the work progresses, until such fund is exhausted or transferred to the treasurer by order of the said board of supervisors.

(2) Such refunding bonds shall not exceed in the aggregate the amount of the bonds refunded thereby, and shall bear interest at a rate not exceeding 8 percent per annum, payable semiannually, and may be exchanged for the outstanding bonds at par or sold for not less than 95 cents on the dollar and accrued interest, and the proceeds used solely in the payment of outstanding bonds. Any discount or expense of such sale of the refunding bonds shall be paid out of the maintenance fund of the district, if any, or out of surplus in the sinking fund, if any. (3) Any landowner shall have the right at any time within 30 days after the adoption of the resolution providing for the issuance of the refunding bonds, to pay the full amount of uncollected principal or assessment chargeable to his or her land for the payment of the bonds proposed to be refunded, and his or her lands shall thereby be released from any tax or assessment for the payment of said bonds. The landowner’s land shall remain liable, subject to the limitations prescribed in the law under which the original bonds were issued and the original or revised benefits assessed against said land, for any additional tax which may be required to pay said bonds by reason of other lands in the district not paying the tax or assessment. (4) Unless and until refunding bonds shall have been authorized and issued, the governing board shall continue the levy of annual taxes sufficient to pay the outstanding bonds and interest thereon as they fall due. When any bonds of such district are refunded pursuant to the authority hereby conferred, the collection of corresponding installments of tax or assessment shall likewise be deferred. The governing board shall make proper provision for the payment of the principal and interest of said refunding bonds in like manner as was required in the case of the issuance of original bonds by the law under which such district is or may have been incorporated; and the holders of such refunding bonds shall have the same rights as are given the holders of bonds under the law under which such district is or may have been incorporated. (5) Any landowner failing to avail himself or herself of the privilege conferred by this section of paying in full the unpaid principal tax or assessment against his or her land shall not be heard to complain by reason of additional interest to be collected from his or her lands by reason of the extension of the bonds. (6) Taxes or assessments levied for the payment of refunding bonds and the interest thereon shall be secured by the same lien as other taxes of such district levied for the payment of the original bonds, and the additional interest which will accrue on account of such refunding bonds shall be included and added to the original drainage tax and shall be secured by the same lien; but the interest to accrue shall not be considered as a part of the cost of construction in determining whether the tax exceeds the benefits assessed. (7) No proceedings shall be required for the issuance of refunding bonds other than those provided by this section; provided, however, that the validity of all bonds issued under this chapter and the validity of all proceedings had incident to and culminating in the issuance of such bonds shall, prior to the sale or delivery of such bonds, be determined and established in the manner now or hereafter provided by law for the validation of bonds issued by counties, municipalities, taxing districts or other political districts or subdivisions of this state.

(2) Such notice may be in the following form: NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN to all persons interested in the lands included within the Water Control District that a petition has been filed with the district, praying for a readjustment of the assessment of benefits for the purpose of making a more equitable basis for the levy of taxes against the various pieces and parcels of land in said district to pay its indebtedness and maintain its drainage system, and that said petition will be heard by the board of supervisors on the day of , (year) . Dated , (year) . (Secretary of District) County (3) Any interested person may file an answer to the petition before the return day and, if so, shall be duly heard, but, if not, the cause shall proceed ex parte. Upon the hearing of the petition, if the board shall find that there has been a material change in the values of the lands in the district since the last previous assessment of benefits, contributed to by the drainage system, and that the other material allegations of the petition herein required to be set forth are substantially true, the board of supervisors shall order that there be made a readjustment of the assessment of benefits for the purpose of providing a basis upon which to levy further and future taxes for the payment of the obligations of, and maintaining the drainage system in, the district, and shall order the engineer’s report to be revised accordingly. Thereupon, the board of supervisors shall proceed pursuant to s. 298.301 to make such readjustment of assessment of benefits to each piece or parcel of land which has accrued or will accrue as a result of the drainage system. Provided, in making the readjustment of the assessment of benefits, the board of supervisors shall not increase the existing assessment, or unpaid portion thereof, on any piece or parcel of land; provided, further, that after the making of such readjustment, the limitation of 10 percent of the annual maintenance tax which may be levied shall apply to the amount of benefits as readjusted.
