At the request of the defendant, the court may order the amount repayable to the defendant from such deposit to be paid to the defendant’s attorney of record.(b)Moneys retained by the clerk under this provision shall be disbursed as directed by the county commission for law enforcement, criminal justice, and criminal court operations relating to pretrial release, including, but not limited to, screening, supervision, and apprehension, subject to the following conditions:1.The clerk must receive a sum equal to actual, demonstrable increased costs, if any, attributable to the implementation of this section.2.Moneys distributed to the sheriff must be used for increased expenditures in connection with the apprehension of defendants who fail to appear as required.(5)If a final judgment for a fine and court costs, or either a fine or court costs, is entered in an action in which a deposit has been made in accordance with this section, the balance of such deposit, after deduction of bail costs as provided for herein, shall be applied to the satisfaction of the judgment.(6)In the event that this section becomes effective, the Supreme Court shall promulgate rules as necessary to implement this section.History.—s. 47, ch. 82-175.1Note.—Pursuant to s. 73, ch. 82-175, effective “if and only if chapter 648 . . . is . . . repealed, in which event [this] section shall take effect upon the effective date of such repeal.”",
