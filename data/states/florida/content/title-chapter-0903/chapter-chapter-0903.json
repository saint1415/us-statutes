      "text": "903.046 Purpose of and criteria for bail determination.— (1) The purpose of a bail determination in criminal proceedings is to ensure the appearance of the criminal defendant at subsequent proceedings and to protect the community against unreasonable danger from the criminal defendant. (2) When determining whether to release a defendant on bail or other conditions, and what that bail or those conditions may be, the court shall consider: (a) The nature and circumstances of the offense charged. (b) The weight of the evidence against the defendant. (c) The defendant’s family ties, length of residence in the community, immigration status, employment history, financial resources, and mental condition. (d) The defendant’s past and present conduct, including any record of convictions, previous flight to avoid prosecution, or failure to appear at court proceedings. However, any defendant who had failed to appear on the day of any required court proceeding in the case at issue, but who had later voluntarily appeared or surrendered, shall not be eligible for a recognizance bond; and any defendant who failed to appear on the day of any required court proceeding in the case at issue and who was later arrested shall not be eligible for a recognizance bond or for any form of bond which does not require a monetary undertaking or commitment equal to or greater than $2,000 or twice the value of the monetary commitment or undertaking of the original bond, whichever is greater. Notwithstanding anything in this section, the court has discretion in determining conditions of release if the defendant proves circumstances beyond his or her control for the failure to appear. This section may not be construed as imposing additional duties or obligations on a governmental entity related to monetary bonds. (e) The nature and probability of danger which the defendant’s release poses to the community. (f) The source of funds used to post bail or procure an appearance bond, particularly whether the proffered funds, real property, property, or any proposed collateral or bond premium may be linked to or derived from the crime alleged to have been committed or from any other criminal or illicit activities. The burden of establishing the noninvolvement in or nonderivation from criminal or other illicit activity of such proffered funds, real property, property, or any proposed collateral or bond premium falls upon the defendant or other person proffering them to obtain the defendant’s release. (g) Whether the defendant is already on release pending resolution of another criminal proceeding or on probation, parole, or other release pending completion of a sentence. (h) The street value of any drug or controlled substance connected to or involved in the criminal charge. It is the finding and intent of the Legislature that crimes involving drugs and other controlled substances are of serious social concern, that the flight of defendants to avoid prosecution is of similar serious social concern, and that frequently such defendants are able to post monetary bail using the proceeds of their unlawful enterprises to defeat the social utility of pretrial bail. Therefore, the courts should carefully consider the utility and necessity of substantial bail in relation to the street value of the drugs or controlled substances involved. (i) The nature and probability of intimidation and danger to victims. (j) Whether there is probable cause to believe that the defendant committed a new crime while on pretrial release. (k) Any other facts that the court considers relevant. (l) Whether the crime charged is a violation of chapter 874 or alleged to be subject to enhanced punishment under chapter 874 or reclassification under s. 843.22. If any such violation is charged against a defendant or if the defendant is charged with a crime that is alleged to be subject to such enhancement or reclassification, he or she is not eligible for release on bail or surety bond until the first appearance on the case in order to ensure the full participation of the prosecutor and the protection of the public. (m) Whether the defendant, other than a defendant whose only criminal charge is a misdemeanor offense under chapter 316, is required to register as a sexual offender under s. 943.0435 or a sexual predator under s. 775.21; and, if so, he or she is not eligible for release on bail or surety bond until the first appearance on the case in order to ensure the full participation of the prosecutor and the protection of the public.

      "text": "903.047 Conditions of pretrial release.— (1) As a condition of pretrial release, whether such release is by surety bail bond or recognizance bond or in some other form, the defendant must: (a) Refrain from criminal activity of any kind. (b) If the court issues an order of no contact, refrain from any contact of any type with the victim, except through pretrial discovery pursuant to the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure. An order of no contact is effective immediately and enforceable for the duration of the pretrial release or until it is modified by the court. The defendant shall be informed in writing of the order of no contact, specifying the applicable prohibited acts, before the defendant is released from custody on pretrial release. As used in this section, unless otherwise specified by the court, the term “no contact” includes the following prohibited acts: 1. Communicating orally or in any written form, either in person, telephonically, electronically, or in any other manner, either directly or indirectly through a third person, with the victim or any other person named in the order. If the victim and the defendant have children in common, at the request of the defendant, the court may designate an appropriate third person to contact the victim for the sole purpose of facilitating the defendant’s contact with the children. However, this subparagraph does not prohibit an attorney for the defendant, consistent with rules regulating The Florida Bar, from communicating with any person protected by the no contact order for lawful purposes. 2. Having physical or violent contact with the victim or other named person or his or her property. 3. Being within 500 feet of the victim’s or other named person’s residence, even if the defendant and the victim or other named person share the residence. 4. Being within 500 feet of the victim’s or other named person’s vehicle, place of employment, or a specified place frequented regularly by such person. (c) Comply with all conditions of pretrial release imposed by the court. A court must consider s. 903.046(2) when determining whether to impose nonmonetary conditions in addition to or in lieu of monetary bond. Such nonmonetary conditions may include, but are not limited to, requiring a defendant to: 1. Maintain employment, or, if unemployed, actively seek employment. 2. Maintain or commence an educational program. 3. Abide by specified restrictions on personal associations, place of residence, or travel. 4. Report on a regular basis to a designated law enforcement agency, pretrial services agency, or other agency. 5. Comply with a specified curfew. 6. Refrain from possessing a firearm, destructive device, or other dangerous weapon. 7. Refrain from excessive use of alcohol, or any use of a narcotic drug or other controlled substance without a prescription from a licensed medical practitioner. 8. Undergo available medical, psychological, psychiatric, mental health, or substance abuse evaluation and follow all recommendations, including treatment for drug or alcohol dependency, and remain in a specified institution, if required for that purpose. 9. Return to custody for specified hours following release for employment, school, or other limited purposes. 10. Any other condition that is reasonably necessary to assure the appearance of the defendant at subsequent proceedings and to protect the community against unreasonable danger of harm. (2) Upon motion by the defendant when bail is set, or upon later motion properly noticed pursuant to law, the court may modify the condition required by paragraph (1)(b) if good cause is shown and the interests of justice so require. The victim shall be permitted to be heard at any proceeding in which such modification is considered, and the state attorney shall notify the victim of the provisions of this subsection and of the pendency of any such proceeding.

Each defendant charged with a felony of the second degree or higher, and each defendant appearing before a court in connection with bail, shall sign the application upon oath in open court. (2) After the application is completed and the quantity and other conditions of the bond are determined as required by law, the defendant may deposit with the clerk of the court before which the action is pending or with the sheriff, if designated by the clerk, a sum of money equal to 10 percent of the bond and any additional collateral for all or part of the remaining portion of the bond as the court may require. (3) Upon depositing such sum and additional collateral and agreeing in writing to all nonmonetary conditions of the bond which the court may require, the defendant shall be released from custody subject to all conditions of release imposed by the court. (4)(a) If the conditions of release have been performed and the defendant has been discharged from all obligations in the action, the clerk of the court shall return to the defendant, unless the court orders otherwise, 75 percent of the 10-percent sum deposited, plus any additional required collateral, and shall retain as bail costs 25 percent of the 10-percent sum deposited. At the request of the defendant, the court may order the amount repayable to the defendant from such deposit to be paid to the defendant’s attorney of record. (b) Moneys retained by the clerk under this provision shall be disbursed as directed by the county commission for law enforcement, criminal justice, and criminal court operations relating to pretrial release, including, but not limited to, screening, supervision, and apprehension, subject to the following conditions: 1. The clerk must receive a sum equal to actual, demonstrable increased costs, if any, attributable to the implementation of this section. 2. Moneys distributed to the sheriff must be used for increased expenditures in connection with the apprehension of defendants who fail to appear as required.

The official shall take the defendant into custody, as on a commitment, and issue a certificate acknowledging the surrender. (2) When a surety presents the certificate and a copy of the bond to the court having jurisdiction, the court shall order the obligors exonerated and any money or bonds deposited as bail refunded. The surety shall give the state attorney 3 days’ notice of application for an order of exoneration and furnish the state attorney a copy of the certificate and bond. (3)(a) The surety shall be exonerated of liability on the bond if it is determined before breach of the bond that the defendant is in any jail or prison and the surety agrees in writing to pay the costs and expenses incurred in returning the defendant to the jurisdiction of the court. A surety is only responsible for the itemized costs and expenses incurred for the transport of a defendant to whom he or she has a fiduciary duty and is not liable for the costs and expenses incurred in transporting any other defendant.

However, in any case in which the bond forfeiture has been discharged by the court of competent jurisdiction conditioned upon the payment by the surety of certain costs or fees as allowed by statute, the amount for which judgment may be entered may not exceed the amount of the unpaid fees or costs upon which the discharge had been conditioned. Judgment for the full amount of the forfeiture shall not be entered if payment of a lesser amount will satisfy the conditions to discharge the forfeiture. Within 10 days, the clerk shall furnish the Department of Financial Services and the Office of Insurance Regulation of the Financial Services Commission with a certified copy of the judgment docket and shall furnish the surety company at its home office a copy of the judgment, which shall include the power of attorney number of the bond and the name of the executing agent. If the judgment is not paid within 35 days, the clerk shall furnish the Department of Financial Services, the Office of Insurance Regulation, and the sheriff of the county in which the bond was executed, or the official responsible for operation of the county jail, if other than the sheriff, two copies of the judgment and a certificate stating that the judgment remains unsatisfied. When and if the judgment is properly paid or an order to vacate the judgment has been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, the clerk shall immediately notify the sheriff, or the official responsible for the operation of the county jail, if other than the sheriff, and the Department of Financial Services and the Office of Insurance Regulation, if the department and office had been previously notified of nonpayment, of such payment or order to vacate the judgment. The clerk may furnish documents or give notice as required in this subsection by mail or electronic means. The clerk shall also immediately prepare and record in the public records a satisfaction of the judgment or record the order to vacate judgment. If the defendant is returned to the county of jurisdiction of the court, whenever a motion to set aside the judgment is filed, the operation of this section is tolled until the court makes a disposition of the motion. (2) A certificate signed by the clerk of the court or her or his designee, certifying that the notice required in subsection (1) was mailed or electronically delivered on a specified date, and accompanied by a copy of the required notice constitutes sufficient proof that such mailing or electronic delivery was properly accomplished as indicated therein. If such mailing or electronic delivery was properly accomplished as evidenced by such certificate, the failure of a company to receive a copy of the judgment as prescribed in subsection (1) does not constitute a defense to the forfeiture and is not a ground for the discharge, remission, reduction, set aside, or continuance of such forfeiture. (3) Surety bail bonds may not be executed by a bail bond agent against whom a judgment has been entered which has remained unpaid for 35 days and may not be executed for a company against whom a judgment has been entered which has remained unpaid for 50 days. No sheriff or other official who is empowered to accept or approve surety bail bonds shall accept or approve such a bond executed by such a bail bond agent or executed for such a company until such judgment has been paid. (4) After notice of judgment against the surety given by the clerk of the circuit court, the surety or bail bond agent shall, within 35 days of the entry of judgment, submit to the clerk of the circuit court an amount equal to the judgment, unless the judgment has been set aside by the court within 35 days of the entry of judgment. If a motion to set aside the judgment has been filed pursuant to subsection (5), the amount submitted shall be held in escrow until such time as the court has disposed of the motion. The failure to comply with the provisions of this subsection constitutes a failure to pay the judgment. (5) After notice of judgment against the surety given by the clerk of the circuit court, the surety or bail bond agent may within 35 days file a motion to set aside the judgment or to stay the judgment. It shall be a condition of any such motion and of any order to stay the judgment that the surety pay the amount of the judgment to the clerk, which amount shall be held in escrow until such time as the court has disposed of the motion to set aside the judgment. The filing of such a motion, when accompanied by the required escrow deposit, shall act as an automatic stay of further proceedings, including execution, until the motion has been heard and a decision rendered by the court. (6) The failure of a state attorney to file, or of the clerk of the circuit court to make, a certified copy of the order of forfeiture as required by law applicable prior to July 1, 1982, shall not invalidate any judgment entered by the clerk prior to June 12, 1981.

(3) If the defendant surrenders or is apprehended within 180 days after forfeiture, the court, on motion at a hearing upon notice having been given to the clerk of the circuit court and the state attorney as required in subsection (8), shall direct remission of up to, but not more than, 95 percent of a forfeiture if the surety apprehended and surrendered the defendant or if the apprehension or surrender of the defendant was substantially procured or caused by the surety, or the surety has substantially attempted to procure or cause the apprehension or surrender of the defendant, and the delay has not thwarted the proper prosecution of the defendant.

In addition, remission shall be granted when the surety did not substantially participate or attempt to participate in the apprehension or surrender of the defendant when the costs of returning the defendant to the jurisdiction of the court have been deducted from the remission and when the delay has not thwarted the proper prosecution of the defendant. (5) If the defendant surrenders or is apprehended within 1 year after forfeiture, the court, on motion at a hearing upon notice having been given to the clerk of the circuit court and the state attorney as required in subsection (8), shall direct remission of up to, but not more than, 85 percent of a forfeiture if the surety apprehended and surrendered the defendant or if the apprehension or surrender of the defendant was substantially procured or caused by the surety, or the surety has substantially attempted to procure or cause the apprehension or surrender of the defendant, and the delay has not thwarted the proper prosecution of the defendant. In addition, remission shall be granted when the surety did not substantially participate or attempt to participate in the apprehension or surrender of the defendant when the costs of returning the defendant to the jurisdiction of the court have been deducted from the remission and when the delay has not thwarted the proper prosecution of the defendant. (6) If the defendant surrenders or is apprehended within 2 years after forfeiture, the court, on motion at a hearing upon notice having been given to the clerk of the circuit court and the state attorney as required in subsection (8), shall direct remission of up to, but not more than, 50 percent of a forfeiture if the surety apprehended and surrendered the defendant or if the apprehension or surrender of the defendant was substantially procured or caused by the surety, or the surety has substantially attempted to procure or cause the apprehension or surrender of the defendant, and the delay has not thwarted the proper prosecution of the defendant. In addition, remission shall be granted when the surety did not substantially participate or attempt to participate in the apprehension or surrender of the defendant when the costs of returning the defendant to the jurisdiction of the court have been deducted from the remission and when the delay has not thwarted the proper prosecution of the defendant. (7) The remission of a forfeiture may not be ordered for any reason other than as specified herein. (8) An application for remission must be accompanied by affidavits setting forth the facts on which it is founded; however, the surety must establish by further documentation or other evidence any claimed attempt at procuring or causing the apprehension or surrender of the defendant before the court may order remission based upon an attempt to procure or cause such apprehension or surrender. The clerk of the circuit court and the state attorney must be given 20 days’ notice before a hearing on an application and be furnished copies of all papers, applications, and affidavits. Remission shall be granted on the condition of payment of costs, unless the ground for remission is that there was no breach of the bond. (9) The clerk of the circuit court may enter into a contract with a private attorney or into an interagency agreement with a governmental agency to represent the clerk of the court in an action for the remission of a forfeiture under this section. (10) The clerk of the circuit court is the real party in interest for all appeals arising from an action for the remission of a forfeiture under this section.
