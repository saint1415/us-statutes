Any agreement by an individual in the employ of any person or concern to pay all or any portion of any employer’s contributions, reimbursements, interest, penalties, fines, or fees required under this chapter from the employer, is void. An employer may not directly or indirectly make or require or accept any deduction from wages to finance the employer’s contributions, reimbursements, interest, penalties, fines, or fees required from her or him, or require or accept any waiver of any right under this chapter by any individual in her or his employ. An employer, or an officer or agent of an employer, who violates this subsection commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.

An individual claiming benefits in any proceeding before the commission or the department, or representatives of either, or a court may be represented by counsel or an authorized representative, but the counsel or representative may not charge or receive for those services more than an amount approved by the commission, the department, or the court. (b) An attorney at law representing a claimant for benefits in any district court of appeal of this state or in the Supreme Court of Florida is entitled to counsel fees payable by the department as set by the court if the petition for review or appeal is initiated by the claimant and results in a decision awarding more benefits than provided in the decision from which appeal was taken. The amount of the fee may not exceed 50 percent of the total amount of regular benefits permitted under s. 443.111(5)(b) during the benefit year. (c) The department shall pay attorneys’ fees awarded under this section from the Employment Security Administration Trust Fund as part of the costs of administration of this chapter and may pay these fees directly to the attorney for the claimant in a lump sum.

      "text": "443.091 Benefit eligibility conditions.— (1) An unemployed individual is eligible to receive benefits for any week only if the Department of Commerce finds that: (a) She or he has made a claim for benefits for that week in accordance with the rules adopted by the department. (b) She or he has completed the department’s online work registration and subsequently reports to the one-stop career center as directed by the local workforce development board for reemployment services. This requirement does not apply to persons who are: 1. Non-Florida residents; 2. On a temporary layoff; 3. Union members who customarily obtain employment through a union hiring hall; 4. Claiming benefits under an approved short-time compensation plan as provided in s. 443.1116; or 5. Unable to complete the online work registration due to illiteracy, physical or mental impairment, a legal prohibition from using a computer, or a language impediment. If a person is exempted from the online work registration under this subparagraph, then the filing of his or her claim constitutes registration for work. (c) To make continued claims for benefits, she or he is reporting to the department in accordance with this paragraph and department rules. Department rules may not conflict with s. 443.111(1)(b), which requires that each claimant continue to report regardless of any pending appeal relating to her or his eligibility or disqualification for benefits. 1. For each week of unemployment claimed, each report must, at a minimum, include the name and address of each prospective employer contacted, or the date the claimant reported to a one-stop career center, pursuant to paragraph (d). For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term “address” means a website address, a physical address, or an e-mail address. 2. The department shall offer an online assessment aimed at identifying an individual’s skills, abilities, and career aptitude. The skills assessment must be voluntary, and the department shall allow a claimant to choose whether to take the skills assessment. The online assessment shall be made available to any person seeking services from a local workforce development board or a one-stop career center. a. If the claimant chooses to take the online assessment, the outcome of the assessment shall be made available to the claimant, local workforce development board, and one-stop career center. The department, local workforce development board, or one-stop career center shall use the assessment to develop a plan for referring individuals to training and employment opportunities. Aggregate data on assessment outcomes may be made available to CareerSource Florida, Inc., for use in the development of policies related to education and training programs that will ensure that businesses in this state have access to a skilled and competent workforce. b. Individuals shall be informed of and offered services through the one-stop delivery system, including career counseling, the provision of skill match and job market information, and skills upgrade and other training opportunities, and shall be encouraged to participate in such services at no cost to the individuals. The department shall coordinate with CareerSource Florida, Inc., the local workforce development boards, and the one-stop career centers to identify, develop, and use best practices for improving the skills of individuals who choose to participate in skills upgrade and other training opportunities. The department may contract with an entity to create the online assessment in accordance with the competitive bidding requirements in s. 287.057. The online assessment must work seamlessly with the Reemployment Assistance Claims and Benefits Information System. (d) She or he is able to work and is available for work. In order to assess eligibility for a claimed week of unemployment, the department shall develop criteria to determine a claimant’s ability to work and availability for work. A claimant must be actively seeking work in order to be considered available for work. This means engaging in systematic and sustained efforts to find work, including contacting at least five prospective employers for each week of unemployment claimed. The department may require the claimant to provide proof of such efforts to the one-stop career center as part of reemployment services. A claimant’s proof of work search efforts may not include the same prospective employer at the same location in 3 consecutive weeks, unless the employer has indicated since the time of the initial contact that the employer is hiring. The department shall conduct random reviews of work search information provided by claimants. As an alternative to contacting at least five prospective employers for any week of unemployment claimed, a claimant may, for that same week, report in person to a one-stop career center to meet with a representative of the center and access reemployment services of the center. The center shall keep a record of the services or information provided to the claimant and shall provide the records to the department upon request by the department. However: 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph or paragraphs (b) and (e), an otherwise eligible individual may not be denied benefits for any week because she or he is in training with the approval of the department, or by reason of s. 443.101(2) relating to failure to apply for, or refusal to accept, suitable work. Training may be approved by the department in accordance with criteria prescribed by rule. A claimant’s eligibility during approved training is contingent upon satisfying eligibility conditions prescribed by rule. 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an otherwise eligible individual who is in training approved under s. 236(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, may not be determined ineligible or disqualified for benefits due to enrollment in such training or because of leaving work that is not suitable employment to enter such training. As used in this subparagraph, the term “suitable employment” means work of a substantially equal or higher skill level than the worker’s past adversely affected employment, as defined for purposes of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, the wages for which are at least 80 percent of the worker’s average weekly wage as determined for purposes of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an otherwise eligible individual may not be denied benefits for any week because she or he is before any state or federal court pursuant to a lawfully issued summons to appear for jury duty. 4. Union members who customarily obtain employment through a union hiring hall may satisfy the work search requirements of this paragraph by reporting daily to their union hall. 5. The work search requirements of this paragraph do not apply to persons who are unemployed as a result of a temporary layoff or who are claiming benefits under an approved short-time compensation plan as provided in s. 443.1116. 6. In small counties as defined in s. 120.52(19), a claimant engaging in systematic and sustained efforts to find work must contact at least three prospective employers for each week of unemployment claimed. 7. The work search requirements of this paragraph do not apply to persons required to participate in reemployment services under paragraph (e). (e) She or he participates in reemployment services, such as job search assistance services, whenever the individual has been determined, by a profiling system established by the rules of the department, to be likely to exhaust regular benefits and to be in need of reemployment services. (f) She or he has been unemployed for a waiting period of 1 week. A week may be counted as a waiting week under this subsection only if: 1. It occurs within the benefit year that includes the week for which she or he claims payment of benefits; 2. Benefits have not been paid for that week; and 3. The individual was eligible for benefits for that week as provided in this section and s. 443.101, except for the requirements of this subsection and s. 443.101(5). (g) She or he has been paid wages for insured work equal to 1.5 times her or his high quarter wages during her or his base period, except that an unemployed individual is not eligible to receive benefits if the base period wages are less than $3,400. (h) She or he submitted to the department a valid social security number assigned to her or him. The department may verify the social security number with the United States Social Security Administration and may deny benefits if the department is unable to verify the individual’s social security number, the social security number is invalid, or the social security number is not assigned to the individual. (2) An individual may not receive benefits in a benefit year unless, after the beginning of the next preceding benefit year during which she or he received benefits, she or he performed service, regardless of whether in employment as defined in s. 443.036, and earned remuneration for that service of at least 3 times her or his weekly benefit amount as determined for her or his current benefit year. (3) Benefits based on service in employment described in s. 443.1216(2) and (3) are payable in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions as benefits payable based on other service subject to this chapter, except that: (a) Benefits are not payable for services in an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity for an educational institution or an institution of higher education for any week of unemployment commencing during the period between 2 successive academic years; during a similar period between two regular terms, whether or not successive; or during a period of paid sabbatical leave provided for in the individual’s contract, to any individual, if the individual performs those services in the first of those academic years or terms and there is a contract or a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform services in any such capacity for any educational institution or institution of higher education in the second of those academic years or terms. (b) Benefits may not be based on services in any other capacity for an educational institution or an institution of higher education to any individual for any week that commences during a period between 2 successive academic years or terms if the individual performs those services in the first of the academic years or terms and there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform those services in the second of the academic years or terms. However, if compensation is denied to any individual under this paragraph and the individual was not offered an opportunity to perform those services for the educational institution for the second of those academic years or terms, that individual is entitled to a retroactive payment of compensation for each week for which the individual filed a timely claim for compensation and for which compensation was denied solely by reason of this paragraph. (c) Benefits are not payable based on services provided to an educational institution or institution of higher learning to any individual for any week that commences during an established and customary vacation period or holiday recess if the individual performs any services described in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) in the period immediately before the vacation period or holiday recess and there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform any service in the period immediately after the vacation period or holiday recess. (d) Benefits are not payable for services in any capacity specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) to any individual who performed those services in an educational institution while in the employ of a governmental agency or governmental entity that is established and operated exclusively for the purpose of providing those services to one or more educational institutions. (e) Benefits are not payable for services in any capacity specified in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) to any individual who provided those services to or on behalf of an educational institution, or an institution of higher education. (f) Effective July 1, 2013, paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) shall apply to services provided by an individual for an educational institution while in the employ of a private employer holding a contractual relationship with such educational institution, but only if the base period wages attributable to such services are identified as such in the quarterly reports filed pursuant to s. 443.131(1). (g) As used in this subsection, the term: 1. “Fixed contract” means a written agreement of employment for a specified period of time. 2. “Continuing contract” means a written agreement that is automatically renewed until terminated by one of the parties to the contract. (4) In the event of national emergency, in the course of which the Federal Emergency Unemployment Payment Plan is, at the request of the Governor, invoked for all or any part of the state, the emergency plan shall supersede the procedures prescribed by this chapter, and by rules adopted under this chapter, and the department shall act as the Florida agency for the United States Department of Labor in the administration of the plan. (5) Benefits are not payable to any individual based on service 90 percent or more of which consists of participating in sports or athletic events or training, or preparing to participate, for any week that commences during the period between two successive sport seasons, or similar periods, if the individual performed the service in the first of those seasons, or similar periods, and there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform those services in the later of those seasons, or similar periods.

      "heading": "Disqualification for benefits.",
      "text": "443.101 Disqualification for benefits.—An individual shall be disqualified for benefits: (1)(a) For the week in which he or she has voluntarily left work without good cause attributable to his or her employing unit or for the week in which he or she has been discharged by the employing unit for misconduct connected with his or her work, based on a finding by the Department of Commerce. As used in this paragraph, the term “work” means any work, whether full-time, part-time, or temporary. 1. Disqualification for voluntarily quitting continues for the full period of unemployment next ensuing after the individual has left his or her full-time, part-time, or temporary work voluntarily without good cause and until the individual has earned income equal to or greater than 17 times his or her weekly benefit amount. As used in this subsection, the term “good cause” includes only that cause attributable to the employing unit which would compel a reasonable employee to cease working or attributable to the individual’s illness or disability requiring separation from his or her work. Any other disqualification may not be imposed. 2. An individual is not disqualified under this subsection for: a. Voluntarily leaving temporary work to return immediately when called to work by the permanent employing unit that temporarily terminated his or her work within the previous 6 calendar months; b. Voluntarily leaving work to relocate as a result of his or her military-connected spouse’s permanent change of station orders, activation orders, or unit deployment orders; or c. Voluntarily leaving work if he or she proves that his or her discontinued employment is a direct result of circumstances related to domestic violence as defined in s. 741.28. An individual who voluntarily leaves work under this sub-subparagraph must: (I) Make reasonable efforts to preserve employment, unless the individual establishes that such remedies are likely to be futile or to increase the risk of future incidents of domestic violence. Such efforts may include seeking a protective injunction, relocating to a secure place, or seeking reasonable accommodation from the employing unit, such as a transfer or change of assignment; (II) Provide evidence such as an injunction, a protective order, or other documentation authorized by state law which reasonably proves that domestic violence has occurred; and (III) Reasonably believe that he or she is likely to be the victim of a future act of domestic violence at, in transit to, or departing from his or her place of employment. 3. The employment record of an employing unit may not be charged for the payment of benefits to an individual who has voluntarily left work under sub-subparagraph 2.c. 4. Disqualification for being discharged for misconduct connected with his or her work continues for the full period of unemployment next ensuing after having been discharged and until the individual is reemployed and has earned income of at least 17 times his or her weekly benefit amount and for not more than 52 weeks immediately following that week, as determined by the department in each case according to the circumstances or the seriousness of the misconduct, under the department’s rules for determining disqualification for benefits for misconduct. 5. If an individual has provided notification to the employing unit of his or her intent to voluntarily leave work and the employing unit discharges the individual for reasons other than misconduct before the date the voluntary quit was to take effect, the individual, if otherwise entitled, shall receive benefits from the date of the employer’s discharge until the effective date of his or her voluntary quit. 6. If an individual is notified by the employing unit of the employer’s intent to discharge the individual for reasons other than misconduct and the individual quits without good cause before the date the discharge was to take effect, the claimant is ineligible for benefits pursuant to s. 443.091(1)(d) for failing to be available for work for the week or weeks of unemployment occurring before the effective date of the discharge. (b) For any week with respect to which the department finds that his or her unemployment is due to a suspension for misconduct connected with the individual’s work. (c) For any week with respect to which the department finds that his or her unemployment is due to a leave of absence, if the leave was voluntarily initiated by the individual. (d) For any week with respect to which the department finds that his or her unemployment is due to a discharge for misconduct connected with the individual’s work, consisting of drug use, as evidenced by a positive, confirmed drug test. (2) If the Department of Commerce finds that the individual has failed without good cause to apply for available suitable work, accept suitable work when offered to him or her, or return to the individual’s customary self-employment when directed by the department, the disqualification continues for the full period of unemployment next ensuing after he or she failed without good cause to apply for available suitable work, accept suitable work, or return to his or her customary self-employment, and until the individual has earned income of at least 17 times his or her weekly benefit amount. The department shall by rule adopt criteria for determining the “suitability of work,” as used in this section. In developing these rules, the department shall consider the duration of a claimant’s unemployment in determining the suitability of work and the suitability of proposed rates of compensation for available work. Further, after an individual has received 25 weeks of benefits in a single year, suitable work is a job that pays the minimum wage and is 120 percent or more of the weekly benefit amount the individual is drawing. (a) In determining whether or not any work is suitable for an individual, the department shall consider the degree of risk to the individual’s health, safety, and morals; the individual’s physical fitness, prior training, experience, prior earnings, length of unemployment, and prospects for securing local work in his or her customary occupation; and the distance of the available work from his or her residence. (b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, work is not deemed suitable and benefits may not be denied to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work under any of the following conditions: 1. The position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute. 2. The wages, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are substantially less favorable to the individual than those prevailing for similar work in the locality. 3. As a condition of being employed, the individual is required to join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization. (c) If the department finds that an individual was rejected for offered employment as the direct result of a positive, confirmed drug test required as a condition of employment, the individual is disqualified for refusing to accept an offer of suitable work. (3) For any week with respect to which he or she is receiving or has received remuneration in the form of: (a) Wages in lieu of notice. (b) Severance pay. The number of weeks that an individual’s severance pay disqualifies the individual is equal to the amount of the severance pay divided by that individual’s average weekly wage received from the employer that paid the severance pay, rounded down to the nearest whole number, beginning with the week the individual is separated from employment. (c) Compensation for temporary total disability or permanent total disability under the workers’ compensation law of any state or under a similar law of the United States. If the remuneration referred to in this subsection is less than the benefits that would otherwise be due under this chapter, an individual who is otherwise eligible is entitled to receive for that week benefits reduced by the amount of the remuneration. (4) For any week with respect to which the department finds that his or her total or partial unemployment is due to a labor dispute in active progress which exists at the factory, establishment, or other premises at which he or she is or was last employed; except that this subsection does not apply if it is shown to the satisfaction of the department that: (a)1. He or she is not participating in, financing, or directly interested in the labor dispute that is in active progress; however, the payment of regular union dues may not be construed as financing a labor dispute within the meaning of this section; and 2. He or she does not belong to a grade or class of workers of which immediately before the commencement of the labor dispute there were members employed at the premises at which the labor dispute occurs any of whom are participating in, financing, or directly interested in the dispute; if in any case separate branches of work are commonly conducted as separate businesses in separate premises, or are conducted in separate departments of the same premises, each department, for the purpose of this subsection, is deemed to be a separate factory, establishment, or other premise. (b) His or her total or partial unemployment results from a lockout by his or her employer. As used in this section, the term “lockout” means a situation in which employees have not gone on strike, nor have employees notified the employer of a date certain for a strike, but in which employees have been denied entry to the factory, establishment, or other premises of employment by the employer. However, benefits are not payable under this paragraph if the lockout action was taken in response to threats, actions, or other indications of impending damage to property and equipment or possible physical violence by employees or in response to actual damage or violence or a substantial reduction in production instigated or perpetrated by employees. (5) For any week with respect to which or a part of which he or she has received or is seeking reemployment assistance or unemployment benefits under a reemployment assistance or unemployment compensation law of another state or of the United States. For the purposes of this subsection, a reemployment assistance or unemployment compensation law of the United States is any law of the United States which provides for payment of any type and in any amounts for periods of unemployment due to lack of work. However, if the appropriate agency of the other state or of the United States finally determines that he or she is not entitled to reemployment assistance or unemployment benefits, this disqualification does not apply. (6) For making any false or fraudulent representation for the purpose of obtaining benefits contrary to this chapter, constituting a violation under s. 443.071. The disqualification imposed under this subsection shall begin with the week for which the false or fraudulent representation was made and shall continue for a period not to exceed 1 year after the date the Department of Commerce discovers the false or fraudulent representation and until any overpayment of benefits resulting from such representation has been repaid in full. This disqualification may be appealed in the same manner as any other disqualification imposed under this section. A conviction by any court of competent jurisdiction in this state of the offense prohibited or punished by s. 443.071 is conclusive upon the appeals referee and the commission of the making of the false or fraudulent representation for which disqualification is imposed under this section. (7) If the Department of Commerce finds that the individual is an alien, unless the alien is an individual who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise is permanently residing in the United States under color of law, including an alien who is lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of s. 203(a)(7) or s. 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, if any modifications to s. 3304(a)(14) of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, as provided by Pub. L. No. 94-566, which specify other conditions or other effective dates than those stated under federal law for the denial of benefits based on services performed by aliens, and which modifications are required to be implemented under state law as a condition for full tax credit against the tax imposed by the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, are deemed applicable under this section, if: (a) Any data or information required of individuals applying for benefits to determine whether benefits are not payable to them because of their alien status is uniformly required from all applicants for benefits; and (b) In the case of an individual whose application for benefits would otherwise be approved, a determination that benefits to such individual are not payable because of his or her alien status may not be made except by a preponderance of the evidence. If the department finds that the individual has refused without good cause an offer of resettlement or relocation, which offer provides for suitable employment for the individual notwithstanding the distance of relocation, resettlement, or employment from the current location of the individual in this state, this disqualification continues for the week in which the failure occurred and for not more than 17 weeks immediately after that week, or a reduction by not more than 5 weeks from the duration of benefits, as determined by the department in each case. (8) For any week with respect to which he or she has received, from a base period employer, benefits from a retirement, pension, or annuity program embodied in a union contract or either a public or private employee benefit program, except: (a) For any week in which benefits from a retirement, pension, or annuity program, as referred to in this subsection, are less than the weekly benefits that would otherwise be due under this chapter, he or she is entitled to receive for that week, if otherwise eligible, benefits reduced by the amount of benefits from the retirement, pension, or annuity program, prorated to a weekly basis; (b) For any week in which an individual has received benefits from a retirement, pension, or annuity program, as referred to in this subsection, for which program he or she has paid at least one-half of the contributions, the individual is entitled to receive for that week, if otherwise eligible, benefits reduced by one-half of the amount of benefits from the retirement, pension, or annuity program, prorated on a weekly basis; or (c) For any week in which he or she has received benefits from a retirement, pension, or annuity program under the United States Social Security Act, for which program he or she has paid any contribution, benefits may not be reduced because of the contribution. For the purpose of this subsection, benefits from the United States Social Security Act, a disability benefit program, or any other similar periodic payment based on the previous work of the individual are considered retirement income, except as provided in paragraph (c). (9) If the individual was terminated from his or her work as follows: (a) If the Department of Commerce or the Reemployment Assistance Appeals Commission finds that the individual was terminated from work for violation of any criminal law, under any jurisdiction, which was in connection with his or her work, and the individual was convicted, or entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the individual is not entitled to reemployment assistance benefits for up to 52 weeks, pursuant to rules adopted by the department, and until he or she has earned income of at least 17 times his or her weekly benefit amount. If, before an adjudication of guilt, an admission of guilt, or a plea of nolo contendere, the employer proves by competent substantial evidence to the department that the arrest was due to a crime against the employer or the employer’s business, customers, or invitees, the individual is not entitled to reemployment assistance benefits. (b) If the department or the Reemployment Assistance Appeals Commission finds that the individual was terminated from work for any dishonest act in connection with his or her work, the individual is not entitled to reemployment assistance benefits for up to 52 weeks, pursuant to rules adopted by the department, and until he or she has earned income of at least 17 times his or her weekly benefit amount. If the employer terminates an individual as a result of a dishonest act in connection with his or her work and the department finds misconduct in connection with his or her work, the individual is not entitled to reemployment assistance benefits. If an individual is disqualified for benefits, the account of the terminating employer, if the employer is in the base period, is noncharged at the time the disqualification is imposed. (10) Subject to the requirements of this subsection, if the claim is made based on the loss of employment as a leased employee for an employee leasing company or as a temporary employee for a temporary help firm. (a) As used in this subsection, the term: 1. “Temporary help firm” means a firm that hires its own employees and assigns them to clients to support or supplement the client’s workforce in work situations such as employee absences, temporary skill shortages, seasonal workloads, and special assignments and projects, and includes a labor pool as defined in s. 448.22. The term also includes a firm created by an entity licensed under s. 125.012(6), which hires employees assigned by a union for the purpose of supplementing or supporting the workforce of the temporary help firm’s clients. The term does not include employee leasing companies regulated under part XI of chapter 468. 2. “Temporary employee” means an employee assigned to work for the clients of a temporary help firm. The term also includes a day laborer performing day labor, as defined in s. 448.22, who is employed by a labor pool as defined in s. 448.22. 3. “Leased employee” means an employee assigned to work for the clients of an employee leasing company regulated under part XI of chapter 468. (b) A temporary or leased employee is deemed to have voluntarily quit employment and is disqualified for benefits under subparagraph (1)(a)1. if, upon conclusion of his or her latest assignment, the temporary or leased employee, without good cause, failed to contact the temporary help or employee-leasing firm for reassignment, if the employer advised the temporary or leased employee at the time of hire and that the leased employee is notified also at the time of separation that he or she must report for reassignment upon conclusion of each assignment, regardless of the duration of the assignment, and that reemployment assistance benefits may be denied for failure to report. For purposes of this section, the time of hire for a day laborer is upon his or her acceptance of the first assignment following completion of an employment application with the labor pool. The labor pool as defined in s. 448.22(1) must provide notice to the temporary employee upon conclusion of the latest assignment that work is available the next business day and that the temporary employee must report for reassignment the next business day. The notice must be given by means of a notice printed on the paycheck, written notice included in the pay envelope, or other written notification at the conclusion of the current assignment. (11) If an individual is discharged from employment for drug use as evidenced by a positive, confirmed drug test as provided in paragraph (1)(d), or is rejected for offered employment because of a positive, confirmed drug test as provided in paragraph (2)(c), test results and chain of custody documentation provided to the employer by a licensed and approved drug-testing laboratory is self-authenticating and admissible in reemployment assistance hearings, and such evidence creates a rebuttable presumption that the individual used, or was using, controlled substances, subject to the following conditions: (a) To qualify for the presumption described in this subsection, an employer must have implemented a drug-free workplace program under ss. 440.101 and 440.102, and must submit proof that the employer has qualified for the insurance discounts provided under s. 627.0915, as certified by the insurance carrier or self-insurance unit. In lieu of these requirements, an employer who does not fit the definition of “employer” in s. 440.102 may qualify for the presumption if the employer is in compliance with equivalent or more stringent drug-testing standards established by federal law or regulation. (b) Only laboratories licensed and approved as provided in s. 440.102(9), or as provided by equivalent or more stringent licensing requirements established by federal law or regulation may perform the drug tests. (c) Disclosure of drug test results and other information pertaining to drug testing of individuals who claim or receive compensation under this chapter shall be governed by s. 443.1715. (12) For any week in which the individual is unavailable for work due to incarceration or imprisonment. (13) For any week with respect to which the department finds that his or her unemployment is due to a discharge from employment for failure without good cause to maintain a license, registration, or certification required by applicable law necessary for the employee to perform her or his assigned job duties. For purposes of this subsection, the term “good cause” includes, but is not limited to, failure of the employer to submit information required for a license, registration, or certification; short-term physical injury which prevents the employee from completing or taking a required test; and inability to take or complete a required test that is outside the employee’s control.

      "heading": "Payment of benefits.",
      "text": "443.111 Payment of benefits.— (1) MANNER OF PAYMENT.—Benefits are payable from the fund in accordance with rules adopted by the Department of Commerce, subject to the following requirements: (a) Benefits are payable electronically, except that an individual being paid by paper warrant on July 1, 2011, may continue to be paid in that manner until the expiration of the claim. The department may develop a system for the payment of benefits by electronic funds transfer, including, but not limited to, debit cards, electronic payment cards, or any other means of electronic payment that the department deems to be commercially viable or cost-effective. Commodities or services related to the development of such a system shall be procured by competitive solicitation, unless they are purchased from a state term contract pursuant to s. 287.056. The department shall adopt rules necessary to administer this paragraph. (b) As required under s. 443.091(1), each claimant must report at least biweekly to receive reemployment assistance benefits and to attest to the fact that she or he is able and available for work, has not refused suitable work, is seeking work and has met the requirements of s. 443.091(1)(d), and, if she or he has worked, to report earnings from that work. Each claimant must continue to report regardless of any appeal or pending appeal relating to her or his eligibility or disqualification for benefits. (2) QUALIFYING REQUIREMENTS.—To establish a benefit year for reemployment assistance benefits, an individual must have: (a) Wage credits in two or more calendar quarters of the individual’s base period. (b) Minimum total base period wage credits equal to the high quarter wages multiplied by 1.5, but at least $3,400 in the base period. (3) WEEKLY BENEFIT AMOUNT.—An individual’s “weekly benefit amount” is an amount equal to one twenty-sixth of the total wages for insured work paid during that quarter of the base period in which the total wages paid were the highest, but not less than $32 or more than $275. The weekly benefit amount, if not a multiple of $1, is rounded downward to the nearest full dollar amount. The maximum weekly benefit amount in effect at the time the claimant establishes an individual weekly benefit amount is the maximum benefit amount applicable throughout the claimant’s benefit year. (4) WEEKLY BENEFIT FOR UNEMPLOYMENT.— (a) Total.—Each eligible individual who is totally unemployed in any week is paid for the week a benefit equal to her or his weekly benefit amount. (b) Partial.—Each eligible individual who is partially unemployed in any week is paid for the week a benefit equal to her or his weekly benefit less that part of the earned income, if any, payable to her or him for the week which is in excess of 8 times the federal hourly minimum wage. These benefits, if not a multiple of $1, are rounded downward to the nearest full dollar amount. (5) DURATION OF BENEFITS.— (a) As used in this section, the term “Florida average unemployment rate” means the average of the 3 months for the most recent third calendar year quarter of the seasonally adjusted statewide unemployment rates as published by the Department of Commerce. (b) Each otherwise eligible individual is entitled during any benefit year to a total amount of benefits equal to 25 percent of the total wages in his or her base period, not to exceed $6,325 or the product arrived at by multiplying the weekly benefit amount with the number of weeks determined in paragraph (c), whichever is less. However, the total amount of benefits, if not a multiple of $1, is rounded downward to the nearest full dollar amount. These benefits are payable at a weekly rate no greater than the weekly benefit amount. (c) For claims submitted during a calendar year, the duration of benefits is limited to: 1. Twelve weeks if this state’s average unemployment rate is at or below 5 percent. 2. An additional week in addition to the 12 weeks for each 0.5 percent increment in this state’s average unemployment rate above 5 percent. 3. Up to a maximum of 23 weeks if this state’s average unemployment rate equals or exceeds 10.5 percent. (d) For the purposes of this subsection, wages are counted as “wages for insured work” for benefit purposes with respect to any benefit year only if the benefit year begins after the date the employing unit by whom the wages were paid has satisfied the conditions of this chapter for becoming an employer. (e) If the remuneration of an individual is not based upon a fixed period or duration of time or if the individual’s wages are paid at irregular intervals or in a manner that does not extend regularly over the period of employment, the wages for any week or for any calendar quarter for the purpose of computing an individual’s right to employment benefits only are determined in the manner prescribed by rule. These rules, to the extent practicable, must secure results reasonably similar to those that would prevail if the individual were paid her or his wages at regular intervals.

      "text": "443.1115 Extended benefits.— (1) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the term: (a) “Extended benefit period” means a period that: 1. Begins with the third week after a week for which there is a state “on” indicator; and 2. Ends with either of the following weeks, whichever occurs later: a. The third week after the first week for which there is a state “off” indicator; or b. The 13th consecutive week of that period. However, an extended benefit period may not begin by reason of a state “on” indicator before the 14th week after the end of a prior extended benefit period that was in effect for this state. (b) “State ‘on’ indicator” means the occurrence of a week in which the rate of insured unemployment under state law, not seasonally adjusted, for the period consisting of that week and the 12 weeks immediately preceding it: 1. Equals or exceeds 120 percent of the average of those rates for the corresponding 13-week period ending in each of the preceding 2 calendar years; and 2. Equals or exceeds 5 percent. (c) “State ‘off’ indicator” means the occurrence of a week in which there is no state “on” indicator. (d) “Rate of insured unemployment” means the percentage derived by dividing the average weekly number of individuals filing claims for regular compensation in this state, excluding extended-benefit claimants for weeks of unemployment with respect to the most recent 13-consecutive-week period, as determined by the Department of Commerce on the basis of its reports to the United States Secretary of Labor, by the average monthly employment covered under this chapter for the first four of the most recent six completed calendar quarters ending before the end of that 13-week period. (e) “Regular benefits” means benefits payable to an individual under this chapter or under any other state law, including benefits payable to federal civilian employees and to ex-servicemembers under 5 U.S.C. ss. 8501-8525, other than extended benefits. (f) “Extended benefits” means benefits, including benefits payable to federal civilian employees and to ex-servicemembers under 5 U.S.C. ss. 8501-8525, payable to an individual under this section for weeks of unemployment in her or his eligibility period. (g) “Eligibility period” means the period consisting of the weeks in her or his benefit year which begin in an extended benefit period and, if her or his benefit year ends within that extended benefit period, any subsequent weeks beginning in that period. (h) “Exhaustee” means an individual who, for any week of unemployment in her or his eligibility period: 1. Has received, before that week, all of the regular benefits available to her or him under this chapter or any other state law, including dependents’ allowances and benefits payable to federal civilian employees and ex-servicemembers under 5 U.S.C. ss. 8501-8525, in her or his current benefit year that includes that week. For the purposes of this paragraph, an individual has received all of the regular benefits available to her or him although, as a result of a pending appeal for wages paid for insured work which were not considered in the original monetary determination in her or his benefit year, she or he may subsequently be determined to be entitled to added regular benefits; 2. Her or his benefit year having expired before that week, was paid no, or insufficient, wages for insured work on the basis of which she or he could establish a new benefit year that includes that week; and 3.a. Has no right to unemployment benefits or allowances under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act or other federal laws as specified in regulations issued by the United States Secretary of Labor; and b. Has not received and is not seeking unemployment benefits under the unemployment compensation law of Canada; but if she or he is seeking those benefits and the appropriate agency finally determines that she or he is not entitled to benefits under that law, she or he is considered an exhaustee. (2) REGULAR BENEFITS ON CLAIMS FOR, AND THE PAYMENT OF, EXTENDED BENEFITS.—Except when the result is inconsistent with the other provisions of this section and as provided in the rules of the Department of Commerce, the provisions of this chapter applying to claims for, or the payment of, regular benefits apply to claims for, and the payment of, extended benefits. These extended benefits are charged to the employment records of employers to the extent that the share of those extended benefits paid from this state’s Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund is not eligible to be reimbursed from federal sources. (3) ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR EXTENDED BENEFITS.— (a) An individual is eligible to receive extended benefits for any week of unemployment in her or his eligibility period only if the Department of Commerce finds that, for that week: 1. She or he is an exhaustee as defined in subsection (1). 2. She or he satisfies the requirements of this chapter for the receipt of regular benefits applicable to individuals claiming extended benefits, including not being subject to disqualification from the receipt of benefits. An individual disqualified from receiving regular benefits may not receive extended benefits after the disqualification period terminates if he or she was disqualified for voluntarily leaving work, being discharged from work for misconduct, or refusing suitable work. However, if the disqualification period for regular benefits terminates because the individual received the required amount of remuneration for services rendered as a common-law employee, she or he may receive extended benefits. 3. The individual was paid wages for insured work for the applicable benefit year equal to 1.5 times the high quarter earnings during the base period. (b)1. Except as provided in subparagraph 2., an individual is not eligible for extended benefits for any week if: a. Extended benefits are payable for the week pursuant to an interstate claim filed in any state under the interstate benefit payment plan; and b. An extended benefit period is not in effect for the week in the other state. 2. This paragraph does not apply with respect to the first 2 weeks for which extended benefits are payable, pursuant to an interstate claim filed under the interstate benefit payment plan, to the individual from the extended benefit account established for the individual for the benefit year. (c)1. An individual is disqualified from receiving extended benefits if the department finds that, during any week of unemployment in her or his eligibility period: a. She or he failed to apply for suitable work or, if offered, failed to accept suitable work, unless the individual can furnish to the department satisfactory evidence that her or his prospects for obtaining work in her or his customary occupation within a reasonably short period are good. If this evidence is deemed satisfactory for this purpose, the determination of whether any work is suitable for the individual shall be made in accordance with the definition of suitable work in s. 443.101(2). This disqualification begins with the week the failure occurred and continues until she or he is employed for at least 4 weeks and receives earned income of at least 17 times her or his weekly benefit amount. b. She or he failed to furnish tangible evidence that she or he actively engaged in a systematic and sustained effort to find work. This disqualification begins with the week the failure occurred and continues until she or he is employed for at least 4 weeks and receives earned income of at least 4 times her or his weekly benefit amount. 2. Except as otherwise provided in sub-subparagraph 1.a., as used in this paragraph, the term “suitable work” means any work within the individual’s capabilities to perform, if: a. The gross average weekly remuneration payable for the work exceeds the sum of the individual’s weekly benefit amount plus the amount, if any, of supplemental unemployment benefits, as defined in s. 501(c)(17)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, payable to the individual for that week; b. The wages payable for the work equal the higher of the minimum wages provided by s. 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, without regard to any exemption, or the state or local minimum wage; and c. The work otherwise meets the definition of suitable work in s. 443.101(2) to the extent that the criteria for suitability are not inconsistent with this paragraph. (d) However, notwithstanding paragraph (c), or any other provision of this chapter, an individual who is in training approved under s. 236(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, may not be determined to be ineligible or disqualified for extended benefits for her or his enrollment in training or because of leaving work that is not suitable employment to enter such training. As used in this paragraph, the term “suitable employment” means work of a substantially equal or higher skill level than the worker’s past adversely affected employment, as defined for purposes of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, the wages for which are at least 80 percent of the worker’s average weekly wage, as determined for purposes of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. (4) WEEKLY EXTENDED BENEFIT AMOUNT.—The weekly extended benefit amount payable to an individual for a week of total unemployment in her or his eligibility period is equal to the weekly benefit amount payable to her or him during her or his applicable benefit year. For any individual who is paid benefits during the applicable benefit year in accordance with more than one weekly benefit amount, the weekly extended benefit amount is the average of those weekly benefit amounts. (5) TOTAL EXTENDED BENEFIT AMOUNT.— (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), the total extended benefit amount payable to an eligible individual for her or his applicable benefit year is the lesser of: 1. Fifty percent of the total regular benefits payable to her or him under this chapter in her or his applicable benefit year; or 2. Thirteen times her or his weekly benefit amount payable to her or him under this chapter for a week of total unemployment in the applicable benefit year. (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if the benefit year of an individual ends within an extended benefit period, the number of weeks of extended benefits the individual is entitled to receive in that extended benefit period for weeks of unemployment beginning after the end of the benefit year, except as provided in this subsection, is reduced, but not to below zero, by the number of weeks for which the individual received, within that benefit year, trade readjustment allowances under the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. (6) COMPUTATIONS.—The Department of Commerce shall perform the computations required under paragraph (1)(d) in accordance with regulations of the United States Secretary of Labor. (7) RECOVERY OF OVERPAYMENTS UNDER THE TRADE ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED.—If the state, a cooperating state agency, the United States Secretary of Labor, or a court of competent jurisdiction finds that a person has received payments under the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, to which the person was not entitled, the sum of those payments shall be deducted from the extended benefits payable to that person under this section, except that each single deduction under this subsection may not exceed 50 percent of the amount otherwise payable. The amounts deducted must be paid to the agency that issued the payments under the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, for return to the United States Treasury. However, except for overpayments determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, a deduction may not be made under this subsection until a determination by the state agency or the United States Secretary of Labor is final.

      "text": "443.1116 Short-time compensation.— (1) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the term: (a) “Affected unit” means a specified plant, department, shift, or other definable unit of two or more employees designated by the employer to participate in a short-time compensation plan. (b) “Employer-sponsored training” means a training component sponsored by an employer to improve the skills of the employer’s workers. (c) “Normal weekly hours of work” means the number of hours in a week that an individual would regularly work for the short-time compensation employer, not to exceed 40 hours, excluding overtime. (d) “Short-time compensation benefits” means benefits payable to individuals in an affected unit under an approved short-time compensation plan. (e) “Short-time compensation employer” means an employer with a short-time compensation plan in effect. (f) “Short-time compensation plan” or “plan” means an employer’s written plan for reducing unemployment under which an affected unit shares the work remaining after its normal weekly hours of work are reduced. (2) APPROVAL OF SHORT-TIME COMPENSATION PLANS.—An employer wishing to participate in the short-time compensation program must submit a signed, written, short-time plan to the Department of Commerce for approval. The Secretary of Commerce or his or her designee shall approve the plan if: (a) The plan applies to and identifies each specific affected unit; (b) The individuals in the affected unit are identified by name and social security number; (c) The normal weekly hours of work for individuals in the affected unit are reduced by at least 10 percent and by not more than 40 percent; (d) The plan includes a certified statement by the employer that the aggregate reduction in work hours is in lieu of layoffs that would affect at least 10 percent of the employees in the affected unit and that would have resulted in an equivalent reduction in work hours; (e) The plan applies to at least 10 percent of the employees in the affected unit; (f) The plan is approved in writing by the collective bargaining agent for each collective bargaining agreement covering any individual in the affected unit; (g) The plan does not serve as a subsidy to seasonal employers during the off-season or as a subsidy to employers who traditionally use part-time employees; (h) The plan certifies that, if the employer provides fringe benefits to any employee whose workweek is reduced under the program, the fringe benefits will continue to be provided to the employee participating in the short-time compensation program under the same terms and conditions as though the workweek of such employee had not been reduced or to the same extent as other employees not participating in the short-time compensation program. As used in this paragraph, the term “fringe benefits” includes, but is not limited to, health insurance, retirement benefits under defined benefit pension plans as defined in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. s. 1002(35), contributions under a defined contribution plan as defined in s. 414(i) of the Internal Revenue Code, paid vacation and holidays, and sick leave; (i) The plan describes the manner in which the requirements of this subsection will be implemented, including a plan for giving notice, if feasible, to an employee whose workweek is to be reduced, together with an estimate of the number of layoffs that would have occurred absent the ability to participate in short-time compensation; and (j) The terms of the employer’s written plan and implementation are consistent with employer obligations under applicable federal laws and laws of this state. (3) APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL OF THE PLAN.—The Secretary of Commerce or his or her designee shall approve or disapprove a short-time compensation plan in writing within 15 days after its receipt. If the plan is denied, the secretary or his or her designee shall notify the employer of the reasons for disapproval. (4) BEGINNING AND TERMINATION OF SHORT-TIME COMPENSATION BENEFIT PERIOD.—A plan takes effect on the date of its approval by the Secretary of Commerce or his or her designee and expires at the end of the 12th full calendar month after its effective date. (5) ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR SHORT-TIME COMPENSATION BENEFITS.— (a) Except as provided in this subsection, an individual is eligible to receive short-time compensation benefits for any week only if she or he complies with this chapter and the Department of Commerce finds that: 1. The individual is employed as a member of an affected unit in an approved plan that was approved before the week and is in effect for the week; 2. The individual is able to work and is available for additional hours of work or for full-time work with the short-time employer; and 3. The normal weekly hours of work of the individual are reduced by at least 10 percent but not by more than 40 percent, with a corresponding reduction in wages. (b) The department may not deny short-time compensation benefits to an individual who is otherwise eligible for these benefits for any week by reason of the application of any provision of this chapter relating to availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to apply for or accept work from other than the short-time compensation employer of that individual. (c) The department may not deny short-time compensation benefits to an individual who is otherwise eligible for these benefits for any week because such individual is participating in an employer-sponsored training or a training under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to improve job skills when the training is approved by the department. (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an individual is deemed unemployed in any week for which compensation is payable to her or him, as an employee in an affected unit, for less than her or his normal weekly hours of work in accordance with an approved short-time compensation plan in effect for the week. (6) WEEKLY SHORT-TIME COMPENSATION BENEFIT AMOUNT.—The weekly short-time compensation benefit amount payable to an individual is equal to the product of her or his weekly benefit amount as provided in s. 443.111(3) and the ratio of the number of normal weekly hours of work for which the employer would not compensate the individual to the individual’s normal weekly hours of work. The benefit amount, if not a multiple of $1, is rounded downward to the next lower multiple of $1. (7) TOTAL SHORT-TIME COMPENSATION BENEFIT AMOUNT.—An individual may not be paid benefits under this section in any benefit year for more than the maximum entitlement provided in s. 443.111(5), and an individual may not be paid short-time compensation benefits for more than 26 weeks in any benefit year. (8) EFFECT OF SHORT-TIME COMPENSATION BENEFITS RELATING TO THE PAYMENT OF REGULAR AND EXTENDED BENEFITS.— (a) The short-time compensation benefits paid to an individual shall be deducted from the total benefit amount established for that individual in s. 443.111(5). (b) An individual who receives all of the short-time compensation or combined reemployment assistance or unemployment compensation and short-time compensation available in a benefit year is considered an exhaustee for purposes of the extended benefits program in s. 443.1115 and, if otherwise eligible under those provisions, is eligible to receive extended benefits. (c) An otherwise eligible individual may not be disqualified from benefits for leaving employment instead of accepting a reduction in hours under an approved plan. (9) ALLOCATION OF SHORT-TIME COMPENSATION BENEFIT CHARGES.—Except when the result is inconsistent with the other provisions of this chapter, short-time compensation benefits shall be charged to the employment record of employers as provided in s. 443.131(3).

(2) TERMINATION OF COVERAGE.— (a) General.—Except as otherwise provided in this section, an employing unit ceases to be an employer subject to this chapter as of January 1 of any calendar year only if it files with the tax collection service provider, by April 30 of the year for which termination is requested, a written application for termination of coverage and the service provider finds that the employing unit, in the preceding calendar year, did not meet the requirements of an employer, as described in s. 443.1215(1)(a), (1)(d), or (2). This time limit for filing an application may be waived by the tax collection service provider in cases in which the time limit expires before the liability of the employing unit is established in the records of the service provider. For the purposes of this subsection, the two or more employing units listed in s. 443.1215(1)(e), (1)(f), and (1)(h) shall be treated as a single employing unit. (b) Nonprofit organizations.—Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4), an employing unit subject to this chapter under s. 443.1216(3) ceases to be an employer subject to this chapter as of January 1 of any calendar year only if it files with the tax collection service provider, by April 30 of the year for which termination is requested, a written application for termination of coverage and the service provider finds that there were fewer than 20 different days, each day being in a different week within the preceding calendar year, within which the employing unit employed four or more individuals in employment subject to this chapter. The timely filing of application may be waived as provided in paragraph (a).

However, at the expiration of the calendar year of the election, the tax collection service provider may reconsider the voluntary election of coverage and may notify the employer that the employer will not be carried upon the records of the service provider as an employer, and thereupon the employer ceases to be an employer under this chapter as of January 1 of the year next succeeding the last calendar year during which it was an employer under this chapter. (b) Public employers.—An employing unit that is a public employer as defined in s. 443.036, for which services that do not constitute employment as defined in this chapter are performed, may file with the tax collection service provider a written election that all those services performed by individuals in its employ in one or more distinct establishments or places of business constitute employment for purposes of this chapter for at least 1 calendar year. Upon written approval of the election by the tax collection service provider, these services constitute employment subject to this chapter from and after the date stated in the approval. These services cease to be employment subject to this chapter as of January 1 of any calendar year after that calendar year only if, by April 30 of the next year, the employing unit files a written notice to that effect with the tax collection service provider. (c) Certain services for political subdivisions.— 1. Any political subdivision of this state may elect to cover under this chapter, for at least 1 calendar year, service performed by employees in all of the hospitals and institutions of higher education operated by the political subdivision.

The election may exclude any services described in s. 443.1216(4). Any political subdivision electing coverage under this paragraph must be a reimbursing employer and make reimbursements in lieu of contributions for benefits attributable to this employment, provided for nonprofit organizations in s. 443.1312(3) and (5). 2. The provisions of s. 443.091(3) relating to benefit rights based on service for nonprofit organizations and state hospitals and institutions of higher education also apply to service covered by an election under this section. 3. The amounts required to be reimbursed in lieu of contributions by any political subdivision under this paragraph shall be billed, and payment made, as provided in s. 443.1312(3) for similar reimbursements by nonprofit organizations. 4. An election under this paragraph may be terminated after at least 1 calendar year of coverage by filing with the tax collection service provider written notice not later than 30 days before the last day of the calendar year in which the termination is to be effective.

In a calendar quarter during the current or preceding calendar year paid wages of at least $1,500 for service in employment; or 2. For any portion of a day in each of 20 different calendar weeks, regardless of whether the weeks were consecutive, during the current or the preceding calendar year, employed at least one individual in employment, irrespective of whether the same individual was in employment during each day. (b) An employing unit for which service in employment, as defined in s. 443.1216(2), is performed, except as provided in subsection (2). (c) An employing unit for which service in employment, as defined in s. 443.1216(3), is performed, except as provided in subsection (2). (d)1. An employing unit for which agricultural labor, as defined in s. 443.1216(5), is performed. 2. An employing unit for which domestic service in employment, as defined in s. 443.1216(6), is performed. (e) An individual or employing unit that acquires the organization, trade, or business, or substantially all of the assets of another individual or employing unit, which, at the time of the acquisition, is an employer subject to this chapter, or that acquires a part of the organization, trade, or business of another individual or employing unit which, at the time of the acquisition, is an employer subject to this chapter, if the other individual or employing unit would be an employer under paragraph (a) if that part constitutes its entire organization, trade, or business. (f) An individual or employing unit that acquires the organization, trade, or business, or substantially all of the assets of another employing unit, if the employment record of the predecessor before the acquisition, together with the employment record of the individual or employing unit after the acquisition, both within the same calendar year, is sufficient to render an employing unit subject to this chapter as an employer under paragraph (a). (g) An employing unit that is not otherwise an employer subject to this chapter under this section: 1. For which, during the current or preceding calendar year, service is or was performed for which the employing unit is liable for any federal tax against which credit may be taken for contributions required to be paid into a state unemployment fund. 2. Which, as a condition for approval of this chapter for full tax credit against the tax imposed by the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, is required under the federal act to be an employer that is subject to this chapter.

(2)(a) In determining whether an employing unit for which service, other than domestic service, is also performed is an employer under paragraph (1)(a), paragraph (1)(b), paragraph (1)(c), or subparagraph (1)(d)1., the wages earned or the employment of an employee performing domestic service may not be taken into account. (b) In determining whether an employing unit for which service, other than agricultural labor, is also performed is an employer under paragraph (1)(a), paragraph (1)(b), paragraph (1)(c), or subparagraph (1)(d)2., the wages earned or the employment of an employee performing service in agricultural labor may not be taken into account. If an employing unit is determined to be an employer of agricultural labor, the employing unit is considered an employer for purposes of paragraph (1)(a). (3) An employing unit that fails to keep the records of employment required by this chapter and by the rules of the Department of Commerce and the state agency providing reemployment assistance tax collection services is presumed to be an employer liable for the payment of contributions under this chapter, regardless of the number of individuals employed by the employing unit. However, the tax collection service provider shall make written demand that the employing unit keep and maintain required payroll records. The demand must be made at least 6 months before assessing contributions against an employing unit determined to be an employer that is subject to this chapter solely by reason of this subsection.

From or to a trust described in s. 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 which is exempt from tax under s. 501(a) at the time of payment, unless payment is made to an employee of the trust as remuneration for services rendered as an employee of the trust and not as a beneficiary of the trust; 2. Under or to an annuity plan that, at the time of payment, is a plan described in s. 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954; 3.

      "number": "443.131",
      "heading": "Contributions",
      "text": "443.131 Contributions.— (1) PAYMENT OF CONTRIBUTIONS.—Contributions accrue and are payable by each employer for each calendar quarter he or she is subject to this chapter for wages paid during each calendar quarter for employment. Contributions are due and payable by each employer to the tax collection service provider, in accordance with the rules adopted by the Department of Commerce or the state agency providing tax collection services. This subsection does not prohibit the tax collection service provider from allowing, at the request of the employer, employers of employees performing domestic services, as defined in s. 443.1216(6), to pay contributions or report wages at intervals other than quarterly when the nonquarterly payment or reporting assists the service provider and when nonquarterly payment and reporting is authorized under federal law. Employers of employees performing domestic services may report wages and pay contributions annually, with a due date of no later than January 31, unless that day is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, in which event the due date is the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday. For purposes of this subsection, the term “holiday” means a day designated under s. 110.117(1) and (2) or any other day when the offices of the United States Postal Service are closed. To qualify for this election, the employer must employ only employees performing domestic services, be eligible for a variation from the standard rate computed under subsection (3), apply to this program no later than December 1 of the preceding calendar year, and agree to provide the department or its tax collection service provider with any special reports that are requested, including copies of all federal employment tax forms. An employer who fails to timely furnish any wage information required by the department or its tax collection service provider loses the privilege to participate in this program, effective the calendar quarter immediately after the calendar quarter the failure occurred. The employer may reapply for annual reporting when a complete calendar year elapses after the employer’s disqualification if the employer timely furnished any requested wage information during the period in which annual reporting was denied. An employer may not deduct contributions, interests, penalties, fines, or fees required under this chapter from any part of the wages of his or her employees. A fractional part of a cent less than one-half cent shall be disregarded from the payment of contributions, but a fractional part of at least one-half cent shall be increased to 1 cent. (2) CONTRIBUTION RATES.—Each employer must pay contributions equal to the following percentages of wages paid by him or her for employment: (a) Initial rate.—Each employer whose employment record is chargeable with benefits for less than 8 calendar quarters shall pay contributions at the initial rate of 2.7 percent. (b) Variable rates.—Each employer whose employment record is chargeable for benefits during at least 8 calendar quarters shall pay contributions at the standard rate in paragraph (3)(c), except as otherwise varied through experience rating under subsection (3). For the purposes of this section, the total wages on which contributions were paid by a single employer or his or her predecessor to an individual in any state during a single calendar year shall be counted to determine whether more remuneration was paid to the individual by the employer or his or her predecessor in 1 calendar year than constituted wages. (3) VARIATION OF CONTRIBUTION RATES BASED ON BENEFIT EXPERIENCE.— (a) Employment records.—The regular and short-time compensation benefits paid to an eligible individual shall be charged to the employment record of each employer who paid the individual wages of at least $100 during the individual’s base period in proportion to the total wages paid by all employers who paid the individual wages during the individual’s base period. Benefits may not be charged to the employment record of an employer who furnishes part-time work to an individual who, because of loss of employment with one or more other employers, is eligible for partial benefits while being furnished part-time work by the employer on substantially the same basis and in substantially the same amount as the individual’s employment during his or her base period, regardless of whether this part-time work is simultaneous or successive to the individual’s lost employment. Further, as provided in s. 443.151(3), benefits may not be charged to the employment record of an employer who furnishes the Department of Commerce with notice, as prescribed in rules of the department, that any of the following apply: 1. If an individual leaves his or her work without good cause attributable to the employer or is discharged by the employer for misconduct connected with his or her work, benefits subsequently paid to the individual based on wages paid by the employer before the separation may not be charged to the employment record of the employer. 2. If an individual is discharged by the employer for unsatisfactory performance during an initial employment probationary period, benefits subsequently paid to the individual based on wages paid during the probationary period by the employer before the separation may not be charged to the employer’s employment record. As used in this subparagraph, the term “initial employment probationary period” means an established probationary plan that applies to all employees or a specific group of employees and that does not exceed 90 calendar days following the first day a new employee begins work. The employee must be informed of the probationary period within the first 7 days of work. The employer must demonstrate by conclusive evidence that the individual was separated because of unsatisfactory work performance and not because of lack of work due to temporary, seasonal, casual, or other similar employment that is not of a regular, permanent, and year-round nature. 3. Benefits subsequently paid to an individual after his or her refusal without good cause to accept suitable work from an employer may not be charged to the employment record of the employer if any part of those benefits are based on wages paid by the employer before the individual’s refusal to accept suitable work. As used in this subparagraph, the term “good cause” does not include distance to employment caused by a change of residence by the individual. The department shall adopt rules prescribing for the payment of all benefits whether this subparagraph applies regardless of whether a disqualification under s. 443.101 applies to the claim. 4. If an individual is separated from work as a direct result of a natural disaster declared under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. ss. 5121 et seq., benefits subsequently paid to the individual based on wages paid by the employer before the separation may not be charged to the employment record of the employer. 5. If an individual is separated from work as a direct result of an oil spill, terrorist attack, or other similar disaster of national significance not subject to a declaration under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, benefits subsequently paid to the individual based on wages paid by the employer before the separation may not be charged to the employment record of the employer. 6. If an individual is separated from work as a direct result of domestic violence and meets all requirements in s. 443.101(1)(a)2.c., benefits subsequently paid to the individual based on wages paid by the employer before separation may not be charged to the employment record of the employer. (b) Benefit ratio.— 1. As used in this paragraph, the term “annual payroll” means the calendar quarter taxable payroll reported to the tax collection service provider for the quarters used in computing the benefit ratio. The term does not include a penalty resulting from the untimely filing of required wage and tax reports. All of the taxable payroll reported to the tax collection service provider by the end of the quarter preceding the quarter for which the contribution rate is to be computed must be used in the computation. 2. As used in this paragraph, the term “benefits charged to the employer’s employment record” means the amount of benefits paid to individuals multiplied by: a. For benefits paid prior to July 1, 2007, 1. b. For benefits paid during the period beginning on July 1, 2007, and ending March 31, 2011, 0.90. c. For benefits paid after March 31, 2011, 1. d. For benefits paid during the period beginning April 1, 2020, and ending December 31, 2020, 0. e. For benefits paid during the period beginning January 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2021, 1, except as otherwise adjusted in accordance with paragraph (f). 3. For each calendar year, the tax collection service provider shall compute a benefit ratio for each employer whose employment record was chargeable for benefits during the 12 consecutive quarters ending June 30 of the calendar year preceding the calendar year for which the benefit ratio is computed. An employer’s benefit ratio is the quotient obtained by dividing the total benefits charged to the employer’s employment record during the 3-year period ending June 30 of the preceding calendar year by the total of the employer’s annual payroll for the 3-year period ending June 30 of the preceding calendar year. The benefit ratio shall be computed to the fifth decimal place and rounded to the fourth decimal place. 4. The tax collection service provider shall compute a benefit ratio for each employer who was not previously eligible under subparagraph 3., whose contribution rate is set at the initial contribution rate in paragraph (2)(a), and whose employment record was chargeable for benefits during at least 8 calendar quarters immediately preceding the calendar quarter for which the benefit ratio is computed. The employer’s benefit ratio is the quotient obtained by dividing the total benefits charged to the employer’s employment record during the first 6 of the 8 completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the calendar quarter for which the benefit ratio is computed by the total of the employer’s annual payroll during the first 7 of the 9 completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the calendar quarter for which the benefit ratio is computed. The benefit ratio shall be computed to the fifth decimal place and rounded to the fourth decimal place and applies for the remainder of the calendar year. The employer must subsequently be rated on an annual basis using up to 12 calendar quarters of benefits charged and up to 12 calendar quarters of annual payroll. That employer’s benefit ratio is the quotient obtained by dividing the total benefits charged to the employer’s employment record by the total of the employer’s annual payroll during the quarters used in his or her first computation plus the subsequent quarters reported through June 30 of the preceding calendar year. Each subsequent calendar year, the rate shall be computed under subparagraph 3. The tax collection service provider shall assign a variation from the standard rate of contributions in paragraph (c) on a quarterly basis to each eligible employer in the same manner as an assignment for a calendar year under paragraph (e). (c) Standard rate.—The standard rate of contributions payable by each employer shall be 5.4 percent. (d) Eligibility for variation from the standard rate.—An employer is eligible for a variation from the standard rate of contributions in any calendar year only if the employer’s employment record was chargeable for benefits throughout the 12 consecutive quarters ending on June 30 of the preceding calendar year. The contribution rate of an employer who, as a result of having at least 8 consecutive quarters of payroll insufficient to be chargeable for benefits, has not been chargeable for benefits throughout the 12 consecutive quarters reverts to the initial contribution rate until the employer subsequently becomes eligible for an earned rate. (e) Assignment of variations from the standard rate.— 1. As used in this paragraph, the terms “total benefit payments,” “benefits paid to an individual,” and “benefits charged to the employment record of an employer” mean the amount of benefits paid to individuals multiplied by: a. For benefits paid prior to July 1, 2007, 1. b. For benefits paid during the period beginning on July 1, 2007, and ending March 31, 2011, 0.90. c. For benefits paid after March 31, 2011, 1. d. For benefits paid during the period beginning April 1, 2020, and ending December 31, 2020, 0. e. For benefits paid during the period beginning January 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2021, 1, except as otherwise adjusted in accordance with paragraph (f). 2. For the calculation of contribution rates effective January 1, 2012, and thereafter: a. The tax collection service provider shall assign a variation from the standard rate of contributions for each calendar year to each eligible employer. In determining the contribution rate, varying from the standard rate to be assigned each employer, adjustment factors computed under sub-sub-subparagraphs (I)-(IV) are added to the benefit ratio. This addition shall be accomplished in two steps by adding a variable adjustment factor and a final adjustment factor. The sum of these adjustment factors computed under sub-sub-subparagraphs (I)-(IV) shall first be algebraically summed. The sum of these adjustment factors shall next be divided by a gross benefit ratio determined as follows: Total benefit payments for the 3-year period described in subparagraph (b)3. are charged to employers eligible for a variation from the standard rate, minus excess payments for the same period, divided by taxable payroll entering into the computation of individual benefit ratios for the calendar year for which the contribution rate is being computed. The ratio of the sum of the adjustment factors computed under sub-sub-subparagraphs (I)-(IV) to the gross benefit ratio is multiplied by each individual benefit ratio that is less than the maximum contribution rate to obtain variable adjustment factors; except that if the sum of an employer’s individual benefit ratio and variable adjustment factor exceeds the maximum contribution rate, the variable adjustment factor is reduced in order for the sum to equal the maximum contribution rate. The variable adjustment factor for each of these employers is multiplied by his or her taxable payroll entering into the computation of his or her benefit ratio. The sum of these products is divided by the taxable payroll of the employers who entered into the computation of their benefit ratios. The resulting ratio is subtracted from the sum of the adjustment factors computed under sub-sub-subparagraphs (I)-(IV) to obtain the final adjustment factor. The variable adjustment factors and the final adjustment factor must be computed to five decimal places and rounded to the fourth decimal place. This final adjustment factor is added to the variable adjustment factor and benefit ratio of each employer to obtain each employer’s contribution rate. An employer’s contribution rate may not, however, be rounded to less than 0.1 percent. In determining the contribution rate, varying from the standard rate to be assigned, the computation shall exclude any benefit that is excluded by the multipliers under subparagraph (b)2. and subparagraph 1. The computation of the contribution rate, varying from the standard rate to be assigned, shall also exclude any benefit paid as a result of a governmental order related to COVID-19 to close or reduce capacity of a business. In addition, the contribution rate for the 2021 and 2022 calendar years shall be calculated without the application of the positive adjustment factor in sub-sub-subparagraph (III). (I) An adjustment factor for noncharge benefits is computed to the fifth decimal place and rounded to the fourth decimal place by dividing the amount of noncharge benefits during the 3-year period described in subparagraph (b)3. by the taxable payroll of employers eligible for a variation from the standard rate who have a benefit ratio for the current year which is less than the maximum contribution rate. For purposes of computing this adjustment factor, the taxable payroll of these employers is the taxable payrolls for the 3 years ending June 30 of the current calendar year as reported to the tax collection service provider by September 30 of the same calendar year. As used in this sub-sub-subparagraph, the term “noncharge benefits” means benefits paid to an individual, as adjusted pursuant to subparagraph (b)2. and subparagraph 1., from the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund which were not charged to the employment record of any employer, but excluding any benefit paid as a result of a governmental order related to COVID-19 to close or reduce capacity of a business. (II) An adjustment factor for excess payments is computed to the fifth decimal place, and rounded to the fourth decimal place by dividing the total excess payments during the 3-year period described in subparagraph (b)3. by the taxable payroll of employers eligible for a variation from the standard rate who have a benefit ratio for the current year which is less than the maximum contribution rate. For purposes of computing this adjustment factor, the taxable payroll of these employers is the same figure used to compute the adjustment factor for noncharge benefits under sub-sub-subparagraph (I). As used in this sub-subparagraph, the term “excess payments” means the amount of benefits charged to the employment record of an employer, as adjusted pursuant to subparagraph (b)2. and subparagraph 1., during the 3-year period described in subparagraph (b)3., but excluding any benefit paid as a result of a governmental order related to COVID-19 to close or reduce capacity of a business, less the product of the maximum contribution rate and the employer’s taxable payroll for the 3 years ending June 30 of the current calendar year as reported to the tax collection service provider by September 30 of the same calendar year. As used in this sub-sub-subparagraph, the term “total excess payments” means the sum of the individual employer excess payments for those employers that were eligible for assignment of a contribution rate different from the standard rate. (III) With respect to computing a positive adjustment factor: (A) Beginning January 1, 2012, if the balance of the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund on September 30 of the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year for which the contribution rate is being computed is less than 4 percent of the taxable payrolls for the year ending June 30 as reported to the tax collection service provider by September 30 of that calendar year, a positive adjustment factor shall be computed. The positive adjustment factor is computed annually to the fifth decimal place and rounded to the fourth decimal place by dividing the sum of the total taxable payrolls for the year ending June 30 of the current calendar year as reported to the tax collection service provider by September 30 of that calendar year into a sum equal to one-fifth of the difference between the balance of the fund as of September 30 of that calendar year and the sum of 5 percent of the total taxable payrolls for that year. The positive adjustment factor remains in effect for subsequent years until the balance of the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund as of September 30 of the year immediately preceding the effective date of the contribution rate equals or exceeds 4 percent of the taxable payrolls for the year ending June 30 of the current calendar year as reported to the tax collection service provider by September 30 of that calendar year. (B) Beginning January 1, 2018, and for each year thereafter, the positive adjustment shall be computed by dividing the sum of the total taxable payrolls for the year ending June 30 of the current calendar year as reported to the tax collection service provider by September 30 of that calendar year into a sum equal to one-fourth of the difference between the balance of the fund as of September 30 of that calendar year and the sum of 5 percent of the total taxable payrolls for that year. The positive adjustment factor remains in effect for subsequent years until the balance of the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund as of September 30 of the year immediately preceding the effective date of the contribution rate equals or exceeds 4 percent of the taxable payrolls for the year ending June 30 of the current calendar year as reported to the tax collection service provider by September 30 of that calendar year. (IV) If, beginning January 1, 2015, and each year thereafter, the balance of the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund as of September 30 of the year immediately preceding the calendar year for which the contribution rate is being computed exceeds 5 percent of the taxable payrolls for the year ending June 30 of the current calendar year as reported to the tax collection service provider by September 30 of that calendar year, a negative adjustment factor must be computed. The negative adjustment factor shall be computed annually beginning on January 1, 2015, and each year thereafter, to the fifth decimal place and rounded to the fourth decimal place by dividing the sum of the total taxable payrolls for the year ending June 30 of the current calendar year as reported to the tax collection service provider by September 30 of the calendar year into a sum equal to one-fourth of the difference between the balance of the fund as of September 30 of the current calendar year and 5 percent of the total taxable payrolls of that year. The negative adjustment factor remains in effect for subsequent years until the balance of the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund as of September 30 of the year immediately preceding the effective date of the contribution rate is less than 5 percent, but more than 4 percent of the taxable payrolls for the year ending June 30 of the current calendar year as reported to the tax collection service provider by September 30 of that calendar year. The negative adjustment authorized by this section is suspended in any calendar year in which repayment of the principal amount of an advance received from the federal Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund under 42 U.S.C. s. 1321 is due to the Federal Government. (V) The maximum contribution rate that may be assigned to an employer is 5.4 percent, except employers participating in an approved short-time compensation plan may be assigned a maximum contribution rate that is 1 percent greater than the maximum contribution rate for other employers in any calendar year in which short-time compensation benefits are charged to the employer’s employment record. (VI) As used in this subsection, “taxable payroll” shall be determined by excluding any part of the remuneration paid to an individual by an employer for employment during a calendar year in excess of the first $7,000. Beginning January 1, 2012, “taxable payroll” shall be determined by excluding any part of the remuneration paid to an individual by an employer for employment during a calendar year as described in s. 443.1217(2). For the purposes of the employer rate calculation that will take effect in January 1, 2012, and in January 1, 2013, the tax collection service provider shall use the data available for taxable payroll from 2009 based on excluding any part of the remuneration paid to an individual by an employer for employment during a calendar year in excess of the first $7,000, and from 2010 and 2011, the data available for taxable payroll based on excluding any part of the remuneration paid to an individual by an employer for employment during a calendar year in excess of the first $8,500. b. If the transfer of an employer’s employment record to an employing unit under paragraph (g) which, before the transfer, was an employer, the tax collection service provider shall recompute a benefit ratio for the successor employer based on the combined employment records and reassign an appropriate contribution rate to the successor employer effective on the first day of the calendar quarter immediately after the effective date of the transfer. 3. The tax collection service provider shall reissue rates for the 2021 calendar year. However, an employer shall continue to timely file its employer’s quarterly reports and pay the contributions due in a timely manner in accordance with the rules of the Department of Commerce. The Department of Revenue shall post the revised rates on its website to enable employers to securely review the revised rates. For contributions for the first quarter of the 2021 calendar year, if any employer remits to the tax collection service provider an amount in excess of the amount that would be due as calculated pursuant to this paragraph, the tax collection service provider shall refund the excess amount from the amount erroneously collected. Notwithstanding s. 443.141(6), refunds issued through August 31, 2021, for first quarter 2021 contributions must be paid from the General Revenue Fund. 4. The tax collection service provider shall calculate and assign contribution rates effective January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022, excluding any benefit charge that is excluded by the multipliers under subparagraph (b)2. and subparagraph 1.; without the application of the positive adjustment factor in sub-sub-subparagraph 2.a.(III); and without the inclusion of any benefit charge directly related to COVID-19 as a result of a governmental order to close or reduce capacity of a business, as determined by the Department of Commerce, for each employer who is eligible for a variation from the standard rate pursuant to paragraph (d). The Department of Commerce shall provide the tax collection service provider with all necessary benefit charge information by August 1, 2021, including specific information for adjustments related to COVID-19 charges resulting from a governmental order to close or reduce capacity of a business, to enable the tax collection service provider to calculate and issue tax rates effective January 1, 2022. The tax collection service provider shall calculate and post rates for the 2022 calendar year by March 1, 2022. (f) Adjustment in benefit ratio multiplier.—For purposes of calculating the benefits charged for the period beginning January 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2021, pursuant to sub-subparagraphs (b)2.e. and (e)1.e., the amount of benefits paid to individuals shall be multiplied by 1, unless such calculation results in estimated total contributions of more than $475.5 million for calendar year 2022 as estimated by the Office of Economic and Demographic Research, based on the preliminary 2022 computed rate. If the estimated total contributions calculated are more than $475.5 million, the multiplier in sub-subparagraphs (b)2.e. and (e)1.e. shall be reduced by increments of 0.05 until the estimated total contributions are $475.5 million or less. The Office of Economic and Demographic Research shall provide the incremental reduction, if any, to the tax collection service provider by January 1, 2022. (g) Transfer of employment records.— 1. For the purposes of this subsection, two or more employers who are parties to a transfer of business or the subject of a merger, consolidation, or other form of reorganization, effecting a change in legal identity or form, are deemed a single employer and are considered to be one employer with a continuous employment record if the tax collection service provider finds that the successor employer continues to carry on the employing enterprises of all of the predecessor employers and that the successor employer has paid all contributions required of and due from all of the predecessor employers and has assumed liability for all contributions that may become due from all of the predecessor employers. In addition, an employer may not be considered a successor under this subparagraph if the employer purchases a company with a lower rate into which employees with job functions unrelated to the business endeavors of the predecessor are transferred for the purpose of acquiring the low rate and avoiding payment of contributions. As used in this paragraph, notwithstanding s. 443.036(14), the term “contributions” means all indebtedness to the tax collection service provider, including, but not limited to, interest, penalty, collection fee, and service fee. A successor employer must accept the transfer of all of the predecessor employers’ employment records within 30 days after the date of the official notification of liability by succession. If a predecessor employer has unpaid contributions or outstanding quarterly reports, the successor employer must pay the total amount with certified funds within 30 days after the date of the notice listing the total amount due. After the total indebtedness is paid, the tax collection service provider shall transfer the employment records of all of the predecessor employers to the successor employer’s employment record. The tax collection service provider shall determine the contribution rate of the combined successor and predecessor employers upon the transfer of the employment records, as prescribed by rule, in order to calculate any change in the contribution rate resulting from the transfer of the employment records. 2. Regardless of whether a predecessor employer’s employment record is transferred to a successor employer under this paragraph, the tax collection service provider shall treat the predecessor employer, if he or she subsequently employs individuals, as an employer without a previous employment record or, if his or her coverage is terminated under s. 443.121, as a new employing unit. 3. The state agency providing reemployment assistance tax collection services may adopt rules governing the partial transfer of experience rating when an employer transfers an identifiable and segregable portion of his or her payrolls and business to a successor employing unit. As a condition of each partial transfer, these rules must require the following to be filed with the tax collection service provider: an application by the successor employing unit, an agreement by the predecessor employer, and the evidence required by the tax collection service provider to show the benefit experience and payrolls attributable to the transferred portion through the date of the transfer. These rules must provide that the successor employing unit, if not an employer subject to this chapter, becomes an employer as of the date of the transfer and that the transferred portion of the predecessor employer’s employment record is removed from the employment record of the predecessor employer. For each calendar year after the date of the transfer of the employment record in the records of the tax collection service provider, the service provider shall compute the contribution rate payable by the successor employer or employing unit based on his or her employment record, combined with the transferred portion of the predecessor employer’s employment record. These rules may also prescribe what contribution rates are payable by the predecessor and successor employers for the period between the date of the transfer of the transferred portion of the predecessor employer’s employment record in the records of the tax collection service provider and the first day of the next calendar year. 4. This paragraph does not apply to an employee leasing company and client contractual agreement as defined in s. 443.036, except as provided in s. 443.1216(1)(a)2.a. The tax collection service provider shall, if the contractual agreement is terminated or the employee leasing company fails to submit reports or pay contributions as required by the service provider, treat the client as a new employer without previous employment record unless the client is otherwise eligible for a variation from the standard rate. (h) Transfer of unemployment experience upon transfer or acquisition of a business.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon transfer or acquisition of a business, the following conditions apply to the assignment of rates and to transfers of unemployment experience: 1.a. If an employer transfers its trade or business, or a portion thereof, to another employer and, at the time of the transfer, there is any common ownership, management, or control of the two employers, the unemployment experience attributable to the transferred trade or business shall be transferred to the employer to whom the business is so transferred. The rates of both employers shall be recalculated and made effective as of the beginning of the calendar quarter immediately following the date of the transfer of the trade or business unless the transfer occurred on the first day of a calendar quarter, in which case the rate shall be recalculated as of that date. b. If, following a transfer of experience under sub-subparagraph a., the department or the tax collection service provider determines that a substantial purpose of the transfer of trade or business was to obtain a reduced liability for contributions, the experience rating account of the employers involved shall be combined into a single account and a single rate assigned to the account. 2. Whenever a person is not an employer under this chapter at the time it acquires the trade or business of an employer, the unemployment experience of the acquired business shall not be transferred to the person if the department or the tax collection service provider finds that such person acquired the business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions. Instead, such person shall be assigned the new employer rate under paragraph (2)(a). In determining whether the business was acquired solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions, the tax collection service provider shall consider, but not be limited to, the following factors: a. Whether the person continued the business enterprise of the acquired business; b. How long such business enterprise was continued; or c. Whether a substantial number of new employees was hired for performance of duties unrelated to the business activity conducted before the acquisition. 3. If a person knowingly violates or attempts to violate subparagraph 1. or subparagraph 2. or any other provision of this chapter related to determining the assignment of a contribution rate, or if a person knowingly advises another person to violate the law, the person shall be subject to the following penalties: a. If the person is an employer, the employer shall be assigned the highest rate assignable under this chapter for the rate year during which such violation or attempted violation occurred and for the 3 rate years immediately following this rate year. However, if the person’s business is already at the highest rate for any year, or if the amount of increase in the person’s rate would be less than 2 percent for such year, then a penalty rate of contribution of 2 percent of taxable wages shall be imposed for such year and the following 3 rate years. b. If the person is not an employer, such person shall be subject to a civil money penalty of not more than $5,000. The procedures for the assessment of a penalty shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in s. 443.141(2), and the provisions of s. 443.141(3) shall apply to the collection of the penalty. Any such penalty shall be deposited in the penalty and interest account established under s. 443.211(2). 4. For purposes of this paragraph, the term: a. “Knowingly” means having actual knowledge of or acting with deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard for the prohibition involved. b. “Violates or attempts to violate” includes, but is not limited to, intent to evade, misrepresent, or willfully nondisclose. 5. In addition to the penalty imposed by subparagraph 3., any person who violates this paragraph commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. 6. The department and the tax collection service provider shall establish procedures to identify the transfer or acquisition of a business for the purposes of this paragraph and shall adopt any rules necessary to administer this paragraph. 7. For purposes of this paragraph: a. “Person” has the meaning given to the term by s. 7701(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. b. “Trade or business” shall include the employer’s workforce. 8. This paragraph shall be interpreted and applied in such a manner as to meet the minimum requirements contained in any guidance or regulations issued by the United States Department of Labor. (i) Additional conditions for variation from the standard rate.—An employer’s contribution rate may not be reduced below the standard rate under this section unless: 1. All contributions, reimbursements, interest, and penalties incurred by the employer for wages paid by him or her in all previous calendar quarters, except the 4 calendar quarters immediately preceding the calendar quarter or calendar year for which the benefit ratio is computed, are paid; 2. The employer has produced for inspection and copying all work records in his or her possession, custody, or control which were requested by the Department of Commerce or its tax collection service provider pursuant to s. 443.171(5). An employer shall have at least 60 days to provide the requested work records before the employer is assigned the standard rate; and 3. The employer entitled to a rate reduction has at least one annual payroll as defined in subparagraph (b)1. unless the employer is eligible for additional credit under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act. If the Federal Unemployment Tax Act is amended or repealed in a manner affecting credit under the federal act, this section applies only to the extent that additional credit is allowed against the payment of the tax imposed by the act. The tax collection service provider shall assign an earned contribution rate to an employer for the quarter immediately after the quarter in which all contributions, reimbursements, interest, and penalties are paid in full and all work records requested pursuant to s. 443.171(5) are produced for inspection and copying by the Department of Commerce or the tax collection service provider. (j) Notice of determinations of contribution rates; redeterminations.—The state agency providing tax collection services: 1. Shall promptly notify each employer of his or her contribution rate as determined for any calendar year under this section. The determination is conclusive and binding on the employer unless within 20 days after mailing the notice of determination to the employer’s last known address, or, in the absence of mailing, within 20 days after delivery of the notice, the employer files an application for review and redetermination setting forth the grounds for review. An employer may not, in any proceeding involving his or her contribution rate or liability for contributions, contest the chargeability to his or her employment record of any benefits paid in accordance with a determination, redetermination, or decision under s. 443.151, except on the ground that the benefits charged were not based on services performed in employment for him or her and then only if the employer was not a party to the determination, redetermination, or decision, or to any other proceeding under this chapter, in which the character of those services was determined. 2. Shall, upon discovery of an error in computation, reconsider any prior determination or redetermination of a contribution rate after the 20-day period has expired and issue a revised notice of contribution rate as redetermined. A redetermination is subject to review, and is conclusive and binding if review is not sought, in the same manner as review of a determination under subparagraph 1. A reconsideration may not be made after March 31 of the calendar year immediately after the calendar year for which the contribution rate is applicable, and interest may not accrue on any additional contributions found to be due until 30 days after the employer is mailed notice of his or her revised contribution rate. 3. May adopt rules providing for periodic notification to employers of benefits paid and charged to their employment records or of the status of those employment records. A notification, unless an application for redetermination is filed in the manner and within the time limits prescribed by the Department of Commerce, is conclusive and binding on the employer under this chapter. The redetermination, and the finding of fact of the department in connection with the redetermination, may be introduced in any subsequent administrative or judicial proceeding involving the determination of the contribution rate of an employer for any calendar year. A redetermination becomes final in the same manner provided in this subsection for findings of fact made by the department in proceedings to redetermine the contribution rate of an employer. Pending a redetermination or an administrative or judicial proceeding, the employer must file reports and pay contributions in accordance with this section. (k) Employment records of employers entering the armed forces.— 1. If the tax collection service provider finds that an employer’s business is closed solely because of the entrance of one or more of the owners, officers, partners, or the majority stockholder into the Armed Forces of the United States, or any of its allies, or of the United Nations, the employer’s employment record may not be terminated. If the business is resumed within 2 years after the discharge or release from active duty in the armed forces of that person or persons, the employer’s benefit experience is deemed to have been continuous throughout that period. The benefit ratio of the employer for the calendar year in which he or she resumed business and the 3 calendar years immediately after resuming business is a percentage equal to the total of his or her benefit charges, including charges of benefits paid to any individual during the period the employer was in the armed forces based on wages paid by him or her before the employer’s entrance into the armed forces for the 3 most recently completed calendar years divided by that part of his or her total payroll, for which contributions were paid to the tax collection service provider, for the 3 most recent calendar years during the whole of which, respectively, the employer was in business. 2. A refund made under this paragraph shall be made in accordance with s. 443.141(6). (l) Applicability to contributing employers.—This subsection applies only to contributing employers. (4) REIMBURSING EMPLOYERS.—Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply to reimbursing employers. (5) INVALIDITY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS.—If any provision of this section prevents the state from qualifying for any federal interest relief provisions provided under s. 1202 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. s. 1322, or prevents employers in this state from qualifying for the limitation on credit reduction as provided under s. 3302(f) of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, chapter 23 of Title 26 U.S.C., that provision is invalid to the extent necessary to maintain qualification for the interest relief provisions and federal unemployment tax credits.

      "text": "443.1315 Treatment of Indian tribes.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Employer” means any Indian tribe for which service in employment as defined by this chapter is performed. (b) “Employment” means service performed in the employ of an Indian tribe, as defined by s. 3306(u) of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, if this service is excluded from employment as defined by that act solely by reason of s. 3306(c)(7) of that act and is not otherwise excluded from employment under this chapter. For purposes of this section, the exclusions from employment under s. 443.1216(4) apply to services performed in the employ of an Indian tribe. (2) Benefits based on service in employment are payable in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions as benefits payable based on other service subject to this chapter. (3)(a) Indian tribes or tribal units of Indian tribes, including subdivisions, subsidiaries, or business enterprises wholly owned by those Indian tribes, subject to this chapter must pay contributions under the same terms and conditions as all other subject employers unless they elect to become reimbursing employers and reimburse the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund amounts equal to the amount of benefits attributable to service in the employ of the Indian tribe. (b) Indian tribes electing to make reimbursements in lieu of contributions must make this election in the same manner and under the same conditions in s. 443.1312 for nonprofit organizations subject to this chapter. Indian tribes must determine whether reimbursement for benefits paid will be elected by the tribe as a whole, by individual tribal units of an Indian tribe, or by combinations of individual tribal units. (c) Indian tribes or tribal units shall be billed for the full amount of benefits attributable to service in the employ of the Indian tribe or tribal unit on the same schedule as other employing units that elect to make reimbursements in lieu of contributions. (d) The tax collection service provider may require an Indian tribe or tribal unit that elects to become a reimbursing employer to, within 90 days after the effective date of that election: 1. Execute and file with the tax collection service provider a surety bond approved by the service provider; or 2. Deposit with the tax collection service provider money or securities on the same basis as other employers with the same election option. (4)(a)1. An Indian tribe or tribal unit that fails to make required reimbursements, including assessments of interest and penalty, within 90 days after receipt of the bill, loses the option to make reimbursements in lieu of contributions as provided in subsection (3) for the following tax year unless payment in full is received before contribution rates for the next tax year are computed. 2. The option to make reimbursements in lieu of contributions is reinstated once the Indian tribe makes all contributions timely for 1 year and no contributions or reimbursements for benefits paid, penalties, or interest remain outstanding. (b)1. Services performed for an Indian tribe or tribal unit that fails to make required reimbursements, including assessments of interest and penalty, after all collection activities deemed necessary by the tax collection service provider, subject to approval by the Department of Commerce, are exhausted may not be treated as employment for purposes of paragraph (1)(b). 2. The tax collection service provider may determine that any Indian tribe that loses coverage under subparagraph 1. may have services performed for the tribe subsequently included as employment for purposes of paragraph (1)(b) if all contributions, reimbursements, penalties, and interest are paid. (c) The department or its tax collection service provider shall immediately notify the United States Internal Revenue Service and the United States Department of Labor when an Indian tribe fails to make reimbursements required under this section, including assessments of interest and penalty, within 90 days after a final notice of delinquency. (5) Notices of payment and reporting delinquency to Indian tribes or tribal units must include information that failure to make full reimbursement within the prescribed timeframe: (a) Will cause the Indian tribe to be liable for taxes under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act. (b) Will cause the Indian tribe to lose the option to make reimbursements in lieu of contributions. (c) Could cause the Indian tribe to be excepted from the definition of “employer” provided in paragraph (1)(a) and services in the employ of the Indian tribe provided in paragraph (1)(b) to be excepted from employment. (6) An Indian tribe must reimburse the fund for all extended benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of the Indian tribe unless the benefits are reimbursed by the Federal Government. (7) The Department of Commerce and the state agency providing reemployment assistance tax collection services shall adopt rules necessary to administer this section.

      "text": "443.141 Collection of contributions and reimbursements.— (1) PAST DUE CONTRIBUTIONS AND REIMBURSEMENTS; DELINQUENT, ERRONEOUS, INCOMPLETE, OR INSUFFICIENT REPORTS.— (a) Interest.—Contributions or reimbursements unpaid on the date due bear interest at the rate of 1 percent per month through December 31, 2014. Beginning January 1, 2015, the interest rate shall be calculated in accordance with s. 213.235, except that the rate of interest may not exceed 1 percent per month from and after the date due until payment plus accrued interest is received by the tax collection service provider, unless the service provider finds that the employing unit has good reason for failing to pay the contributions or reimbursements when due. Interest collected under this subsection must be paid into the Special Employment Security Administration Trust Fund. (b) Penalty for delinquent, erroneous, incomplete, or insufficient reports.— 1. An employing unit that fails to file any report required by the Department of Commerce or its tax collection service provider, in accordance with rules for administering this chapter, shall pay to the service provider for each delinquent report the sum of $25 for each 30 days or fraction thereof that the employing unit is delinquent, unless the department or its service provider, whichever required the report, finds that the employing unit has good reason for failing to file the report. The department or its service provider may assess penalties only through the date of the issuance of the final assessment notice. However, additional penalties accrue if the delinquent report is subsequently filed. 2.a. An employing unit that files an erroneous, incomplete, or insufficient report with the department or its tax collection service provider shall pay a penalty. The amount of the penalty is $50 or 10 percent of any tax due, whichever is greater, but no more than $300 per report. The penalty shall be added to any tax, penalty, or interest otherwise due. b. The department or its tax collection service provider shall waive the penalty if the employing unit files an accurate, complete, and sufficient report within 30 days after a penalty notice is issued to the employing unit. The penalty may not be waived pursuant to this subparagraph more than one time during a 12-month period. c. As used in this subsection, the term “erroneous, incomplete, or insufficient report” means a report so lacking in information, completeness, or arrangement that the report cannot be readily understood, verified, or reviewed. Such reports include, but are not limited to, reports having missing wage or employee information, missing or incorrect social security numbers, or illegible entries; reports submitted in a format that is not approved by the department or its tax collection service provider; and reports showing gross wages that do not equal the total of the wages of each employee. However, the term does not include a report that merely contains inaccurate data that was supplied to the employer by the employee, if the employer was unaware of the inaccuracy. 3. Penalties imposed pursuant to this paragraph shall be deposited in the Special Employment Security Administration Trust Fund. 4. The penalty and interest for a delinquent, erroneous, incomplete, or insufficient report may be waived if the penalty or interest is inequitable. The provisions of s. 213.24(1) apply to any penalty or interest that is imposed under this section. (c) Application of partial payments.—If a delinquency exists in the employment record of an employer not in bankruptcy, a partial payment less than the total delinquency amount shall be applied to the employment record as the payor directs. In the absence of specific direction, the partial payment shall be applied to the payor’s employment record as prescribed in the rules of the department or the state agency providing tax collection services. (d) Payments for contributions.—For an annual administrative fee not to exceed $5, a contributing employer may pay its quarterly contributions due for wages paid in the first three quarters of each year in equal installments if those contributions are paid as follows: 1. For contributions due for wages paid in the first quarter of each year, one-fourth of the contributions due must be paid on or before April 30, one-fourth must be paid on or before July 31, one-fourth must be paid on or before October 31, and one-fourth must be paid on or before December 31. 2. In addition to the payments specified in subparagraph 1., for contributions due for wages paid in the second quarter of each year, one-third of the contributions due must be paid on or before July 31, one-third must be paid on or before October 31, and one-third must be paid on or before December 31. 3. In addition to the payments specified in subparagraphs 1. and 2., for contributions due for wages paid in the third quarter of each year, one-half of the contributions due must be paid on or before October 31, and one-half must be paid on or before December 31. 4. If any of the due dates in this paragraph fall on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the due date is the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “holiday” means a day designated under s. 110.117(1) and (2) or any other day when the offices of the United States Postal Service are closed. 5. The annual administrative fee assessed for electing to pay under the installment method shall be collected at the time the employer makes the first installment payment each year. The fee shall be segregated from the payment and deposited into the Operating Trust Fund of the Department of Revenue. 6. Interest does not accrue on any contribution that becomes due for wages paid in the first three quarters of each year if the employer pays the contribution in accordance with subparagraphs 1.-5. Interest and fees continue to accrue on prior delinquent contributions and commence accruing on all contributions due for wages paid in the first three quarters of each year which are not paid in accordance with subparagraphs 1.-4. Penalties may be assessed in accordance with this chapter. The contributions due for wages paid in the fourth quarter are not affected by this paragraph and are due and payable in accordance with this chapter. (e) Adoption of rules.—The department and the state agency providing reemployment assistance tax collection services may adopt rules to administer this subsection. (2) REPORTS, CONTRIBUTIONS, APPEALS.— (a) Failure to make reports and pay contributions.—If an employing unit determined by the tax collection service provider to be an employer subject to this chapter fails to make and file any report as and when required by this chapter or by any rule of the Department of Commerce or the state agency providing tax collection services, for the purpose of determining the amount of contributions due by the employer under this chapter, or if any filed report is found by the service provider to be incorrect or insufficient, and the employer, after being notified in writing by the service provider to file the report, or a corrected or sufficient report, as applicable, fails to file the report within 15 days after the date of the mailing of the notice, the tax collection service provider may: 1. Determine the amount of contributions due from the employer based on the information readily available to it, which determination is deemed to be prima facie correct; 2. Assess the employer the amount of contributions determined to be due; and 3. Immediately notify the employer by mail of the determination and assessment including penalties as provided in this chapter, if any, added and assessed, and demand payment together with interest on the amount of contributions from the date that amount was due and payable. (b) Hearings.—The determination and assessment are final 20 days after the date the assessment is mailed unless the employer files with the tax collection service provider within the 20 days a written protest and petition for hearing specifying the objections. The tax collection service provider shall promptly review each petition and may reconsider its determination and assessment in order to resolve the petitioner’s objections. The tax collection service provider shall forward each unresolved petition to the department for a hearing on the objections. Upon receipt of a petition, the department shall schedule a hearing and notify the petitioner of the time and place of the hearing. The department may appoint special deputies to conduct hearings who shall submit their findings together with a transcript of the proceedings before them and their recommendations to the department for its final order. Special deputies are subject to the prohibition against ex parte communications in s. 120.66. At any hearing conducted by the department or its special deputy, evidence may be offered to support the determination and assessment or to prove it is incorrect. In order to prevail, however, the petitioner must prove that the determination and assessment are incorrect or file full and complete corrected reports. Evidence may also be submitted to rebut the determination by the tax collection service provider that the petitioner is an employer under this chapter. Upon evidence taken before it or upon the transcript submitted to it with the findings and recommendation of its special deputy, the department shall set aside the tax collection service provider’s determination that the petitioner is an employer under this chapter or reaffirm the determination. The amounts assessed under the final order, together with interest and penalties, must be paid within 15 days after notice of the final order is mailed to the employer, unless judicial review is instituted in a case of status determination. Amounts due when the status of the employer is in dispute are payable within 15 days after the entry of an order by the court affirming the determination. However, a determination that an employing unit is not an employer under this chapter does not affect the benefit rights of an individual as determined by an appeals referee or the commission unless: 1. The individual is made a party to the proceedings before the special deputy; or 2. The decision of the appeals referee or the commission has not become final or the employing unit and the department were not made parties to the proceedings before the appeals referee or the commission. (c) Appeals.—The department and the state agency providing reemployment assistance tax collection services shall adopt rules prescribing the procedures for an employing unit determined to be an employer to file an appeal and be afforded an opportunity for a hearing on the determination. Pending a hearing, the employing unit must file reports and pay contributions in accordance with s. 443.131. (3) COLLECTION PROCEEDINGS.— (a) Lien for payment of contributions or reimbursements.— 1. A lien exists in favor of the tax collection service provider upon all the property, both real and personal, of an employer liable for payment of any contribution or reimbursement levied and imposed under this chapter for the amount of the contributions or reimbursements due, together with any interest, costs, and penalties. If any contribution or reimbursement imposed under this chapter or any portion of that contribution, reimbursement, interest, or penalty is not paid within 60 days after becoming delinquent, the tax collection service provider may file a notice of lien in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of any county in which the delinquent employer owns property or conducts or has conducted business. The notice of lien must include the periods for which the contributions, reimbursements, interest, or penalties are demanded and the amounts due. A copy of the notice of lien must be mailed to the employer at the employer’s last known address. The notice of lien may not be filed until 15 days after the date the assessment becomes final under subsection (2). Upon filing, the clerk of the circuit court shall record the notice of lien in a book maintained for that purpose. The amount of the lien, together with the cost of recording and interest accruing upon the amount of the contribution or reimbursement, becomes a lien upon the title to and interest, whether legal or equitable, in any real property, chattels real, or personal property of the employer against whom the notice of lien is issued, in the same manner as a judgment of the circuit court docketed in the office of the circuit court clerk, with execution issued to the sheriff for levy. This lien is prior, preferred, and superior to all mortgages or other liens filed, recorded, or acquired after the notice of lien is filed. Upon the payment of the amounts due, or upon determination by the tax collection service provider that the notice of lien was erroneously issued, the lien is satisfied when the service provider acknowledges in writing that the lien is fully satisfied. A lien’s satisfaction does not need to be acknowledged before any notary or other public officer, and the signature of the director of the tax collection service provider or designee is conclusive evidence of the satisfaction of the lien, which satisfaction shall be recorded by the clerk of the circuit court who receives the fees for those services. 2. The tax collection service provider may subsequently issue a warrant directed to any sheriff in this state, commanding him or her to levy upon and sell any real or personal property of the employer liable for any amount under this chapter within his or her jurisdiction, for payment, with the added penalties and interest and the costs of executing the warrant, together with the costs of the clerk of the circuit court in recording and docketing the notice of lien, and to return the warrant to the service provider with payment. The warrant may only be issued and enforced for all amounts due to the tax collection service provider on the date the warrant is issued, together with interest accruing on the contribution or reimbursement due from the employer to the date of payment at the rate provided in this section. However, if there is a sale of any assets of the employer, priorities under the warrant shall be determined in accordance with the priority established by any notices of lien filed by the tax collection service provider and recorded by the clerk of the circuit court. The sheriff shall execute the warrant in the same manner prescribed by law for executions issued by the clerk of the circuit court for judgments of the circuit court. The sheriff is entitled to the same fees for executing the warrant as for a writ of execution out of the circuit court, and these fees must be collected in the same manner. 3. The lien expires 10 years after the filing of a notice of lien with the clerk of court. An action to collect amounts due under this chapter may not be commenced after the expiration of the lien securing the payment of the amounts owed. (b) Injunctive procedures to contest warrants after issuance.—An injunction or restraining order to stay the execution of a warrant may not be issued until a motion is filed; reasonable notice of a hearing on the motion for the injunction is served on the tax collection service provider; and the party seeking the injunction either pays into the custody of the court the full amount of contributions, reimbursements, interests, costs, and penalties claimed in the warrant or enters into and files with the court a bond with two or more good and sufficient sureties approved by the court in a sum at least twice the amount of the contributions, reimbursements, interests, costs, and penalties, payable to the tax collection service provider. The bond must also be conditioned to pay the amount of the warrant, interest, and any damages resulting from the wrongful issuing of the injunction, if the injunction is dissolved, or the motion for the injunction is dismissed. Only one surety is required when the bond is executed by a lawfully authorized surety company. (c) Attachment and garnishment.—Upon the filing of notice of lien as provided in subparagraph (a)1., the tax collection service provider is entitled to remedy by attachment or garnishment as provided in chapters 76 and 77, as for a debt due. Upon application by the tax collection service provider, these writs shall be issued by the clerk of the circuit court as upon a judgment of the circuit court duly docketed and recorded. These writs shall be returnable to the circuit court. A bond may not be required of the tax collection service provider as a condition required for the issuance of these writs of attachment or garnishment. Issues raised under proceedings by attachment or garnishment shall be tried by the circuit court in the same manner as a judgment under chapters 76 and 77. Further, the notice of lien filed by the tax collection service provider is valid for purposes of all remedies under this chapter until satisfied under this chapter, and revival by scire facias or other proceedings are not necessary before pursuing any remedy authorized by law. Proceedings authorized upon a judgment of the circuit court do not make the lien a judgment of the circuit court upon a debt for any purpose other than as are specifically provided by law as procedural remedies. (d) Third-party claims.—Upon any levy made by the sheriff under a writ of attachment or garnishment as provided in paragraph (c), the circuit court shall try third-party claims to property involved as upon a judgment thereof and all proceedings authorized on third-party claims in ss. 56.16, 56.20, 76.21, and 77.16 shall apply. (e) Proceedings supplementary to execution.—At any time after a warrant provided for in subparagraph (a)2. is returned unsatisfied by any sheriff of this state, the tax collection service provider may file an affidavit in the circuit court affirming the warrant was returned unsatisfied and remains valid and outstanding. The affidavit must also state the residence of the party or parties against whom the warrant is issued. The tax collection service provider is subsequently entitled to have other and further proceedings in the circuit court as upon a judgment thereof as provided in s. 56.29. (f) Reproductions.—In any proceedings in any court under this chapter, reproductions of the original records of the Department of Commerce, its tax collection service provider, the former Agency for Workforce Innovation, the former Department of Labor and Employment Security, or the commission, including, but not limited to, photocopies or microfilm, are primary evidence in lieu of the original records or of the documents that were transcribed into those records. (g) Jeopardy assessment and warrant.—If the tax collection service provider reasonably believes that the collection of contributions or reimbursements from an employer will be jeopardized by delay, the service provider may assess the contributions or reimbursements immediately, together with interest or penalties when due, regardless of whether the contributions or reimbursements accrued are due, and may immediately issue a notice of lien and jeopardy warrant upon which proceedings may be conducted as provided in this section for notice of lien and warrant of the service provider. Within 15 days after mailing the notice of lien by registered mail, the employer may protest the issuance of the lien in the same manner provided in paragraph (2)(a). The protest does not operate as a supersedeas or stay of enforcement unless the employer files with the sheriff seeking to enforce the warrant a good and sufficient surety bond in twice the amount demanded by the notice of lien or warrant. The bond must be conditioned upon payment of the amount subsequently found to be due from the employer to the tax collection service provider in the final order of the Department of Commerce upon protest of assessment. The jeopardy warrant and notice of lien are satisfied in the manner provided in this section upon payment of the amount finally determined to be due from the employer. If enforcement of the jeopardy warrant is not superseded as provided in this section, the employer is entitled to a refund from the fund of all amounts paid as contributions or reimbursements in excess of the amount finally determined to be due by the employer upon application being made as provided in this chapter. (4) MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS FOR COLLECTION OF CONTRIBUTIONS AND REIMBURSEMENTS.— (a) In addition to all other remedies and proceedings authorized by this chapter for the collection of contributions and reimbursements, a right of action by suit in the name of the tax collection service provider is created. A suit may be brought, and all proceedings taken, to the same effect and extent as for the enforcement of a right of action for debt or assumpsit, and all remedies available in such actions, including attachment and garnishment, are available to the tax collection service provider for the collection of any contribution or reimbursement. The tax collection service provider is not, however, required to post bond in any such action or proceedings. In addition, this section does not make these contributions or reimbursements a debt or demand unenforceable against homestead property as provided by Art. X of the State Constitution, and these remedies are solely procedural. (b) An employer who fails to make return or pay the contributions or reimbursements levied under this chapter, and who remains an employer as provided in s. 443.121, may be enjoined from employing individuals in employment as defined in this chapter upon the complaint of the tax collection service provider in the circuit court of the county in which the employer does business. An employer who fails to make return or pay contributions or reimbursements shall be enjoined from employing individuals in employment until the return is made and the contributions or reimbursements are paid to the tax collection service provider. (c) Any agent or employee designated by the Department of Commerce or its tax collection service provider may administer an oath to any person for any return or report required by this chapter or by the rules of the department or the state agency providing reemployment assistance tax collection services, and an oath made before the department or its service provider or any authorized agent or employee has the same effect as an oath made before any judicial officer or notary public of the state. (d) Civil actions brought under this chapter to collect contributions, reimbursements, or interest, or any proceeding conducted for the collection of contributions or reimbursements from an employer, shall be heard by the court having jurisdiction at the earliest possible date and are entitled to preference upon the calendar of the court over all other civil actions except petitions for judicial review of claims for benefits arising under this chapter and cases arising under the Workers’ Compensation Law of this state. (e) The tax collection service provider may commence an action in any other state to collect reemployment assistance contributions, reimbursements, penalties, and interest legally due this state. The officials of other states that extend a like comity to this state may sue for the collection of contributions, reimbursements, interest, and penalties in the courts of this state. The courts of this state shall recognize and enforce liability for contributions, reimbursements, interest, and penalties imposed by other states that extend a like comity to this state. (f) The collection of any contribution, reimbursement, interest, or penalty due under this chapter is not enforceable by civil action, warrant, claim, or other means unless the notice of lien is filed with the clerk of the circuit court as described in subsection (3) within 5 years after the date the contribution, reimbursement, interest, and penalty were due. (5) PRIORITIES UNDER LEGAL DISSOLUTION OR DISTRIBUTIONS.—In the event of any distribution of an employer’s assets pursuant to an order of any court under the laws of this state, including any receivership, assignment for the benefit of creditors, adjudicated insolvency, composition, administration of estates of decedents, or other similar proceeding, contributions or reimbursements then or subsequently due must be paid in full before all other claims except claims for wages of $250 or less to each claimant, earned within 6 months after the commencement of the proceeding, and on a parity with all other tax claims wherever those tax claims are given priority. In the administration of the estate of a decedent, the filing of notice of lien is a proceeding required upon protest of the claim filed by the tax collection service provider for contributions or reimbursements due under this chapter, and the claim must be allowed by the circuit judge. However, the personal representative of the decedent may, by petition to the circuit court, object to the validity of the tax collection service provider’s claim, and proceedings shall be conducted in the circuit court for the determination of the validity of the service provider’s claim. Further, the bond of the personal representative may not be discharged until the claim is finally determined by the circuit court. If a bond is not given by the personal representative, the assets of the estate may not be distributed until the final determination by the circuit court. Upon distribution of the assets of the estate, the tax collection service provider’s claim has a class 8 priority as established in s. 733.707(1)(h), subject to the above limitations with reference to wages. In the event of an employer’s adjudication in bankruptcy, judicially confirmed extension proposal, or composition, under the federal Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, as amended, contributions or reimbursements then or subsequently due are entitled to priority as is provided in 11 U.S.C. s. 507(a)(8). (6) REFUNDS.— (a) Within 4 years after payment of any amount as contributions, reimbursements, interest, or penalties, an employing unit may apply for an adjustment of its subsequent payments of contributions or reimbursements, or for a refund if the adjustment cannot be made. (b) If the tax collection service provider determines that any contributions, reimbursements, interest, or penalties were erroneously collected, the employing unit may adjust its subsequent payment of contributions or reimbursements by the amount erroneously collected. If an adjustment cannot be made, the tax collection service provider shall refund the amount erroneously collected from the fund. (c) Within the time limit provided in paragraph (a), the tax collection service provider may on its own initiative adjust or refund the amount erroneously collected. (d) This chapter does not authorize a refund of contributions or reimbursements properly paid in accordance with this chapter when the payment was made, except as required by s. 443.1216(13)(e). (e) An employing unit entitled to a refund or adjustment for erroneously collected contributions, reimbursements, interest, or penalties is not entitled to interest on that erroneously collected amount. (f) Refunds under this subsection and under s. 443.1216(13)(e) may be paid from the clearing account or the benefit account of the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund and from the Special Employment Security Administration Trust Fund for interest or penalties previously paid into the fund, notwithstanding s. 443.191(2).

      "heading": "Procedure concerning claims.",
      "text": "443.151 Procedure concerning claims.— (1) POSTING OF INFORMATION.— (a) Each employer must post and maintain in places readily accessible to individuals in her or his employ printed statements concerning benefit rights, claims for benefits, and other matters relating to the administration of this chapter as the Department of Commerce may by rule prescribe. Each employer must supply to individuals copies of printed statements or other materials relating to claims for benefits as directed by the rules of the department. The department shall supply these printed statements and other materials to each employer without cost to the employer. (b)1. The department shall advise each individual filing a new claim for reemployment assistance, at the time of filing the claim, that: a. Reemployment assistance is subject to federal income tax. b. Requirements exist pertaining to estimated tax payments. c. The individual may elect to have federal income tax deducted and withheld from the individual’s payment of reemployment assistance at the amount specified in the federal Internal Revenue Code. d. The individual is not permitted to change a previously elected withholding status more than twice per calendar year. 2. Amounts deducted and withheld from reemployment assistance must remain in the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund until transferred to the federal taxing authority as payment of income tax. 3. The department shall follow all procedures specified by the United States Department of Labor and the federal Internal Revenue Service pertaining to the deducting and withholding of income tax. 4. If more than one authorized request for deduction and withholding is made, amounts must be deducted and withheld in accordance with the following priorities: a. Reemployment assistance overpayments have first priority; b. Child support payments have second priority; and c. Withholding under this subsection has third priority. (2) FILING OF CLAIM INVESTIGATIONS; NOTIFICATION OF CLAIMANTS AND EMPLOYERS.— (a) In general.—Initial and continued claims for benefits must be made by approved electronic or alternate means and in accordance with rules adopted by the Department of Commerce. The department shall provide alternative means, such as by telephone, for filing initial and continued claims if the department determines access to the approved electronic means is or will be unavailable and also must provide public notice of such unavailability. The department must notify claimants and employers regarding monetary and nonmonetary determinations of eligibility. Investigations of issues raised in connection with a claimant which may affect a claimant’s eligibility for benefits or charges to an employer’s employment record shall be conducted by the department through written, telephonic, or electronic means as prescribed by rule. (b) Process.—When the Reemployment Assistance Claims and Benefits Information System described in s. 443.1113 is fully operational, the process for filing claims must incorporate the process for registering for work with the consumer-first workforce system established under s. 445.011. Unless exempted under s. 443.091(1)(b)5., a claim for benefits may not be processed until the work registration requirement is satisfied. The department may adopt rules as necessary to administer the work registration requirement set forth in this paragraph. (3) DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY.— (a) Notices of claim.—The Department of Commerce shall promptly provide a notice of claim to the claimant’s most recent employing unit and all employers whose employment records are liable for benefits under the monetary determination. The employer must respond to the notice of claim within 14 days after the mailing date of the notice, or in lieu of mailing, within 14 days after the delivery of the notice. If a contributing employer or its agent fails to timely or adequately respond to the notice of claim or request for information, the employer’s account may not be relieved of benefit charges as provided in s. 443.131(3)(a), notwithstanding paragraph (5)(b). The department may adopt rules as necessary to implement the processes described in this paragraph relating to notices of claim. (b) Monetary determinations.—In addition to the notice of claim, the department shall also promptly provide an initial monetary determination to the claimant and each base period employer whose account is subject to being charged for its respective share of benefits on the claim. The monetary determination must include a statement of whether and in what amount the claimant is entitled to benefits, and, in the event of a denial, must state the reasons for the denial. A monetary determination for the first week of a benefit year must also include a statement of whether the claimant was paid the wages required under s. 443.091(1)(g) and, if so, the first day of the benefit year, the claimant’s weekly benefit amount, and the maximum total amount of benefits payable to the claimant for a benefit year. The claimant may file a request for the department to reconsider a monetary determination within 20 days after the department mails the notice to the claimant’s last known address or, in lieu of mailing, within 20 days after the delivery of the notice. A monetary determination is final for a claimant if the claimant does not file a timely request for the department to reconsider the monetary determination. A monetary redetermination is final for a claimant unless within 20 days after the mailing of the notice of monetary redetermination to the claimant’s last known address or, in lieu of mailing, within 20 days after the delivery of the notice, the claimant files an appeal. The monetary determination or monetary redetermination is final for an employer or other party entitled to notice unless within 20 days after the mailing of the respective notice to the employer or party to its last known address or, in lieu of mailing, within 20 days after delivery of the notice, an appeal is filed by the employer or the party. The department may adopt rules as necessary to implement the processes described in this paragraph relating to notices of monetary determinations and the appeals or reconsideration requests filed in response to such notices. (c) Nonmonetary determinations.—If the department receives information that may result in a denial of benefits, the department must complete an investigation of the claim required by subsection (2) and provide notice of a nonmonetary determination to the claimant and the employer from whom the claimant’s reason for separation affects his or her entitlement to benefits. The determination must state the reason for the determination and whether the reemployment assistance tax account of the contributing employer is charged for benefits paid on the claim. The nonmonetary determination is final unless within 20 days after the mailing of the notices to the parties’ last known addresses, or in lieu of mailing, within 20 days after the delivery of the notices, an appeal or written request for reconsideration is filed by the claimant or other party entitled to notice. The department may adopt rules as necessary to implement the processes described in this paragraph relating to notices of nonmonetary determination and the appeals or reconsideration requests filed in response to such notices, and may adopt rules prescribing the manner and procedure by which employers within the base period of a claimant become entitled to notice of nonmonetary determination. (d) Determinations in labor dispute cases.—Whenever any claim involves a labor dispute described in s. 443.101(4), the department shall promptly assign the claim to a special examiner who shall make a determination on the issues involving unemployment due to the labor dispute. The special examiner shall make the determination after an investigation, as necessary. The claimant or another party entitled to notice of the determination may appeal a determination under subsection (4). (e) Redeterminations.— 1. The department may reconsider a determination if it finds an error or if new evidence or information pertinent to the determination is discovered after a prior determination or redetermination. A redetermination may not be made more than 1 year after the last day of the benefit year unless the disqualification for making a false or fraudulent representation under s. 443.101(6) is applicable, in which case the redetermination may be made within 2 years after the false or fraudulent representation. The department must promptly give notice of redetermination to the claimant and to any employers entitled to notice in the manner prescribed in this section for the notice of an initial determination. 2. If the amount of benefits is increased by the redetermination, an appeal of the redetermination based solely on the increase may be filed as provided in subsection (4). If the amount of benefits is decreased by the redetermination, the redetermination may be appealed by the claimant if a subsequent claim for benefits is affected in amount or duration by the redetermination. If the final decision on the determination or redetermination to be reconsidered was made by an appeals referee, the commission, or a court, the department may apply for a revised decision from the body or court that made the final decision. 3. If an appeal of an original determination is pending when a redetermination is issued, the appeal unless withdrawn is treated as an appeal from the redetermination. (4) APPEALS.— (a) Appeals referees.— 1. The Department of Commerce shall appoint one or more impartial salaried appeals referees in accordance with s. 443.171(3) to hear and decide appealed claims. 2. A person may not participate on behalf of the department as an appeals referee in any case in which she or he is an interested party. 3. The department may designate alternates to serve in the absence or disqualification of any appeals referee on a temporary basis. These alternates must have the same qualifications required of appeals referees. 4. The department shall provide the commission and the appeals referees with proper facilities and assistance for the execution of their functions. (b) Filing and hearing.— 1. The claimant or any other party entitled to notice of a determination may appeal an adverse determination to an appeals referee within 20 days after the date of mailing of the notice to her or his last known address or, if the notice is not mailed, within 20 days after the date of delivering the notice. 2. Unless the appeal is untimely or withdrawn or review is initiated by the commission, the appeals referee, after mailing all parties and attorneys of record a notice of hearing at least 10 days before the date of hearing, notwithstanding the 14-day notice requirement in s. 120.569(2)(b), may only affirm, modify, or reverse the determination. An appeal may not be withdrawn without the permission of the appeals referee. 3. If an appeal appears to have been filed after the permissible time limit, the Office of Appeals may issue an order to show cause to the appellant which requires the appellant to show why the appeal should not be dismissed as untimely. If, within 15 days after the mailing date of the order to show cause, the appellant does not provide written evidence of timely filing or good cause for failure to appeal timely, the appeal shall be dismissed. However, an appeal may not be filed more than 5 years after the date of the mailing of the determination or, if the determination is not mailed, more than 5 years after the date of the delivery of the determination. 4. If an appeal involves a question of whether services were performed by a claimant in employment or for an employer, the referee must give special notice of the question and of the pendency of the appeal to the employing unit and to the department, both of which become parties to the proceeding. 5.a. Any part of the evidence may be received in written form, and all testimony of parties and witnesses shall be made under oath. b. Irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded, but all other evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs is admissible, whether or not such evidence would be admissible in a trial in state court. c. Hearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining other evidence, or to support a finding if it would be admissible over objection in civil actions. Notwithstanding s. 120.57(1)(c), hearsay evidence may support a finding of fact if: (I) The party against whom it is offered has a reasonable opportunity to review such evidence prior to the hearing; and (II) The appeals referee or special deputy determines, after considering all relevant facts and circumstances, that the evidence is trustworthy and probative and that the interests of justice are best served by its admission into evidence. 6. The parties must be notified promptly of the referee’s decision. The referee’s decision is final unless further review is initiated under paragraph (c) within 20 days after the date of mailing notice of the decision to the party’s last known address or, in lieu of mailing, within 20 days after the delivery of the notice. (c) Review by commission.—The commission may, on its own motion, within the time limit in paragraph (b), initiate a review of the decision of an appeals referee. The commission may also allow the department or any adversely affected party entitled to notice of the decision to appeal the decision by filing an application within the time limit in paragraph (b). An adversely affected party has the right to appeal the decision if the department’s determination is not affirmed by the appeals referee. The commission may affirm, modify, or reverse the findings and conclusions of the appeals referee based on evidence previously submitted in the case or based on additional evidence taken at the direction of the commission. The commission may assume jurisdiction of or transfer to another appeals referee the proceedings on any claim pending before an appeals referee. Any proceeding in which the commission assumes jurisdiction before completion must be heard by the commission in accordance with the requirement of this subsection for proceedings before an appeals referee. When the commission denies an application to hear an appeal of an appeals referee’s decision, the decision of the appeals referee is the decision of the commission for purposes of this paragraph and is subject to judicial review within the same time and manner as decisions of the commission, except that the time for initiating review runs from the date of notice of the commission’s order denying the application to hear an appeal. (d) Procedure.—The manner that appealed claims are presented must comply with the commission’s rules. Witnesses subpoenaed under this section are allowed fees at the rate established by s. 92.142, and fees of witnesses subpoenaed on behalf of the department or any claimant are deemed part of the expense of administering this chapter. (e) Judicial review.—Orders of the commission entered under paragraph (c) are subject to review only by notice of appeal in the district court of appeal in the appellate district in which a claimant resides or the job separation arose or in the appellate district where the order was issued. However, if the notice of appeal is filed solely with the commission, the appeal shall be filed in the district court of appeal in the appellate district in which the order was issued. Notwithstanding chapter 120, the commission is a party respondent to every such proceeding. The department may initiate judicial review of orders in the same manner and to the same extent as any other party. (5) PAYMENT OF BENEFITS.— (a) The Department of Commerce shall promptly pay benefits in accordance with a determination or redetermination regardless of any appeal or pending appeal. Before payment of benefits to the claimant, however, each employer who is liable for reimbursements in lieu of contributions for payment of the benefits must be notified, at the address on file with the department or its tax collection service provider, of the initial determination of the claim and must be given 10 days to respond. (b) The department shall promptly pay benefits, regardless of whether a determination is under appeal if the determination allowing benefits is affirmed in any amount by an appeals referee or is affirmed by the commission, or if a decision of an appeals referee allowing benefits is affirmed in any amount by the commission. In these instances, a court may not issue an injunction, supersedeas, stay, or other writ or process suspending payment of benefits. A contributing employer that responded to the notice of claim within the time limit provided in subsection (3) may not, however, be charged with benefits paid under an erroneous determination if the decision is ultimately reversed. Benefits are not paid for any subsequent weeks of unemployment involved in a reversal. (c) The provisions of paragraph (b) relating to charging an employer liable for contributions do not apply to reimbursing employers. (6) RECOVERY AND RECOUPMENT.— (a) Any person who, by reason of her or his fraud, receives benefits under this chapter to which she or he is not entitled is liable for repaying those benefits to the Department of Commerce on behalf of the trust fund or, in the discretion of the department, to have those benefits deducted from future benefits payable to her or him under this chapter. In addition, the department shall impose upon the claimant a penalty equal to 15 percent of the amount overpaid. To enforce this paragraph, the department must find the existence of fraud through a redetermination or decision under this section within 2 years after the fraud was committed. Any recovery or recoupment of benefits must be commenced within 7 years after the redetermination or decision. (b) Any person who, by reason other than her or his fraud, receives benefits under this chapter to which, under a redetermination or decision pursuant to this section, she or he is not entitled, is liable for repaying those benefits to the department on behalf of the trust fund or, in the discretion of the department, to have those benefits deducted from any future benefits payable to her or him under this chapter. Any recovery or recoupment of benefits must be commenced within 7 years after the redetermination or decision. (c) Any person who, by reason other than fraud, receives benefits under this chapter to which she or he is not entitled as a result of an employer’s failure to respond to a claim within the timeframe provided in subsection (3) is not liable for repaying those benefits to the department on behalf of the trust fund or to have those benefits deducted from any future benefits payable to her or him under this chapter. (d) Recoupment from future benefits is not permitted if the benefits are received by any person without fault on the person’s part and recoupment would defeat the purpose of this chapter or would be inequitable and against good conscience. (e) The department shall collect the repayment of benefits without interest by the deduction of benefits through a redetermination or by a civil action. (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any person who is determined by this state, a cooperating state agency, the United States Secretary of Labor, or a court to have received any payments under the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, to which the person was not entitled shall have those payments deducted from any regular benefits, as defined in s. 443.1115(1)(e), payable to her or him under this chapter. Each such deduction may not exceed 50 percent of the amount otherwise payable. The payments deducted shall be remitted to the agency that issued the payments under the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, for return to the United States Treasury. Except for overpayments determined by a court, a deduction may not be made under this paragraph until a determination by the state agency or the United States Secretary of Labor is final. (7) REPRESENTATION IN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS.—In any administrative proceeding conducted under this chapter, an employer or a claimant has the right, at his or her own expense, to be represented by counsel or by an authorized representative. Notwithstanding s. 120.62(2), the authorized representative need not be a qualified representative. (8) BILINGUAL REQUIREMENTS.— (a) The Department of Commerce shall provide printed bilingual instructional and educational materials in the appropriate language in those counties in which 5 percent or more of the households in the county are classified as a single-language minority. (b) The department shall ensure that one-stop career centers and appeals offices located in counties subject to the requirements of paragraph (c) prominently post notices in the appropriate languages and that translators are available in those centers and offices. (c) As used in this subsection, the term “single-language minority” means households that speak the same non-English language and that do not contain an adult fluent in English. The department shall develop estimates of the percentages of single-language minority households for each county by using data from the United States Bureau of the Census.

I of the State Constitution. This confidential information may be released in accordance with the provisions in 20 C.F.R. part 603. A person receiving confidential information who violates this subsection commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. The Department of Commerce or its tax collection service provider may, however, furnish to any employer copies of any report submitted by that employer upon the request of the employer and may furnish to any claimant copies of any report submitted by that claimant upon the request of the claimant. The department or its tax collection service provider may charge a reasonable fee for copies of these reports as prescribed by rule, which may not exceed the actual reasonable cost of the preparation of the copies. Fees received for copies under this subsection must be deposited in the Employment Security Administration Trust Fund. (2) DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.— (a) Subject to restrictions the Department of Commerce or the state agency providing reemployment assistance tax collection services adopts by rule, information declared confidential under this section is available to any agency of this or any other state, or any federal agency, charged with the administration of any reemployment assistance or unemployment compensation law or the maintenance of the one-stop delivery system, or the Bureau of Internal Revenue of the United States Department of the Treasury, or the Florida Department of Revenue. Information obtained in connection with the administration of the one-stop delivery system may be made available to persons or agencies for purposes appropriate to the operation of a public employment service or a job-preparatory or career education or training program. The department shall, on a quarterly basis, furnish the National Directory of New Hires with information concerning the wages and reemployment assistance benefits paid to individuals, by the dates, in the format, and containing the information specified in the regulations of the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services. Upon request, the department shall furnish any agency of the United States charged with the administration of public works or assistance through public employment, and may furnish to any state agency similarly charged, the name, address, ordinary occupation, and employment status of each recipient of benefits and the recipient’s rights to further benefits under this chapter. Except as otherwise provided by law, the receiving agency must retain the confidentiality of this information as provided in this section. The tax collection service provider may request the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States to examine the correctness of any return or report of any national banking association rendered under this chapter and may in connection with that request transmit any report or return for examination to the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States as provided in s. 3305(c) of the federal Internal Revenue Code. (b) The employer or the employer’s workers’ compensation carrier against whom a claim for benefits under chapter 440 has been made, or a representative of either, may request from the department records of wages of the employee reported to the department by any employer for the quarter that includes the date of the accident that is the subject of such claim and for subsequent quarters. 1. The request must be made with the authorization or consent of the employee or any employer who paid wages to the employee after the date of the accident. 2. The employer or carrier shall make the request on a form prescribed by rule for such purpose by the department. Such form shall contain a certification by the requesting party that it is a party entitled to the information requested. 3. The department shall provide the most current information readily available within 15 days after receiving the request. (3) DISCLOSURE OF DRUG TEST INFORMATION.—Notwithstanding s. 440.102(8), all information, interviews, reports, and drug test results, written or otherwise, received by an employer through a drug-testing program may be used or received in evidence, obtained in discovery, or disclosed in public or private proceedings conducted for the purpose of determining compensability under this chapter, including any administrative or judicial appeal. The employer, agent of the employer, or laboratory conducting a drug test may also obtain access to employee drug test information when consulting with legal counsel in connection with actions brought under or related to this chapter or when the information is relevant to its defense in a civil or administrative matter. This information may also be released to a professional or occupational licensing board in a related disciplinary proceeding. However, unless otherwise provided by law, this information is confidential for all other purposes. (a) This information may not be disclosed or released and may not be used in any criminal proceeding against the person tested. Information released contrary to paragraph (c) is inadmissible as evidence in the criminal proceeding. (b) Unless otherwise provided by law, any information described in this subsection and received by a public employer through a drug-testing program, or obtained by a public employee under this chapter, is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution, until introduced into the public record under a hearing conducted under s. 443.151(4). (c) Confidentiality may be waived only by express and informed written consent executed by the person tested. The consent form must contain, at a minimum: 1. The name of the person who is authorized to obtain the information; 2. The purpose of the disclosure; 3. The precise information to be disclosed; 4. The duration of the consent; and 5. The signature of the person authorizing release of the information.

The access is limited to the wage reports for the appropriate amount of time for the purpose the information is requested. (2) Users must obtain consent in writing or by electronic signature from an applicant for credit, employment, or other permitted purposes. Any written or electronic signature consent from an applicant must be signed and must include the following: (a) Specific notice that information concerning the applicant’s wage and employment history will be released to a consumer reporting agency; (b) Notice that the release is made for the sole purpose of reviewing the specific application for credit, employment, or other permitted purpose made by the applicant; (c) Notice that the files of the Department of Commerce or its tax collection service provider containing information concerning wage and employment history which is submitted by the applicant or his or her employers may be accessed; and (d) A listing of the parties authorized to receive the released information. (3) Consumer reporting agencies and users accessing information under this section must safeguard the confidentiality of the information. A consumer reporting agency or user may use the information only to support a single transaction for the user to satisfy its standard underwriting or eligibility requirements or for those requirements imposed upon the user, and to satisfy the user’s obligations under applicable state or federal laws, rules, or regulations. (4) If a consumer reporting agency or user violates this section, the Department of Commerce shall, upon 30 days’ written notice to the consumer reporting agency, terminate the contract established between the Department of Commerce and the consumer reporting agency or require the consumer reporting agency to terminate the contract established between the consumer reporting agency and the user under this section. (5) The Department of Commerce shall establish minimum audit, security, net worth, and liability insurance standards, technical requirements, and any other terms and conditions considered necessary in the discretion of the state agency to safeguard the confidentiality of the information released under this section and to otherwise serve the public interest. The Department of Commerce shall also include, in coordination with any necessary state agencies, necessary audit procedures to ensure that these rules are followed. (6) In contracting with one or more consumer reporting agencies under this section, any revenues generated by the contract must be used to pay the entire cost of providing access to the information. Further, in accordance with federal regulations, any additional revenues generated by the Department of Commerce or the state under this section must be paid into the Administrative Trust Fund of the Department of Commerce for the administration of the unemployment compensation system or be used as program income.

In which any part of the individual’s service is performed; 2. In which the individual has her or his residence; or 3. In which the employing unit maintains a place of business. (b) For services to be considered as performed within a state under a reciprocal agreement, the employing unit must have an election in effect for those services, which is approved by the agency charged with the administration of such state’s reemployment assistance or unemployment compensation law, under which all the services performed by the individual for the employing unit are deemed to be performed entirely within that state. (c) The department shall participate in any arrangements for the payment of compensation on the basis of combining an individual’s wages and employment covered under this chapter with her or his wages and employment covered under the reemployment assistance or unemployment compensation laws of other states, which are approved by the United States Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the state reemployment assistance or unemployment compensation agencies, as reasonably calculated to assure the prompt and full payment of compensation in those situations and which include provisions for: 1. Applying the base period of a single state law to a claim involving the combining of an individual’s wages and employment covered under two or more state reemployment assistance or unemployment compensation laws; and 2.
