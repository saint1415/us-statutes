      "text": "267.061 Historic properties; state policy, responsibilities.— (1) STATE POLICY RELATIVE TO HISTORIC PROPERTIES.— (a) The rich and unique heritage of historic properties in this state, representing more than 10,000 years of human presence, is an important legacy to be valued and conserved for present and future generations. The destruction of these nonrenewable historical resources will engender a significant loss to the state’s quality of life, economy, and cultural environment. It is therefore declared to be state policy to: 1. Provide leadership in the preservation of the state’s historic resources; 2. Administer state-owned or state-controlled historic resources in a spirit of stewardship and trusteeship; 3. Contribute to the preservation of non-state-owned historic resources and to give encouragement to organizations and individuals undertaking preservation by private means; 4. Foster conditions, using measures that include financial and technical assistance, for a harmonious coexistence of society and state historic resources; 5. Encourage the public and private preservation and utilization of elements of the state’s historically built environment; and 6. Assist local governments to expand and accelerate their historic preservation programs and activities. (b) It is further declared to be the public policy of the state that all treasure trove, artifacts, and such objects having intrinsic or historical and archaeological value which have been abandoned on state-owned lands or state-owned sovereignty submerged lands shall belong to the state with the title thereto vested in the Division of Historical Resources of the Department of State for the purposes of administration and protection. (2) RESPONSIBILITIES OF STATE AGENCIES OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.— (a) Each state agency of the executive branch having direct or indirect jurisdiction over a proposed state or state-assisted undertaking shall, in accordance with state policy and prior to the approval of expenditure of any state funds on the undertaking, consider the effect of the undertaking on any historic property that is included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of Historic Places. Each such agency shall afford the division a reasonable opportunity to comment with regard to such an undertaking. (b) Each state agency of the executive branch shall initiate measures in consultation with the division to assure that where, as a result of state action or assistance carried out by such agency, a historic property is to be demolished or substantially altered in a way which adversely affects the character, form, integrity, or other qualities which contribute to historical, architectural, or archaeological value of the property, timely steps are taken to determine that no feasible and prudent alternative to the proposed demolition or alteration exists, and, where no such alternative is determined to exist, to assure that timely steps are taken either to avoid or mitigate the adverse effects, or to undertake an appropriate archaeological salvage excavation or other recovery action to document the property as it existed prior to demolition or alteration. (c) In consultation with the division, each state agency of the executive branch shall establish a program to locate, inventory, and evaluate all historic properties under the agency’s ownership or control that appear to qualify for the National Register. Each such agency shall exercise caution to assure that any such historic property is not inadvertently transferred, sold, demolished, substantially altered, or allowed to deteriorate significantly. (d) Each state agency of the executive branch shall assume responsibility for the preservation of historic resources which are owned or controlled by such agency. Prior to acquiring, constructing, or leasing buildings for the purpose of carrying out agency responsibilities, the agency shall use, to the maximum extent feasible, historic properties available to the agency. Each agency shall undertake, consistent with the preservation of such properties, the mission of the agency, and the professional standards established pursuant to s. 267.031(5)(k), any preservation actions necessary to carry out the intent of this paragraph. (e) Each state agency of the executive branch, in seeking to acquire additional space through new construction or lease, shall give preference to the acquisition or use of historic properties when such acquisition or use is determined to be feasible and prudent compared with available alternatives. The acquisition or use of historic properties is considered feasible and prudent if the cost of purchase or lease, the cost of rehabilitation, remodeling, or altering the building to meet compliance standards and the agency’s needs, and the projected costs of maintaining the building and providing utilities and other services is less than or equal to the same costs for available alternatives. The agency shall request the division to assist in determining if the acquisition or use of a historic property is feasible and prudent. Within 60 days after making a determination that additional space is needed, the agency shall request the division to assist in identifying buildings within the appropriate geographic area that are historic properties suitable for acquisition or lease by the agency, whether or not such properties are in need of repair, alteration, or addition. (f) Consistent with the agency’s mission and authority, all state agencies of the executive branch shall carry out agency programs and projects, including those under which any state assistance is provided, in a manner which is generally sensitive to the preservation of historic properties and shall give consideration to programs and projects which will further the purposes of this section. (3) DEPARTMENT OF MANAGEMENT SERVICES.—The Department of Management Services, in consultation with the division, shall adopt rules for the renovation of historic properties which are owned or leased by the state. Such rules shall be based on national guidelines for historic renovation, including the standards and guidelines for rehabilitation adopted by the United States Secretary of the Interior.

(1) The division shall encourage the initiation of proposals for Official Florida Historical Markers from departments or agencies of the state; units of county, municipal, or other local governments; corporations, partnerships, or other organizations, whether public or private and whether or not for profit; or any individual. Markers may be installed to recognize historic properties, as well as individuals, events, and other topics significant in Florida or American history, architecture, archaeology, or culture. (2) By means of appropriate variations in marker design, the division shall distinguish the following categories of Official Florida Historical Markers: (a) Florida Heritage Landmark markers, which shall be used to identify and interpret Heritage Landmark properties. (b) State Historic Highway markers, which shall be used to identify state historic highways, as provided in general law. (c) Florida Heritage markers, which shall be used to identify and interpret people, events, and places, including buildings and archaeological sites, which do not meet the criteria for a Florida Heritage Landmark, and other subjects relating to Florida history and culture. (d) Other special series of markers which the division may establish to facilitate guiding the general public to places of historic interest and to facilitate identification and interpretation of topics of statewide interest, including, but not limited to, historic and scenic trails, byways, and greenways and anniversaries or other occasions of special significance to the history and culture of Florida. The division may exercise the right of trademark over the terms “Florida Heritage” or “Heritage Florida” pursuant to s. 286.031. (3) The division shall establish and maintain a central register of all markers installed in each category set out in subsection (2). In addition, the division shall establish and maintain the Florida Register of Heritage Landmarks, a central register of historic properties, which generally shall consist of properties more than 50 years of age deemed worthy of preservation for their exceptional historical significance to the state as a whole or a region of the state and their architectural or archaeological integrity. (a) The division shall adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 that prescribe criteria and a process for the identification, evaluation, and designation of Heritage Landmark properties, as well as for withdrawal of designation. (b) The division may waive the age requirement of 50 years for properties of overwhelming state or national importance; however, it is the intent of the Legislature that exceptions shall rarely be given. (c) The division shall undertake a program to identify and nominate properties eligible for designation as Heritage Landmarks. (d) Designation of private property as a Heritage Landmark does not prohibit under Florida law or regulation any actions which may otherwise be taken by the property owner with respect to the property. (4)(a) The division is authorized and empowered to erect and maintain appropriate signs or markers indicating sites of historic interest and value upon public property as well as upon private property where permission is obtained. (b) The Department of Transportation or the governing body of each county or municipality is authorized to permit and assist the division in erecting and maintaining said historic signs or markers within the right-of-way of any state highway, county road, or municipal street, or any other property under its jurisdiction and control, under such conditions and limitations as may be appropriate. The division is hereby vested with the exclusive authority and power to erect and maintain said historic signs or markers within the right-of-way of any state highway. (5) The division shall designate an approved marker as an Official Florida Historical Marker. To ensure a degree of uniformity and quality of historical markers, monuments, plaques, medallions, and similar devices in this state, and to avoid any confusion with or misrepresentation of an Official Florida Historical Marker, no such marker or reasonable facsimile thereof may be fabricated with any emblem, design, or logo signifying another organization. No other emblem, design, or marker size may be used in addition to or instead of those offered by the division for an Official Florida Historical Marker. Emblems, designs, or logos offered by the division are property of the state and may not be used for commercial advertising or copied for the use of any other agency, association, corporation, or individual without the express consent and authorization of the division. (6) The division may establish a reasonable fee to recover its costs arising from review of a proposal for a historical marker, monument, plaque, medallion, or similar device. Any fee established shall be payable by the applicant for the marker, monument, plaque, medallion, or similar device. (7) Funds for the creation and placement of an Official Florida Historical Marker shall be provided by the agency, organization, individual, or other entity proposing the marker. The division may erect Official Florida Historical Markers at its own expense and may make competitive grants from the Historical Resources Operating Trust Fund, pursuant to s. 267.0617, to assist in funding the costs of Official Florida Historical Markers. All Official Florida Historical Markers shall be considered property of the state. (8) The division shall seek cooperation from local volunteers throughout the state and, where appropriate, shall encourage the establishment of citizen support organizations, pursuant to s. 267.17, to assist in maintaining Official Florida Historical Markers and facilitating public access to places marked.

(2) The division may issue permits for excavation and surface reconnaissance on land owned or controlled by the state, land owned by a water authority, or land within the boundaries of a designated state archaeological landmark or landmark zone to institutions that the division deems to be properly qualified to conduct such activity, subject to such rules and regulations as the division may prescribe, provided such activity is undertaken by reputable museums, universities, colleges, or other historical, scientific, or educational institutions or societies that possess or will secure the archaeological expertise for the performance of systematic archaeological field research, comprehensive analysis, and interpretation in the form of publishable reports and monographs, such reports to be submitted to the division. (3) Those state institutions considered by the division permanently to possess the required archaeological expertise to conduct the archaeological activities allowed under the permit may be designated as accredited institutions which will be allowed to conduct archaeological field activities on land owned or controlled by the state, land owned by a water authority, or land within the boundaries of a designated state archaeological landmark or landmark zone without obtaining an individual permit for each project, except that those accredited institutions will be required to give prior written notice of all anticipated archaeological field activities on land owned or controlled by the state, land owned by a water authority, or land within the boundaries of a designated state archaeological landmark or landmark zone to the division, together with such information as may reasonably be required by the division to ensure the proper preservation, protection, and excavation of the archaeological resources. However, archaeological activity may not be commenced by the accredited institution until the division has determined that the planned project will be in conformity with the guidelines, regulations, and criteria adopted pursuant to ss. 267.11-267.14. Such determination will be made by the division and notification to the institution given within 15 days after receipt of the prior notification by the division. (4) All specimens collected under a permit issued by the division or under the procedures adopted for accredited institutions shall belong to the state with the title thereto vested in the division for the purpose of administration and protection. The division may arrange for the disposition of the specimens so collected by accredited state institutions at those institutions and for the temporary or permanent loan of such specimens at permitholding institutions for the purpose of further scientific study, interpretative displays, and curatorial responsibilities.

(b) Any person who by means of excavation conducts archaeological field investigations on, or removes or attempts to remove or defaces, destroys, or otherwise alters any archaeological site or specimen located upon, land owned or controlled by the state, land owned by a water authority, or land within the boundaries of a designated state archaeological landmark or landmark zone, except in the course of activities pursued under the authority of a permit or under procedures relating to accredited institutions granted by the division, commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, and any vehicle or equipment of any person used in connection with the violation is subject to forfeiture to the state if it is determined by any court of law that the vehicle or equipment was involved in the violation. Such person shall forfeit to the state all specimens, objects, and materials collected or excavated, together with all photographs and records relating to such material. The court may also order the defendant to make restitution to the state for the archaeological or commercial value and cost of restoration and repair as defined in subsection (4). (c) Any person who offers for sale or exchange any object with knowledge that it has previously been collected or excavated in violation of any of the terms of ss. 267.11-267.14, or who procures, counsels, solicits, or employs any other person to violate any prohibition contained in ss. 267.11-267.14 or to sell, purchase, exchange, transport, receive, or offer to sell, purchase, or exchange any archaeological resource excavated or removed from land owned or controlled by the state, land owned by a water authority, or land within the boundaries of a designated state archaeological landmark or landmark zone, except with the express consent of the division, commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, and any vehicle or equipment of any person used in connection with the violation is subject to forfeiture to the state if it is determined by any court of law that such vehicle or equipment was involved in the violation. All specimens, objects, and material collected or excavated, together with all photographs and records relating to such material, shall be forfeited to the state. The court may also order the defendant to make restitution to the state for the archaeological or commercial value and cost of restoration and repair as defined in subsection (4). (2)(a) The division may institute an administrative proceeding to impose an administrative fine of not more than $500 a day on any person or business organization that, without written permission of the division, explores for, salvages, or excavates treasure trove, artifacts, sunken or abandoned ships, or other objects having historical or archaeological value located upon land owned or controlled by the state, including state sovereignty submerged land, or land owned by a water authority. (b) The division shall institute an administrative proceeding by serving written notice of a violation by certified mail upon the alleged violator. The notice shall specify the law or rule allegedly violated and the facts upon which the allegation is based. The notice shall also specify the amount of the administrative fine sought by the division. The fine is not due until after service of notice and an administrative hearing. However, the alleged violator has 20 days after service of notice to request an administrative hearing. Failure to respond within that time constitutes a waiver, and the fine becomes due without a hearing. (c) The division may enter its judgment for the amount of the administrative penalty imposed in a court of competent jurisdiction, pursuant to s. 120.69. The judgment may be enforced as any other judgment. (d) The division may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive relief against any person or business organization that explores for, salvages, or excavates treasure trove, artifacts, sunken or abandoned ships, or other objects having historical or archaeological value located upon land owned or controlled by the state, including state sovereignty submerged land, or land owned by a water authority without the written permission of the division. (e) The division shall adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 to administer this section. (3) Any person who: (a) Reproduces, retouches, reworks, or forges any archaeological or historical object originating from an archaeological site as designated by ss. 267.11-267.14 and deriving its principal value from its antiquity or makes any such object, whether a copy or not; or (b) Falsely labels, describes, identifies, or offers for sale or exchange any object with intent to represent the same to be an original and genuine archaeological or historical specimen, commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (4) DETERMINATION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL OR COMMERCIAL VALUE AND COST OF RESTORATION AND REPAIR.— (a) Archaeological value.—For purposes of this section, the archaeological value of any archaeological resource involved in a violation of the prohibitions in ss. 267.11-267.14 or conditions of a permit issued pursuant to ss. 267.11-267.14 shall be the value of the data associated with the archaeological resource. This value shall be appraised in terms of the costs of the retrieval of the scientific information which would have been obtainable prior to the violation. These costs may include, but need not be limited to, the cost of preparing a research design, conducting field work, carrying out laboratory analysis, and preparing reports as would be necessary to realize the information potential. (b) Commercial value.—For purposes of this section, the commercial value of any archaeological resource involved in a violation of the prohibitions in ss. 267.11-267.14 or conditions of a permit issued pursuant to ss. 267.11-267.14 shall be its fair market value. Where the violation has resulted in damage to the archaeological resource, the fair market value should be determined using the condition of the archaeological resource prior to the violation, to the extent that its prior condition can be ascertained. (c) Cost of restoration and repair.—For purposes of this section, the cost of restoration and repair of archaeological resources damaged as a result of a violation of prohibitions or conditions pursuant to this section shall be the sum of the costs already incurred for emergency restoration or repair work, plus those costs projected to be necessary to complete restoration and repair, which may include, but need not be limited to, the costs of the following: 1. Reconstruction of the archaeological resource. 2. Stabilization of the archaeological resource. 3. Ground contour reconstruction and surface stabilization. 4. Research necessary to carry out reconstruction or stabilization. 5. Physical barriers or other protective devices, necessitated by the disturbance of the archaeological resource, to protect it from further disturbance. 6. Examination and analysis of the archaeological resource, including recording remaining archaeological information, where necessitated by disturbance, in order to salvage remaining values which cannot be otherwise conserved. 7. Reinterment of human remains in accordance with religious custom and state, local, or tribal law, where appropriate, as determined by the land manager. 8. Preparation of reports relating to any of the activities described in this paragraph.
