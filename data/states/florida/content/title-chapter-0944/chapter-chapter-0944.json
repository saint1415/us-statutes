      "text": "944.012 Legislative intent.—The Legislature hereby finds and declares that: (1) Florida spends each year in excess of $60 million for its state correctional system, but Florida citizens have not received a fair return on that investment. Florida correctional institutions have contributed little to the reduction of crime. To the contrary, crime rates continue to rise; recidivism rates are notoriously high; and large prisons have for the most part become schools for crime, making successful reintegration into the community unlikely. (2) It is clear that major changes in correctional methods are required. It is essential to abate the use of large institutions and continue the development of community-based corrections; to equip judges with more effective evaluative tools to deal with the criminal offender; and to provide alternatives to institutionalization, including the availability of probationers’ residences and community correctional centers. (3) One of the chief factors contributing to the high recidivism rate in the state is the general inability of ex-offenders to find or keep meaningful employment. Although 90 percent of all offenders sent to prison return to society one day, the correctional system has done little to provide the offender with the vocational skills the offender needs to return to society as a productive citizen. This failure virtually guarantees the probability of return to crime. Vocational training and assistance in job placement must be looked to on a priority basis as an integral part of the process of changing deviant behavior in the institutionalized offender, when such change is determined to be possible. (4) These changes must not be made out of sympathy for the criminal or out of disregard of the threat of crime to society. They must be made precisely because that threat is too serious to be countered by ineffective methods. (5) In order to make the correctional system an efficient and effective mechanism, the various agencies involved in the correctional process must coordinate their efforts. Where possible, interagency offices should be physically located within major institutions and should include representatives of the public employment service, the vocational rehabilitation programs of the Department of Education, and the Florida Commission on Offender Review. Duplicative and unnecessary methods of evaluating offenders must be eliminated and areas of responsibility consolidated in order to more economically use present scarce resources. (6) It is the intent of the Legislature: (a) To provide a mechanism for the early identification, evaluation, and treatment of behavioral disorders of adult offenders coming into contact with the correctional system. (b) To separate dangerous or repeat offenders from nondangerous offenders, who have potential for rehabilitation, and place dangerous offenders in secure and manageable institutions. (c) When possible, to divert from expensive institutional commitment those individuals who, by virtue of professional diagnosis and evaluation, can be placed in less costly and more effective environments and programs better suited for their rehabilitation and the protection of society. (d) To make available to those offenders who are capable of rehabilitation the job training and job placement assistance they need to build meaningful and productive lives when they return to the community. (e) To provide intensive and meaningful supervision for those on probation so that the condition or situation which caused the person to commit the crime is corrected.

      "text": "944.023 Comprehensive correctional master plan.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Criminal Justice Estimating Conference” means the Criminal Justice Estimating Conference referred to in s. 216.136(5). (b) “Total capacity” of the state correctional system means the total design capacity of all institutions and facilities in the state correctional system, which may include those facilities authorized and funded under chapter 957, increased by one-half, with the following exceptions: 1. Medical and mental health beds must remain at design capacity. 2. Community-based contracted beds must remain at design capacity. 3. The one-inmate-per-cell requirement at Florida State Prison and other maximum security facilities must be maintained pursuant to paragraph (7)(a). 4. Community correctional centers and drug treatment centers must be increased by one-third. 5. A housing unit may not exceed its maximum capacity pursuant to paragraphs (7)(a) and (b). 6. A number of beds equal to 5 percent of total capacity shall be deducted for management beds at institutions. (c) “State correctional system” means the correctional system as defined in s. 944.02. (2) The department shall develop a comprehensive correctional master plan. The master plan shall project the needs for the state correctional system for the coming 5-year period and shall be updated annually and submitted to the Governor’s office and the Legislature at the same time the department submits its legislative budget request as provided in chapter 216. (3) The purposes of the comprehensive correctional master plan shall be: (a) To ensure that the penalties of the criminal justice system are completely and effectively administered to the convicted criminals and, to the maximum extent possible, that the criminal is provided opportunities for self-improvement and returned to freedom as a productive member of society. (b) To the extent possible, to protect the public safety and the law-abiding citizens of this state and to carry out the laws protecting the rights of the victims of convicted criminals. (c) To develop and maintain a humane system of punishment providing prison inmates with proper housing, nourishment, and medical attention. (d) To provide fair and adequate compensation and benefits to the employees of the state correctional system. (e) To the extent possible, to maximize the effective and efficient use of the principles used in private business. (f) To provide that convicted criminals not be incarcerated for any longer period of time or in any more secure facility than is necessary to ensure adequate sanctions, rehabilitation of offenders, and protection of public safety. (4) The comprehensive correctional master plan shall use the estimates of the Criminal Justice Estimating Conference and shall include: (a) A plan for the decentralization of reception and classification facilities for the implementation of a systemwide diagnosis-and-evaluation capability for adult offenders. The plan shall provide for a system of psychological testing and evaluation as well as medical screening through department resources or with other public or private agencies through a purchase-of-services agreement. (b) A plan developed by the department for the comprehensive vocational and educational training of, and treatment programs for, offenders and their evaluation within each institution, program, or facility of the department, based upon the identified needs of the offender and the requirements of the employment market. (c) A plan contracting with local facilities and programs as short-term confinement resources of the department for offenders who are sentenced to 3 years or less, or who are within 3 years or less of their anticipated release date, and integration of detention services which have community-based programs. The plan shall designate such facilities and programs by region of the state and identify, by county, the capability for local incarceration. (d) A detailed analysis of methods to implement diversified alternatives to institutionalization when such alternatives can be safely employed. The analysis shall include an assessment of current pretrial intervention, probation, and community control alternatives and their cost-effectiveness with regard to restitution to victims, reimbursements for cost of supervision, and subsequent violations resulting in commitments to the department. Such analysis shall also include an assessment of current use of electronic surveillance of offenders and projected potential for diverting additional categories of offenders from incarceration within the department. (e) A detailed analysis of current incarceration rates of both the state and county correctional systems with the calculation by the department of the current and projected ratios of inmates in the correctional system, as defined in s. 945.01, to the general population of the state which will serve as a basis for projecting construction needs. (f) A plan for community-based facilities and programs for the reintegration of offenders into society whereby inmates who are being released shall receive assistance. Such assistance may be through work-release, transition assistance, release assistance stipend, contract release, postrelease special services, temporary housing, or job placement programs. (g) A plan reflecting parity of pay or comparable economic benefits for correctional officers with that of law enforcement officers in this state, and an assessment of projected impacts on turnover rates within the department. (h) A plan containing habitability criteria which defines when beds are available and functional for use by inmates, and containing factors which define when institutions and facilities may be added to the inventory of the state correctional system. (5) The comprehensive correctional master plan shall project by year the total operating and capital outlay costs necessary for constructing a sufficient number of prison beds to avoid a deficiency in prison beds. Included in the master plan which projects operating and capital outlay costs shall be a siting plan which shall assess, rank, and designate appropriate sites pursuant to s. 944.095. The master plan shall include an assessment of the department’s current capability for providing the degree of security necessary to ensure public safety and should reflect the levels of security needed for the forecasted admissions of various types of offenders based upon sentence lengths and severity of offenses. The plan shall also provide construction options for targeting violent and habitual offenders for incarceration while providing specific alternatives for the various categories of lesser offenders. (6) Institutions within the state correctional system shall have the following design capacity factors: (a) Rooms and prison cells between 40 square feet and 90 square feet, inclusive: one inmate per room or prison cell. (b) Dormitory-style rooms and other rooms exceeding 90 square feet: one inmate per 55 square feet. (c) At institutions with rooms or cells, except to the extent that separate confinement cells have been constructed, a number of rooms or prison cells equal to 3 percent of total design capacity must be deducted from design capacity and set aside for confinement purposes. (d) Bed count calculations used to determine design capacity shall only include beds which are functional and available for use by inmates. (7) Institutions within the state correctional system shall have the following maximum capacity factors: (a) Rooms and prison cells between 40 square feet and 60 square feet, inclusive: one inmate per room or cell. If the room or prison cell is between 60 square feet and 90 square feet, inclusive, two inmates are allowed in each room, except that one inmate per room or prison cell is allowed at Florida State Prison or any other maximum security institution or facility which may be constructed. (b) Dormitory-style rooms and other rooms exceeding 90 square feet: one inmate per 37.5 square feet. Double-bunking is generally allowed only along the outer walls of a dormitory. (c) At institutions with rooms or cells, except to the extent that separate confinement cells have been constructed, a number of rooms or prison cells equal to 3 percent of total maximum capacity are not available for maximum capacity, and must be set aside for confinement purposes, thereby reducing maximum capacity by 6 percent since these rooms would otherwise house two inmates. (d) A number of beds equal to 5 percent of total maximum capacity must be deducted for management at institutions.

(b) Community-based residential drug treatment facilities that include: 1. Nonsecure facilities, whereby probationers and drug offender probationers who have violated their terms or conditions, or persons placed on community control whose presumptive sentence exceeds 22 months, may be required to reside while working, receiving treatment, or attending school, and whereby inmates may be placed who are nearing their date of release from a correctional institution or a community correctional center, who are in need of placement in a substance abuse transition housing program, and who are considered eligible for such placement by the department; and 2. Secure facilities which provide for limited access for the duration of the program for persons who have violated their conditions of probation, drug offender probation, or community control, and whose presumptive sentence exceeds 22 months. (c) A system of probation and restitution centers throughout the state whereby probationers, drug offender probationers, and community controllees who have violated their terms or conditions, and whose presumptive sentence exceeds 22 months, may be required to reside while working, receiving treatment, or attending school, or for persons on probation, drug offender probation, or community control who may be required to attend outpatient substance abuse counseling and whereby inmates may be placed who are nearing their date of release from a correctional institution or a community correctional center, who are in need of placement in a substance abuse transition housing program, and who are considered eligible for such placement by the department. The purpose of these facilities and services is to provide the court with an alternative to committing offenders to more secure state correctional institutions and to assist in the supervision of probationers, drug offender probationers, and community controllees and to provide the department transitional-housing beds to assist inmates released into the community. (2) Notwithstanding any other law, the department shall ensure that at least 400 of its contracted beds in nonsecure community-based residential substance abuse treatment facilities authorized under subparagraph (1)(b)1. or probation and restitution centers authorized under paragraph (1)(c) are designated for transition assistance for inmates who are nearing their date of release from a correctional institution or a community correctional center. These designated beds shall be provided by private organizations that do not have a faith component and that are under contract with the department. In making placement decisions, the department and the contract providers shall give priority consideration to those inmates who are nearing their date of release and who are to be placed in some form of postrelease community supervision. However, if an inmate whose sentence expires upon his or her release from a correctional institution or a community correction center and for whom community supervision is not required demonstrates the need for or interest in and suitability for transition-housing assistance, as determined by the department, the inmate is eligible to be considered for placement in transition housing. A right to substance abuse program services is not stated, intended, or otherwise implied by this subsection. (3)(a) The department shall develop and implement procedures to diagnose offenders prior to sentencing, for the purpose of recommending to the sentencing court suitable candidates for placement in a community-based residential drug treatment facility or probation and restitution center as provided in this section. The department shall also develop and implement procedures to properly identify inmates prior to release who demonstrate the need for or interest in and suitability for placement in a community-based substance abuse transition housing program as provided in this section and pursuant to ss. 944.4731 and 944.704. (b) Pretrial intervention programs in appropriate counties to provide early counseling and supervision services to specified offenders as provided in s. 948.08.

(2) When the department proposes a site for a state correctional facility, it shall request that the local government having jurisdiction over such proposed site determine whether or not the proposed site is in compliance with local government comprehensive plans, local land use ordinances, local zoning ordinances or regulations, and other local ordinances in effect at the time of such request. If no such determination is made within 90 days of the request, it shall be presumed that the proposed site is in compliance with such plans, ordinances, or regulations. (3) If the local government determines within 90 days of the request that construction of a correctional facility on the proposed site does not comply with any such plan, ordinance, or regulation, the department may request a modification of such plan, ordinance, or regulation without having an ownership interest in such property. For the purposes of this section, modification includes, but is not limited to, a variance, rezoning, special exception, or any other action of the local government having jurisdiction over the proposed site which would authorize siting of a correctional facility. (4) Upon receipt of a request for modification from the department, the local government may recommend alternative sites to the department and shall give notice and hold a public hearing on the request for modification in the same manner as for a rezoning as provided under the appropriate special or local law or ordinance, except that such proceeding shall be recorded by tape or by a certified court reporter and made available for transcription at the expense of any interested party. (5) When the department requests such a modification and it is denied by the local government or there is no action on such request within 90 days of the request, the department may appeal the decision of the local government on the requested modification of local plans, ordinances, or regulations to the Governor and Cabinet. (6) The Governor and Cabinet shall consider the following when determining whether to grant the appeal from the decision of the local government on the requested modification: (a) The record of the proceedings before the local government. (b) Reports and studies by any other agency relating to matters within the jurisdiction of such agency which matters may be potentially affected by the proposed site. (c) Existing studies and reports and information maintained by the department as the Governor and Cabinet may request addressing the feasibility and availability of alternative sites in the general area. (7) The Governor and Cabinet, upon determining that the local government has recommended no feasible alternative site and that the interests of the state in providing correctional facilities outweigh the concerns of the local government, shall authorize construction and operation of a correctional facility on the proposed site notwithstanding any local plan, ordinance, or regulation. (8) Actions taken by the department or the Governor and Cabinet pursuant to this section shall not be subject to the provisions of ss. 120.56, 120.569, and 120.57. The decision by the Governor and Cabinet shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to s. 120.68 in the District Court of Appeal, First District. (9) Insofar as the provisions of this section are inconsistent with the provisions of any other law, general, special, or local, the provisions of this section are controlling.

Scientific evidence links the use of tobacco products with numerous significant health risks. The use of tobacco products by inmates, employees, or visitors is contrary to efforts by the Department of Corrections to reduce the cost of inmate health care and to limit unnecessary litigation. The Department of Corrections and the private vendors operating correctional facilities shall make smoking-cessation assistance available to inmates in order to implement this section. (2) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Department” means the Department of Corrections. (b) “Employee” means an employee of the department or a private vendor in a contractual relationship with the department, and includes persons such as contractors, volunteers, or law enforcement officers who are within a state correctional facility to perform a professional service. (c) “State correctional facility” means a state or privately operated correctional institution as defined in s. 944.02, or a correctional institution or facility operated under s. 944.105 or chapter 957. (d) “Tobacco products” means items such as cigars, cigarettes, snuff, loose tobacco, or similar goods made with any part of the tobacco plant, which are prepared or used for smoking, chewing, dipping, sniffing, or other personal use. (e) “Visitor” means any person other than an inmate or employee who is within a state correctional facility for a lawful purpose and includes, but is not limited to, persons who are authorized to visit state correctional institutions pursuant to s. 944.23 and persons authorized to visit as prescribed by departmental rule or vendor policy. (f) “Prohibited areas” means any indoor areas of any building, portable, or other enclosed structure within a state correctional facility. The secretary of the department may, by rule, designate other areas, including vehicles, as “prohibited areas” to be regulated under this section. Neither employee housing on the grounds of a state correctional facility nor maximum security inmate housing areas may be designated as prohibited areas under this section. (3)(a) An inmate within a state correctional facility may not use tobacco products in prohibited areas at any time while in the custody of the department or under the supervision of a private vendor operating a correctional facility. (b)1. An employee or visitor may not use any tobacco products in prohibited areas. 2. The warden or supervisor of a state correctional facility shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the tobacco prohibition for employees and visitors is strictly enforced. (4) An inmate who violates this section commits a disciplinary infraction and is subject to punishment determined to be appropriate by the disciplinary authority in the state correctional facility, including, but not limited to, forfeiture of gain-time or the right to earn gain-time in the future under s. 944.28. (5) The department may adopt rules and the private vendors operating correctional facilities may adopt policies and procedures for the implementation of this section, the designation of prohibited areas and smoking areas, and for the imposition of the following penalties: (a) Inmates who violate this section will be subject to disciplinary action as provided by rule and in accordance with this section. (b) Employees who violate this section will be subject to disciplinary action as provided by rule. (c) Visitors who violate this section will be subject to removal of authorization to enter a correctional facility as provided by rule.

Such persons shall be delivered to the custody of the department at such reception and classification centers as shall be provided for this purpose. (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), any prisoner incarcerated in the state correctional system or contractor-operated correctional facility operated pursuant to chapter 957 who is convicted in circuit or county court of a crime committed during that incarceration shall serve the sentence imposed for that crime within the state correctional system regardless of the length of sentence or classification of the offense. (c)1. When the highest ranking offense for which the prisoner is convicted is a felony, the trial court shall sentence the prisoner pursuant to the Criminal Punishment Code in chapter 921. 2.

The department shall adopt the uniform judgment and sentence forms as promulgated by the Supreme Court in Rule 3.986, Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure. (5) The department shall also refuse to accept a person into the state correctional system unless the following documents are presented in a completed form by the sheriff or chief correctional officer, or a designated representative, to the officer in charge of the reception process. The department may, at its discretion, receive such documents electronically: (a) The uniform commitment and judgment and sentence forms as described in subsection (4). (b) The sheriff’s certificate as described in s. 921.161. (c) A certified copy of the indictment or information relating to the offense for which the person was convicted. (d) A copy of the probable cause affidavit for each offense identified in the current indictment or information. (e) A copy of the Criminal Punishment Code scoresheet and any attachments thereto prepared pursuant to Rule 3.701, Rule 3.702, or Rule 3.703, Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure, or any other rule pertaining to the preparation of felony sentencing scoresheets. (f) A copy of the restitution order or the reasons by the court for not requiring restitution pursuant to s. 775.089(1). (g) The name and address of any victim, if available. (h) A printout of a current criminal history record as provided through an FCIC/NCIC printer. (i) Any available health assessments including medical, mental health, and dental, including laboratory or test findings; custody classification; disciplinary and adjustment; and substance abuse assessment and treatment information which may have been developed during the period of incarceration before the transfer of the person to the department’s custody. Available information shall be transmitted on standard forms developed by the department. In addition, the sheriff or other officer having such person in charge shall also deliver with the foregoing documents any available presentence investigation reports as described in s. 921.231 and any attached documents. After a prisoner is admitted into the state correctional system, the department may request such additional records relating to the prisoner as it considers necessary from the clerk of the court, the Department of Children and Families, or any other state or county agency for the purpose of determining the prisoner’s proper custody classification, gain-time eligibility, or eligibility for early release programs. An agency that receives such a request from the department must provide the information requested. The department may, at its discretion, receive such information electronically. (6) If a person is sentenced by a circuit court to serve a term of imprisonment concurrently with a term being served in another jurisdiction, the sheriff or chief correctional officer shall notify the department of the location at which such person is serving such term of imprisonment and shall forward to the department the documents described in subsection (5). (7) Pursuant to such regulations as it may provide, the department may transfer prisoners from one institution to another institution in the correctional system and classify and reclassify prisoners as circumstances may require. (8) If a state prisoner’s presence is required in court for any reason after the sheriff or chief correctional officer has relinquished custody to the department, the court shall issue an order for the sheriff or chief correctional officer to assume temporary custody and transport the prisoner to the county jail pending the court appearance. The sheriff or chief correctional officer, or a designated representative, shall present a copy of the order to appropriate officers at the facility housing the prisoner prior to assuming temporary custody of the prisoner. Neither the court nor the sheriff or chief correctional officer may release such prisoner without first obtaining confirmation from the department that the prisoner has no commitments from other jurisdictions or outstanding detainers. It is the responsibility of the clerk of the circuit court to provide the department’s central office with certified copies of each court action that affects a state commitment.

      "text": "944.1905 Initial inmate classification; inmate reclassification.—The Department of Corrections shall classify inmates pursuant to an objective classification scheme. The initial inmate classification questionnaire and the inmate reclassification questionnaire must cover both aggravating and mitigating factors. (1) In scoring either the initial inmate classification questionnaire or the inmate reclassification questionnaire, points must be added to the inmate’s overall score for factors indicating the inmate’s custody risk. Such factors may include: (a) The severity of the crime; (b) The length of the sentence; and (c) The verified history involving intentional violence. (2) In scoring the initial inmate classification questionnaire, points may be deducted from the inmate’s overall score for factors indicating the inmate’s stability. Such factors may include: (a) Age 30 or over; (b) High school diploma or high school equivalency diploma received; and (c) Full-time employment, full-time school attendance, or part-time employment and part-time school attendance for 6 months or longer at the time of arrest. (3) Points may be deducted from the inmate’s overall score on the inmate reclassification questionnaire for continuous positive behavior. Continuous positive behavior may include: (a) Lack of any major penalties for a specified period of time; (b) Completion of any correctional programs aimed at self-betterment, such as drug or alcohol counseling, vocational training, or academic programs; (c) Above-average behavior or progress on work squads outside the perimeter of the institution; or (d) Above-average behavior or progress in any employment inside the perimeter of the institution. (4) The department shall cross-validate the initial inmate classification questionnaire and the inmate reclassification questionnaire using custody score sheets from other states to determine the validity of the Florida model. If any items prove to be invalid, the department may revise either questionnaire as needed. (5)(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or chapter 958, the department shall assign to facilities housing youthful offenders all inmates who are less than 18 years of age and who have not been assigned to a facility for youthful offenders under the provisions of chapter 958. Such an inmate shall be assigned to a facility for youthful offenders until the inmate is 18 years of age; however, the department may assign the inmate to a facility for youthful offenders until the inmate reaches an age not to exceed 21 years if the department determines that the continued assignment is in the best interests of the inmate and the assignment does not pose an unreasonable risk to other inmates in the facility. (b) Any inmate who is assigned to a facility under paragraph (a) is subject to the provisions of s. 958.11 regarding facility assignments, and shall be removed and reassigned to the general inmate population if his or her behavior threatens the safety of other inmates or correctional staff.

      "text": "944.241 Incarcerated pregnant women.— (1) SHORT TITLE.—This section may be cited as the “Tammy Jackson Healthy Pregnancies for Incarcerated Women Act.” (2) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the term: (a) “Correctional institution” means any facility under the authority of the department or the Department of Juvenile Justice, a county or municipal detention facility, or a detention facility operated by a private entity. (b) “Corrections official” means the official who is responsible for oversight of a correctional institution or his or her designee. (c) “Department” means the Department of Corrections. (d) “Extraordinary circumstance” means a substantial flight risk or some other extraordinary medical or security circumstance that dictates restraints be used to ensure the safety and security of the prisoner, the staff of the correctional institution or medical facility, other prisoners, or the public. (e) “Invasive body search” means a search involving a manual inspection of the breasts or a manual inspection using touch, insertion, or probing of the cavities of the human body, including the genitals, buttocks, or anus. An invasive body search may only be conducted according to a correctional institution’s written rules, policies, or procedures as required by subsection (6). (f) “Labor” means the period of time before a birth during which contractions are of sufficient frequency, intensity, and duration to bring about effacement and progressive dilation of the cervix. (g) “Postpartum recovery” means, as determined by her physician, the period immediately following delivery, including the recovery period when a woman is in the hospital or infirmary following birth, up to 24 hours after delivery unless the physician after consultation with the department or correctional institution recommends a longer period of time. (h) “Pregnant prisoner” means any prisoner whose pregnancy is confirmed by or otherwise known to a qualified health care professional at the correctional institution. (i) “Prisoner” means any person incarcerated or detained in any correctional institution who is accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for a violation of criminal law or the terms and conditions of parole, probation, community control, pretrial release, or a diversionary program. For purposes of this section, the term includes any woman detained under the immigration laws of the United States at any correctional institution. (j) “Restraints” means any physical restraint or mechanical device used to control the movement of a prisoner’s body or limbs, including, but not limited to, flex cuffs, soft restraints, hard metal handcuffs, a black box, chubb cuffs, leg irons, belly chains, a security or tether chain, or a convex shield. (k) “Restrictive housing” means housing a prisoner separately from the general population of a correctional institution and imposing restrictions on her movement, behavior, and privileges. The term includes placing a prisoner in medical isolation, in a medical housing unit, or in the infirmary. (3) RESTRAINT OF PRISONERS.— (a) Restraints may not be used on a pregnant prisoner during labor, delivery, and postpartum recovery, unless the corrections official makes an individualized determination that the pregnant prisoner presents an extraordinary circumstance, except that: 1. The physician may request that restraints not be used for documentable medical purposes. The correctional officer, correctional institution employee, or other officer accompanying the pregnant prisoner may consult with the medical staff; however, if the officer determines there is an extraordinary public safety risk, the officer is authorized to apply restraints as limited by subparagraph 2. 2. Leg, ankle, or waist restraints may not be used on any pregnant prisoner who is in labor or delivery. (b) If restraints are used on a pregnant prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a): 1. The type of restraint applied and the application of the restraint must be done in the least restrictive manner necessary; and 2. The corrections official shall make written findings within 10 days after the use of restraints as to the extraordinary circumstance that dictated the use of the restraints. These findings shall be kept on file by the department or correctional institution for at least 5 years. (c) During the third trimester of pregnancy or when requested by the physician treating a pregnant prisoner, unless there are significant documentable security reasons noted by the department or correctional institution to the contrary that would threaten the safety of the prisoner, the unborn child, or the public in general: 1. Leg, ankle, and waist restraints may not be used; and 2. If wrist restraints are used, they must be applied in the front so the pregnant prisoner is able to protect herself in the event of a forward fall. (d) In addition to the specific requirements of paragraphs (a)-(c), any restraint of a pregnant prisoner must be done in the least restrictive manner necessary in order to mitigate the possibility of adverse clinical consequences. (4) RESTRICTIVE HOUSING.— (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) or paragraph (d), a pregnant prisoner may not be involuntarily placed in restrictive housing. (b) A pregnant prisoner may be involuntarily placed in restrictive housing if the corrections official of the correctional institution makes an individualized determination that restrictive housing is necessary to protect the health and safety of the pregnant prisoner or others or to preserve the security and order of the correctional institution and that there are no less restrictive means available. After placing a pregnant prisoner in restrictive housing under this paragraph, the corrections official must write a report stating: 1. The individualized reason restrictive housing is necessary. 2. The reason less restrictive means are not available. 3. Whether a qualified health care professional at the correctional institution objects to the placement. The corrections official must provide a copy of such report to the pregnant prisoner within 12 hours after placing the prisoner in restrictive housing. (c) A pregnant prisoner who is placed in restrictive housing under this section must be: 1. Seen by a qualified health care professional at least once every 24 hours. 2. Observed by a correctional officer at least once every hour. 3. Housed in the least restrictive setting consistent with the health and safety of the pregnant prisoner. 4. Given a medical treatment plan developed and approved by a qualified health care professional at the correctional institution if the pregnant prisoner does not already have such a treatment plan in place. (d)1. If a pregnant prisoner needs medical care, a primary care nurse practitioner or obstetrician must provide an order for the pregnant prisoner to be placed in a designated medical housing unit or admitted to the infirmary. 2. If a pregnant prisoner has passed her due date, she must be placed in a designated medical housing unit or admitted to the infirmary until labor begins. A pregnant prisoner who has been placed in a designated medical housing unit or admitted to the infirmary must be provided the same access to outdoor recreation, visitation, mail, telephone calls, and other privileges and classes available to the general population unless: a. The corrections official, after consulting with a qualified health care professional at the correctional institution, determines that such access poses a danger to the safety and security of the correctional institution; or b. A qualified health care professional at the correctional institution determines that such access poses a danger of adverse clinical consequences for the pregnant prisoner or others and documents such determination in the pregnant prisoner’s medical file. (5) ENFORCEMENT.— (a) Notwithstanding any relief or claims afforded by federal or state law, any prisoner who is restrained or placed in restrictive housing in violation of this section may file a grievance with the correctional institution and be granted a 45-day extension if requested in writing pursuant to rules promulgated by the correctional institution. (b) This section does not prevent a woman harmed through the use of restraints or by placement in restrictive housing under this section from filing a complaint under any other relevant provision of federal or state law. (6) RULES; NOTICE TO PRISONERS; LOCAL AND PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.— (a) The department and the Department of Juvenile Justice shall adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 to administer this section. (b) Each correctional institution shall inform female prisoners of the rules developed pursuant to paragraph (a) upon admission to the correctional institution, including the policies and practices in the prisoner handbook, and post the policies and practices in locations in the correctional institution where such notices are commonly posted and will be seen by female prisoners, including common housing areas and medical care facilities. (c) Each county or municipal detention facility and each detention facility operated by a private entity shall adopt written policies and procedures relating to the use of restraints and the performance of invasive body searches on pregnant prisoners.

      "text": "944.275 Gain-time.— (1) The department is authorized to grant deductions from sentences in the form of gain-time in order to encourage satisfactory prisoner behavior, to provide incentive for prisoners to participate in productive activities, and to reward prisoners who perform outstanding deeds or services. (2)(a) The department shall establish for each prisoner sentenced to a term of years a “maximum sentence expiration date,” which shall be the date when the sentence or combined sentences imposed on a prisoner will expire. In establishing this date, the department shall reduce the total time to be served by any time lawfully credited. (b) When a prisoner with an established maximum sentence expiration date is sentenced to an additional term or terms without having been released from custody, the department shall extend the maximum sentence expiration date by the length of time imposed in the new sentence or sentences, less lawful credits. (c) When an escaped prisoner or a parole violator is returned to the custody of the department, the maximum sentence expiration date in effect when the escape occurred or the parole was effective shall be extended by the amount of time the prisoner was not in custody plus the time imposed in any new sentence or sentences, but reduced by any lawful credits. (3)(a) The department shall also establish for each prisoner sentenced to a term of years a “tentative release date” which shall be the date projected for the prisoner’s release from custody by virtue of gain-time granted or forfeited as described in this section. The initial tentative release date shall be determined by deducting basic gain-time granted from the maximum sentence expiration date. Other gain-time shall be applied when granted or restored to make the tentative release date proportionately earlier; and forfeitures of gain-time, when ordered, shall be applied to make the tentative release date proportionately later. (b) When an initial tentative release date is reestablished because of additional sentences imposed before the prisoner has completely served all prior sentences, any gain-time granted during service of a prior sentence and not forfeited shall be applied. (c) The tentative release date may not be later than the maximum sentence expiration date. (4)(a) As a means of encouraging satisfactory behavior, the department shall grant basic gain-time at the rate of 10 days for each month of each sentence imposed on a prisoner, subject to the following: 1. Portions of any sentences to be served concurrently shall be treated as a single sentence when determining basic gain-time. 2. Basic gain-time for a partial month shall be prorated on the basis of a 30-day month. 3. When a prisoner receives a new maximum sentence expiration date because of additional sentences imposed, basic gain-time shall be granted for the amount of time the maximum sentence expiration date was extended. (b) For each month in which an inmate works diligently, participates in training, uses time constructively, or otherwise engages in positive activities, the department may grant incentive gain-time in accordance with this paragraph. The rate of incentive gain-time in effect on the date the inmate committed the offense which resulted in his or her incarceration shall be the inmate’s rate of eligibility to earn incentive gain-time throughout the period of incarceration and shall not be altered by a subsequent change in the severity level of the offense for which the inmate was sentenced. 1. For sentences imposed for offenses committed prior to January 1, 1994, up to 20 days of incentive gain-time may be granted. If granted, such gain-time shall be credited and applied monthly. 2. For sentences imposed for offenses committed on or after January 1, 1994, and before October 1, 1995: a. For offenses ranked in offense severity levels 1 through 7, under former s. 921.0012 or former s. 921.0013, up to 25 days of incentive gain-time may be granted. If granted, such gain-time shall be credited and applied monthly. b. For offenses ranked in offense severity levels 8, 9, and 10, under former s. 921.0012 or former s. 921.0013, up to 20 days of incentive gain-time may be granted. If granted, such gain-time shall be credited and applied monthly. 3. For sentences imposed for offenses committed on or after October 1, 1995, the department may grant up to 10 days per month of incentive gain-time. (c) An inmate who performs some outstanding deed, such as saving a life or assisting in recapturing an escaped inmate, or who in some manner performs an outstanding service that would merit the granting of additional deductions from the term of his or her sentence may be granted meritorious gain-time of from 1 to 60 days. (d) Notwithstanding the monthly maximum awards of incentive gain-time under subparagraphs (b)1., 2., and 3., the education program manager shall recommend, and the Department of Corrections may grant, a one-time award of 60 additional days of incentive gain-time to an inmate who is otherwise eligible and who successfully completes requirements for and is, or has been during the current commitment, awarded a high school equivalency diploma or vocational certificate. Under no circumstances may an inmate receive more than 60 days for educational attainment pursuant to this section. (e)1. Notwithstanding subparagraph (b)3., for sentences imposed for offenses committed on or after October 1, 2014, and before July 1, 2023, the department may not grant incentive gain-time if the offense is a violation of s. 782.04(1)(a)2.c.; s. 787.01(3)(a)2. or 3.; s. 787.02(3)(a)2. or 3.; s. 794.011, excluding s. 794.011(10); s. 800.04; s. 825.1025; or s. 847.0135(5). 2. Notwithstanding subparagraph (b)3., for sentences imposed for offenses committed on or after July 1, 2023, the department may not grant incentive gain-time if the offense is for committing or attempting, soliciting, or conspiring to commit a violation of s. 782.04(1)(a)2.c.; s. 787.01(3)(a)2. or 3.; s. 787.02(3)(a)2. or 3.; s. 794.011, excluding s. 794.011(10); s. 800.04; s. 825.1025; or s. 847.0135(5). (f) An inmate who is subject to subparagraph (b)3. is not eligible to earn or receive gain-time under paragraph (a), paragraph (b), paragraph (c), or paragraph (d) or any other type of gain-time in an amount that would cause a sentence to expire, end, or terminate, or that would result in a prisoner’s release, prior to serving a minimum of 85 percent of the sentence imposed. For purposes of this paragraph, credits awarded by the court for time physically incarcerated shall be credited toward satisfaction of 85 percent of the sentence imposed. Except as provided by this section, a prisoner may not accumulate further gain-time awards at any point when the tentative release date is the same as that date at which the prisoner will have served 85 percent of the sentence imposed. State prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment shall be incarcerated for the rest of their natural lives, unless granted pardon or clemency. (5) When a prisoner is found guilty of an infraction of the laws of this state or the rules of the department, gain-time may be forfeited according to law. (6)(a) Basic gain-time under this section shall be computed on and applied to all sentences imposed for offenses committed on or after July 1, 1978, and before January 1, 1994. (b) All incentive and meritorious gain-time is granted according to this section. (c) All additional gain-time previously awarded under former subsections (2) and (3) and all forfeitures ordered prior to the effective date of the act that created this section shall remain in effect and be applied in establishing an initial tentative release date. (7) The department shall adopt rules to implement the granting, forfeiture, restoration, and deletion of gain-time.

(b) Maintaining a healthy and productive corrections workforce with safe conditions free from the effects of substance abuse is important to correctional employers, employees, inmates, and the public. (c) Certain substance abuse testing standards are necessary to ensure uniform and economical application of policy throughout the state’s institutions and to protect both inmates and employers participating in random and reasonable suspicion substance abuse testing programs. (d) In balancing the interests of correctional employers, employees, inmates, and the public, it is in the best interest of all concerned to establish standards to ensure uniform, fair, economical, and accurate substance abuse testing in the state correctional system. (2) PURPOSES.—The purposes of the Drug-Free Corrections Act of 1992 are to: (a) Promote the goal of a drug-free correctional system through fair, economical, and reasonable methods of random and reasonable suspicion substance abuse testing of inmates for the protection of inmates, employees, employers, and the public. (b) Establish an aggressive, routine random substance abuse testing program and a reasonable suspicion substance abuse testing program to identify substance-abusing inmates, determine appropriate treatment, and provide a strong deterrent to future substance abuse.

The department shall also adopt rules relating to fair, economical, and accurate operations and procedures of a random inmate substance abuse testing program and a reasonable suspicion substance abuse testing program by urinalysis or other noninvasive procedure which enumerate penalties for positive test results, including but not limited to the forfeiture of both basic and incentive gain-time, and which do not limit the number of times an inmate may be tested in any one fiscal or calendar year. (2) SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT PROGRAMS.— (a) An inmate who meets the criteria established by the department shall participate in substance abuse program services when such services are available. A right to substance abuse program services is not stated, intended, or otherwise implied by this chapter. (b) Upon arrival at a department’s reception center for initial processing, each inmate shall be screened and assessed to determine if the inmate meets the department’s criteria for mandated participation in a substance-abuse program. Criteria for mandated substance abuse program services shall be based on: 1. The presence of a diagnosed psychoactive substance dependence or use disorder; 2. The severity of the addiction; 3. A history of criminal behavior related to substance abuse; 4. A recommendation by a sentencing authority for substance abuse program services; 5. Unsuccessful participation in community-based substance abuse services; 6. Sentencing by a drug court or drug division; and 7. Other classification or program criteria that the department finds will ensure security and optimal program placement. (c) When selecting contract providers to administer substance abuse treatment programs, the department shall make every effort to consider qualified faith-based service groups on an equal basis with other private organizations. (3) REPORTING REQUIREMENT.—The department shall, as part of its annual report, report the number of random and reasonable suspicion substance abuse tests administered in the fiscal year, the number of positive results obtained, the number of negative results obtained, the number of inmates requesting and participating in substance abuse treatment programs as the result of a positive random or reasonable suspicion substance abuse test, and the number of repeat substance abuse offenders.

      "text": "944.4731 Addiction-Recovery Supervision Program.— (1) This section may be cited as the “Addiction-Recovery Supervision Program Act.” (2)(a) Any offender released from a state correctional facility who is convicted of a crime committed on or after July 1, 2001, must be given addiction-recovery supervision if the offender has: 1. A history of substance abuse or addiction; 2. Participated in any drug treatment; 3. No current or previous convictions for a violent offense; 4. No current or previous convictions for drug trafficking or for the unlawful sale of a controlled substance; 5. No current or previous convictions for a property offense, except for a conviction for: a. Passing worthless checks, forgery, uttering, or counterfeiting; b. Third degree felony grand theft, excluding a theft relating to firearms; or c. Third degree felony burglary of an unoccupied structure or conveyance; and 6. No current or previous conviction for a traffic offense involving injury or death. (b) An offender released under addiction-recovery supervision shall be subject to specified terms and conditions, including payment of the costs of supervision under s. 948.09 and any other court-ordered payments, such as child support and restitution. If an offender has received a term of probation or community control to be served after release from incarceration, the period of probation or community control may not be substituted for addiction-recovery supervision and shall follow the term of addiction-recovery supervision. A panel of not fewer than two commissioners shall establish the terms and conditions of supervision, and the terms and conditions must be included in the supervision order. In setting the terms and conditions of supervision, the commission shall weigh heavily the program requirements, including, but not limited to, work at paid employment while participating in treatment and traveling restrictions. The commission shall also determine whether an offender violates the terms and conditions of supervision and whether a violation warrants revocation of addiction-recovery supervision pursuant to s. 947.141. The commission shall review the offender’s record for the purpose of establishing the terms and conditions of supervision. The commission may impose any special conditions it considers warranted from its review of the record. The length of supervision may not exceed the maximum penalty imposed by the court. (c) The Legislature finds that offenders released from state prison into the community who meet the criteria for participating in the addiction-recovery supervision program possess the greatest potential for successful substance abuse recovery through treatment and transition assistance. (3)(a) Each fiscal year, and contingent upon funding, the department shall enter into contracts with multiple providers who are private organizations, including faith-based service groups, to operate substance abuse transition housing programs, including providers that: 1. Provide postrelease housing, programming, treatment, and other transitional services; 2. Emphasize job placement and gainful employment for program participants; 3. Provide a curriculum related to substance abuse treatment which uses a cognitive behavior model or 12-step model of addiction recovery; 4. Provide for a length of stay of not more than 12 months; and 5. Use community volunteers in operating the program to the greatest extent possible. (b) The department shall allow providers to use innovative approaches to treatment and shall authorize a high level of flexibility in operating a program. The department shall ensure that an offender’s faith orientation, or lack thereof, will not be considered in determining admission to a faith-based program and that the program does not attempt to convert an offender toward a particular faith or religious preference. (4) When facilitating job placement for an offender under this program, the provider shall make every effort to secure suitable employment that provides adequate wages, a potential for advancement, and a likelihood of stable and long-term employment. To measure the success of postrelease job placement, the department shall, as part of its annual report, track for 1 year offenders who successfully complete the program and shall determine their employment status. (5) Each contract entered into under this section for operating a substance abuse transition housing program must invite innovation, minimize bureaucracy, and permit the private organization or faith-based provider to petition the department to waive any rule, policy, or procedure that is inconsistent with the mission of the private organization or faith-based provider. (6) Six months before an offender is released, the chaplain and transition assistance specialist at the institution where the offender is incarcerated shall initiate the prerelease screening process in addition to the basic release orientation required under s. 944.705. (a) The transition assistance specialist and the chaplain shall provide a list of contracted private providers, including faith-based providers, to the offender and facilitate the application process. The transition assistance specialist shall inform the offender of program availability and assess the offender’s need and suitability for substance abuse transition housing assistance. If an offender is approved for placement, the specialist shall assist the offender and coordinate the release of the offender with the selected program. If an offender requests and is approved for placement in a contracted faith-based substance abuse transition housing program, the specialist must consult with the chaplain prior to such placement. A right to substance abuse program services is not stated, intended, or otherwise implied by this section. (b) If an offender has participated in a faith-based program while incarcerated or housed at a community correctional center and the same or a similar faith-based provider offers a contracted substance abuse transition housing program, the department shall make every attempt to maintain this continuum of care. (7) While participating in a substance abuse transition housing program, an offender shall: (a) Adhere to all conditions of supervision enforced by the commission and the program provider. Failure to comply with such rules or conditions may result in revocation of supervision pursuant to s. 947.141. (b) Pay fees to defray program costs, costs of supervision required under s. 948.09, and any restitution or obligations for child support. (c) Participate in a cognitive behavior model or 12-step model of recovery. (8) The commission may adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 as necessary for administering this section.

If a contractor-operated correctional facility makes the digitized photograph, this photograph shall be provided to the Department of Corrections. Additionally, the digitized photograph, whether made by the Department of Corrections or a contractor-operated correctional facility, shall be placed in the inmate’s file. The Department of Corrections shall make the digitized photograph available electronically to the Department of Law Enforcement as soon as the digitized photograph is in the department’s database and must be in a format that is compatible with the requirements of the Florida Crime Information Center. The department shall provide a copy of the digitized photograph to a local law enforcement agency upon request. (3)(a) If an inmate is to be released after having served one or more sentences for a conviction of robbery, sexual battery, home-invasion robbery, or carjacking, or an inmate to be released has a prior conviction for robbery, sexual battery, home-invasion robbery, or carjacking or similar offense, in this state or in another jurisdiction, and if such prior conviction information is contained in department records, the department shall release to the sheriff of the county in which the inmate plans to reside, and, if the inmate plans to reside within a municipality, to the chief of police of that municipality, the following information, which must include, but need not be limited to: 1.

(b) The department may electronically submit the information listed in paragraph (a) to the sheriff of the county in which the inmate plans to reside, and, if the inmate plans to reside within a municipality, to the chief of police of that municipality. (4) An inmate who refuses to submit to the taking of a digitized photograph commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. (5) The department shall, at least 10 days before the anticipated date of release on work release of an inmate, notify in writing the county law enforcement agency in the county in this state in which the inmate is scheduled to be released. (6) Upon request of the victim, the personal representative of the victim, or the state attorney, the department shall notify the requesting person when an inmate has been approved for community work release within 30 days after the date of approval. (7)(a) The department, working in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, shall provide every Florida-born inmate with a certified copy of his or her birth certificate and a state identification card before the inmate’s release upon expiration of his or her sentence. A replacement driver license shall be provided in lieu of a state identification card when an inmate has a valid state driver license issued by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles which was lost, stolen, or destroyed. (b) Paragraph (a) does not apply to inmates who: 1. The department determines have a valid driver license or state identification card, except that the department shall provide these inmates with a replacement state identification card or replacement driver license, if necessary. 2. Have an active detainer, unless the department determines that cancellation of the detainer is likely or that the incarceration for which the detainer was issued will be less than 12 months in duration. 3. Are released due to an emergency release or a conditional medical release under s. 947.149. 4. Are not in the physical custody of the department at or within 180 days before release. 5.

(c) The department shall assist each inmate in applying for and obtaining a social security card before release if the inmate needs a social security card. (d) The department, for purposes of assisting the inmate in obtaining a birth certificate, shall submit to the Department of Health on all Florida-born inmates in its custody, the department’s inmate photo or digitized photo, and as provided by the inmate his or her date of birth, full name at birth and any subsequent legal name changes, city or county of birth, mother’s full name including her maiden surname, and father’s full name. (e) For inmates born outside of this state, the department shall assist the inmate in completing the necessary forms or applications to obtain a social security card, driver license, or state identification card. The department shall also provide the inmate with the location and address of the appropriate licensing authority the inmate will need to obtain a valid identification card in proximity to the inmate’s release address.

      "text": "944.606 Sexual offenders; notification upon release.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Convicted” means there has been a determination of guilt as a result of a trial or the entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, regardless of whether adjudication is withheld. A conviction for a similar offense includes, but is not limited to, a conviction by a federal or military tribunal, including courts-martial conducted by the Armed Forces of the United States, and includes a conviction or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere resulting in a sanction in any state of the United States or other jurisdiction. A sanction includes, but is not limited to, a fine; probation; community control; parole; conditional release; control release; or incarceration in a state prison, federal prison, contractor-operated correctional facility, or local detention facility. (b) “Electronic mail address” has the same meaning as provided in s. 668.602. (c) “Internet identifier” has the same meaning as provided in s. 775.21. (d) “Permanent residence,” “temporary residence,” and “transient residence” have the same meaning as provided in s. 775.21. (e) “Professional license” has the same meaning as provided in s. 775.21. (f) “Sexual offender” means a person who has been convicted of committing, or attempting, soliciting, or conspiring to commit, any of the criminal offenses proscribed in the following statutes in this state or similar offenses in another jurisdiction: s. 393.135(2); s. 394.4593(2); s. 787.01, s. 787.02, or s. 787.025(2)(c), where the victim is a minor; s. 787.06(3)(b), (d), (f), or (g), or (5); former s. 787.06(3)(h); s. 794.011, excluding s. 794.011(10); s. 794.05; former s. 796.03; former s. 796.035; s. 800.04; s. 810.145(8); s. 825.1025; s. 827.071; s. 847.0133; s. 847.0135, excluding s. 847.0135(6); s. 847.0137; s. 847.0138; s. 847.0145; s. 895.03, if the court makes a written finding that the racketeering activity involved at least one sexual offense listed in this paragraph or at least one offense listed in this paragraph with sexual intent or motive; s. 916.1075(2); or s. 985.701(1); or any similar offense committed in this state which has been redesignated from a former statute number to one of those listed in this subsection, when the department has received verified information regarding such conviction; an offender’s computerized criminal history record is not, in and of itself, verified information. (2) The Legislature finds that sexual offenders, especially those who have committed their offenses against minors, often pose a high risk of engaging in sexual offenses even after being released from incarceration or commitment and that protection of the public from sexual offenders is a paramount governmental interest. Sexual offenders have a reduced expectation of privacy because of the public’s interest in public safety and in the effective operation of government. Releasing sexual offender information to law enforcement agencies and to persons who request such information, and releasing such information to the public by a law enforcement agency or public agency, will further the governmental interests of public safety. (3)(a) The department shall provide information regarding any sexual offender who is being released after serving a period of incarceration for any offense, as follows: 1. The department shall provide: the sexual offender’s name, any change in the offender’s name by reason of marriage or other legal process, and any alias, if known; the correctional facility from which the sexual offender is released; the sexual offender’s social security number, race, sex, date of birth, height, weight, and hair and eye color; tattoos or other identifying marks; address of any planned permanent residence or temporary residence, within the state or out of state, including a rural route address and a post office box; if no permanent or temporary address, any transient residence within the state; address, location or description, and dates of any known future temporary residence within the state or out of state; date and county of sentence and each crime for which the offender was sentenced; a copy of the offender’s fingerprints, palm prints, and a digitized photograph taken within 60 days before release; the date of release of the sexual offender; all electronic mail addresses and all Internet identifiers required to be provided pursuant to s. 943.0435(4)(e); employment information, if known, provided pursuant to s. 943.0435(4)(e); all home telephone numbers and cellular telephone numbers required to be provided pursuant to s. 943.0435(4)(e); information about any professional licenses the offender has, if known; and passport information, if he or she has a passport, and, if he or she is an alien, information about documents establishing his or her immigration status. The department shall notify the Department of Law Enforcement if the sexual offender escapes, absconds, or dies. If the sexual offender is in the custody of a contractor-operated correctional facility, the facility shall take the digitized photograph of the sexual offender within 60 days before the sexual offender’s release and provide this photograph to the Department of Corrections and also place it in the sexual offender’s file. If the sexual offender is in the custody of a local jail, the custodian of the local jail shall register the offender within 3 business days after intake of the offender for any reason and upon release, and shall notify the Department of Law Enforcement of the sexual offender’s release and provide to the Department of Law Enforcement the information specified in this paragraph and any information specified in subparagraph 2. that the Department of Law Enforcement requests. 2. The department may provide any other information deemed necessary, including criminal and corrections records, nonprivileged personnel and treatment records, when available. (b) The department must provide the information described in subparagraph (a)1. to: 1. The sheriff of the county from where the sexual offender was sentenced; 2. The sheriff of the county and, if applicable, the police chief of the municipality, where the sexual offender plans to reside; 3. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement; 4. When requested, the victim of the offense, the victim’s parent or legal guardian if the victim is a minor, the lawful representative of the victim or of the victim’s parent or guardian if the victim is a minor, or the next of kin if the victim is a homicide victim; and 5. Any person who requests such information, either within 6 months prior to the anticipated release of a sexual offender, or as soon as possible if an offender is released earlier than anticipated. All such information provided to the Department of Law Enforcement must be available electronically as soon as the information is in the agency’s database and must be in a format that is compatible with the requirements of the Florida Crime Information Center. (c) Upon request, the department must provide the information described in subparagraph (a)2. to: 1. The sheriff of the county from where the sexual offender was sentenced; and 2. The sheriff of the county and, if applicable, the police chief of the municipality, where the sexual offender plans to reside, either within 6 months prior to the anticipated release of a sexual offender, or as soon as possible if an offender is released earlier than anticipated. (d) Upon receiving information regarding a sexual offender from the department, the Department of Law Enforcement, the sheriff or the chief of police shall provide the information described in subparagraph (a)1. to any individual who requests such information and may release the information to the public in any manner deemed appropriate, unless the information so received is confidential or exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. (4) This section authorizes the department or any law enforcement agency to notify the community and the public of a sexual offender’s presence in the community. However, with respect to a sexual offender who has been found to be a “sexual predator” under chapter 775, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement or any other law enforcement agency must inform the community and the public of the sexual predator’s presence in the community, as provided in chapter 775. (5) An elected or appointed official, public employee, school administrator or employee, or agency, or any individual or entity acting at the request or upon the direction of any law enforcement agency, is immune from civil liability for damages resulting from the release of information under this section.

      "text": "944.609 Career offenders; notification upon release.— (1) As used in this section, the term “career offender” means a person who is in the custody or control of, or under the supervision of, the department or is in the custody or control of, or under the supervision of a contractor-operated correctional facility, who is designated as a habitual violent felony offender, a violent career criminal, or a three-time violent felony offender under s. 775.084 or as a prison releasee reoffender under s. 775.082(9). (2) The Legislature finds that certain career offenders, by virtue of their histories of offenses, present a threat to the public and to communities. The Legislature finds that requiring these career offenders to register for the purpose of tracking the career offenders and providing for notifying the public and a community of the presence of a career offender are important aids to law enforcement agencies, the public, and communities if the career offender engages again in criminal conduct. Registration is intended to aid law enforcement agencies in timely apprehending a career offender. Registration is not a punishment, but merely a status. Notification to the public and communities of the presence of a career offender aids the public and communities in avoiding being victimized by the career offender. The Legislature intends to require the registration of career offenders and to authorize law enforcement agencies to notify the public and communities of the presence of a career offender. (3)(a) The department must provide information regarding any career offender who is being released after serving a period of incarceration for any offense, as follows: 1. The department must provide the career offender’s name, any change in the career offender’s name by reason of marriage or other legal process, and any alias, if known; the correctional facility from which the career offender is released; the career offender’s social security number, race, gender, date of birth, height, weight, and hair and eye color; date and county of sentence and each crime for which the career offender was sentenced; a copy of the career offender’s fingerprints and a digitized photograph taken within 60 days before release; the date of release of the career offender; and the career offender’s intended residence address, if known. The department shall notify the Department of Law Enforcement if the career offender escapes, absconds, or dies. If the career offender is in the custody of a contractor-operated correctional facility, the facility shall take the digitized photograph of the career offender within 60 days before the career offender’s release and provide this photograph to the Department of Corrections and also place it in the career offender’s file.

The department may provide any other information deemed necessary, including criminal and corrections records and nonprivileged personnel and treatment records, when available. (b) The department must provide the information described in subparagraph (a)1. to: 1. The sheriff of the county where the career offender was sentenced; 2. The sheriff of the county and, if applicable, the police chief of the municipality, where the career offender plans to reside; 3. The Department of Law Enforcement; 4. When requested, the victim of the offense, the victim’s parent or legal guardian if the victim is a minor, the lawful representative of the victim or of the victim’s parent or guardian if the victim is a minor, or the next of kin if the victim is a homicide victim; and 5. Any person who requests such information, within 6 months prior to the anticipated release of a career offender or as soon as possible if a career offender is released earlier than anticipated.

(d) Upon receiving information regarding a career offender from the department, the Department of Law Enforcement, the sheriff, or the chief of police shall provide the information described in subparagraph (a)1. to any individual who requests such information and may release the information to the public in any manner deemed appropriate, unless the information is confidential or exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. (4) The department or any law enforcement agency may notify the community and the public of a career offender’s presence in the community. However, with respect to a career offender who has been found to be a sexual predator under s. 775.21, the Department of Law Enforcement or any other law enforcement agency must inform the community and the public of the career offender’s presence in the community, as provided in s. 775.21. (5) An elected or appointed official, public employee, school administrator or employee, or agency, or any individual or entity acting at the request or upon the direction of any law enforcement agency, is immune from civil liability for damages resulting from the good faith compliance with the requirements of this section or the release of information under this section.

      "text": "944.801 Education for state prisoners.— (1) There is hereby established under the Department of Corrections a Correctional Education Program which shall be composed of the educational facilities and services of all institutions and facilities housing inmates operated by the Department of Corrections and shall be supervised by the Department of Corrections. (2) The Department of Corrections is vested with the authority and responsibility to manage and operate the Correctional Education Program as provided by law. (3) The responsibilities of the Correctional Education Program shall be to: (a) Develop guidelines for collecting education-related information during the inmate reception process and for disseminating such information to the classification staff of the Department of Corrections. The information collected shall include the inmate’s areas of educational or vocational interest, vocational skills, and level of education. (b) Monitor and assess all inmate education program services and report the results of such evaluation in the annual report of activities. (c) Develop complete and reliable statistics on the educational histories, the city/intracity area and school district where the inmate was domiciled prior to incarceration, the participation in state educational and training programs, and the occupations of inmates confined to state correctional facilities. The compiled statistics shall be summarized and analyzed in the annual report of correctional educational activities required by paragraph (f). (d) Approve educational programs of the appropriate levels and types in the correctional institutions and develop procedures for the admission of inmate students thereto. (e) Enter into agreements with public or private school districts, entities, community colleges, junior colleges, colleges, or universities as may be deemed appropriate for the purpose of carrying out its duties and responsibilities and ensure that agreements require minimum performance standards and standards for measurable objectives, in accordance with established Department of Education standards. (f) Report annual activities to the Secretary of Corrections. (g) Develop and maintain complete and reliable statistics on the number of high school equivalency diplomas and vocational certificates issued by each institution in each skill area, the change in inmate literacy levels, and the number of inmate admissions to and withdrawals from education courses. The compiled statistics shall be summarized and analyzed in the annual report of correctional education activities required by paragraph (f). (h) Develop a written procedure for selecting programs to add to or delete from the vocational curriculum. The procedure shall include labor market analyses that demonstrate the projected demand for certain occupations and the projected supply of potential employees. In conducting these analyses, the department shall evaluate the feasibility of adding vocational education programs that have been identified by the Department of Commerce, the Department of Education, or a regional coordinating council as being in undersupply in this state. The department shall periodically reevaluate the vocational education programs in major institutions to determine which of the programs support and provide relevant skills to inmates who could be assigned to a correctional work program that is operated as a Prison Industry Enhancement Program. (i) Ensure that every inmate who has 2 years or more remaining to serve on his or her sentence at the time that he or she is received at an institution and who lacks basic and functional literacy skills as defined in s. 1004.02 attends not fewer than 150 hours of sequential instruction in a correctional adult basic education program. The basic and functional literacy level of an inmate shall be determined by the average composite test score obtained on a test approved for this purpose by the State Board of Education. 1. Upon completion of the 150 hours of instruction, the inmate shall be retested and, if a composite test score of functional literacy is not attained, the department is authorized to require the inmate to remain in the instructional program. 2. Highest priority of inmate participation shall be focused on youthful offenders and those inmates nearing release from the correctional system. 3. An inmate shall be required to attend the 150 hours of adult basic education instruction unless such inmate: a. Is serving a life sentence or is under sentence of death. b. Is specifically exempted for security or health reasons. c. Is housed at a community correctional center, road prison, work camp, or vocational center. d. Attains a functional literacy level after attendance in fewer than 150 hours of adult basic education instruction. e. Is unable to enter such instruction because of insufficient facilities, staff, or classroom capacity. 4. The Department of Corrections shall provide classes to accommodate those inmates assigned to correctional or public work programs after normal working hours. The department shall develop a plan to provide academic and vocational classes on a more frequent basis and at times that accommodate the increasing number of inmates with work assignments, to the extent that resources permit. 5. If an inmate attends and actively participates in the 150 hours of instruction, the Department of Corrections may grant a one-time award of up to 6 additional days of incentive gain-time, which must be credited and applied as provided by law. Active participation means, at a minimum, that the inmate is attentive, responsive, cooperative, and completes assigned work. (j) Recommend the award of additional incentive gain-time for inmates who receive a high school equivalency diploma or a vocational certificate. (k) Ensure that all education staff are certified in accordance with the Department of Education standards. (l) Develop goals and objectives relating to all phases of the correctional education program. (m) Design and implement a plan, in coordination with the relevant professional boards regulated by the Department of Business and Professional Regulation, or the Department of Business and Professional Regulation when there is no board, to ensure that inmates in a correctional institution who take classes that meet the necessary curriculum requirements as determined by the applicable laws and rules for those professions shall receive credit toward licensure requirements for the successful completion of those classes. (4) The department may expand the use of job assignment credentialing and industry certifications. (5) The Correctional Education Program may establish a prison entrepreneurship program and adopt procedures for admitting student inmates. If the department elects to develop the program, it must include at least 180 days of in-prison education. The program curriculum must include a component on developing a business plan, procedures for graduation and certification of successful student inmates, and at least 90 days of transitional and postrelease continuing educational services. Transitional and postrelease continuing educational services may be offered to graduate student inmates on a voluntary basis and are not a requirement for completion of the program. The department shall enter into agreements with public or private colleges or universities, other nonprofit entities, or other authorized providers under s. 1002.45(1)(a)1. to implement the program. The program must be funded with existing resources. (6) The Correctional Education Program may work in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Florida Forestry Service Division, and the Florida Department of Financial Services, Division of State Fire Marshal to develop a program for implementation within state correctional institutions or correctional facilities to train and certify inmates as firefighters. The program should include, but not be limited to, certification of inmates as state forest staff trained to help protect homes, forestland, and natural resources from the effects of wildfires throughout the state. (7) The department may contract with a district school board, the Florida Virtual School, a charter school authorized to operate under s. 1002.33, or a Florida College System institution to provide education services in the Correctional Education Program. The education services may include any educational, career, or vocational training authorized by the department. (8) Minors who are adjudicated as adults and who are in the custody or under the supervision of the Department of Corrections may receive and participate in educational services provided within the department without the parental consent of the minors. (9) Notwithstanding s. 120.81(3), all inmates under 22 years of age who qualify for special educational services and programs pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. ss. 1400 et seq., and who request a due process hearing as provided by that act shall be entitled to such hearing before the Division of Administrative Hearings. Administrative law judges shall not be required to travel to state or contractor-operated correctional institutions and facilities in order to conduct these hearings.

(2) It is the intent of the Legislature that the department expand the faith- and character-based initiative through the use of faith- and character-based institutions. The department is encouraged to phase out the faith-based and self improvement dormitory programs and move toward the goal of only implementing faith- and character-based institutions. The department is also encouraged to dedicate and maintain faith- and character-based institutions that serve both male and female inmates at their respective institutions. (3) It is the intent of the Legislature that the department and the private vendors operating contractor-operated correctional facilities continuously: (a) Measure recidivism rates for inmates who have participated in faith- and character-based programs. (b) Increase the number of volunteers who minister to inmates from various faith-based and secular institutions in the community. (c) Develop community linkages with secular institutions as well as churches, synagogues, mosques, and other faith-based institutions to assist inmates in their release back into the community. (4)(a) The department shall ensure that an inmate’s faith orientation, or lack thereof, will not be considered in determining admission to a faith- and character-based program and that the program does not attempt to convert an inmate toward a particular faith or religious preference. (b) The programs shall operate 24 hours a day within the existing correctional facilities and must emphasize the importance of personal responsibility, meaningful work, education, substance abuse treatment, and peer support. (c) Participation in a program shall be voluntary. Assignment to a program shall be based on evaluation and the length of time the inmate is projected to be assigned to that particular institution. The department may not remove an inmate once assigned to a program except for the purposes of population management, for inmate conduct that may subject the inmate to disciplinary confinement or loss of gain-time, for physical or mental health concerns, or for security or safety concerns. (5) The department shall ensure that any faith component of any program authorized in this chapter is offered on a voluntary basis and an offender’s faith orientation, or lack thereof, will not be considered in determining admission to such a program and that the program does not attempt to convert an offender toward a particular faith or religious preference. (6) Within faith- and character-based institutions of the state correctional system, peer-to-peer programming shall be offered, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, literacy instruction, and other activities. (7) The department shall ensure that state funds are not expended for the purpose of furthering religious indoctrination, but rather, that state funds are expended for purposes of furthering the secular goals of criminal rehabilitation, the successful reintegration of offenders into the community, and the reduction of recidivism.

      "text": "944.275 Gain-time.— (1) The department is authorized to grant deductions from sentences in the form of gain-time in order to encourage satisfactory prisoner behavior, to provide incentive for prisoners to participate in productive activities, and to reward prisoners who perform outstanding deeds or services. (2)(a) The department shall establish for each prisoner sentenced to a term of years a “maximum sentence expiration date,” which shall be the date when the sentence or combined sentences imposed on a prisoner will expire. In establishing this date, the department shall reduce the total time to be served by any time lawfully credited. (b) When a prisoner with an established maximum sentence expiration date is sentenced to an additional term or terms without having been released from custody, the department shall extend the maximum sentence expiration date by the length of time imposed in the new sentence or sentences, less lawful credits. (c) When an escaped prisoner or a parole violator is returned to the custody of the department, the maximum sentence expiration date in effect when the escape occurred or the parole was effective shall be extended by the amount of time the prisoner was not in custody plus the time imposed in any new sentence or sentences, but reduced by any lawful credits. (3)(a) The department shall also establish for each prisoner sentenced to a term of years a “tentative release date” which shall be the date projected for the prisoner’s release from custody by virtue of gain-time granted or forfeited as described in this section. The initial tentative release date shall be determined by deducting basic gain-time granted from the maximum sentence expiration date. Other gain-time shall be applied when granted or restored to make the tentative release date proportionately earlier; and forfeitures of gain-time, when ordered, shall be applied to make the tentative release date proportionately later. (b) When an initial tentative release date is reestablished because of additional sentences imposed before the prisoner has completely served all prior sentences, any gain-time granted during service of a prior sentence and not forfeited shall be applied. (c) The tentative release date may not be later than the maximum sentence expiration date. (4)(a) As a means of encouraging satisfactory behavior, the department shall grant basic gain-time at the rate of 10 days for each month of each sentence imposed on a prisoner, subject to the following: 1. Portions of any sentences to be served concurrently shall be treated as a single sentence when determining basic gain-time. 2. Basic gain-time for a partial month shall be prorated on the basis of a 30-day month. 3. When a prisoner receives a new maximum sentence expiration date because of additional sentences imposed, basic gain-time shall be granted for the amount of time the maximum sentence expiration date was extended. (b) For each month in which an inmate works diligently, participates in training, uses time constructively, or otherwise engages in positive activities, the department may grant incentive gain-time in accordance with this paragraph. The rate of incentive gain-time in effect on the date the inmate committed the offense which resulted in his or her incarceration shall be the inmate’s rate of eligibility to earn incentive gain-time throughout the period of incarceration and shall not be altered by a subsequent change in the severity level of the offense for which the inmate was sentenced. 1. For sentences imposed for offenses committed prior to January 1, 1994, up to 20 days of incentive gain-time may be granted. If granted, such gain-time shall be credited and applied monthly. 2. For sentences imposed for offenses committed on or after January 1, 1994, and before October 1, 1995: a. For offenses ranked in offense severity levels 1 through 7, under former s. 921.0012 or former s. 921.0013, up to 25 days of incentive gain-time may be granted. If granted, such gain-time shall be credited and applied monthly. b. For offenses ranked in offense severity levels 8, 9, and 10, under former s. 921.0012 or former s. 921.0013, up to 20 days of incentive gain-time may be granted. If granted, such gain-time shall be credited and applied monthly. 3. For sentences imposed for offenses committed on or after October 1, 1995, the department may grant up to 10 days per month of incentive gain-time. (c) An inmate who performs some outstanding deed, such as saving a life or assisting in recapturing an escaped inmate, or who in some manner performs an outstanding service that would merit the granting of additional deductions from the term of his or her sentence may be granted meritorious gain-time of from 1 to 60 days. (d) Notwithstanding the monthly maximum awards of incentive gain-time under subparagraphs (b)1., 2., and 3., the education program manager shall recommend, and the Department of Corrections may grant, a one-time award of 60 additional days of incentive gain-time to an inmate who is otherwise eligible and who successfully completes requirements for and is, or has been during the current commitment, awarded a high school equivalency diploma or vocational certificate. Under no circumstances may an inmate receive more than 60 days for educational attainment pursuant to this section. (e)1. Notwithstanding subparagraph (b)3., for sentences imposed for offenses committed on or after October 1, 2014, and before July 1, 2023, the department may not grant incentive gain-time if the offense is a violation of s. 782.04(1)(a)2.c.; s. 787.01(3)(a)2. or 3.; s. 787.02(3)(a)2. or 3.; s. 794.011, excluding s. 794.011(10); s. 800.04; s. 825.1025; or s. 847.0135(5). 2. Notwithstanding subparagraph (b)3., for sentences imposed for offenses committed on or after July 1, 2023, the department may not grant incentive gain-time if the offense is for committing or attempting, soliciting, or conspiring to commit a violation of s. 782.04(1)(a)2.c.; s. 787.01(3)(a)2. or 3.; s. 787.02(3)(a)2. or 3.; s. 794.011, excluding s. 794.011(10); s. 800.04; s. 825.1025; or s. 847.0135(5). (f) An inmate who is subject to subparagraph (b)3. is not eligible to earn or receive gain-time under paragraph (a), paragraph (b), paragraph (c), or paragraph (d) or any other type of gain-time in an amount that would cause a sentence to expire, end, or terminate, or that would result in a prisoner’s release, prior to serving a minimum of 85 percent of the sentence imposed. For purposes of this paragraph, credits awarded by the court for time physically incarcerated shall be credited toward satisfaction of 85 percent of the sentence imposed. Except as provided by this section, a prisoner may not accumulate further gain-time awards at any point when the tentative release date is the same as that date at which the prisoner will have served 85 percent of the sentence imposed. State prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment shall be incarcerated for the rest of their natural lives, unless granted pardon or clemency. (5) When a prisoner is found guilty of an infraction of the laws of this state or the rules of the department, gain-time may be forfeited according to law. (6)(a) Basic gain-time under this section shall be computed on and applied to all sentences imposed for offenses committed on or after July 1, 1978, and before January 1, 1994. (b) All incentive and meritorious gain-time is granted according to this section. (c) All additional gain-time previously awarded under former subsections (2) and (3) and all forfeitures ordered prior to the effective date of the act that created this section shall remain in effect and be applied in establishing an initial tentative release date. (7) The department shall adopt rules to implement the granting, forfeiture, restoration, and deletion of gain-time.
