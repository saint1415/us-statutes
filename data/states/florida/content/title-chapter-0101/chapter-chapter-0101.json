Once voted, the provisional ballot must be placed in a secrecy envelope and thereafter sealed in a provisional ballot envelope. The provisional ballot must be deposited in a ballot box. All provisional ballots must remain sealed in their envelopes for return to the supervisor of elections. The department shall prescribe the form of the provisional ballot envelope. A person casting a provisional ballot has the right to present written evidence supporting his or her eligibility to vote to the supervisor of elections by not later than 5 p.m. on the second day following the election. (2)(a) The county canvassing board shall examine each Provisional Ballot Voter’s Certificate and Affirmation to determine if the person voting that ballot was entitled to vote at the precinct where the person cast a vote in the election and that the person had not already cast a ballot in the election. In determining whether a person casting a provisional ballot is entitled to vote, the county canvassing board shall review the information provided in the Voter’s Certificate and Affirmation, written evidence provided by the person pursuant to subsection (1), information provided in any cure affidavit and accompanying supporting documentation pursuant to subsection (6), any other evidence presented by the supervisor, and, in the case of a challenge, any evidence presented by the challenger. A ballot of a person casting a provisional ballot shall be canvassed pursuant to paragraph (b) unless the canvassing board determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the person was not entitled to vote. (b) If it is determined that the person was registered and entitled to vote at the precinct where the person cast a vote in the election, the canvassing board must compare the signature on the Provisional Ballot Voter’s Certificate and Affirmation or the provisional ballot cure affidavit with the signature on the voter’s registration or precinct register. A provisional ballot may be counted only if: 1. The signature on the voter’s certificate or the cure affidavit matches the elector’s signature in the registration books or the precinct register; however, in the case of a cure affidavit, the supporting identification listed in subsection (6) must also confirm the identity of the elector; or 2. The cure affidavit contains a signature that does not match the elector’s signature in the registration books or the precinct register, but the elector has submitted a current and valid Tier 1 form of identification confirming his or her identity pursuant to subsection (6).

Notifying the elector of the signature deficiency by e-mail and directing the elector to the cure affidavit and instructions on the supervisor’s website; 2. Notifying the elector of the signature deficiency by text message and directing the elector to the cure affidavit and instructions on the supervisor’s website; or 3. Notifying the elector of the signature deficiency by telephone and directing the elector to the cure affidavit and instructions on the supervisor’s website.

(Voter’s Signature) (Address) (d) Instructions must accompany the cure affidavit in substantially the following form: READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE COMPLETING THE AFFIDAVIT. FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS MAY CAUSE YOUR BALLOT NOT TO COUNT. 1. In order to cure the missing signature or the signature discrepancy on your Provisional Ballot Voter’s Certificate and Affirmation, your affidavit should be completed and returned as soon as possible so that it can reach the supervisor of elections of the county in which your precinct is located no later than 5 p.m. on the 2nd day after the election. 2. You must sign your name on the line above (Voter’s Signature). 3. You must make a copy of one of the following forms of identification: a. Tier 1 identification.—Current and valid identification that includes your name and photograph: Florida driver license; Florida identification card issued by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles; United States passport; debit or credit card; military identification; student identification; retirement center identification; neighborhood association identification; public assistance identification; veteran health identification card issued by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs; Florida license to carry a concealed weapon or firearm; or employee identification card issued by any branch, department, agency, or entity of the Federal Government, the state, a county, or a municipality; or b. Tier 2 identification.—ONLY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A TIER 1 FORM OF IDENTIFICATION, identification that shows your name and current residence address: current utility bill; bank statement; government check; paycheck; or government document (excluding voter information card). 4. Place the envelope bearing the affidavit into a mailing envelope addressed to the supervisor. Insert a copy of your identification in the mailing envelope. Mail (if time permits), deliver, or have delivered the completed affidavit along with the copy of your identification to your county supervisor of elections. Be sure there is sufficient postage if mailed and that the supervisor’s address is correct. Remember, your information MUST reach your county supervisor of elections no later than 5 p.m. on the 2nd day following the election or your ballot will not count. 5. Alternatively, you may fax or e-mail your completed affidavit and a copy of your identification to the supervisor of elections. If e-mailing, please provide these documents as attachments. 6. Submitting a provisional ballot affidavit does not establish your eligibility to vote in this election or guarantee that your ballot will be counted. The county canvassing board determines your eligibility to vote through information provided on the Provisional Ballot Voter’s Certificate and Affirmation, written evidence provided by you, including information in your cure affidavit along with any supporting identification, and any other evidence presented by the supervisor of elections or a challenger. You may still be required to present additional written evidence to support your eligibility to vote. (e) The department and each supervisor shall include the affidavit and instructions on their respective websites. The supervisor shall include his or her office mailing address, e-mail address, and fax number on the page containing the affidavit instructions, and the department’s instruction page shall include the office mailing addresses, e-mail addresses, and fax numbers of all supervisors or provide a conspicuous link to such addresses. (f) The supervisor shall attach each affidavit received to the appropriate provisional ballot envelope containing the Provisional Ballot Voter’s Certificate and Affirmation. (7)(a) Each supervisor shall establish a free access system that allows each person who casts a provisional ballot to determine whether his or her provisional ballot was counted in the final canvass of votes and, if not, the reasons why. Information regarding provisional ballots shall be available no later than 30 days following the election. The system established must restrict information regarding an individual ballot to the person who cast the ballot. (b) Unless processed as a signature update pursuant to subsection (2), the supervisor shall mail a voter registration application to the elector to be completed indicating the elector’s current signature if the signature on the voter’s certificate or cure affidavit did not match the elector’s signature in the registration books or precinct register.

If the basis for the challenge is that the person’s legal residence is not in that precinct, the person shall first be given the opportunity to execute a change of legal residence in order to be able to vote a regular ballot in accordance with s. 101.045(2). If the change of legal residence is such that the person is then properly registered for that precinct, the person shall be allowed to vote a regular ballot.

(7) At presidential elections it permits each elector, by one operation, to vote for all presidential electors of a party or for all presidential electors of candidates for President and Vice President with no party affiliation. (8) It provides a method for write-in voting. (9) It is capable of accumulating a count of the specific number of ballots tallied for a precinct, accumulating total votes by candidate for each office, and accumulating total votes for and against each question and issue of the ballots tallied for a precinct. (10) It is capable of tallying votes from ballots of different political parties from the same precinct, in the case of a primary election. (11) It is capable of automatically producing precinct totals in printed form. (12) If it is of a type which registers votes electronically, it will permit each voter to change his or her vote for any candidate or upon any question appearing on the official ballot up to the time that the voter takes the final step to register his or her vote and to have the vote computed. (13) It is capable of providing records from which the operation of the voting system may be audited. (14) It uses a precinct-count tabulation system.

      "text": "101.56062 Standards for accessible voting systems.— (1) Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, each voting system certified by the Department of State for use in local, state, and federal elections must include the capability to install accessible voter interface devices in the system configuration which will allow the system to meet the following minimum standards: (a) The voting system must provide a tactile input or audio input device, or both. (b) The voting system must provide a method by which voters can confirm any tactile or audio input by having the capability of audio output using synthetic or recorded human speech that is reasonably phonetically accurate. (c) Any operable controls on the input device which are needed for voters who are visually impaired must be discernible tactilely without actuating the keys. (d) Audio and visual access approaches must be able to work both separately and simultaneously. (e) If a nonaudio access approach is provided, the system may not require color perception. The system must use black text or graphics, or both, on white background or white text or graphics, or both, on black background, unless the office of the Secretary of State approves other high-contrast color combinations that do not require color perception. (f) Any voting system that requires any visual perception must offer the election official who programs the system, prior to its being sent to the polling place, the capability to set the font size, as it appears to the voter, from a minimum of 14 points to a maximum of 24 points. (g) The voting system must provide audio information, including any audio output using synthetic or recorded human speech or any auditory feedback tones that are important for the use of the audio approach, through at least one mode, by handset or headset, in enhanced auditory fashion (increased amplification), and must provide incremental volume control with output amplification up to a level of at least 97 dB SPL. (h) For transmitted voice signals to the voter, the voting system must provide a gain adjustable up to a minimum of 20 dB with at least one intermediate step of 12 dB of gain. (i) For the safety of others, if the voting system has the possibility of exceeding 120 dB SPL, then a mechanism must be included to reset the volume automatically to the voting system’s default volume level after every use, for example when the handset is replaced, but not before. Also, universal precautions in the use and sharing of headsets should be followed. (j) If sound cues and audible information such as “beeps” are used, there must be simultaneous corresponding visual cues and information. (k) Controls and operable mechanisms must be operable with one hand, including operability with a closed fist, and operable without tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist. (l) The force required to operate or activate the controls must be no greater than 5 pounds of force. (m) Voting booths must have voting controls at a minimum height of 36 inches above the finished floor with a minimum knee clearance of 27 inches high, 30 inches wide, and 19 inches deep, or the accessible voter interface devices must be designed so as to allow their use on top of a table to meet these requirements. Tabletop installations must include adequate privacy. (n) Any audio ballot must provide the voter with the following functionalities: 1. After the initial instructions that the system requires election officials to provide to each voter, the voter should be able to independently operate the voter interface through the final step of casting a ballot without assistance. 2. The voter must be able to determine the races that he or she is allowed to vote in and to determine which candidates are available in each race. 3. The voter must be able to determine how many candidates may be selected in each race. 4. The voter must be able to have confidence that the physical or vocal inputs given to the system have selected the candidates that he or she intended to select. 5. The voter must be able to review the candidate selections that he or she has made. 6. Prior to the act of casting the ballot, the voter must be able to change any selections previously made and confirm a new selection. 7. The system must communicate to the voter the fact that the voter has failed to vote in a race or has failed to vote the number of allowable candidates in any race and require the voter to confirm his or her intent to undervote before casting the ballot. 8. The system must prevent the voter from overvoting any race. 9. The voter must be able to input a candidate’s name in each race that allows a write-in candidate. 10. The voter must be able to review his or her write-in input to the interface, edit that input, and confirm that the edits meet the voter’s intent. 11. There must be a clear, identifiable action that the voter takes to “cast” the ballot. The system must make clear to the voter how to take this action so that the voter has minimal risk of taking the action accidentally but, when the voter intends to cast the ballot, the action can be easily performed. 12. Once the ballot is cast, the system must confirm to the voter that the action has occurred and that the voter’s process of voting is complete. 13. Once the ballot is cast, the system must preclude the voter from modifying the ballot cast or voting or casting another ballot. The functionalities required in this paragraph for certification may be satisfied by either the voting device or by the entire voting system. (2) Such voting system must include at least one accessible voter interface device installed in each polling place which meets the requirements of this section, except for paragraph (1)(d).

Tests shall be sufficient to determine that the voting system is properly programmed, the election is correctly defined on the voting system, and all of the voting system input, output, and communication devices are working properly. (2) On any day not more than 25 days before the commencement of early voting as provided in s. 101.657, the supervisor of elections shall have the automatic tabulating equipment publicly tested to ascertain that the equipment will correctly count the votes cast for all offices and on all measures. If the ballots to be used at the polling place on election day are not available at the time of the testing, the supervisor may conduct an additional test not more than 10 days before election day. Public notice of the time and place of the test shall be given at least 48 hours prior thereto by publication on the county website as provided in s. 50.0311, on the supervisor of elections’ website, or once in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the county. If the applicable website becomes unavailable or if there is no newspaper of general circulation in the county, the notice must be posted in at least four conspicuous places in the county. The supervisor or the municipal elections official may, at the time of qualifying, give written notice of the time and location of the public preelection test to each candidate qualifying with that office and obtain a signed receipt that the notice has been given. The Department of State shall give written notice to each statewide candidate at the time of qualifying, or immediately at the end of qualifying, that the voting equipment will be tested and advise each candidate to contact the county supervisor of elections as to the time and location of the public preelection test. The supervisor or the municipal elections official shall, at least 30 days before the commencement of early voting as provided in s. 101.657, send written notice by certified mail to the county party chair of each political party and to all candidates for other than statewide office whose names appear on the ballot in the county and who did not receive written notification from the supervisor or municipal elections official at the time of qualifying, stating the time and location of the public preelection test of the automatic tabulating equipment. The canvassing board shall convene, and each member of the canvassing board shall certify to the accuracy of the test. For the test, the canvassing board may designate one member to represent it. The test shall be open to representatives of the political parties, the press, and the public. Each political party may designate one person with expertise in the computer field who shall be allowed in the central counting room when all tests are being conducted and when the official votes are being counted. The designee may not interfere with the normal operation of the canvassing board. (3) For electronic or electromechanical voting systems configured to tabulate vote-by-mail ballots at a central or regional site, the public testing shall be conducted by processing a preaudited group of ballots so produced as to record a predetermined number of valid votes for each candidate and on each measure and to include one or more ballots for each office which have activated voting positions in excess of the number allowed by law in order to test the ability of the automatic tabulating equipment to reject such votes. If any error is detected, the cause therefor shall be corrected and an errorless count shall be made before the automatic tabulating equipment is approved. The test shall be repeated and errorless results achieved immediately before the start of the official count of the ballots and again after the completion of the official count. The programs and ballots used for testing shall be sealed and retained under the custody of the county canvassing board. (4)(a)1. For electronic or electromechanical voting systems configured to include electronic or electromechanical tabulation devices which are distributed to the precincts, all or a sample of the devices to be used in the election shall be publicly tested. If a sample is to be tested, the sample shall consist of a random selection of at least 5 percent or 10 of the devices for an optical scan system, whichever is greater. For touchscreen systems used for voters having a disability, a sample of at least 2 percent of the devices must be tested. The test shall be conducted by processing a group of ballots, causing the device to output results for the ballots processed, and comparing the output of results to the results expected for the ballots processed. The group of ballots shall be produced so as to record a predetermined number of valid votes for each candidate and on each measure and to include for each office one or more ballots which have activated voting positions in excess of the number allowed by law in order to test the ability of the tabulating device to reject such votes. 2. If any tested tabulating device is found to have an error in tabulation, it shall be deemed unsatisfactory. For each device deemed unsatisfactory, the canvassing board shall take steps to determine the cause of the error, shall attempt to identify and test other devices that could reasonably be expected to have the same error, and shall test a number of additional devices sufficient to determine that all devices are satisfactory. Upon deeming any device unsatisfactory, the canvassing board may require all devices to be tested or may declare that all devices are unsatisfactory. 3. If the operation or output of any tested tabulation device, such as spelling or the order of candidates on a report, is in error, such problem shall be reported to the canvassing board. The canvassing board shall then determine if the reported problem warrants its deeming the device unsatisfactory. (b) At the completion of testing under this subsection, the canvassing board or its representative, the representatives of the political parties, and the candidates or their representatives who attended the test shall witness the resetting of each device that passed to a preelection state of readiness and the sealing of each device that passed in such a manner as to secure its state of readiness until the opening of the polls. (c) The canvassing board or its representative shall execute a written statement setting forth the tabulation devices tested, the results of the testing, the protective counter numbers, if applicable, of each tabulation device, the number of the seal securing each tabulation device at the conclusion of testing, any problems reported to the board as a result of the testing, and whether each device tested is satisfactory or unsatisfactory. (d) Any tabulating device deemed unsatisfactory shall be recoded, repaired, or replaced and shall be made available for retesting. Such device must be determined by the canvassing board or its representative to be satisfactory before it may be used in any election. The canvassing board or its representative shall announce at the close of the first testing the date, place, and time that any unsatisfactory device will be retested or may, at the option of the board, notify by telephone each person who was present at the first testing as to the date, place, and time that the retesting will occur. (e) Records must be kept of all preelection testing of electronic or electromechanical tabulation devices used in any election. Such records are to be present and available for inspection and reference during public preelection testing by any person in attendance during such testing. The need of the canvassing board for access to such records during the testing shall take precedence over the need of other attendees to access such records so that the work of the canvassing board will not be delayed or hindered. Records of testing must include, for each device, the name of each person who tested the device and the date, place, time, and results of each test. Records of testing shall be retained as part of the official records of the election in which any device was used. (5) Any tests involving marksense ballots pursuant to this section shall employ test ballots created by the supervisor of elections using actual ballots that have been printed for the election. If ballot-on-demand ballots will be used in the election, the supervisor shall also create test ballots using the ballot-on-demand technology that will be used to produce ballots in the election, using the same paper stock as will be used for ballots in the election.

      "text": "101.5614 Canvass of returns.— (1) As soon as the polls are closed, the election board shall secure the voting devices against further voting. The election board shall thereafter, in the presence of members of the public desiring to witness the proceedings, verify the number of voted ballots, unused ballots, provisional ballots, and spoiled ballots to ascertain whether such number corresponds with the number of ballots issued by the supervisor. If there is a difference, this fact shall be reported in writing to the county canvassing board with the reasons therefor if known. The total number of voted ballots shall be entered on the forms provided. The proceedings of the election board at the precinct after the polls have closed shall be open to the public; however, no person except a member of the election board shall touch any ballot or ballot container or interfere with or obstruct the orderly count of the ballots. (2) The results of ballots tabulated at precinct locations may be transmitted to the main computer system for the purpose of compilation of complete returns. The security guidelines for transmission of returns shall conform to rules adopted by the Department of State pursuant to s. 101.015. (3) For each ballot or ballot image on which write-in votes have been cast, the canvassing board shall compare the write-in votes with the votes cast on the ballot; if the total number of votes for any office exceeds the number allowed by law, such votes shall not be counted. All valid votes shall be tallied by the canvassing board. (4)(a) If any vote-by-mail ballot is physically damaged so that it cannot properly be counted by the voting system’s automatic tabulating equipment, a true duplicate copy shall be made of the damaged ballot in an open and accessible room in the presence of witnesses and substituted for the damaged ballot. Likewise, a duplicate ballot shall be made of a vote-by-mail ballot containing an overvoted race if there is a clear indication on the ballot that the voter has made a definite choice in the overvoted race or ballot measure. A duplicate shall include all valid votes as determined by the canvassing board based on rules adopted by the division pursuant to s. 102.166(4). A duplicate may be made of a ballot containing an undervoted race or ballot measure if there is a clear indication on the ballot that the voter has made a definite choice in the undervoted race or ballot measure. A duplicate may not include a vote if the voter’s intent in such race or on such measure is not clear. Upon request, a physically present candidate, a political party official, a political committee official, or an authorized designee thereof, must be allowed to observe the duplication of ballots upon signing an affidavit affirming his or her acknowledgment that disclosure of election results discerned from observing the ballot duplication process while the election is ongoing is a felony, as provided under subsection (8). The observer must be allowed to observe the duplication of ballots in such a way that the observer is able to see the markings on each ballot and the duplication taking place. All duplicate ballots must be clearly labeled “duplicate,” bear a serial number which shall be recorded on the defective ballot, and be counted in lieu of the defective ballot. The duplication of ballots must happen in the presence of at least one canvassing board member. After a ballot has been duplicated, the defective ballot shall be placed in an envelope provided for that purpose, and the duplicate ballot shall be tallied with the other ballots for that precinct. If any observer makes a reasonable objection to a duplicate of a ballot, the ballot must be presented to the canvassing board for a determination of the validity of the duplicate. The canvassing board must document the serial number of the ballot in the canvassing board’s minutes. The canvassing board must decide whether the duplication is valid. If the duplicate ballot is determined to be valid, the duplicate ballot must be counted. If the duplicate ballot is determined to be invalid, the duplicate ballot must be rejected and a proper duplicate ballot must be made and counted in lieu of the original. (b) A true duplicate copy shall be made of each federal write-in absentee ballot in the presence of witnesses and substituted for the federal write-in absentee ballot. The duplicate ballot must include all valid votes as determined by the canvassing board based on rules adopted by the division pursuant to s. 102.166(4). All duplicate ballots shall be clearly labeled “duplicate,” bear a serial number that shall be recorded on the federal write-in absentee ballot, and be counted in lieu of the federal write-in absentee ballot. After a ballot has been duplicated, the federal write-in absentee ballot shall be placed in an envelope provided for that purpose, and the duplicate ballot shall be tallied with other ballots for that precinct. (5) If there is no clear indication on the ballot that the voter has made a definite choice for an office or ballot measure, the elector’s ballot shall not be counted for that office or measure, but the ballot shall not be invalidated as to those names or measures which are properly marked. (6) Vote-by-mail ballots may be counted by the voting system’s automatic tabulating equipment if they have been marked in a manner which will enable them to be properly counted by such equipment. (7) The return printed by the voting system’s automatic tabulating equipment, to which has been added the return of write-in, vote-by-mail, and manually counted votes and votes from provisional ballots, shall constitute the official return of the election upon certification by the canvassing board. Upon completion of the count, the returns shall be open to the public. A copy of the returns may be posted at the central counting place or at the office of the supervisor of elections in lieu of the posting of returns at individual precincts. (8) Any supervisor of elections, deputy supervisor of elections, canvassing board member, election board member, election employee, or other person authorized to observe, review, or inspect ballot materials or observe canvassing who releases any information about votes cast for or against any candidate or ballot measure or any results of any election before the closing of the polls in that county on election day commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.

(5) A ballot shall be counted only if: (a) It is returned in the return mailing envelope; (b) The elector’s signature has been verified as provided in this subsection; and (c) It is received by the supervisor of elections not later than 7 p.m. on the day of the election. The supervisor of elections shall verify the signature of each elector on the return mailing envelope with the signature on the elector’s registration records. Such verification may commence at any time prior to the canvass of votes. The supervisor of elections shall safely keep the ballot unopened in his or her office until the county canvassing board canvasses the vote. If the supervisor of elections determines that an elector to whom a replacement ballot has been issued under subsection (4) has voted more than once, the canvassing board shall determine which ballot, if any, is to be counted. (6) The canvassing board may begin the canvassing of mail ballots as provided by s. 101.68(2)(a). The criminal penalty specified in that paragraph for the release of results before 7 p.m. on election day is also applicable to canvassing conducted under this act. (7) With respect to absent electors overseas entitled to vote in the election, the supervisor of elections shall mail an official ballot with a secrecy envelope, a return mailing envelope, and instructions sufficient to describe the voting process to each such elector on a date sufficient to allow such elector time to vote in the election and to have his or her marked ballot reach the supervisor by 7 p.m. on the day of the election. (8) A ballot that otherwise satisfies the requirements of subsection (5) shall be counted even if the elector dies after mailing the ballot but before election day, as long as, prior to the death of the voter, the ballot was: (a) Postmarked by the United States Postal Service; (b) Date-stamped with a verifiable tracking number by common carrier; or (c) Already in the possession of the supervisor of elections.

      "text": "101.62 Request for vote-by-mail ballots.— (1) REQUEST.— (a) The supervisor shall accept a request for a vote-by-mail ballot only from a voter or, if directly instructed by the voter, a member of the voter’s immediate family or the voter’s legal guardian. A request may be made in person, in writing, by telephone, or through the supervisor’s website. The department shall prescribe by rule by October 1, 2023, a uniform statewide application to make a written request for a vote-by-mail ballot which includes fields for all information required in this subsection. One request is deemed sufficient to receive a vote-by-mail ballot for all elections through the end of the calendar year of the next regularly scheduled general election, unless the voter or the voter’s designee indicates at the time the request is made the elections within such period for which the voter desires to receive a vote-by-mail ballot. The supervisor must cancel a request for a vote-by-mail ballot when any first-class mail or nonforwardable mail sent by the supervisor to the voter is returned as undeliverable. If the voter requests a vote-by-mail ballot thereafter, the voter must provide or confirm his or her current residential address. (b) The supervisor may accept a request for a vote-by-mail ballot to be mailed to a voter’s address on file in the Florida Voter Registration System from the voter, or, if directly instructed by the voter, a member of the voter’s immediate family or the voter’s legal guardian. If an in-person or a telephonic request is made, the voter must provide the voter’s Florida driver license number, the voter’s Florida identification card number, or the last four digits of the voter’s social security number, whichever may be verified in the supervisor’s records. If the ballot is requested to be mailed to an address other than the voter’s address on file in the Florida Voter Registration System, the request must be made in writing. A written request must be signed by the voter and include the voter’s Florida driver license number, the voter’s Florida identification card number, or the last four digits of the voter’s social security number. However, an absent uniformed services voter or an overseas voter seeking a vote-by-mail ballot is not required to submit a signed, written request for a vote-by-mail ballot that is being mailed to an address other than the voter’s address on file in the Florida Voter Registration System. The person making the request must disclose: 1. The name of the voter for whom the ballot is requested. 2. The voter’s address. 3. The voter’s date of birth. 4. The voter’s Florida driver license number, the voter’s Florida identification card number, or the last four digits of the voter’s social security number, whichever may be verified in the supervisor’s records. If the voter’s registration record does not already include the voter’s Florida driver license number or Florida identification card number or the last four digits of the voter’s social security number, the number provided must be recorded in the voter’s registration record. 5. The requester’s name. 6. The requester’s address. 7. The requester’s driver license number, the requester’s identification card number, or the last four digits of the requester’s social security number, if available. 8. The requester’s relationship to the voter. 9. The requester’s signature (written requests only). (c) Upon receiving a request for a vote-by-mail ballot from an absent voter, the supervisor of elections shall notify the voter of the free access system that has been designated by the department for determining the status of his or her vote-by-mail ballot. (d) For purposes of this section, the term “immediate family” refers to the following, as applicable: 1. The voter’s spouse, parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling, or the parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling of the voter’s spouse. 2. The designee’s spouse, parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling, or the parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling of the designee’s spouse. (2) ACCESS TO VOTE-BY-MAIL REQUEST INFORMATION.—For each request for a vote-by-mail ballot received, the supervisor shall record the following information: the date the request was made; the identity of the voter’s designee making the request, if any; the Florida driver license number, Florida identification card number, or last four digits of the social security number of the voter provided with a written request; the date the vote-by-mail ballot was delivered to the voter or the voter’s designee or the date the vote-by-mail ballot was delivered to the post office or other carrier; the address to which the ballot was mailed or the identity of the voter’s designee to whom the ballot was delivered; the date the ballot was received by the supervisor; the absence of the voter’s signature on the voter’s certificate, if applicable; whether the voter’s certificate contains a signature that does not match the voter’s signature in the registration books or precinct register; and such other information he or she may deem necessary. This information must be provided in electronic format as provided by division rule. The information must be updated and made available no later than 8 a.m. of each day, including weekends, beginning 60 days before the primary until 15 days after the general election and shall be contemporaneously provided to the division. This information is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and shall be made available to or reproduced only for the voter requesting the ballot, a canvassing board, an election official, a political party or official thereof, a candidate who has filed qualification papers and is opposed in an upcoming election, and registered political committees for political purposes only. (3) DELIVERY OF VOTE-BY-MAIL BALLOTS.— (a) No later than 45 days before each presidential preference primary election, primary election, and general election, the supervisor of elections shall send a vote-by-mail ballot as provided in subparagraph (d)2. to each absent uniformed services voter and to each overseas voter who has requested a vote-by-mail ballot. (b) The supervisor shall mail a vote-by-mail ballot to each absent qualified voter, other than those listed in paragraph (a), who has requested such a ballot, between the 40th and 33rd days before the presidential preference primary election, primary election, and general election. (c) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b), the supervisor shall mail vote-by-mail ballots within 2 business days after receiving a request for such a ballot, but no later than the 10th day before election day. The deadline to submit a request for a ballot to be mailed is 5 p.m. local time on the 12th day before an upcoming election. (d) Upon a request for a vote-by-mail ballot, the supervisor shall provide a vote-by-mail ballot to each voter by whom a request for that ballot has been made, by one of the following means: 1. By nonforwardable, return-if-undeliverable mail to the voter’s current mailing address on file with the supervisor or any other address the voter specifies in the request. The envelopes must be prominently marked “Do Not Forward.” 2. By forwardable mail, e-mail, or facsimile machine transmission to absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters. The absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter may designate in the vote-by-mail ballot request the preferred method of transmission. If the voter does not designate the method of transmission, the vote-by-mail ballot must be mailed. 3. By personal delivery to the voter after vote-by-mail ballots have been mailed and up to 7 p.m. on election day upon presentation of the identification required in s. 101.043. 4. By delivery to the voter’s designee after vote-by-mail ballots have been mailed and up to 7 p.m. on election day. Any voter may designate in writing a person to pick up the ballot for the voter; however, the person designated may not pick up more than two vote-by-mail ballots per election, other than the designee’s own ballot, except that additional ballots may be picked up for members of the designee’s immediate family. The designee shall provide to the supervisor the written authorization by the voter and a picture identification of the designee and must complete an affidavit. The designee shall state in the affidavit that the designee is authorized by the voter to pick up that ballot and shall indicate if the voter is a member of the designee’s immediate family and, if so, the relationship. The department shall prescribe the form of the affidavit. If the supervisor is satisfied that the designee is authorized to pick up the ballot and that the signature of the voter on the written authorization matches the signature of the voter on file, the supervisor must give the ballot to that designee for delivery to the voter. 5. Except as provided in s. 101.655, the supervisor may not deliver a vote-by-mail ballot to a voter or a voter’s designee pursuant to subparagraph 3. or subparagraph 4., respectively, during the mandatory early voting period and up to 7 p.m. on election day, unless there is an emergency, to the extent that the voter will be unable to go to a designated early voting site in his or her county or to his or her assigned polling place on election day. If a vote-by-mail ballot is delivered, the voter or his or her designee must execute an affidavit affirming to the facts which allow for delivery of the vote-by-mail ballot. The department shall adopt a rule providing for the form of the affidavit. (4) SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.—If the department is unable to certify candidates for an election in time to comply with paragraph (3)(a), the Department of State is authorized to prescribe rules for a ballot to be sent to absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters. (5) MATERIALS.—Only the materials necessary to vote by mail may be mailed or delivered with any vote-by-mail ballot. (6) PROHIBITION.—Except as expressly authorized for voters having a disability under s. 101.662, for overseas voters under s. 101.697, or for local referenda under ss. 101.6102 and 101.6103, a county, municipality, or state agency may not send a vote-by-mail ballot to a voter unless the voter has requested a vote-by-mail ballot in the manner authorized under this section.

VOTER’S CERTIFICATE I, , do solemnly swear or affirm that I am a qualified and registered voter of County, Florida, and that I have not and will not vote more than one ballot in this election. I understand that if I commit or attempt to commit any fraud in connection with voting, vote a fraudulent ballot, or vote more than once in an election, I can be convicted of a felony of the third degree and fined up to $5,000 and/or imprisoned for up to 5 years.

VERY IMPORTANT. In order to ensure that your vote-by-mail ballot will be counted, it should be completed and returned as soon as possible so that it can reach the supervisor of elections of the county in which your precinct is located no later than 7 p.m. on the day of the election. However, if you are an overseas voter casting a ballot in a presidential preference primary or general election, your vote-by-mail ballot must be postmarked or dated no later than the date of the election and received by the supervisor of elections of the county in which you are registered to vote no later than 10 days after the date of the election. Note that the later you return your ballot, the less time you will have to cure any signature deficiencies, which is authorized until 5 p.m. on the 2nd day after the election. 2. Mark your ballot in secret as instructed on the ballot. You must mark your own ballot unless you are unable to do so because of blindness, disability, or inability to read or write. 3. Mark only the number of candidates or issue choices for a race as indicated on the ballot. If you are allowed to “Vote for One” candidate and you vote for more than one candidate, your vote in that race will not be counted. 4. Place your marked ballot in the enclosed secrecy envelope. 5. Insert the secrecy envelope into the enclosed mailing envelope which is addressed to the supervisor. 6. Seal the mailing envelope and completely fill out the Voter’s Certificate on the back of the mailing envelope. 7. VERY IMPORTANT. In order for your vote-by-mail ballot to be counted, you must sign your name on the line above (Voter’s Signature). A vote-by-mail ballot will be considered illegal and not be counted if the signature on the voter’s certificate does not match the signature on record. The signature on file at the time the supervisor of elections in the county in which your precinct is located receives your vote-by-mail ballot is the signature that will be used to verify your signature on the voter’s certificate. If you need to update your signature for this election, send your signature update on a voter registration application to your supervisor of elections so that it is received before your vote-by-mail ballot is received. 8. VERY IMPORTANT. If you are an overseas voter, you must include the date you signed the Voter’s Certificate on the line above (Date) or your ballot may not be counted. 9. Mail, deliver, or have delivered the completed mailing envelope. Be sure there is sufficient postage if mailed. THE COMPLETED MAILING ENVELOPE CAN BE DELIVERED TO THE OFFICE OF THE SUPERVISOR OF ELECTIONS OF THE COUNTY IN WHICH YOUR PRECINCT IS LOCATED OR DROPPED OFF AT AN AUTHORIZED SECURE BALLOT INTAKE STATION, AVAILABLE AT EACH EARLY VOTING LOCATION. 10. FELONY NOTICE. It is a felony under Florida law to accept any gift, payment, or gratuity in exchange for your vote for a candidate. It is also a felony under Florida law to vote in an election using a false identity or false address, or under any other circumstances making your ballot false or fraudulent.

Such request for supervised voting in the facility shall be made by submitting a written request to the supervisor of elections no later than 28 days prior to the election for which that request is submitted. The request shall specify the name and address of the facility and the name of the electors who wish to vote by mail in that election. If the request contains the names of fewer than five voters, the supervisor of elections is not required to provide supervised voting. (2) The supervisor of elections may, in the absence of a request from the administrator of a facility, provide for supervised voting in the facility for those persons who have requested vote-by-mail ballots. The supervisor of elections shall notify the administrator of the facility that supervised voting will occur. (3) The supervisor of elections shall, in cooperation with the administrator of the facility, select a date and time when the supervised voting will occur. (4) The supervisor of elections shall designate supervised voting teams to provide the services prescribed by this section. Each supervised voting team shall include at least two persons. Each supervised voting team must include representatives of more than one political party; however, in any primary election to nominate party nominees in which only one party has candidates appearing on the ballot, all supervised voting team members may be of that party. No candidate may provide supervised voting services. (5) The supervised voting team shall deliver the ballots to the respective absent electors, and each member of the team shall jointly supervise the voting of the ballots. If any elector requests assistance in voting, the oath prescribed in s. 101.051 shall be completed and the elector may receive the assistance of two members of the supervised voting team or some other person of the elector’s choice to assist the elector in casting the elector’s ballot. (6) Before providing assistance, the supervised voting team shall disclose to the elector that the ballot may be retained to vote at a later time and that the elector has the right to seek assistance in voting from some other person of the elector’s choice without the presence of the supervised voting team. (7) If any elector declines to vote a ballot or is unable to vote a ballot, the supervised voting team shall mark the ballot “refused to vote” or “unable to vote.” (8) After the ballots have been voted or marked in accordance with the provisions of this section, the supervised voting team shall deliver the ballots to the supervisor of elections, who shall retain them pursuant to s. 101.67.

      "text": "101.657 Early voting.— (1)(a) As a convenience to the voter, the supervisor of elections shall allow an elector to vote early in the main or branch office of the supervisor. The supervisor shall mark, code, indicate on, or otherwise track the voter’s precinct for each early voted ballot. In order for a branch office to be used for early voting, it shall be a permanent facility of the supervisor and shall have been designated and used as such for at least 1 year prior to the election. The supervisor may also designate any city hall, permanent public library facility, fairground, civic center, courthouse, county commission building, stadium, convention center, government-owned senior center, or government-owned community center as an early voting site; however, if so designated, the sites must be geographically located so as to provide all voters in the county an equal opportunity to cast a ballot, insofar as is practicable, and must provide sufficient nonpermitted parking to accommodate the anticipated amount of voters. In addition, a supervisor may designate one early voting site per election in an area of the county that does not have any of the eligible early voting locations. Such additional early voting site must be geographically located so as to provide all voters in that area with an equal opportunity to cast a ballot, insofar as is practicable, and must provide sufficient nonpermitted parking to accommodate the anticipated amount of voters. Each county shall, at a minimum, operate the same total number of early voting sites for a general election which the county operated for the 2012 general election. The results or tabulation of votes cast during early voting may not be made before the close of the polls on election day. Results shall be reported by precinct. (b) The supervisor shall designate each early voting site by no later than the 30th day prior to an election and shall designate an early voting area, as defined in s. 97.021, at each early voting site. The supervisor shall provide to the division no later than the 30th day before an election the address of each early voting site and the hours that early voting will occur at each site. (c) All early voting sites in a county shall allow any person in line at the closing of an early voting site to vote. (d) Early voting shall begin on the 10th day before an election that contains state or federal races and end on the 3rd day before the election, and shall be provided for no less than 8 hours and no more than 12 hours per day at each site during the applicable period. In addition, early voting may be offered at the discretion of the supervisor of elections on the 15th, 14th, 13th, 12th, 11th, or 2nd day before an election that contains state or federal races for at least 8 hours per day, but not more than 12 hours per day. The supervisor of elections may provide early voting for elections that are not held in conjunction with a state or federal election. However, the supervisor has the discretion to determine the hours of operation of early voting sites in those elections. (e) Notwithstanding the requirements of s. 100.3605, municipalities may provide early voting in municipal elections that are not held in conjunction with county or state elections. If a municipality provides early voting, it may designate as many sites as necessary and shall conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (a)-(c). The supervisor is not required to conduct early voting if it is provided pursuant to this subsection. (f) Notwithstanding the requirements of s. 189.04, special districts may provide early voting in any district election not held in conjunction with county or state elections. If a special district provides early voting, it may designate as many sites as necessary and shall conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (a)-(c). The supervisor is not required to conduct early voting if it is provided pursuant to this subsection. (2) During any early voting period, each supervisor shall make available the total number of voters casting a ballot at each early voting location and the total number of vote-by-mail ballots received under s. 101.69(2) during the previous day. Each supervisor shall prepare an electronic data file listing the individual voters who cast a ballot during the early voting period. This information shall be provided in electronic format as provided by rule adopted by the division. The information shall be updated and made available no later than noon of each day and shall be contemporaneously provided to the division. (3) The ballot of each elector voting early shall be counted even if the elector dies on or before election day. (4)(a) The elector must provide identification and must complete an Early Voting Voter Certificate in substantially the following form: EARLY VOTING VOTER CERTIFICATE I, , am a qualified elector in this election and registered voter of County, Florida. I do solemnly swear or affirm that I am the person so listed on the voter registration rolls of County and that I reside at the listed address. I understand that if I commit or attempt to commit fraud in connection with voting, vote a fraudulent ballot, or vote more than once in an election I could be convicted of a felony of the third degree and both fined up to $5,000 and imprisoned for up to 5 years. I understand that my failure to sign this certificate invalidates my ballot. (Voter’s Signature) (Address) (City/State) (b) Any elector may challenge an elector seeking to vote early under the provisions of s. 101.111. Any challenged voter must vote a provisional ballot. The canvassing board shall review the ballot and decide the validity of the ballot by majority vote. (c) The canvass of returns for ballots cast under this subsection shall be substantially the same as votes cast by electors in precincts, as provided in s. 101.5614.

During the signature comparison process, the supervisor may not use any knowledge of the political affiliation of the elector whose signature is subject to verification. (b) An elector who dies after casting a vote-by-mail ballot but on or before election day shall remain listed in the registration books until the results have been certified for the election in which the ballot was cast. The supervisor shall safely keep the ballot unopened in his or her office until the county canvassing board canvasses the vote pursuant to subsection (2). (c) If two or more vote-by-mail ballots for the same election are returned in one mailing envelope, the ballots may not be counted. (d) Except as provided in subsection (4), after a vote-by-mail ballot is received by the supervisor, the ballot is deemed to have been cast, and changes or additions may not be made to the voter’s certificate. (2)(a) The county canvassing board may begin the canvassing of vote-by-mail ballots upon the completion of the public testing of automatic tabulating equipment pursuant to s. 101.5612(2), but must begin such canvassing by no later than noon on the day following the election. However, notwithstanding any such authorization to begin canvassing or otherwise processing vote-by-mail ballots early, no result shall be released until after the closing of the polls in that county on election day. Any supervisor, deputy supervisor, canvassing board member, election board member, or election employee who releases the results of a canvassing or processing of vote-by-mail ballots prior to the closing of the polls in that county on election day commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. (b) To ensure that all vote-by-mail ballots to be counted by the canvassing board are accounted for, the canvassing board shall compare the number of ballots in its possession with the number of requests for ballots received to be counted according to the supervisor’s file or list. (c)1. The canvassing board must, if the supervisor has not already done so, compare the signature of the elector on the voter’s certificate or on the vote-by-mail ballot cure affidavit as provided in subsection (4) with the signature of the elector in the registration books or the precinct register to see that the elector is duly registered in the county and to determine the legality of that vote-by-mail ballot. A vote-by-mail ballot may only be counted if: a. The signature on the voter’s certificate or the cure affidavit matches the elector’s signature in the registration books or precinct register; however, in the case of a cure affidavit, the supporting identification listed in subsection (4) must also confirm the identity of the elector; or b. The cure affidavit contains a signature that does not match the elector’s signature in the registration books or precinct register, but the elector has submitted a current and valid Tier 1 identification pursuant to subsection (4) which confirms the identity of the elector. For purposes of this subparagraph, any canvassing board finding that an elector’s signatures do not match must be by majority vote and beyond a reasonable doubt. 2. The ballot of an elector who casts a vote-by-mail ballot shall be counted even if the elector dies on or before election day, as long as, before the death of the voter, the ballot was postmarked by the United States Postal Service, date-stamped with a verifiable tracking number by a common carrier, or already in the possession of the supervisor. 3. A vote-by-mail ballot is not considered illegal if the signature of the elector does not cross the seal of the mailing envelope. 4. If any elector or candidate present believes that a vote-by-mail ballot is illegal due to a defect apparent on the voter’s certificate or the cure affidavit, he or she may, at any time before the ballot is removed from the envelope, file with the canvassing board a protest against the canvass of that ballot, specifying the precinct, the voter’s certificate or the cure affidavit, and the reason he or she believes the ballot to be illegal. A challenge based upon a defect in the voter’s certificate or cure affidavit may not be accepted after the ballot has been removed from the mailing envelope. 5. If the canvassing board determines that a ballot is illegal, a member of the board must, without opening the envelope, mark across the face of the envelope: “rejected as illegal.” The cure affidavit, if applicable, the envelope, and the ballot therein shall be preserved in the manner that official ballots are preserved. (d) The canvassing board shall record the ballot upon the proper record, unless the ballot has been previously recorded by the supervisor. The mailing envelopes shall be opened and the secrecy envelopes shall be mixed so as to make it impossible to determine which secrecy envelope came out of which signed mailing envelope; however, in any county in which an electronic or electromechanical voting system is used, the ballots may be sorted by ballot styles and the mailing envelopes may be opened and the secrecy envelopes mixed separately for each ballot style. The votes on vote-by-mail ballots shall be included in the total vote of the county. (3) The supervisor or the chair of the county canvassing board shall, after the board convenes, have custody of the vote-by-mail ballots until a final proclamation is made as to the total vote received by each candidate. (4)(a) As soon as practicable, the supervisor shall, on behalf of the county canvassing board, attempt to notify an elector who has returned a vote-by-mail ballot that does not include the elector’s signature or contains a signature that does not match the elector’s signature in the registration books or precinct register by: 1. Notifying the elector of the signature deficiency by e-mail and directing the elector to the cure affidavit and instructions on the supervisor’s website; 2. Notifying the elector of the signature deficiency by text message and directing the elector to the cure affidavit and instructions on the supervisor’s website; or 3. Notifying the elector of the signature deficiency by telephone and directing the elector to the cure affidavit and instructions on the supervisor’s website. In addition to the notification required under subparagraph 1., subparagraph 2., or subparagraph 3., the supervisor must notify the elector of the signature deficiency by first-class mail and direct the elector to the cure affidavit and instructions on the supervisor’s website. Beginning the day before the election, the supervisor is not required to provide notice of the signature deficiency by first-class mail, but shall continue to provide notice as required under subparagraph 1., subparagraph 2., or subparagraph 3. (b) The supervisor shall allow such an elector to complete and submit an affidavit in order to cure the vote-by-mail ballot until 5 p.m. on the 2nd day after the election. (c) The elector must complete a cure affidavit in substantially the following form: VOTE-BY-MAIL BALLOT CURE AFFIDAVIT I, , am a qualified voter in this election and registered voter of County, Florida. I do solemnly swear or affirm that I requested and returned the vote-by-mail ballot and that I have not and will not vote more than one ballot in this election. I understand that if I commit or attempt any fraud in connection with voting, vote a fraudulent ballot, or vote more than once in an election, I may be convicted of a felony of the third degree and fined up to $5,000 and imprisoned for up to 5 years. I understand that my failure to sign this affidavit means that my vote-by-mail ballot will be invalidated. (Voter’s Signature) (Address) (d) Instructions must accompany the cure affidavit in substantially the following form: READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE COMPLETING THE AFFIDAVIT. FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS MAY CAUSE YOUR BALLOT NOT TO COUNT. 1. In order to ensure that your vote-by-mail ballot will be counted, your affidavit should be completed and returned as soon as possible so that it can reach the supervisor of elections of the county in which your precinct is located no later than 5 p.m. on the 2nd day after the election. 2. You must sign your name on the line above (Voter’s Signature). 3. You must make a copy of one of the following forms of identification: a. Tier 1 identification.—Current and valid identification that includes your name and photograph: Florida driver license; Florida identification card issued by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles; United States passport; debit or credit card; military identification; student identification; retirement center identification; neighborhood association identification; public assistance identification; veteran health identification card issued by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs; a Florida license to carry a concealed weapon or firearm; or an employee identification card issued by any branch, department, agency, or entity of the Federal Government, the state, a county, or a municipality; or b. Tier 2 identification.—ONLY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A TIER 1 FORM OF IDENTIFICATION, identification that shows your name and current residence address: current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or government document (excluding voter information card). 4. Place the envelope bearing the affidavit into a mailing envelope addressed to the supervisor. Insert a copy of your identification in the mailing envelope. Mail (if time permits), deliver, or have delivered the completed affidavit along with the copy of your identification to your county supervisor of elections. Be sure there is sufficient postage if mailed and that the supervisor’s address is correct. Remember, your information MUST reach your county supervisor of elections no later than 5 p.m. on the 2nd day after the election, or your ballot will not count. 5. Alternatively, you may fax or e-mail your completed affidavit and a copy of your identification to the supervisor of elections. If e-mailing, please provide these documents as attachments. (e) The department and each supervisor shall include the affidavit and instructions on their respective websites. The supervisor must include his or her office’s mailing address, e-mail address, and fax number on the page containing the affidavit instructions, and the department’s instruction page must include the office mailing addresses, e-mail addresses, and fax numbers of all supervisors of elections or provide a conspicuous link to such addresses. (f) The supervisor shall attach each affidavit received to the appropriate vote-by-mail ballot mailing envelope. (g) If a vote-by-mail ballot is validated following the submission of a cure affidavit, the supervisor shall make a copy of the affidavit, affix it to a voter registration application, and immediately process it as a valid request for a signature update pursuant to s. 98.077. (h) After all election results on the ballot have been certified, the supervisor shall, on behalf of the county canvassing board, notify each elector whose ballot has been rejected as illegal and provide the specific reason the ballot was rejected. In addition, unless processed as a signature update pursuant to paragraph (g), the supervisor shall mail a voter registration application to the elector to be completed indicating the elector’s current signature if the signature on the voter’s certificate or cure affidavit did not match the elector’s signature in the registration books or precinct register.

      "text": "101.69 Voting in person; return of vote-by-mail ballot.— (1) The provisions of this code shall not be construed to prohibit any elector from voting in person at the elector’s precinct on the day of an election or at an early voting site, notwithstanding that the elector has requested a vote-by-mail ballot for that election. An elector who has returned a voted vote-by-mail ballot to the supervisor, however, is deemed to have cast his or her ballot and is not entitled to vote another ballot or to have a provisional ballot counted by the county canvassing board. An elector who has received a vote-by-mail ballot and has not returned the voted ballot to the supervisor, but desires to vote in person, shall return the ballot, whether voted or not, to the election board in the elector’s precinct or to an early voting site. The returned ballot shall be marked “canceled” by the board and placed with other canceled ballots. However, if the elector does not return the ballot and the election official: (a) Confirms that the supervisor has received the elector’s vote-by-mail ballot, the elector shall not be allowed to vote in person. If the elector maintains that he or she has not returned the vote-by-mail ballot or remains eligible to vote, the elector shall be provided a provisional ballot as provided in s. 101.048. (b) Confirms that the supervisor has not received the elector’s vote-by-mail ballot, the elector shall be allowed to vote in person as provided in this code. The elector’s vote-by-mail ballot, if subsequently received, shall not be counted and shall remain in the mailing envelope, and the envelope shall be marked “Rejected as Illegal.” (c) Cannot determine whether the supervisor has received the elector’s vote-by-mail ballot, the elector may vote a provisional ballot as provided in s. 101.048. (2)(a) The supervisor shall allow an elector who has received a vote-by-mail ballot to physically return a voted vote-by-mail ballot to the supervisor by placing the return mail envelope containing his or her marked ballot in a secure ballot intake station. Secure ballot intake stations shall be placed at the main office of the supervisor, at each permanent branch office of the supervisor which meets the criteria set forth in s. 101.657(1)(a) for branch offices used for early voting and which is open for at least the minimum number of hours prescribed by s. 98.015(4), and at each early voting site. Secure ballot intake stations may also be placed at any other site that would otherwise qualify as an early voting site under s. 101.657(1). Secure ballot intake stations must be geographically located so as to provide all voters in the county with an equal opportunity to cast a ballot, insofar as is practicable. Except for secure ballot intake stations at an office of the supervisor, a secure ballot intake station may only be used during the county’s early voting hours of operation and must be monitored in person by an employee of the supervisor’s office. A secure ballot intake station at an office of the supervisor must be continuously monitored in person by an employee of the supervisor’s office when the secure ballot intake station is accessible for deposit of ballots. (b) A supervisor shall designate each secure ballot intake station location at least 30 days before an election. The supervisor shall provide the address of each secure ballot intake station location to the division at least 30 days before an election. After a secure ballot intake station location has been designated, it may not be moved or changed except as approved by the division to correct a violation of this subsection. (c)1. On each day of early voting, all secure ballot intake stations must be emptied at the end of early voting hours and all ballots retrieved from the secure ballot intake stations must be returned to the supervisor’s office. 2. For secure ballot intake stations located at an office of the supervisor, all ballots must be retrieved before the secure ballot intake station is no longer monitored by an employee of the supervisor. 3. Employees of the supervisor must comply with procedures for the chain of custody of ballots as required by s. 101.015(4). (3) If any secure ballot intake station is left accessible for ballot receipt other than as authorized by this section, the supervisor is subject to a civil penalty of $25,000. The division is authorized to enforce this provision.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, this section shall be applicable where the computer method of voting is in use, and adequate provision shall be made for the privacy of the elector while casting his or her vote. (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), whenever the supervisor of elections of any county determines that the accommodations for holding any election at a polling place designated for any precinct in the county are unavailable, are inadequate for the expeditious and efficient housing and handling of voting and voting paraphernalia, or do not comply with the requirements of s. 101.715, the supervisor shall, not less than 30 days before the holding of an election, provide for the voting place for such precinct to be moved to another site that is accessible to the public on election day in said precinct or, if such is not available, to another site that is accessible to the public on election day in a contiguous precinct. If such action of the supervisor results in the voting place for two or more precincts being located for the purposes of an election in one building, the supervisor of elections shall provide adequate supplies, equipment, and personnel are available to accommodate the voters for the precincts that are collocated. When any supervisor moves any polling place pursuant to this subsection, the supervisor shall, not more than 30 days or fewer than 7 days before the holding of an election, give notice of the change of the polling place for the precinct involved, with clear description of the voting place to which changed, by publication on the county’s website as provided in s. 50.0311, on the supervisor’s website, or at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. A notice of the change of the polling place involved shall be mailed at least 14 days before an election to each registered elector or to each household in which there is a registered elector. (3) In cases of emergency and when time does not permit compliance with subsection (2), the supervisor of elections shall designate a new polling place which shall be accessible to the public on election day and shall cause a notice to be posted at the old polling place advising the electors of the location of the new polling place. (4) Each polling place shall be conspicuously identified by a sign, on or near the premises of the polling place, designating the polling place by precinct number. Such sign shall be large enough to be clearly visible to occupants of passing vehicular traffic on roadways contiguous to the polling place, with letters no smaller than 3 inches high, and shall be displayed at all times while the polls are open on any election day. (5) Public, tax-supported buildings must be made available for use as polling places, or early voting locations that meet the requirements specified in s. 101.657, upon the request of the supervisor of elections.
