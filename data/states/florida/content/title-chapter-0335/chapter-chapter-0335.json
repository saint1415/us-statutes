(2) At regular intervals as required by the Federal Highway Administration, each bridge on a public transportation facility shall be inspected for structural soundness and safety for the passage of traffic on such bridge. The thoroughness with which bridges are to be inspected shall depend on such factors as age, traffic characteristics, state of maintenance, and known deficiencies. The governmental entity responsible for maintenance of any such bridge is responsible for having inspections performed and reports prepared in accordance with this section. (3)(a) Each bridge inspection required by subsection (2) shall be performed by an inspector who is qualified, as prescribed in subsection (4), who shall determine the load-carrying capacity and safety condition of the bridge. (b) Each inspection shall be reported on a format designated by the department and forwarded to the department. A copy of such report shall also be provided to the local governmental entities in the jurisdictions of which the bridge is located. Data on a newly completed structure, or on any modification of an existing structure, which would alter previously submitted data on any inspection report shall be submitted to the department and the appropriate local governmental entities within 90 days of completion of the new construction or modification by the governmental entity having maintenance responsibility. (c) The department shall maintain an inventory of bridges and appropriate records on the inspections of such bridges reported pursuant to this section. (4)(a) An individual who inspects bridges and completes reports required by this section must possess the following minimum qualifications: 1. Be a registered professional engineer with expertise in civil engineering; or 2. Have a minimum of 5 years’ experience in bridge construction or maintenance inspection assignments in a responsible capacity and have completed a comprehensive training course approved by the department. (b) An individual who executes reports required by this section shall be a registered professional engineer. (5) Upon receipt of an inspection report that recommends reducing the weight, size, or speed limit on a bridge, the governmental entity having maintenance responsibility for the bridge must reduce the maximum limits for the bridge in accordance with the inspection report and shall post the limits in accordance with s. 316.555. The governmental entity must, within 30 days after receipt of an inspection report recommending lower limits, notify the department that the limitations have been implemented and the 1 bridge has been posted accordingly. If the required actions are not taken within 30 days after receipt of an inspection report, the department shall post the limits on the bridge in accordance with the recommendations in the inspection report. 2 All costs incurred by the department in connection with providing notice of the bridge’s limitations or restrictions shall be assessed against and collected from the governmental entity having maintenance responsibility for the bridge. If an inspection report recommends closure of a bridge, the bridge shall be immediately closed. If the governmental entity does not close the bridge immediately upon receipt of an inspection report recommending closure, the department shall close the bridge. 2 All costs incurred by the department in connection with the bridge closure shall be assessed against and collected from the governmental entity having maintenance responsibility for the bridge. 3 Nothing in this subsection alters existing jurisdictional responsibilities for the operation and maintenance of bridges.

(3) The designation of scenic highways by the department and the criteria adopted by the department for the designation of scenic highways are not intended to affect or limit existing or customary uses in commercial or industrial areas that are adjacent to designated scenic highways nor is designation intended to limit the ability of local government entities to control or limit land uses in commercial or industrial areas within their jurisdictions.

(5) Whenever a temporary detour is necessary to bypass a bridge on the State Highway System due to accident, unforeseen failure of equipment, or emergency traffic stoppage and the only available detour is over a toll facility, the department is authorized to pay to the appropriate authority the tolls that would normally have been collected. (6) Whenever any road on the State Highway System is repaired, reconstructed, or otherwise altered in a manner that necessitates the closing of one or more traveling lanes of the road for a period of time exceeding 2 hours, the party performing such work shall give notice to the appropriate local law enforcement agency within whose jurisdiction such road is located prior to commencing work on the project.
