Any person located in this state who engages in the distribution of a prescription drug, which distribution is not considered “wholesale distribution” under s. 499.003(48)(a). b. Any person located in this state who engages in the receipt or distribution of a prescription drug in this state for the purpose of processing its return or its destruction if such person is not the person initiating the return, the prescription drug wholesale supplier of the person initiating the return, or the manufacturer of the drug. c. A blood establishment located in this state which collects blood and blood components only from volunteer donors as defined in s. 381.06014 or pursuant to an authorized practitioner’s order for medical treatment or therapy and engages in the wholesale distribution of a prescription drug not described in s. 499.003(48)(j) to a health care entity. A mobile blood unit operated by a blood establishment permitted under this sub-subparagraph is not required to be separately permitted. The health care entity receiving a prescription drug distributed under this sub-subparagraph must be licensed as a closed pharmacy or provide health care services at that establishment.

The blood establishment may purchase and possess the drugs described in this sub-subparagraph without a health care clinic establishment permit. 2. Storage, handling, and recordkeeping of these distributions by a person required to be permitted as a restricted prescription drug distributor must be in accordance with the requirements for wholesale distributors under s. 499.0121. 3. A person who applies for a permit as a restricted prescription drug distributor, or for the renewal of such a permit, must provide to the department the information required under s. 499.012. 4. The department may adopt rules regarding the distribution of prescription drugs by hospitals, health care entities, charitable organizations, other persons not involved in wholesale distribution, and blood establishments, which rules are necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. 5. A restricted prescription drug distributor permit is not required for distributions between pharmacies that each hold an active permit under chapter 465, have a common ownership, and are operating in a freestanding end-stage renal dialysis clinic, if such distributions are made to meet the immediate emergency medical needs of specifically identified patients and do not occur with such frequency as to amount to the regular and systematic supplying of that drug between the pharmacies.

A limited prescription drug veterinary wholesale distributor that applies to the department for a new permit or the renewal of a permit must submit a bond of $20,000, or other equivalent means of security acceptable to the department, such as an irrevocable letter of credit or a deposit in a trust account or financial institution, payable to the Professional Regulation Trust Fund.

A limited prescription drug veterinary wholesale distributor permit is not required for an intracompany sale or transfer of a prescription drug from an out-of-state establishment that is duly licensed to engage in the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs in its state of residence to a licensed limited prescription drug veterinary wholesale distributor in this state if both wholesale distributors conduct wholesale distributions of prescription drugs under the same business name.

A device manufacturer permit is required for any person that engages in the manufacture, repackaging, or assembly of medical devices for human use in this state, except that a permit is not required if: a. The person is engaged only in manufacturing, repackaging, or assembling a medical device pursuant to a practitioner’s order for a specific patient; or b. The person does not manufacture, repackage, or assemble any medical devices or components for such devices, except those devices or components which are exempt from registration pursuant to s. 499.015(8). 2.

An exempt cosmetic manufacturer may only: a. Sell prepackaged cosmetics affixed with a label containing information required by the United States Food and Drug Administration. b. Manufacture and sell cosmetics that are soaps, not otherwise exempt from the definition of cosmetics, lotions, moisturizers, and creams. c.

The department may investigate any complaint which alleges that an exempt cosmetic manufacturer has violated an applicable provision of this chapter or a rule adopted under this chapter. The department’s authorized officer or employee may enter and inspect the premises of an exempt cosmetic manufacturer to determine compliance with this chapter and department rules, as applicable. A refusal to permit an authorized officer or employee of the department to enter the premises or to conduct an inspection is a violation of s. 499.005(6) and is grounds for disciplinary action pursuant to s. 499.066. 4. This paragraph does not exempt any person from any state or federal tax law, rule, regulation, or certificate or from any county or municipal law or ordinance that applies to cosmetic manufacturing. (q) Third party logistics provider permit.—A third party logistics provider permit is required for any person that contracts with a prescription drug wholesale distributor or prescription drug manufacturer to provide warehousing, distribution, or other logistics services on behalf of a manufacturer, wholesale distributor, or dispenser, but who does not take title to the prescription drug or have responsibility to direct the sale or disposition of the prescription drug. A third party logistics provider located outside of this state must be licensed in the state or territory from which the prescription drug is distributed by the third party logistics provider. If the state or territory from which the third party logistics provider originates does not require a license to operate as a third party logistics provider, the third party logistics provider must be licensed as a third party logistics provider as required by the federal act. Each third party logistics provider permittee shall comply with s. 499.0121 and other rules that the department requires. (r) Health care clinic establishment permit.—A health care clinic establishment permit is required for the purchase of a prescription drug by a place of business at one general physical location that provides health care or veterinary services, which is owned and operated by a business entity that has been issued a federal employer tax identification number. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term “qualifying practitioner” means a licensed health care practitioner defined in s. 456.001, or a veterinarian licensed under chapter 474, who is authorized under the appropriate practice act to prescribe and administer a prescription drug. 1. An establishment must provide, as part of the application required under s. 499.012, designation of a qualifying practitioner who will be responsible for complying with all legal and regulatory requirements related to the purchase, recordkeeping, storage, and handling of the prescription drugs. In addition, the designated qualifying practitioner shall be the practitioner whose name, establishment address, and license number is used on all distribution documents for prescription drugs purchased or returned by the health care clinic establishment. Upon initial appointment of a qualifying practitioner, the qualifying practitioner and the health care clinic establishment shall notify the department on a form furnished by the department within 10 days after such employment. In addition, the qualifying practitioner and health care clinic establishment shall notify the department within 10 days after any subsequent change. 2. The health care clinic establishment must employ a qualifying practitioner at each establishment. 3. In addition to the remedies and penalties provided in this part, a violation of this chapter by the health care clinic establishment or qualifying practitioner constitutes grounds for discipline of the qualifying practitioner by the appropriate regulatory board. 4. The purchase of prescription drugs by the health care clinic establishment is prohibited during any period of time when the establishment does not comply with this paragraph. 5. A health care clinic establishment permit is not a pharmacy permit or otherwise subject to chapter 465. A health care clinic establishment that meets the criteria of a modified Class II institutional pharmacy under s. 465.019 is not eligible to be permitted under this paragraph. 6. This paragraph does not apply to the purchase of a prescription drug by a licensed practitioner under his or her license. (3) A nonresident prescription drug manufacturer permit is not required for a manufacturer to distribute a prescription drug active pharmaceutical ingredient that it manufactures to a prescription drug manufacturer permitted in this state intended for research and development and not for resale or human use other than lawful clinical trials and biostudies authorized and regulated by federal law. A manufacturer claiming to be exempt from the permit requirements of this subsection and the prescription drug manufacturer purchasing and receiving the active pharmaceutical ingredient shall comply with the recordkeeping requirements of s. 499.0121(6). The prescription drug manufacturer purchasing and receiving the active pharmaceutical ingredient shall maintain on file a record of the FDA registration number; if available, the out-of-state license, permit, or registration number; and, if available, a copy of the most current FDA inspection report, for all manufacturers from whom they purchase active pharmaceutical ingredients under this section. The failure to comply with the requirements of this subsection, or rules adopted by the department to administer this subsection, for the purchase of prescription drug active pharmaceutical ingredients is a violation of s. 499.005(14), and a knowing failure is a violation of s. 499.0051(3). (a) The immediate package or container of a prescription drug active pharmaceutical ingredient distributed into the state that is intended for research and development under this subsection shall bear a label prominently displaying the statement: “Caution: Research and Development Only—Not for Manufacturing, Compounding, or Resale.” (b) A prescription drug manufacturer that obtains a prescription drug active pharmaceutical ingredient under this subsection for use in clinical trials and or biostudies authorized and regulated by federal law must create and maintain records detailing the specific clinical trials or biostudies for which the prescription drug active pharmaceutical ingredient was obtained. (4)(a) A permit issued under this part is not required to distribute a prescription drug active pharmaceutical ingredient from an establishment located in the United States to an establishment located in this state permitted as a prescription drug manufacturer under this part for use by the recipient in preparing, deriving, processing, producing, or fabricating a prescription drug finished dosage form at the establishment in this state where the product is received under an approved and otherwise valid New Drug Approval Application, Abbreviated New Drug Application, New Animal Drug Application, or Therapeutic Biologic Application, provided that the application, active pharmaceutical ingredient, or finished dosage form has not been withdrawn or removed from the market in this country for public health reasons. 1. Any distributor claiming exemption from permitting requirements pursuant to this paragraph shall maintain a license, permit, or registration to engage in the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs under the laws of the state from which the product is distributed. If the state from which the prescription drugs are distributed does not require a license to engage in the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs, the distributor must be licensed as a wholesale distributor as required by the federal act. 2. Any distributor claiming exemption from permitting requirements pursuant to this paragraph and the prescription drug manufacturer purchasing and receiving the active pharmaceutical ingredient shall comply with the recordkeeping requirements of s. 499.0121(6). (b) A permit issued under this part is not required to distribute a prescription drug that has not been repackaged from an establishment located in the United States to an establishment located in this state permitted as a prescription drug manufacturer under this part for research and development or to a holder of a letter of exemption issued by the department under s. 499.03(4) for research, teaching, or testing. 1. Any distributor claiming exemption from permitting requirements pursuant to this paragraph shall maintain a license, permit, or registration to engage in the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs under the laws of the state from which the product is distributed. If the state from which the prescription drugs are distributed does not require a license to engage in the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs, the distributor must be licensed as a wholesale distributor as required by the federal act. 2. All purchasers and recipients of any prescription drugs distributed pursuant to this paragraph shall ensure that the products are not resold or used, directly or indirectly, on humans except in lawful clinical trials and biostudies authorized and regulated by federal law. 3. Any distributor claiming exemption from permitting requirements pursuant to this paragraph, and the purchaser and recipient of the prescription drug, shall comply with the recordkeeping requirements of s. 499.0121(6). 4. The immediate package or container of any active pharmaceutical ingredient distributed into the state that is intended for teaching, testing, research, and development shall bear a label prominently displaying the statement: “Caution: Research, Teaching, or Testing Only – Not for Manufacturing, Compounding, or Resale.” (c) An out-of-state prescription drug wholesale distributor permit is not required for an intracompany sale or transfer of a prescription drug from an out-of-state establishment that is duly licensed as a prescription drug wholesale distributor in its state of residence to a licensed prescription drug wholesale distributor in this state, if both wholesale distributors conduct wholesale distributions of prescription drugs under the same business name. The recordkeeping requirements of s. 499.0121(6) must be followed for such transactions. (d) Persons receiving prescription drugs from a source claimed to be exempt from permitting requirements under this subsection shall maintain on file: 1. A record of the FDA establishment registration number, if any; 2. The resident state or federal license, registration, or permit that authorizes the source to distribute prescription drugs; and 3. A copy of the most recent resident state or FDA inspection report, for all distributors and establishments from whom they purchase or receive prescription drugs under this subsection. (e) All persons claiming exemption from permitting requirements pursuant to this subsection who engage in the distribution of prescription drugs within or into the state are subject to this part, including ss. 499.005 and 499.0051, and shall make available, within 48 hours, to the department on request all records related to any prescription drugs distributed under this subsection, including those records described in s. 499.051(4), regardless of the location where the records are stored. (f) A person purchasing and receiving a prescription drug from a person claimed to be exempt from licensing requirements pursuant to this subsection shall report to the department in writing within 14 days after receiving any product that is misbranded or adulterated or that fails to meet minimum standards set forth in the official compendium or state or federal good manufacturing practices for identity, purity, potency, or sterility, regardless of whether the product is thereafter rehabilitated, quarantined, returned, or destroyed. (g) The department may adopt rules to administer this subsection which are necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. Failure to comply with the requirements of this subsection, or rules adopted by the department to administer this subsection, is a violation of s. 499.005(14), and a knowing failure is a violation of s. 499.0051(3).

Each such manufacturer must be permitted by the department and comply with all of the provisions required of a prescription drug manufacturer under this part. The department shall adopt rules for issuing a virtual nonresident prescription drug manufacturer permit to a person who engages in the manufacture of prescription drugs but does not make or take physical possession of any prescription drugs. The rules adopted by the department under this section may exempt virtual nonresident manufacturers from certain establishment, security, and storage requirements set forth in s. 499.0121. 1. A person that distributes prescription drugs for which the person is not the manufacturer must also obtain an out-of-state prescription drug wholesale distributor permit, an international prescription drug wholesale distributor permit, or third party logistics provider permit pursuant to this section to engage in the distribution of such prescription drugs when required by this part. This subparagraph does not apply to a manufacturer that distributes prescription drugs only for the manufacturer of the prescription drugs where both manufacturers are affiliates. 2. Any such person must comply with the licensing or permitting requirements of the jurisdiction in which the establishment is located and the federal act, and any prescription drug distributed into this state must comply with this part. If a person intends to import prescription drugs from a foreign country into this state, the nonresident prescription drug manufacturer must provide to the department a list identifying each prescription drug it intends to import and document approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration for such importation. 3.a. A nonresident prescription drug manufacturer that has registered to participate in the International Prescription Drug Importation Program pursuant to this section is not required to provide the list and approval required by subparagraph 2. for prescription drugs imported under that program. b. To participate as an exporter of prescription drugs into this state under the International Prescription Drug Importation Program established under s. 499.0285, a nonresident prescription drug manufacturer located outside of the United States must register with the Department of Business and Professional Regulation before engaging in any activities under that section. Such manufacturer must be licensed or permitted in a country with which the United States has a current mutual recognition agreement, cooperation agreement, memorandum of understanding, or other federal mechanism recognizing the country’s adherence to current good manufacturing practices for pharmaceutical products. c. The department shall adopt rules governing the financial responsibility of a nonresident prescription drug manufacturer licensee or permittee. The rules will establish, at a minimum, financial reporting requirements, standards for financial capability to perform the functions governed by the permit, and requirements for ensuring permittees and their contractors can be held accountable for the financial consequences of any act of malfeasance or misfeasance or fraudulent or dishonest act or acts committed by the permittee or its contractors. * * * * * (s) International prescription drug wholesale distributor.— 1. A wholesale distributor located outside of the United States must obtain an international prescription drug wholesale distributor permit to engage in the wholesale exportation and distribution of prescription drugs in the state under the International Prescription Drug Importation Program established in s. 499.0285. The wholesale distributor must be licensed or permitted to operate in a country with which the United States has a mutual recognition agreement, cooperation agreement, memorandum of understanding, or other federal mechanism recognizing the country’s adherence to current good manufacturing practices for pharmaceutical products. The wholesale distributor must maintain at all times a license or permit to engage in the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs in compliance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which it operates. An international prescription drug wholesale distributor permit may not be issued to a wholesale distributor if the jurisdiction in which the wholesale distributor operates does not require a license to engage in the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs. 2. The department shall adopt rules governing the financial responsibility of an international prescription drug wholesale distributor permittee. The rules will establish, at a minimum, financial reporting requirements, standards for financial capability to perform the functions governed by the permit, and requirements for ensuring permittees and their contractors can be held accountable for the financial consequences of any act of malfeasance or misfeasance or fraudulent or dishonest act or acts committed by the permittee or its contractors.

The rules will establish, at a minimum, financial reporting requirements, standards for financial capability to perform the functions governed by the permit, and requirements for ensuring permittees and their contractors can be held accountable for the financial consequences of any act of malfeasance or misfeasance or fraudulent or dishonest act or acts committed by the permittee or its contractors.Note.—Subsection (2) intro. former s. 499.012(2) intro.; paragraph (2)(c) former s. 499.012(2)(e); paragraph (2)(d) former s. 499.012(2)(a); paragraph (2)(e) former s. 499.012(2)(c); paragraph (2)(f) former s. 499.012(2)(d); paragraph (2)(g) former s. 499.014; paragraph (2)(i) former s. 499.012(2)(f); paragraph (2)(k) former s. 499.012(2)(g); paragraph (2)(l) former s. 499.012(2)(h); paragraph (2)(n) former s. 499.012(2)(b); paragraph (2)(o) former s. 499.013(2)(c); paragraph (2)(p) former s. 499.013(2)(b); paragraph (2)(q) former s. 499.013(2)(d); paragraph (2)(r) former s. 499.013(2)(e).",

      "text": "499.83 Permits.— (1) A person or entity that intends to distribute medical gas within or into this state, unless exempted under this part, must obtain the applicable permit before operating as: (a) A medical gas wholesale distributor; (b) A medical gas manufacturer; or (c) A medical oxygen retail establishment. (2) The following permits are established: (a) Medical gas wholesale distributor permit.—A medical gas wholesale distributor permit is required for wholesale distribution, whether within or into this state. A medical gas must remain in the original container obtained by the wholesale distributor and the wholesale distributor may not engage in further manufacturing operations unless it possesses a medical gas manufacturer permit. A medical gas wholesale distributor may not possess or engage in the wholesale distribution of a prescription drug that is not a medical gas or distribute a medical gas other than by wholesale distribution unless otherwise authorized under this chapter. (b) Medical gas manufacturer permit.—A medical gas manufacturer permit is required for a person or entity located in this state which engages in the manufacture of medical gases by physical air separation, chemical action, purification, or filling containers by a liquid-to-liquid, liquid-to-gas, or gas-to-gas process and distributes those medical gases within this state. 1. A permitted medical gas manufacturer may not manufacture or possess a prescription drug other than a medical gas, unless otherwise authorized under this chapter. 2. A permitted medical gas manufacturer may not distribute a medical gas without obtaining the applicable permit, except that it may engage in wholesale distribution of medical gases that it manufactured without obtaining a medical gas wholesale distributor permit if it complies with this part and the rules adopted under this part that apply to a wholesale distributor. 3. A permitted medical gas manufacturer shall comply with all of the requirements applicable to a wholesale distributor under this part and all appropriate state and federal good manufacturing practices. (c) Medical oxygen retail establishment permit.—A medical oxygen retail establishment permit is required for an entity that is located in the state and that sells or delivers medical oxygen directly to patients in this state. The sale and delivery must be based on a prescription or an order from a practitioner authorized by law to prescribe. A pharmacy licensed under chapter 465 does not require a permit as a medical oxygen retail establishment. 1. A medical oxygen retail establishment may not possess, purchase, sell, or trade a medical gas other than medical oxygen, unless otherwise authorized under this chapter. 2. A medical oxygen retail establishment may fill and deliver medical oxygen to an individual patient based on an order from a practitioner authorized by law to prescribe. The medical oxygen retail establishment must comply with all appropriate state and federal good manufacturing practices. Medical oxygen sold or delivered by a medical oxygen retail establishment pursuant to an order from a practitioner may not be returned into the retail establishment’s inventory. 3. A medical oxygen retail establishment shall comply with all of the requirements applicable to a wholesale distributor under this part, except for those requirements that pertain solely to nitrous oxide. (3) An out-of-state wholesale distributor that engages in wholesale distribution into this state must be legally authorized to engage in the wholesale distribution of medical gases as a wholesale distributor in the state in which it resides and provide proof of registration as set forth in s. 499.93(3), if required. (4) A wholesale distributor may not operate from a place of residence, and a place of residence may not be granted a permit or operate under this part, except for the on-call delivery of home care oxygen for wholesale distributors that also maintain a medical oxygen retail establishment permit. (5) If wholesale distribution is conducted at more than one location within this state or more than one location distributing into this state, each location must be permitted by the department. (6) A hospice licensed by the Agency for Health Care Administration pursuant to part IV of chapter 400 is not required to obtain a medical oxygen retail establishment permit to purchase on behalf of and sell medical oxygen to its hospice patients if the hospice contracts for the purchase and delivery of medical oxygen from an establishment permitted pursuant to this part. Sale and delivery to patients by hospices pursuant to this subsection must be based upon a prescription or an order from a practitioner authorized by law to prescribe medical oxygen. For sales to hospices pursuant to this subsection, the medical gas wholesale distributor or the medical gas manufacturer selling medical oxygen to a hospice shall reflect on its invoice the hospice license number provided by the Agency for Health Care Administration and shall maintain such record pursuant to s. 499.89. Both the hospice and the medical oxygen retailer delivering medical oxygen to the patient must maintain a copy of a valid order or prescription for medical oxygen in accordance with s. 499.89 and department rule, which copy must be readily available for inspection.
