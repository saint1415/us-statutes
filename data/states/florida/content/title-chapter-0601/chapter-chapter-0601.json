      "text": "601.02 Purposes.—This chapter is passed: (1) In the exercise of the police power to protect health and welfare and to stabilize and protect the citrus industry of the state. (2) Because the planting, growing, cultivating, spraying, pruning, and fertilizing of citrus groves and the harvesting, hauling, processing, packing, canning, and concentrating of the citrus crop produced thereon is the major agricultural enterprise of Florida and, together with the sale and distribution of said crop, affects the health, morals, and general economy of a vast number of citizens of the state who are either directly or indirectly dependent thereon for a livelihood, and said business is therefore of vast public interest. (3) Because it is wise, necessary, and expedient to protect and enhance the quality and reputation of Florida citrus fruit and the canned and concentrated products thereof in domestic and foreign markets. (4) To provide means whereby producers, packers, canners, and concentrators of citrus fruit and the canned and concentrated products thereof may secure prompt and efficient inspection and classification of grades of citrus fruit and the canned and concentrated products thereof at reasonable costs, it being hereby recognized that the standardization of the citrus fruit industry of Florida by the proper grading and classification of citrus fruit and the canned and concentrated products thereof by prompt and efficient inspection under competent authority is beneficial alike to producer, packer, shipper, canner, concentrator, carrier, receiver, and consumer in that it furnishes them prima facie evidence of the quality and condition of such products and informs the carrier and receiver of the quality of the products carried and received by them and assures the ultimate consumer of the quality of the products purchased. (5) To enable citrus producers collectively to pay assessments to fund marketing and research programs for the direct benefit of the citrus industry of this state. It is the intent of the Legislature that all funds collected under this chapter and the interest accrued on such funds are consideration for a social contract between the state and the citrus growers of the state whereby the state must hold such funds in trust and inviolate and use them only for the purposes prescribed in this chapter. (6) To stabilize the Florida citrus industry and to protect the public against fraud, deception, and financial loss through unscrupulous practices and haphazard methods in connection with the processing and marketing of citrus fruit and the canned or concentrated products thereof. (7) Because said act is designed to promote the general welfare of the Florida citrus industry, which in turn will promote the general welfare and social and political economy of the state. In the event any word, phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph, or section of this chapter is declared unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then such declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect the remainder of this chapter, and the unconstitutional portion shall be considered severable, it being the intent of the Legislature that the remainder of this chapter shall continue in full force and effect.

(a) The payment of such or similar benefits to its employees in foreign countries, including, but not limited to, social security, retirement, and other similar fringe benefit costs, may be in accordance with laws in effect in the country of employment, except that no benefits will be payable to employees not authorized for other state employees, as provided in the Career Service System. (b) The department may loan department employees to or share department employees with other state and federal agencies, state universities, or the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services for marketing and promotion orders authorized under the authority of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services or its direct-support organizations or for orders adopted under the authority of the United States Secretary of Agriculture. The department may enter into agreements with such entity or entities under such terms and conditions as will benefit the State of Florida, if the agency or entity with which the employee is loaned or shared reimburses the State of Florida for all pay and benefits of the employee, not including a service fee for administration. If the entity directly pays the loaned or shared employee his or her salary and benefits, as applicable, an agreement with the department is not necessary and the employee may work part time with the department under terms and conditions mutually agreed to by the department and the employee. All arrangements made pursuant to this paragraph are subject to prior approval by the department. Except as otherwise provided, loans and agreements must comply with s. 112.24.

(7) To adopt, amend or repeal, and enforce rules that establish minimum maturity and quality standards for citrus fruits not inconsistent with existing laws or that regulate and control methods and practices followed or used in harvesting, grading, packing, extracting, canning, concentrating, sectionizing, or otherwise processing citrus fruits or citrus juices or the products thereof for human consumption, including the addition or prohibition of any and all additives, and including application to or use of coloring matter thereon and coloring of fruit by placing in a degreening room with or without use of heat or any form of gas in such process, to the end that such methods and practices as affect the eating and keeping qualities and depreciate the value of citrus fruits or the juices or other food products thereof in any form may be minimized to the greatest extent possible, if not altogether eliminated. (8)(a) To prepare and disseminate information of importance to citrus growers, handlers, shippers, processors, and industry-related and interested persons and organizations relating to department activities and the production, handling, shipping, processing, and marketing of citrus fruit and processed citrus products. For referendum and other notice and informational purposes, the department may prepare and maintain, from the best available sources, a citrus grower mailing list. Such list shall be a public record available as other public records but is not subject to the purging provisions of s. 283.55. (b) Any nonpublished reports or data related to studies or research conducted, caused to be conducted, or funded by the department under s. 601.13 is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. (9) When, in the opinion of the department, revenues collected pursuant to assessments levied under this chapter, whether allocated for research, advertising or promotion, reserve funds, advertising incentive plans, or other purposes, are not immediately needed for the purpose for which such funds are provided, the Chief Financial Officer is authorized and shall, upon the request and approval of the department, or its executive director if she or he has been given such authority, invest and reinvest the funds designated and for the period of time specified in such request. In the investment of such funds, the Chief Financial Officer has the powers and is subject to the limitations provided for in s. 17.61. (10) Subject to the concurrence of the Chief Financial Officer, whenever the department contracts with a foreign entity for performance of services or the purchase of materials and such contract requires payment in equivalent foreign currency, the department may, for payment of such contract obligation, deposit sufficient state funds in a foreign bank, or purchase foreign currency at the current market rate, up to an amount not in excess of the contract obligation. All payments from these funds must have prior audit approval from the office of the Chief Financial Officer. (11) To conduct an annual merchandising and management meeting in this state for department field personnel and to make direct payment, by means of vendor contracts approved by the commission, for all necessary lodging, meals, facilities, and training expenses for department employees attending such annual meeting, in lieu of payment of individual employee per diem allowances as established by s. 112.061. (12) Notwithstanding part I of chapter 287, to adopt rules for the purpose of entering into contracts that are primarily for promotional and advertising services and promotional events, which may include commodities involving a service. Such rules shall include the authority to negotiate costs with the offerors of such services and commodities who have been determined to be qualified on the basis of technical merit, creative ability, and professional competency. Contracts pursuant to this subsection may provide for advance payments when the department determines that such provision is essential to acquiring the service. (13) To investigate or address the transportation problems affecting the citrus industry. (14) To investigate or research the mechanical harvesting of citrus fruit grown in the state. (15) To provide by rule a list of forms used in conducting its business. The adoption of such rule constitutes sufficient notice to the public of the existence of the forms and negates the need to place specific citation to such list throughout the related chapters of the Florida Administrative Code.

(2)(a) Upon the determination by the department that an emergency exists that creates abnormal conditions in the state’s citrus industry, the department, in addition to all other powers and authority provided by law, may adopt emergency rules pursuant to s. 120.54(4) that temporarily modify the maturity standards previously adopted by rule. (b) An emergency rule adopted under this subsection does not take effect unless the emergency rule is adopted by the affirmative vote of at least seven members of the commission. Notwithstanding the limitation on the effective period for emergency rules in s. 120.54(4)(c), each such emergency rule adopted under this section must contain an expiration date of not later than 1 year after its effective date.

      "text": "601.152 Special marketing orders.— (1)(a) Whenever, upon its own motion or upon petition of any handler or producer or group or association of handlers or producers of citrus fruit, the commission, upon affirmative vote of seven of its members, determines: 1. That the conduct of a special advertising and promotional marketing campaign or the conduct of market and product research and development, in addition to the advertising campaign being conducted pursuant to s. 601.15 and the research being conducted pursuant to the other provisions of the Florida Citrus Code, may substantially further increase the consumer acceptance and consumption of, and strengthen the market for, any type, variety, or form of citrus fruit or processed citrus product by further increasing the number of families buying such citrus fruit or such processed citrus product or by further increasing the quantity of such citrus fruit or processed citrus product purchased by buying families; and 2. That such substantial further increase and strengthening may be of substantial benefit to handlers thereof, producers thereof, and to the economy and well-being of the state, the commission shall direct that a proposed marketing order be formulated for a special marketing campaign of advertising and sales promotion, including, but not limited to, brand advertising rebate promotions or the conduct of market and product research and development for such type, variety, or form of citrus fruit or processed citrus product, and shall designate a public hearing to consider adoption and implementation of such proposed marketing order. (b) Notice of the time, place, and purpose of such public hearing shall be: 1. Mailed, at least 10 days before such hearing, to each handler who, during the 12 months immediately before such mailing, has first handled in the primary channel of trade in the state the type, variety, and form of citrus fruit or citrus product specified in the proposed marketing order, and to each handler who the department has good cause to believe will, during the period of time covered by the proposed marketing order, first handle in the primary channel of trade in the state the type, variety, and form of citrus fruit or processed citrus product specified in such proposed marketing order. 2. Published in the Florida Administrative Register at least 10 days before such hearing. (c) A full and complete record of all proceedings at such public hearing shall be made and filed by the department at its offices, which record, when signed by the chair of the commission and authenticated by the seal of the department, shall constitute prima facie evidence of such proceedings in all courts of this state. (d) Copies of the proposed marketing order shall be made available to the public at the offices of the department at least 5 days before such hearing and shall be in sufficient detail to apprise all persons having an interest therein of the approximate amount of moneys proposed to be expended; the assessments to be levied thereunder; and the general details of the proposed marketing order for a special marketing campaign of advertising or sales promotion or market or product research and development. Among the details so specified shall be the period of time during which the assessment imposed pursuant to subsection (8) will be levied upon the privilege so assessed, which period may not be greater than 2 years. The order may, however, provide that the expenditure of the funds received from the imposition of such assessments shall not be so confined but may be expended during such time or times as shall be specified in the proposed marketing order, which may be either during the shipping season immediately preceding the shipping seasons during which such assessments are imposed or during, or at any time subsequent to, the shipping seasons during which such assessments are imposed. This section does not prevent the imposition of a subsequent marketing order before, during, or after the expenditure of funds collected under a previously imposed marketing order, provided the aggregate of the assessments imposed may not exceed the maximum permitted under subsection (8). (e) A proposed marketing order shall specify the type, variety, and form of citrus fruit or processed citrus product to be covered by the order and whether it applies: 1. To such citrus fruit or processed citrus product if it was so packed or processed from fruit first placed in the primary channel of trade in Florida during the period of time specified in the marketing order for the imposition of such assessments, or 2. To such citrus fruit or processed citrus product if it was so packed, processed, or shipped in such type, variety, and form during the period of time specified in the marketing order for the imposition of such assessments. (f) If a marketing order provides for a brand advertising rebate promotion, the details specified shall include the requirements which must be met by the handler, broker, distributor, or grower in order to be eligible for rebate of advertising or promotional expenditures; the amount, or a method for computing the amount, rebatable; and the procedure for making rebates. (g) Any marketing order may provide that policy decisions with respect to details not specifically set forth in such marketing order may be made either by the commission upon its own motion or by the commission upon the recommendation of any handlers’ committee that may be established by the order. Otherwise such policy decisions shall be made by the commission. (2) After such notice and hearing, the commission shall determine whether or not implementation of the new special marketing order, as originally proposed or as amended at the public hearing, will substantially further increase the consumer acceptance and consumption of the citrus fruit or processed citrus product specified in such marketing order and that such substantial further increase in the consumer acceptance and consumption thereof will be of substantial benefit to the handlers and producers thereof and to the economy and well-being of the state. If the commission so determines and if it adopts a marketing order, the commission shall direct that such marketing order be subjected to a referendum of the handlers who have, during a representative period to be selected by the commission, handled in the primary channel of trade in Florida the type, variety, and form of citrus fruit or processed citrus product specified in such marketing order. (3) No marketing order adopted pursuant to this section shall be effective unless and until the commission, at a public meeting, determines such marketing order to have been assented to by referendum by at least 67 percent of the handlers covered by the marketing order who, during the representative period determined by the commission, first handled in the primary channel of trade in Florida not less than 51 percent of the total volume of the type, variety, and form of citrus fruit or processed citrus product specified in the marketing order. (4) The department may prescribe such procedures as it deems necessary properly to conduct a referendum among handlers covered by the marketing order to determine whether such marketing order has been so assented to. (5)(a) Any marketing order adopted under this section and subsequently approved by referendum as provided in this section shall take effect 15 days after referendum approval is officially determined by the commission. Chapter 120 does not apply to this section. Any such marketing order is reviewable by any person adversely affected, by certiorari to the district courts of appeal in the manner prescribed by the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure. The venue of the proceeding for such review shall be the appellate district that includes the county in which the hearings were conducted or, if the venue cannot be determined, the appellate district in which the department’s executive offices are located. (b) In cases in which certiorari is granted pursuant to this section, the court may issue its mandate or order with directions to the agency to enter in the proceedings as is appropriate on the record, or the court may remand the cause for such further proceedings, including the taking of testimony, as may to the court seem necessary or proper: 1. To accord the parties due process of law; 2. To establish a sufficient record for review; 3. To accord the parties their constitutional, statutory, or procedural rights; or 4. To accomplish the purposes and objectives of the law pursuant to which the administrative proceeding was initiated. (6) Any marketing order so implemented under this section may be amended subsequent to its implementation, provided such amendment has been formulated, published, subjected to public hearing, determined by the commission to meet the requirements set forth in the other subsections hereof, and assented to in the same manner and in accordance with all of the procedures and requirements set forth in this section for implementation of the original marketing order. Any such amendment may: (a) Terminate, extend, accelerate, or defer the conduct of the campaign. (b) Defer for one or more shipping seasons the imposition of assessments thereunder. (c) Extend by not more than 2 additional years the period of time during which the assessments imposed pursuant to subsection (8) may be levied upon the privilege so assessed. (d) Increase (subject to the maximum limitations imposed herein) or reduce the assessments or the amount of moneys to be expended. (e) Alter the general details of the campaign. (f) Otherwise amend the originally implemented marketing order. (7) For the purpose of carrying out any and all provisions of this section, the department, or its duly authorized or designated representative or representatives, may hold hearings, take testimony, and administer oaths. Copies of the proceedings, records, and acts of the department and the handlers’ committee, if any, established by the marketing order and certificates purporting to relate the facts concerning such proceedings, records, and acts signed by the chair of the commission and authenticated by the seal of the department shall be prima facie evidence thereof in all the courts of the state. (8)(a) Each person who, during the period specified in any marketing order implemented under this section, first handles in the primary channel of trade in the state any citrus fruit or processed citrus product of the type, variety, and form specified in such marketing order shall, for the privilege of so handling such citrus fruit or such citrus product, pay to the department such assessments as are levied and imposed thereon by such marketing order, which funds shall be used by the department to defray the necessary expenses incurred in the formation, issuance, administration, and enforcement of such marketing order and in the conduct of the special marketing campaign or market and product research and development provided for in such marketing order. However, such assessments levied and imposed under this section may not exceed 8 cents per standard-packed box on citrus fruits in fresh form, 1.3 cents per gallon on single strength citrus juices or sections, or 1.3 cents per pound of soluble citrus solids on concentrated citrus juices. (b) The department shall prescribe procedures for the assessment and collection of such funds to defray the necessary expenses incurred, or expected to be incurred, by the department in the formation, issuance, administration, and enforcement of any marketing order implemented under this section. (c) Every handler shall, at such times as the department may require, file with the department a return, not under oath, on forms to be prescribed and furnished by the department, certified as true and correct, stating the quantity of the type, variety, and form of citrus fruit or citrus product specified in the marketing order first handled in the primary channels of trade in the state by such handler during the period of time specified in the marketing order. Such returns must contain any further information deemed by the department to be reasonably necessary to properly administer or enforce this section or any marketing order implemented under this section. (d) All assessments imposed under this section are due and payable and shall be paid by such handlers at such times and in such installments as the commission prescribes in such marketing order, or the amount thereof shall be provided for and guaranteed by giving a surety bond or cash deposit or as the department otherwise prescribes. (9)(a) All moneys collected by the department under this section shall be set aside in the Florida Citrus Advertising Trust Fund as a special fund to be known as the “Citrus Special Marketing Order Fund.” All moneys in such fund, after deducting the service charge provided in s. 601.15(7), are appropriated to the department for the actual expenses incurred by the department for the formulation, issuance, administration, and enforcement of any marketing order so implemented and in the conduct of the special marketing campaign or market and product research and development to be carried out pursuant to any such marketing order so implemented. Upon the completion of the special marketing campaign or market and product research and development provided for pursuant to any marketing order so implemented, any and all moneys remaining and not required by the department to defray the expenses of such marketing order shall be deposited to and made a part of the Florida Citrus Advertising Trust Fund created by s. 601.15. (b) If the department finds it necessary, the department may transfer to the Citrus Special Marketing Order Fund from any other portion of the Florida Citrus Advertising Trust Fund, including the Emergency Reserve Fund and any other special or reserve fund, such sum of money as the department determines is initially required to formulate, issue, administer, and enforce any such marketing order and conduct the special marketing campaign or market and product research and development to be carried out pursuant to such marketing order until moneys in the Citrus Special Marketing Order Fund derived from assessments imposed and collected pursuant to this section are sufficient for such purposes and thereafter repay such advance out of the Citrus Special Marketing Order Fund. (10)(a) Any handler who fails to file a return or to pay any assessment within the time required shall thereby forfeit to the department a penalty of 5 percent of the amount of assessment then due, but the department, upon good cause shown, may waive all or any part of such penalty. Such penalty shall be paid to the department and disposed of as provided with respect to moneys derived from the assessments imposed under this section. (b) The department may collect the assessments imposed under this section by any of the following methods: 1. The voluntary payment by the handler liable therefor. 2. By a suit at law. 3. By a suit in equity to enjoin and restrain any handler owing such assessments from operating his or her business or engaging in business as a citrus fruit dealer until the delinquent assessments are paid. Such action may include an accounting to determine the amount of assessments plus delinquencies due. In any such proceeding, it shall not be necessary to allege or prove that an adequate remedy at law does not exist. (11) This section shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes set forth and as additional and supplemental powers vested in the department under the police power of this state.

      "text": "601.155 Equalizing assessment; credit; exemption.— (1) The first person who exercises in this state the privilege of processing, reprocessing, blending, or mixing processed orange products or processed grapefruit products or the privilege of packaging or repackaging processed orange products or processed grapefruit products into retail or institutional size containers or, except as provided in subsection (9) or except if an assessment is levied and collected on the exercise of one of the foregoing privileges, the first person having title to or possession of any processed orange product or any processed grapefruit product who exercises the privilege in this state of storing such product or removing any portion of such product from the original container in which it arrived in this state for purposes other than official inspection or direct consumption by the consumer and not for resale shall be assessed and shall pay an assessment upon the exercise of such privilege at the rate described in subsection (2). (2) Upon the exercise of any privilege described in subsection (1), the assessment levied by this section shall be at the same rate per box of oranges or grapefruit utilized in the initial production of the processed citrus products so handled as that imposed, at the time of exercise of the assessable privilege, by s. 601.15 per box of oranges. (3) For the purposes of this section, the number of boxes of oranges or grapefruit utilized in the initial production of processed citrus products subject to the assessable privilege shall be: (a) The actual number of boxes so utilized, if known and verified in accordance with department rules; or (b) An equivalent number established by department rule which, on the basis of existing data, reasonably equates to the quantity of citrus contained in the product, when the actual number of boxes so utilized is not known or properly verified. (4) For purposes of this section: (a) “Processed orange products” means products for human consumption consisting of 20 percent or more single strength equivalent orange juice; orange sections, segments, or edible components; or whole peeled fruit. (b) “Processed grapefruit products” means products for human consumption consisting of 20 percent or more single strength equivalent grapefruit juice; grapefruit sections, segments, or edible components; or whole peeled fruit. (c) “Original container” includes any vessel, tanker or tank car, or other transport vehicle. (d) “Retail or institutional container” means a container having a capacity of 10 gallons or less. (5) Products made in whole or in part from citrus fruit on which an equivalent assessment is levied pursuant to s. 601.15 are exempt from the assessment imposed by this section. In the case of products made in part from citrus fruit exempt from the assessment imposed by this section, it shall be the burden of the persons liable for the assessment to show the department, through competent evidence, proof of that part which is not subject to an assessable privilege. (6) Every person liable for the assessment imposed by this section shall keep a complete and accurate record of the receipt, storage, handling, exercise of any assessable privilege under this section, and shipment of all products subject to the assessment imposed by this section. Such record shall be preserved for a period of 1 year and shall be offered for inspection upon oral or written request by the department or its duly authorized agent. (7) Every person liable for the assessment imposed by this section shall, at such times and in such manner as the department may by rule require, file with the department a return, certified as true and correct, on forms to be prescribed and furnished by the department, stating, in addition to other information reasonably required by the department, the number of units of processed orange or grapefruit products subject to this section upon which any assessable privilege under this section was exercised during the period of time covered by the return. Full payment of assessments due for the period reported shall accompany each return. (8) All assessments levied and imposed by this section shall be due and payable within 61 days after the first of the assessable privileges is exercised in this state. Periodic payment of the assessments imposed by this section by the person first exercising the assessable privileges and liable for such payment shall be permitted only in accordance with department rules, and the payment thereof shall be guaranteed by the posting of an appropriate certificate of deposit, approved surety bond, letter of credit from an issuing financial institution located in the United States, or cash deposit in an amount and manner as prescribed by the department. (9) When any processed orange or grapefruit product is stored or removed from its original container as provided in subsection (1), the equalizing assessment is levied on such storage or removal, and such product is subsequently shipped out of the state in a vessel, tanker or tank car, or container having a capacity greater than 10 gallons, the person who is liable for the assessment shall be entitled to an assessment refund, if such assessment has been paid, or to an assessment credit, provided she or he can provide satisfactory proof that such product has been shipped out of the state and that no privilege assessable under subsection (1) other than storage or removal from the original container was exercised before such shipment out of the state. (10) Notwithstanding any provision of law, the department shall develop a process by which any person liable for the assessment imposed under this section may annually object to payment of the assessment. Any such objection must be allowed without discretion as to the validity thereof, and that person shall be granted the immediate right to elect not to pay two-thirds of the applicable assessment. The department may not expend any of the remaining one-third of the applicable assessment on any advertising, marketing, or public relations activities to which any person liable for the assessment imposed under this section objects; however, such funds may be used for research, administrative, and regulatory activities. Effective July 1, 2004, upon any necessary legislative appropriation of moneys due under the settlement agreement of Consolidated Case No. 2002-CA-4686 in the Circuit Court of the Tenth Judicial Circuit in Polk County, the plaintiffs shall agree to the dismissal of their claim under the foreign commerce clause with prejudice. (11) All assessments levied and collected under this section, including penalties, shall be paid into the State Treasury to be made a part of the Florida Citrus Advertising Trust Fund in the same manner, for the same purposes, and in the same proportions as set forth in s. 601.15(7). Any person failing to file a return or pay any assessment within the time required shall thereby forfeit to the department a penalty of 5 percent of the amount of assessment then due, but the department, on good cause shown, may waive all or any part of such penalty. (12) This section shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes set forth and as additional and supplemental powers vested in the department under the police power of this state.

The costs expected to be incurred during the then-current shipping season by the Bureau of Citrus Inspection in performing its duties with respect to such citrus fruit and by the Bureau of Citrus Technical Control in performing its duties with respect to such citrus fruit; 2. A pro rata portion of the costs expected to be incurred during the then-current shipping season by the Bureau of Citrus License and Bond; 3. A pro rata portion of the costs expected to be incurred during the then-current shipping season, by the Department of Agriculture through its cooperative agreement with the United States Department of Agriculture, which are directly attributable to the estimation of the size of the citrus crop in Florida; and 4. The amount, if any, by which the costs actually incurred with respect to the foregoing during the preceding shipping season may have exceeded the income received during that season, or less the amounts, if any, by which the income received during the preceding shipping season may have exceeded the costs actually incurred with respect to the foregoing during that season. For the purpose of this subparagraph, income received during the preceding season shall be deemed to include all fees collected under this paragraph, plus a pro rata portion of all fees collected under s. 601.59, plus a pro rata portion of all fines and penalties collected pursuant to this chapter, and plus all interest earned on the investment of the foregoing funds. (b) Upon each unit, as defined by the Department of Citrus, of citrus fruit inspected and certified for shipment in fresh form as gift fruit or for sale at roadside retail fruit stands, such fee, to be fixed annually promptly following the release by the United States Department of Agriculture of the October citrus crop estimate, as is determined by the Department of Agriculture to be necessary to pay: 1. The costs expected to be incurred during the then-current shipping season by the Bureau of Citrus Inspection in performing its duties with respect to such citrus fruit and by the Bureau of Citrus Technical Control in performing its duties with respect to such citrus fruit; 2. A pro rata portion of the costs expected to be incurred during the then-current shipping season by the Bureau of Citrus License and Bond; 3. A pro rata portion of the costs expected to be incurred during the then-current shipping season by the Department of Agriculture through its cooperative agreement with the United States Department of Agriculture which are directly attributable to the estimation of the size of the citrus crop in Florida; and 4.

For the purpose of this subparagraph, income received during the preceding shipping season shall be deemed to include all fees collected under this paragraph, plus a pro rata portion of all fees collected under s. 601.59, plus a pro rata portion of all fines and penalties collected pursuant to this chapter, and all interest earned on the investment of the foregoing funds. (c) Upon each standard-packed box or equivalent thereof of citrus fruit inspected and certified for processing, such fee, to be fixed annually promptly following the release by the United States Department of Agriculture of the October citrus crop estimate, as is determined by the Department of Agriculture to be necessary to pay: 1. The costs expected to be incurred during the then-current shipping season by the Bureau of Citrus Inspection in performing its duties with respect to such citrus fruit and by the Bureau of Citrus Technical Control in performing its duties with respect to such citrus fruit; 2.

For the purpose of this subparagraph, income received during the preceding shipping season shall be deemed to include all fees collected under this paragraph, a pro rata portion of all fees collected under s. 601.59, a pro rata portion of all fines and penalties collected pursuant to this chapter, and all interest earned on the investments of the foregoing funds. (d) Upon each standard case of 24 No. 2 cans, or the equivalent thereof, of processed citrus products inspected and certified within this state, such fee, to be fixed annually promptly following the release by the United States Department of Agriculture of the October citrus crop estimate, as is determined by the Department of Agriculture to be necessary to pay: 1. The costs expected to be incurred during the then-current shipping season by the Bureau of Citrus Inspection, through the cooperative agreement between the Department of Agriculture and the United States Department of Agriculture, in performing its duties with respect to processed citrus products; and 2. The amount, if any, by which the costs actually incurred with respect to the foregoing during the preceding shipping season may have exceeded the fees collected under this paragraph during that season, or less the amount, if any, by which the fees collected under this paragraph during the preceding shipping season may have exceeded the costs actually incurred with respect to the foregoing during that season. (2)(a) Costs and income required to be prorated under the terms of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of subsection (1) shall be prorated on the basis of the number of boxes on which fees were assessed under the particular paragraph as compared to the total number of boxes of citrus fruit delivered into the primary channel of trade during the particular shipping season. Expenditures of funds for estimation of the size of the citrus crop in Florida by the Department of Agriculture through its cooperative agreement with the United States Department of Agriculture shall be for service and research work related to estimating and forecasting citrus production in Florida, including, but not limited to, tree counts, using aerial photography and ground surveys, fruit counts, fruit measurement, maturity and yield surveys, damage surveys, opinion surveys, season average price determinations, and related activities. (b) If, after the release of the October citrus crop estimate, a subsequent citrus crop estimate is so substantially different that any of the foregoing fees fixed following the October estimate are determined by the Department of Agriculture to be insufficient to pay the estimated costs expected to be incurred as set forth in the preceding paragraphs, then the Department of Agriculture shall determine the fee necessary to pay such estimated costs based upon such revised citrus crop estimate and shall amend such fee accordingly. (c) In fixing the foregoing fees, the Department of Agriculture shall provide for adequate reserves to pay costs expected to be incurred during those periods when costs are expected to exceed income. (d) The computations of the fees provided for herein and information as to the data upon which they are based shall be furnished by the Department of Agriculture upon request to any person liable for fees hereunder. (3)(a) All fees levied by this section shall be applicable retroactively to a date to be fixed by the Department of Agriculture. Such fees shall be paid to the Department of Agriculture or the payment thereof guaranteed by the person who is the owner or operator of the facility at which the citrus fruit or processed citrus products so certified are handled under the provisions of this chapter. Payment of such fees shall be due upon the certification of the citrus fruit or processed citrus products and shall be paid periodically under such rules and regulations as shall be prescribed by the Department of Agriculture. Payment shall be secured by the filing and posting of a bond or cash deposit in the form and amount required by the Department of Agriculture. (b) All fees levied and collected under the provisions of this section shall be paid into the State Treasury on or before the 15th day of each month. Such moneys shall be deposited to and made a part of the Citrus Inspection Trust Fund and are hereby appropriated to the Department of Agriculture to be used to pay the costs incurred in its performance of the duties of the Bureau of Citrus Inspection and under the cooperative agreements referred to in subsection (1) with respect to citrus fruit and processed citrus products. (4)(a) All persons liable for the fees imposed by this section shall keep a complete and accurate record of the receipt, sale, shipment, and processing of citrus fruit and processed citrus products subject to the fees imposed hereby. Such records shall be preserved by such persons for a period of 1 year following the end of the shipping season to which they pertain and shall be offered for inspection at any time upon oral or written demand by the Department of Agriculture. (b) All persons liable for the fees imposed by this section shall, at such times as the Department of Agriculture may by rule or regulation require, file with the Department of Agriculture a return certified as true and correct on forms to be prescribed and furnished by the Department of Agriculture stating the number of applicable units of citrus fruit and processed citrus products which were subject to fees hereunder during the period of time covered by the return. (5) The Department of Agriculture may adopt rules providing for the imposition of special fees for inspections conducted during hours not contemplated by regular state work hours. The rules shall prescribe circumstances under which the fees levied pursuant to paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) would not apply and the fees imposed pursuant to such rules would apply. The rules shall require that such fees be levied when specifically actuated by contract between the Department of Agriculture and persons liable for the fees created by this subsection. The rules may not authorize fees that exceed the Department of Agriculture’s actual cost of the inspection to be made, nor may such fees be less than those imposed by paragraphs (1)(a) and (b). (6) When any portion of the revenues deposited to the Citrus Inspection Trust Fund is not immediately needed for the purpose for which such funds are appropriated, the Chief Financial Officer shall invest and reinvest such funds, and the earnings thereon shall be deposited to and made a part of the Citrus Inspection Trust Fund. (7) The duties of the Department of Agriculture shall include the duty to conduct hearings, through a hearing officer who shall be an attorney authorized to practice law within this state, on violations of this section and rules adopted thereunder. The hearing officer shall be selected by the Commissioner of Agriculture and shall be in addition to her or his regular legal staff authorized by law. The hearing officer shall, in addition to conducting such hearings, be available to the Division of Fruit and Vegetables for other legal services on matters pertaining to violations of this chapter and rules adopted thereunder.

The service of process of any of the courts of this state upon such resident agent shall be as effectual and binding upon such applicant as if personally served upon such applicant. (3) If the applicant is a corporation, such corporation must be one organized and existing under the laws of this state or having an unrevoked permit authorizing it to transact business in this state. (4) When a license application is submitted for a person or business entity that has an unpaid balance due and owing the department for any citrus assessments or delinquency fees levied and imposed under the authority of this chapter, the applicant shall be notified immediately by the department, and such application may not be further processed or presented to the commission for action until such assessments and fees are paid in full.

The department shall also consider the past history of any applicant, either individually or in connection with any individual, copartnership, corporation, association, or other business unit with whom any applicant has been connected in any capacity, and may in proper cases impute to any individual, corporation, copartnership, association, or other business unit liability for any wrong or unlawful act previously done or performed by such individual, corporation, copartnership, association, or other business unit. (2) If the Florida Citrus Commission shall, by a majority vote, be of the opinion that the applicant is qualified and entitled to a license as a citrus fruit dealer, the commission shall approve the application; otherwise the application shall be disapproved.

No more than one temporary license shall be approved for any applicant during a shipping season. No temporary license may be approved unless all requirements relating to bonds or fees required to be posted or paid by the applicant have been met the same as though the approval were not of a temporary nature. (4) Grounds for the disapproval of the application include, but are not limited to: (a) Any previous conduct of the applicant which would have been grounds for revocation or suspension of a license as hereinafter provided if the applicant had been licensed. (b) Delinquent accounts of the applicant owing to and growing out of the ordinary course of business with producers and other persons or firms. (c) Delinquent accounts of the applicant with any person or persons with whom applicant has dealt in its operations under a previous license.

(5) When the applicant is a corporate or other business entity, the term “applicant” as used in this section shall be deemed to include within its meaning those individuals who have been, or can reasonably be expected to be, actively engaged in the managerial affairs of the corporate or other business entity applicant. (6) The department shall designate not more than three employees directly involved in the processing of citrus fruit dealer license applications, who shall be a part of, and shall have access to, the criminal justice information system described in chapter 943, for purposes of investigating license applicants. (7) The department may adopt rules establishing the procedure and guidelines for granting interim conditional staff approval for issuance of a conditional citrus fruit dealer’s license, which license shall at all times be subject to final approval or other action by the commission at its next regular meeting. Any license so issued shall clearly and conspicuously indicate thereon the conditional nature of the approval and pendency of final action.

The Department of Agriculture may issue a provisional license for a period of no longer than 1 year to an applicant who is under investigation for an action that would constitute a violation of this chapter or has pending against such applicant an administrative or civil proceeding that alleges an action that would constitute a violation of this chapter. The department shall establish by rule requirements for renewal of a provisional license. When the investigation is complete or the pending proceeding has been disposed of, the Department of Agriculture may issue a regular license under this section.

Registration of each agent shall be for the entire shipping season for which the applying dealer’s license is issued; however, a licensed dealer may cancel the registration of any agent registered by her or him by returning the agent’s identification card to the Department of Agriculture and giving formal written notice to the Department of Agriculture of at least 10 days. In addition, such dealer shall make every effort to alert the public to the fact that the agent is no longer authorized to represent her or him. An agent may be registered by more than one licensed dealer for the same shipping season, provided that each licensed dealer applies individually for registration of the agent and further provided that written consent is given by each and every dealer under whose license the agent has valid prior registration. (2) When the requirements of subsection (1) and such additional requirements set forth by rules adopted by the Department of Citrus for registration of an agent are met and the fee required by s. 601.59(2) is paid, the Department of Agriculture shall duly register the agent and issue an identification card certifying such registration. The identification card, among other things, shall show in a prominent manner: (a) The name and address of the agent. (b) The authorizing dealer’s name, address, and license number. (c) The effective date and season for which registration is made. (d)1. A space for signature of the agent. 2. A space to be countersigned by the licensed dealer. 3. A statement providing that the card is not valid unless so signed and countersigned.

      "heading": "Bond requirements of citrus fruit dealers.",
      "text": "601.61 Bond requirements of citrus fruit dealers.— (1)(a) Except as provided in this section, before the approval of a citrus fruit dealer’s license, the applicant must deliver to the Department of Agriculture a good and sufficient cash bond, an appropriate certificate of deposit, or a surety bond executed by the applicant as principal and by a surety company qualified to do business in this state as surety, in an amount determined by the Department of Citrus pursuant to rules adopted by the department. The rules shall allow the department to consider any of the following factors for determining the amount of such bonds or certificates of deposit: the number of standard-packed boxes of citrus fruit, or the equivalent thereof, that the applicant intends to handle during the term of the license as set forth in the application; the total volume of fruit handled by the dealer the previous season; the highest month’s volume handled the previous season; the anticipated increase in the total citrus crop during the season for which the application for license is made; or other relevant factors. (b) If a citrus fruit dealer during the term of her or his license finds that she or he has handled, or can reasonably expect to handle, a volume of fruit greater than that covered by a posted bond or certificate of deposit, the dealer has the affirmative duty to immediately notify the Department of Agriculture and initiate a review by the Department of Citrus to determine any increase required in the amount of such bond or certificate of deposit to comply with the department’s rules for determining the amount of such bonds or certificates of deposit. (2) Such bond shall be in the form approved by the Department of Agriculture and shall be conditioned as provided in s. 601.66(9); to fully comply with the terms and conditions of all contracts, verbal or written, made by the citrus fruit dealer with producers or with other citrus fruit dealers relative to the purchasing, handling, sale, and accounting of purchases and sales of citrus fruit; upon the dealer’s accounting for the proceeds from, and paying for, any citrus fruit purchased or contracted for in accordance with the terms of the contracts with producers; and upon the dealer’s accounting for any advance payments or deposits made, and delivering all citrus fruit contracted for, in accordance with the terms of the contracts with other citrus fruit dealers. The commission may prescribe by rule that such a producer contract contain information that it considers necessary to protect the producer from deceptive practices. For purposes of this chapter, every such contract shall be conclusively deemed to have been made and entered into during the shipping season in which the delivery of fruit into the primary channel of trade is made. (3) Such bond shall be to the Department of Agriculture for the use and benefit of every producer and of every citrus fruit dealer with whom the dealer deals in the purchase, handling, sale, and accounting of purchases and sales of citrus fruit. The aggregate accumulative liability under any bond may not exceed the amount of the bond. Such bond shall provide that the surety company executing the bond is not liable to any citrus fruit dealer claiming to be injured or damaged by such dealer if the aggregate of the amounts found to be due to producers pursuant to this chapter equals or exceeds the amount of the bond, unless such citrus fruit dealer is also a producer and is acting in the capacity of a producer and not in the capacity of a citrus fruit dealer in the transaction wherein she or he claims to have been injured or damaged by applicant; however, if the aggregate of such amounts is less than the amount of the bond, the surety may be held liable to such citrus fruit dealers, but not in excess of the sum by which the amount of the bond exceeds the aggregate of the amounts found to be due to producers pursuant to this chapter. (4) The Department of Citrus or the Department of Agriculture, or any officer or employee designated by the Department of Citrus or the Department of Agriculture, is authorized to inspect such accounts and records of any citrus fruit dealer as may be deemed necessary to determine whether a bond that has been delivered to the Department of Agriculture is in the amount required by this section or whether a previously licensed nonbonded dealer should be required to furnish bond. If any such citrus fruit dealer refuses to permit such inspection, the Department of Agriculture may publish the facts and circumstances and by order suspend the license of the offender until permission to make such inspection is given. Upon a finding by the Department of Agriculture that any citrus fruit dealer has dealt or probably will deal with more fruit during the season than shown by the application, the Department of Agriculture may order such bond increased to such an amount as will meet the requirements set forth in the rules adopted by the Department of Citrus for determining the amount of such bonds. Upon failure to file such increased bond within the time fixed by the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Agriculture may publish the facts and circumstances and by order suspend the license of such citrus fruit dealer until such bond is increased as ordered. (5)(a) The following citrus fruit, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the Department of Citrus, is not considered fruit with which the applicant intends to deal for the purpose of determining the amount of the bond required under subsection (1): 1. Citrus fruit that the applicant produces. 2. Citrus fruit that is handled for its members by a cooperative marketing association organized and existing under chapter 618 or chapter 619. 3. Fresh citrus fruit handled by the applicant that has been prepared and packaged by a registered packinghouse other than the applicant and has been inspected and certified for shipment. 4. Citrus fruit handled by the applicant from citrus groves for which the applicant provides complete grove management services under direct contract with the owner or producer. 5. Citrus fruit handled by a corporate or partnership applicant that is from citrus groves owned by officers or stockholders of the corporation or from citrus groves owned by the partnership, the parent corporation, or a wholly owned subsidiary corporation or its corporate officers or stockholders, or any partner of a partnership, if appropriate waivers of right to any claim against the bond required to be posted by this section are attached to and made a part of the license application. 6. Processed citrus fruit handled by the applicant that has been processed and packaged by a registered citrus processing plant other than the applicant and has been inspected and certified for shipment. (b) If the applicant does not intend to deal with any citrus fruit other than that described in paragraph (a), the Department of Agriculture shall issue a license without the posting of a bond. Such a license shall bear a descriptive statement to the effect that the licensee is not a bonded citrus fruit dealer. (c) A claim against any citrus fruit dealer’s bond required to be posted by this section shall not be accepted with respect to any damages in connection with fruit handled under subparagraphs (a)1.-6. if such claim is filed against the bond of the dealer who was granted bond exempt status for such fruit.

Such liability may be enforced either by proceeding in an administrative action to and before the Department of Agriculture and pursuing such action to its ultimate termination if desired or by filing of a judicial suit at law in a court of competent jurisdiction; however, in such court suit the bond of such citrus fruit dealer theretofore posted with the Department of Agriculture pursuant to s. 601.61 shall not be amenable or subject to any judgment or other legal process issuing out of or from such court in connection with such law suit, whether cash bond or surety company bond, but such bonds shall be amenable to and enforceable only by and through administrative proceedings before the Department of Agriculture, it being the intent and purpose of the Legislature that such citrus dealer’s bond so posted with the Department of Agriculture shall be applicable and liable only for the payment of claims duly adjudicated by order of the Department of Agriculture and the determination of such adjudicated claim if and in the event such order is appealed by any aggrieved party to the administrative proceeding.
