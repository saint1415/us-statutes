(5) Recorded or unrecorded easements or rights, interest or servitude in the nature of easements, rights-of-way and terminal facilities, including those of a public utility or of a governmental agency, so long as the same are used and the use of any part thereof shall except from the operation hereof the right to the entire use thereof. No notice need be filed in order to preserve the lien of any mortgage or deed of trust or any supplement thereto encumbering any such recorded or unrecorded easements, or rights, interest, or servitude in the nature of easements, rights-of-way, and terminal facilities.

(2) A property owners’ association may preserve and protect a community covenant or restriction from extinguishment by the operation of this chapter by filing for record, at any time during the 30-year period immediately following the effective date of the root of title: (a) A written notice in accordance with s. 712.06; or (b) A summary notice in substantial form and content as required under s. 720.3032(2); or an amendment to a community covenant or restriction that is indexed under the legal name of the property owners’ association and references the recording information of the covenant or restriction to be preserved. Failure of a summary notice or amendment to be indexed to the current owners of the affected property does not affect the validity of the notice or vitiate the effect of the filing of such notice. (3) A notice under subsection (1) or subsection (2) preserves an interest in land or other right subject to extinguishment under this chapter, or a covenant or restriction or portion of such covenant or restriction, for not less than 30 years after filing the notice unless the notice is filed again as required in this chapter. A person’s disability or lack of knowledge of any kind may not delay the commencement of or suspend the running of the 30-year period. Such notice may be filed for record by the claimant or by any other person acting on behalf of a claimant who is: (a) Under a disability; (b) Unable to assert a claim on his or her behalf; or (c) One of a class, but whose identity cannot be established or is uncertain at the time of filing such notice of claim for record. The property owners’ association or clerk of the circuit court is not required to provide additional notice pursuant to s. 712.06(3) for a notice filed under subsection (2). The preceding sentence is intended to clarify existing law. (4) It is not necessary for the owner of the marketable record title, as described in s. 712.02, to file a notice to protect his or her marketable record title.

(b) The name and mailing address of an owner, or the name and mailing address of the person in whose name the property is assessed on the last completed tax assessment roll of the county at the time of filing, who, for purpose of such notice, shall be deemed to be an owner; however, if a property owners’ association is filing the notice, the requirements of this paragraph may be satisfied by attaching to and recording with the notice an affidavit executed by the appropriate member of the board of directors of the property owners’ association affirming that the board of directors of the property owners’ association caused a statement in substantially the following form to be mailed or hand delivered to the members of that property owners’ association: STATEMENT OF MARKETABLE TITLE ACTION The (name of property owners’ association) (the “Association”) has taken action to ensure that the (name of declaration, covenant, or restriction) , recorded in Official Records Book , Page , of the public records of County, Florida, as may be amended from time to time, currently burdening the property of each and every member of the Association, retains its status with regard to the affected real property. To this end, the Association shall cause the notice required by chapter 712, Florida Statutes, to be recorded in the public records of County, Florida. Copies of this notice and its attachments are available through the Association pursuant to the Association’s governing documents regarding official records of the Association. (c) A full and complete description of all land affected by such notice, which description shall be set forth in particular terms and not by general reference, but if said claim is founded upon a recorded instrument or a covenant or a restriction, the description in such notice may be the same as that contained in such recorded instrument or covenant or restriction, provided the same shall be sufficient to identify the property. (d) A statement of the claim showing the nature, description, and extent of such claim or other right subject to extinguishment under this chapter or, in the case of a covenant or restriction, a copy of the covenant or restriction or a reference to the book and page or instrument number in which the same is recorded, except that it is not necessary to show the amount of any claim for money or the terms of payment. (e) If such claim or other right subject to extinguishment under this chapter is based upon an instrument of record or a recorded covenant or restriction, such instrument of record or recorded covenant or restriction shall be deemed sufficiently described to identify the same if the notice includes a reference to the book and page in which the same is recorded. (f) Such notice shall be acknowledged in the same manner as deeds are acknowledged for record. (2) Such notice shall be filed with the clerk of the circuit court of the county or counties where the land described therein is situated, together with a true copy thereof. The clerk shall enter, record, and index said notice in the same manner that deeds are entered, recorded, and indexed, as though the claimant were the grantee in the deed and the purported owner were the grantor in a deed, and the clerk shall charge the same fees for recording thereof as are charged for recording deeds. In those counties where the circuit court clerk maintains a tract index, such notice shall also be indexed therein. (3) The person providing the notice referred to in s. 712.05, other than a notice for preservation of a community covenant or restriction, shall: (a) Cause the clerk of the circuit court to mail by registered or certified mail to the purported owner of said property, as stated in such notice, a copy thereof and shall enter on the original, before recording the same, a certificate showing such mailing. For preparing the certificate, the claimant shall pay to the clerk the service charge as prescribed in s. 28.24(9) and the necessary costs of mailing, in addition to the recording charges as prescribed in s. 28.24(13). If the notice names purported owners having more than one address, the person filing the same shall furnish a true copy for each of the several addresses stated, and the clerk shall send one such copy to the purported owners named at each respective address. Such certificate shall be sufficient if the same reads substantially as follows: I hereby certify that I did on this , mail by registered (or certified) mail a copy of the foregoing notice to each of the following at the address stated: (Clerk of the circuit court) of County, Florida, By (Deputy clerk) The clerk of the circuit court is not required to mail to the purported owner of such property any such notice that pertains solely to the preserving of any covenant or restriction or any portion of a covenant or restriction; or (b) Publish once a week, for 2 consecutive weeks, the notice referred to in s. 712.05, with the official record book and page number in which such notice was recorded, in a newspaper as defined in chapter 50 in the county in which the property is located. (4) Failure of any purported owner to receive the mailed notice shall not affect the validity of the notice or vitiate the effect of the filing of such notice.

      "text": "712.065 Extinguishment of discriminatory restrictions.— (1) As used in this section, the term “discriminatory restriction” means a provision in a title transaction recorded in this state which restricts the ownership, occupancy, or use of any real property in this state by any natural person on the basis of a characteristic that has been held, or is held after September 4, 2020, by the United States Supreme Court or the Florida Supreme Court to be protected against discrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or under s. 2, Art. I of the State Constitution, including race, color, national origin, religion, gender, or physical disability. (2) A discriminatory restriction is not enforceable in this state, and all discriminatory restrictions contained in any title transaction recorded in this state are unlawful, are unenforceable, and are declared null and void. Any discriminatory restriction contained in a previously recorded title transaction is extinguished and severed from the recorded title transaction, and the remainder of the title transaction remains enforceable and effective. The recording of any notice preserving or protecting interests or rights pursuant to s. 712.06 does not reimpose or preserve any discriminatory restriction that is extinguished under this section. (3) Upon request of a parcel owner, a discriminatory restriction appearing in a covenant or restriction affecting the parcel may be removed from the covenant or restriction by an amendment approved by a majority vote of the board of directors of the respective property owners’ association or an owners’ association in which all owners may voluntarily join, notwithstanding any other requirements for approval of an amendment of the covenant or restriction. Unless the amendment also changes other provisions of the covenant or restriction, the recording of an amendment removing a discriminatory restriction does not constitute a title transaction occurring after the root of title for purposes of s. 712.03(4).
