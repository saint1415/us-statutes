With respect to the services exempted in this subsection, regardless of the technology, the duties of a local exchange telecommunications company are only those that the company is obligated to extend or provide under applicable federal law and regulations.(13)“Telecommunications company” includes every corporation, partnership, and person and their lessees, trustees, or receivers appointed by any court whatsoever, and every political subdivision in the state, offering two-way telecommunications service to the public for hire within this state by the use of a telecommunications facility.
