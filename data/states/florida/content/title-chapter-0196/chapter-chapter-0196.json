      "text": "196.011 Annual application required for exemption.— (1)(a) Except as provided in s. 196.081(1)(b), every person or organization who, on January 1, has the legal title to real or personal property, except inventory, which is entitled by law to exemption from taxation as a result of its ownership and use shall, on or before March 1 of each year, file an application for exemption with the county property appraiser, listing and describing the property for which exemption is claimed and certifying its ownership and use. The Department of Revenue shall prescribe the forms upon which the application is made. Failure to make application, when required, on or before March 1 of any year shall constitute a waiver of the exemption privilege for that year, except as provided in subsection (8) or subsection (9). (b) The form to apply for an exemption under s. 196.031, s. 196.081, s. 196.091, s. 196.101, s. 196.102, s. 196.173, or s. 196.202 must include a space for the applicant to list the social security number of the applicant and of the applicant’s spouse, if any. If an applicant files a timely and otherwise complete application, and omits the required social security numbers, the application is incomplete. In that event, the property appraiser shall contact the applicant, who may refile a complete application by April 1. Failure to file a complete application by that date constitutes a waiver of the exemption privilege for that year, except as provided in subsection (8) or subsection (9). (2) However, application for exemption will not be required on public roads rights-of-way and borrow pits owned, leased, or held for exclusive governmental use and benefit or on property owned and used exclusively by a municipality for municipal or public purposes in order for such property to be released from all ad valorem taxation. (3) It shall not be necessary to make annual application for exemption on houses of public worship, the lots on which they are located, personal property located therein or thereon, parsonages, burial grounds and tombs owned by houses of public worship, individually owned burial rights not held for speculation, or other such property not rented or hired out for other than religious or educational purposes at any time; household goods and personal effects of permanent residents of this state; and property of the state or any county, any municipality, any school district, or community college district thereof. (4) When any property has been determined to be fully exempt from taxation because of its exclusive use for religious, literary, scientific, or charitable purposes and the application for its exemption has met the criteria of s. 196.195, the property appraiser may accept, in lieu of the annual application for exemption, a statement certified under oath that there has been no change in the ownership and use of the property. (5) It is not necessary to make annual application for exemption on property used to house a charter school pursuant to s. 196.1983. The owner or lessee of any property used to house a charter school pursuant to s. 196.1983 who is not required to file an annual application shall notify the property appraiser promptly whenever the use of the property or the status or condition of the owner or lessee changes so as to change the exempt status of the property. If any owner or lessee fails to so notify the property appraiser and the property appraiser determines that for any year within the prior 10 years the owner or lessee was not entitled to receive such exemption, the owner or lessee of the property is subject to the taxes exempted as a result of such failure plus 15 percent interest per annum and a penalty of 50 percent of the taxes exempted. The property appraiser making such determination shall record in the public records of the county a notice of tax lien against any property owned by that person or entity in the county, and such property must be identified in the notice of tax lien. Such property is subject to the payment of all taxes and penalties. Such lien when filed shall attach to any property, identified in the notice of tax lien, owned by the person or entity who illegally or improperly received the exemption. If such person or entity no longer owns property in that county but owns property in some other county or counties in the state, the property appraiser shall record a notice of tax lien in such other county or counties, identifying the property owned by such person or entity in such county or counties, and it shall become a lien against such property in such county or counties. (6) The owner of property that received an exemption in the prior year, or a property owner who filed an original application that was denied in the prior year solely for not being timely filed, may reapply on a short form as provided by the department. The short form shall require the applicant to affirm that the use of the property and his or her status as a permanent resident have not changed since the initial application. (7)(a) Once an original application for tax exemption has been granted, in each succeeding year on or before February 1, the property appraiser shall mail a renewal application to the applicant, and the property appraiser shall accept from each such applicant a renewal application on a form prescribed by the Department of Revenue. Such renewal application shall be accepted as evidence of exemption by the property appraiser unless he or she denies the application. Upon denial, the property appraiser shall serve, on or before July 1 of each year, a notice setting forth the grounds for denial on the applicant by first-class mail. Any applicant objecting to such denial may file a petition as provided for in s. 194.011(3). (b) Once an original application for tax exemption has been granted under s. 196.26, the property owner is not required to file a renewal application until the use of the property no longer complies with the restrictions and requirements of the conservation easement. (8) The value adjustment board shall grant any exemption for an otherwise eligible applicant if the applicant can clearly document that failure to apply by March 1 was the result of postal error. (9) Any applicant who is qualified to receive any exemption under subsection (1) and who fails to file an application by March 1, must file an application for the exemption with the property appraiser on or before the 25th day following the mailing by the property appraiser of the notices required under s. 194.011(1). Upon receipt of sufficient evidence, as determined by the property appraiser, demonstrating the applicant was unable to apply for the exemption in a timely manner or otherwise demonstrating extenuating circumstances judged by the property appraiser to warrant granting the exemption, the property appraiser may grant the exemption. If the applicant fails to produce sufficient evidence demonstrating the applicant was unable to apply for the exemption in a timely manner or otherwise demonstrating extenuating circumstances as judged by the property appraiser, the applicant may file, pursuant to s. 194.011(3), a petition with the value adjustment board requesting that the exemption be granted. Such petition must be filed during the taxable year on or before the 25th day following the mailing of the notice by the property appraiser as provided in s. 194.011(1). Notwithstanding the provisions of s. 194.013, such person must pay a nonrefundable fee of $15 upon filing the petition. Upon reviewing the petition, if the person is qualified to receive the exemption and demonstrates particular extenuating circumstances judged by the value adjustment board to warrant granting the exemption, the value adjustment board may grant the exemption for the current year. (10)(a) A county may, at the request of the property appraiser and by a majority vote of its governing body, waive the requirement that an annual application or statement be made for exemption of property within the county after an initial application is made and the exemption granted. The waiver under this subsection of the annual application or statement requirement applies to all exemptions under this chapter except the exemption under s. 196.1995. Notwithstanding such waiver, refiling of an application or statement shall be required when any property granted an exemption is sold or otherwise disposed of, when the ownership changes in any manner, when the applicant for homestead exemption ceases to use the property as his or her homestead, or when the status of the owner changes so as to change the exempt status of the property. In its deliberations on whether to waive the annual application or statement requirement, the governing body shall consider the possibility of fraudulent exemption claims which may occur due to the waiver of the annual application requirement. The owner of any property granted an exemption who is not required to file an annual application or statement shall notify the property appraiser promptly whenever the use of the property or the status or condition of the owner changes so as to change the exempt status of the property. If any property owner fails to so notify the property appraiser and the property appraiser determines that for any year within the prior 10 years the owner was not entitled to receive such exemption, the owner of the property is subject to the taxes exempted as a result of such failure plus 15 percent interest per annum and a penalty of 50 percent of the taxes exempted. Except for homestead exemptions controlled by s. 196.161, the property appraiser making such determination shall record in the public records of the county a notice of tax lien against any property owned by that person or entity in the county, and such property must be identified in the notice of tax lien. Except as provided in paragraph (b), such property is subject to the payment of all taxes and penalties. Such lien when filed shall attach to any property, identified in the notice of tax lien, owned by the person who illegally or improperly received the exemption. If such person no longer owns property in that county but owns property in some other county or counties in the state, the property appraiser shall record a notice of tax lien in such other county or counties, identifying the property owned by such person or entity in such county or counties, and it shall become a lien against such property in such county or counties. Before a lien may be filed, the person or entity so notified must be given 30 days to pay the taxes. (b) If a homestead exemption is granted as a result of a clerical mistake or omission by the property appraiser, the taxpayer may not be assessed a penalty or interest. Back taxes shall apply only as follows: 1. If the person who received the homestead exemption as a result of a clerical mistake or omission voluntarily discloses to the property appraiser that he or she was not entitled to the homestead exemption before the property appraiser notifies the owner of the mistake or omission, no back taxes shall be due. 2. If the person who received the homestead exemption as a result of a clerical mistake or omission does not voluntarily disclose to the property appraiser that he or she was not entitled to the homestead exemption before the property appraiser notifies the owner of the mistake or omission, back taxes shall be due for any year or years that the owner was not entitled to the limitation within the 5 years before the property appraiser notified the owner of the mistake or omission. 3. The property appraiser shall serve upon an owner that owes back taxes under subparagraph 2. a notice of intent to record in the public records of the county a notice of tax lien against any property owned by that person in the county, and such property must be identified in the notice of tax lien. The property appraiser must include with such notice information explaining why the owner is not entitled to the limitation, the years for which unpaid taxes are due, and the manner in which unpaid taxes have been calculated. Before a lien may be filed, the person or entity so notified must be given 30 days to pay the taxes. (c) The owner of any property granted an exemption under s. 196.26 shall notify the property appraiser promptly whenever the use of the property no longer complies with the restrictions and requirements of the conservation easement. If the property owner fails to so notify the property appraiser and the property appraiser determines that for any year within the preceding 10 years the owner was not entitled to receive the exemption, the owner of the property is subject to taxes exempted as a result of the failure plus 18 percent interest per annum and a penalty of 100 percent of the taxes exempted. The provisions for tax liens in paragraph (a) apply to property granted an exemption under s. 196.26. (d) A county may, at the request of the property appraiser and by a majority vote of its governing body, waive the requirement that an annual application be made for the veteran’s disability discount granted pursuant to s. 6(e), Art. VII of the State Constitution after an initial application is made and the discount granted. The disabled veteran receiving a discount for which annual application has been waived shall notify the property appraiser promptly whenever the use of the property or the percentage of disability to which the veteran is entitled changes. If a disabled veteran fails to notify the property appraiser and the property appraiser determines that for any year within the prior 10 years the veteran was not entitled to receive all or a portion of such discount, the penalties and processes in paragraph (a) relating to the failure to notify the property appraiser of ineligibility for an exemption shall apply. (e) For any exemption under s. 196.101(2), the statement concerning gross income must be filed with the property appraiser not later than March 1 of every year. (f) If an exemption for which the annual application is waived pursuant to this subsection will be denied by the property appraiser in the absence of the refiling of the application, notification of an intent to deny the exemption shall be mailed to the owner of the property prior to February 1. If the property appraiser fails to timely mail such notice, the application deadline for such property owner pursuant to subsection (1) shall be extended to 28 days after the date on which the property appraiser mails such notice. (11) At the option of the property appraiser and notwithstanding any other provision of this section, initial or original applications for homestead exemption for the succeeding year may be accepted and granted after March 1. Reapplication on a short form as authorized by subsection (6) shall be required if the county has not waived the requirement of an annual application. Once the initial or original application and reapplication have been granted, the property may qualify for the exemption in each succeeding year pursuant to the provisions of subsection (7) or subsection (10). (12) For exemptions enumerated in paragraph (1)(b), social security numbers of the applicant and the applicant’s spouse, if any, are required and must be submitted to the department. Applications filed pursuant to subsection (6) or subsection (7) shall include social security numbers of the applicant and the applicant’s spouse, if any. For counties where the annual application requirement has been waived, property appraisers may require refiling of an application to obtain such information. (13) Notwithstanding subsection (1), if the owner of property otherwise entitled to a religious exemption from ad valorem taxation fails to timely file an application for exemption, and because of a misidentification of property ownership on the property tax roll the owner is not properly notified of the tax obligation by the property appraiser and the tax collector, the owner of the property may file an application for exemption with the property appraiser. The property appraiser must consider the application, and if he or she determines the owner of the property would have been entitled to the exemption had the property owner timely applied, the property appraiser must grant the exemption. Any taxes assessed on such property shall be canceled, and if paid, refunded. Any tax certificates outstanding on such property shall be canceled and refund made pursuant to s. 197.432(11).

      "number": "196.031",
      "heading": "Exemption of homesteads.",
      "text": "196.031 Exemption of homesteads.— (1)(a) A person who, on January 1, has the legal title or beneficial title in equity to real property in this state and who in good faith makes the property his or her permanent residence or the permanent residence of another or others legally or naturally dependent upon him or her, is entitled to an exemption from all taxation, except for assessments for special benefits, up to the assessed valuation of $25,000 on the residence and contiguous real property, as defined in s. 6, Art. VII of the State Constitution. Such title may be held by the entireties, jointly, or in common with others, and the exemption may be apportioned among such of the owners as reside thereon, as their respective interests appear. If only one of the owners of an estate held by the entireties or held jointly with the right of survivorship resides on the property, that owner is allowed an exemption of up to the assessed valuation of $25,000 on the residence and contiguous real property. However, an exemption of more than $25,000 is not allowed to any one person or on any one dwelling house, except that an exemption up to the assessed valuation of $25,000 may be allowed on each apartment or mobile home occupied by a tenant-stockholder or member of a cooperative corporation and on each condominium parcel occupied by its owner. Except for owners of an estate held by the entireties or held jointly with the right of survivorship, the amount of the exemption may not exceed the proportionate assessed valuation of all owners who reside on the property. Before such exemption may be granted, the deed or instrument shall be recorded in the official records of the county in which the property is located. The property appraiser may request the applicant to provide additional ownership documents to establish title. 1 (b) Every person who qualifies to receive the exemption provided in paragraph (a) is entitled to an additional exemption of up to $25,000 on the assessed valuation greater than $50,000 for all levies other than school district levies. The $25,000 value of the additional exemption provided in this paragraph shall be adjusted annually on January 1 of each year for inflation using the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, U.S. City Average, all items 1967=100, or successor reports for the preceding calendar year as initially reported by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, if such percent change is positive. (2) As used in subsection (1), the term “cooperative corporation” means a corporation, whether for profit or not for profit, organized for the purpose of owning, maintaining, and operating an apartment building or apartment buildings or a mobile home park to be occupied by its stockholders or members; and the term “tenant-stockholder or member” means an individual who is entitled, solely by reason of his or her ownership of stock or membership in a cooperative corporation, as evidenced in the official records of the office of the clerk of the circuit court of the county in which the apartment building is located, to occupy for dwelling purposes an apartment in a building owned by such corporation or to occupy for dwelling purposes a mobile home which is on or a part of a cooperative unit. A corporation leasing land for a term of 98 years or more for the purpose of maintaining and operating a cooperative thereon shall be deemed the owner for purposes of this exemption. (3) The exemption provided in this section does not apply with respect to the assessment roll of a county unless and until the roll of that county has been approved by the executive director pursuant to s. 193.1142. (4) The exemption provided in this section applies only to those parcels classified and assessed as owner-occupied residential property or only to the portion of property so classified and assessed. (5) For the purpose of applying the exemptions in this section, the real property includes portions of the real property and contiguous real property assessed solely on the basis of character or use pursuant to s. 193.461 or s. 193.501 or assessed pursuant to s. 193.505. (6) A person who is receiving or claiming the benefit of an ad valorem tax exemption or a tax credit in another state where permanent residency is required as a basis for the granting of that ad valorem tax exemption or tax credit is not entitled to the homestead exemption provided by this section. This subsection does not apply to a person who has the legal or equitable title to real estate in Florida and maintains thereon the permanent residence of another legally or naturally dependent upon the owner. (7) When homestead property is damaged or destroyed by misfortune or calamity and the property is uninhabitable on January 1 after the damage or destruction occurs, the homestead exemption may be granted if the property is otherwise qualified and if the property owner notifies the property appraiser that he or she intends to repair or rebuild the property and live in the property as his or her primary residence after the property is repaired or rebuilt and does not claim a homestead exemption on any other property or otherwise violate this section. Failure by the property owner to commence the repair or rebuilding of the homestead property within 5 years after January 1 following the property’s damage or destruction constitutes abandonment of the property as a homestead. After the 5-year period, the expiration, lapse, nonrenewal, or revocation of a building permit issued to the property owner for such repairs or rebuilding also constitutes abandonment of the property as homestead. (8) Unless the homestead property is totally exempt from ad valorem taxation, the exemptions provided in paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) shall be applied before other homestead exemptions, which shall then be applied in the order that results in the lowest taxable value.

(b) “Household income” means the adjusted gross income, as defined in s. 62 of the United States Internal Revenue Code, of all members of a household. (2) In accordance with s. 6(d), Art. VII of the State Constitution, the board of county commissioners of any county or the governing authority of any municipality may adopt an ordinance to allow either or both of the following additional homestead exemptions: (a) Up to $50,000 for a person who has the legal or equitable title to real estate and maintains thereon the permanent residence of the owner, who has attained age 65, and whose household income does not exceed $20,000. (b) The amount of the assessed value of the property for a person who has the legal or equitable title to real estate with a just value less than $250,000, as determined in the first tax year that the owner applies and is eligible for the exemption, and who has maintained thereon the permanent residence of the owner for at least 25 years, who has attained age 65, and whose household income does not exceed the income limitation prescribed in paragraph (a), as calculated in subsection (3). (3) The $20,000 income limitation shall be adjusted annually, on January 1, by the percentage change in the average cost-of-living index in the period January 1 through December 31 of the immediate prior year compared with the same period for the year prior to that. The index is the average of the monthly consumer-price-index figures for the stated 12-month period, relative to the United States as a whole, issued by the United States Department of Labor. (4) An ordinance granting an additional homestead exemption as authorized by this section must meet the following requirements: (a) It must be adopted under the procedures for adoption of a nonemergency ordinance specified in chapter 125 by a board of county commissioners or chapter 166 by a municipal governing authority, except that the exemption authorized by paragraph (2)(b) must be authorized by a super majority (a majority plus one) vote of the members of the governing body of the county or municipality granting such exemption. (b) It must specify that the exemption applies only to taxes levied by the unit of government granting the exemption. Unless otherwise specified by the county or municipality, this exemption will apply to all tax levies of the county or municipality granting the exemption, including dependent special districts and municipal service taxing units. (c) It must specify the amount of the exemption, which may not exceed the applicable amount specified in subsection (2). If the county or municipality specifies a different exemption amount for dependent special districts or municipal service taxing units, the exemption amount must be uniform in all dependent special districts or municipal service taxing units within the county or municipality. (d) It must require that a taxpayer claiming the exemption for the first time submit to the property appraiser, not later than March 1, a sworn statement of household income on a form prescribed by the Department of Revenue. (5) The department must require by rule that the filing of the statement be supported by copies of any federal income tax returns for the prior year, any wage and earnings statements (W-2 forms), any request for an extension of time to file returns, and any other documents it finds necessary, for each member of the household, to be submitted for inspection by the property appraiser. The taxpayer’s sworn statement shall attest to the accuracy of the documents and grant permission to allow review of the documents if requested by the property appraiser. Once the documents have been inspected by the property appraiser, they shall be returned to the taxpayer or otherwise destroyed. Annually, the property appraiser shall notify each taxpayer of the adjusted income limitation set forth in subsection (3). The taxpayer must notify the property appraiser by May 1 if his or her household income exceeds the most recent adjusted income limitation. The property appraiser may conduct random audits of the taxpayers’ sworn statements to ensure the accuracy of the household income reported. If selected for audit, a taxpayer shall execute Internal Revenue Service Form 8821 or 4506, which authorizes the Internal Revenue Service to release tax information to the property appraiser’s office. All reviews conducted in accordance with this section shall be completed on or before June 1. The property appraiser may not grant the exemption if the required documentation requested is not provided. (6) The board of county commissioners or municipal governing authority must deliver a copy of any ordinance adopted under this section to the property appraiser no later than December 1 of the year prior to the year the exemption will take effect. If the ordinance is repealed, the board of county commissioners or municipal governing authority shall notify the property appraiser no later than December 1 of the year prior to the year the exemption expires. (7) Those persons entitled to the homestead exemption in s. 196.031 may apply for and receive an additional homestead exemption as provided in this section. Receipt of the additional homestead exemption provided for in this section shall be subject to the provisions of ss. 196.131 and 196.161, if applicable. (8) If title is held jointly with right of survivorship, the person residing on the property and otherwise qualifying may receive the entire amount of the additional homestead exemption. (9)(a) If the property appraiser determines that for any year within the immediately previous 10 years a person who was not entitled to the additional homestead exemption under this section was granted such an exemption, the property appraiser shall serve upon the owner a notice of intent to record in the public records of the county a notice of tax lien against any property owned by that person in the county, and that property must be identified in the notice of tax lien. Any property that is owned by the taxpayer and is situated in this state is subject to the taxes exempted by the improper homestead exemption, plus a penalty of 50 percent of the unpaid taxes for each year and interest at a rate of 15 percent per annum. Before any such lien may be filed, the owner must be given 30 days within which to pay the taxes, penalties, and interest. Such a lien is subject to the procedures and provisions set forth in s. 196.161(3). (b) If the additional homestead exemption under this section is improperly granted as a result of a clerical mistake or omission by the property appraiser, the person who improperly received the exemption may not be assessed a penalty and interest. Back taxes shall apply only as follows: 1. If the person who received the additional homestead exemption under this section as a result of a clerical mistake or omission voluntarily discloses to the property appraiser that he or she was not entitled to the homestead exemption before the property appraiser notifies the owner of the mistake or omission, no back taxes shall be due. 2. If the person who received the additional homestead exemption under this section as a result of a clerical mistake or omission does not voluntarily disclose to the property appraiser that he or she was not entitled to the homestead exemption before the property appraiser notifies the owner of the mistake or omission, back taxes shall be due for any year or years that the owner was not entitled to the limitation within the 5 years before the property appraiser notified the owner of the mistake or omission. 3. The property appraiser shall serve upon an owner that owes back taxes under subparagraph 2. a notice of intent to record in the public records of the county a notice of tax lien against any property owned by that person in the county, and such property must be identified in the notice of tax lien. The property appraiser must include with such notice information explaining why the owner is not entitled to the limitation, the years for which unpaid taxes are due, and the manner in which unpaid taxes have been calculated. Before any such lien may be filed, the owner must be given 30 days within which to pay the taxes, penalties, and interest. Such a lien is subject to the procedures and provisions set forth in s. 196.161(3).

The Department of Revenue shall notify all property appraisers and tax collectors in this state of the designated military operations. (3) The exemption is also available to servicemembers who were deployed during the preceding calendar year on active duty outside the continental United States, Alaska, or Hawaii in support of a subordinate operation to a main operation designated in subsection (2). (4) By January 15 of each year, the Department of Military Affairs shall submit to the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the tax committees of each house of the Legislature a report of all known and unclassified military operations outside the continental United States, Alaska, or Hawaii for which servicemembers based in the continental United States have been deployed during the previous calendar year. The report must include: (a) The official and common names of the military operations; (b) The general location and purpose of each military operation; (c) The date each military operation commenced; and (d) The date each military operation terminated, unless the operation is ongoing. (5) The amount of the exemption is equal to the taxable value of the homestead of the servicemember on January 1 of the year in which the exemption is sought multiplied by the number of days that the servicemember was on a qualifying deployment in the preceding calendar year and divided by the number of days in that year. (6)(a) An eligible servicemember who seeks to claim the additional tax exemption as provided in this section must file an application for exemption with the property appraiser on or before March 1 of the year following the year of the qualifying deployment. The application for the exemption must be made on a form prescribed by the department and furnished by the property appraiser. The form must require a servicemember to include or attach proof of a qualifying deployment, the dates of that deployment, and other information necessary to verify eligibility for and the amount of the exemption. (b) An application may be filed on behalf of an eligible servicemember by his or her spouse if the homestead property to which the exemption applies is held by the entireties or jointly with the right of survivorship, by a person who has been designated by the servicemember to take actions on his or her behalf pursuant to chapter 709, or by the personal representative of the servicemember’s estate. (7) The property appraiser shall consider each application for a deployed servicemember exemption within 30 days after receipt or within 30 days after receiving notice of the designation of qualifying deployments by the Legislature, whichever is later. A property appraiser who finds that the taxpayer is entitled to the exemption shall approve the application and file the application in the permanent records. A property appraiser who finds that the taxpayer is not entitled to the exemption shall send a notice of disapproval no later than July 1, citing the reason for disapproval. The original notice of disapproval shall be sent to the taxpayer and shall advise the taxpayer of the right to appeal the decision to the value adjustment board and shall inform the taxpayer of the procedure for filing such an appeal. (8) As used in this section, the term “servicemember” means a member or former member of any branch of the United States military or military reserves, the United States Coast Guard or its reserves, or the Florida National Guard.

      "text": "196.183 Exemption for tangible personal property.— (1) Each tangible personal property tax return is eligible for an exemption from ad valorem taxation of up to $25,000 of assessed value. A single return must be filed for each site in the county where the owner of tangible personal property transacts business. Owners of freestanding property placed at multiple sites, other than sites where the owner transacts business, must file a single return, including all such property located in the county. Freestanding property placed at multiple sites includes vending and amusement machines, LP/propane tanks, utility and cable company property, billboards, leased equipment, and similar property that is not customarily located in the offices, stores, or plants of the owner, but is placed throughout the county. Railroads, private carriers, and other companies assessed pursuant to s. 193.085 shall be allowed one $25,000 exemption for each county to which the value of their property is allocated. The $25,000 exemption for freestanding property placed at multiple locations and for centrally assessed property shall be allocated to each taxing authority based on the proportion of just value of such property located in the taxing authority; however, the amount of the exemption allocated to each taxing authority may not change following the extension of the tax roll pursuant to s. 193.122. (2) For purposes of this section, a “site where the owner of tangible personal property transacts business” includes facilities where the business ships or receives goods, employees of the business are located, goods or equipment of the business are stored, or goods or services of the business are produced, manufactured, or developed, or similar facilities located in offices, stores, warehouses, plants, or other locations of the business. Sites where only the freestanding property of the owner is located shall not be considered sites where the owner of tangible personal property transacts business. (3) The requirement that an annual tangible personal property tax return pursuant to s. 193.052 be filed for taxpayers owning taxable property the value of which, as listed on the return, does not exceed the exemption provided in this section is waived. In order to qualify for this waiver, a taxpayer must file an initial return on which the exemption is taken. If, in subsequent years, the taxpayer owns taxable property the value of which, as listed on the return, exceeds the exemption, the taxpayer is obligated to file a return. The taxpayer may again qualify for the waiver only after filing a return on which the value as listed on the return does not exceed the exemption. A return filed or required to be filed shall be considered an application filed or required to be filed for the exemption under this section. (4) Owners of property previously assessed by the property appraiser without a return being filed may, at the option of the property appraiser, qualify for the exemption under this section without filing an initial return. (5) The exemption provided in this section does not apply in any year a taxpayer fails to timely file a return that is not waived pursuant to subsection (3) or subsection (4). Any taxpayer who received a waiver pursuant to subsection (3) or subsection (4) and who owns taxable property the value of which, as listed on the return, exceeds the exemption in a subsequent year and who fails to file a return with the property appraiser is subject to the penalty contained in s. 193.072(1)(a) calculated without the benefit of the exemption pursuant to this section. Any taxpayer claiming more exemptions than allowed pursuant to subsection (1) is subject to the taxes exempted as a result of wrongfully claiming the additional exemptions plus 15 percent interest per annum and a penalty of 50 percent of the taxes exempted. By February 1 of each year, the property appraiser shall notify by mail all taxpayers whose requirement for filing an annual tangible personal property tax return was waived in the previous year. The notification shall state that a return must be filed if the value of the taxpayer’s tangible personal property exceeds the exemption and include the penalties for failure to file such a return. (6) The exemption provided in this section does not apply to a mobile home that is presumed to be tangible personal property pursuant to s. 193.075(2).

For purposes of this section, each use to which the property is being put must be considered in granting an exemption from ad valorem taxation, including any economic use in addition to any physical use.

However, no such property shall be exempt which is rented or hired out for other than religious, educational, or other exempt purposes at any time. (b) The property appraiser may deny exemption to property claimed by religious organizations to be used for any of the purposes set out in s. 196.011 if the use is not clear or if the property appraiser determines that the property is being held for speculative purposes or that it is being rented or hired out for other than religious or educational purposes. (c) If the property appraiser does deny such property a tax exemption, appeal of the determination to the value adjustment board may be made in the manner prescribed for appealed tax exemptions. (2) Applications required by this chapter shall be filed on forms distributed to the property appraisers by the Department of Revenue. Such forms shall call for accurate description of the property, the value of such property, and the use of such property. (3) Upon receipt of an application for exemption, the property appraiser shall determine: (a) Whether the applicant falls within the definition of any one or several of the exempt classifications. (b) Whether the applicant requesting exemption uses the property predominantly or exclusively for exempt purposes. (c) The extent to which the property is used for exempt purposes. In doing so, the property appraiser shall use the standards set forth in this chapter as applied by regulations of the Department of Revenue. (4) The property appraiser shall find that the person or organization requesting exemption meets the requirements set forth in paragraphs (3)(a) and (b) before any exemption can be granted. (5)(a) If the property appraiser determines that any property claimed as wholly or partially exempt under this section is not entitled to any exemption or is entitled to an exemption to an extent other than that requested in the application, he or she shall notify the person or organization filing the application on such property of that determination in writing on or before July 1 of the year for which the application was filed. (b) The notification must state in clear and unambiguous language the specific requirements of the state statutes which the property appraiser relied upon to deny the applicant the exemption with respect to the subject property. The notification must be drafted in such a way that a reasonable person can understand specific attributes of the applicant or the applicant’s use of the subject property which formed the basis for the denial. The notice must also include the specific facts the property appraiser used to determine that the applicant failed to meet the statutory requirements. If a property appraiser fails to provide a notice that complies with this subsection, any denial of an exemption or an attempted denial of an exemption is invalid. (c) All notifications must specify the right to appeal to the value adjustment board and the procedures to follow in obtaining such an appeal. Thereafter, the person or organization filing such application, or a duly designated representative, may appeal that determination by the property appraiser to the board at the time of its regular hearing. In the event of an appeal, the property appraiser or the property appraiser’s representative shall appear at the board hearing and present his or her findings of fact. If the applicant is not present or represented at the hearing, the board may make a determination on the basis of information supplied by the property appraiser or such other information on file with the board.

All property identified in this subsection must comply with the criteria provided under s. 196.195 for determining exempt status and applied by property appraisers on an annual basis.

If the sole member of the limited liability company that owns the property is also a limited liability company that is disregarded as an entity for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Treasury Regulation 301.7701-3(b)(1)(ii), the Legislature intends that the property be treated as owned by the sole member of the limited liability company that owns the limited liability company that owns the property. Units that are vacant and units that are occupied by natural persons or families whose income no longer meets the income limits of this subsection, but whose income met those income limits at the time they became tenants, shall be treated as portions of the affordable housing property exempt under this subsection if a recorded land use restriction agreement in favor of the Florida Housing Finance Corporation or any other governmental or quasi-governmental jurisdiction requires that all residential units within the property be used in a manner that qualifies for the exemption under this subsection and if the units are being offered for rent. 2 (b)1.

Proc. 96-32, 1996-1 C.B. 717, and is leased for a minimum of 99 years for the purpose of, and is predominantly used for, providing affordable housing to natural persons or families meeting the extremely-low-income, very-low-income, low-income, or moderate-income limits specified in s. 420.0004 is exempt from ad valorem taxation. 2. Land leased pursuant to this paragraph that is assigned or subleased from a nonprofit entity to an extremely-low-income, very-low-income, low-income, or moderate-income person or persons as defined in s. 420.0004 for such person’s or persons’ own use as affordable housing is exempt from ad valorem taxation. 3. For purposes of this paragraph, land is predominantly used for qualifying purposes if the square footage of the improvements on the land used to provide qualifying housing is greater than 50 percent of the square footage of all improvements on the land. 4. This paragraph is repealed December 31, 2059. (2)(a) Notwithstanding ss. 196.195 and 196.196, property in a multifamily project that meets the requirements of this subsection is considered property used for a charitable purpose and is exempt from ad valorem tax beginning with the January 1 assessment after the 15th completed year from the earliest of: 1. The effective date of the recorded agreement on those portions of the affordable housing property that provide housing to natural persons or families meeting the extremely-low-income, very-low-income, or low-income limits specified in s. 420.0004; 2. The first day of the first taxable year in which the property was placed in service as an affordable housing property that provides housing to natural persons or families meeting the extremely-low-income, very-low-income, or low-income limits specified in s. 420.0004; or 3. The date the property received a certificate of occupancy or a certificate of substantial completion, as applicable, allowing the property to be used as an affordable housing property that provides housing to natural persons or families meeting the extremely-low-income, very-low-income, or low-income limits specified in s. 420.0004. (b) The multifamily project must: 1. Contain more than 70 units that are used to provide affordable housing to natural persons or families meeting the extremely-low-income, very-low-income, or low-income limits specified in s. 420.0004; and 2. Be subject to an agreement with the Florida Housing Finance Corporation recorded in the official records of the county in which the property is located to provide affordable housing to natural persons or families meeting the extremely-low-income, very-low-income, or low-income limits specified in s. 420.0004. This exemption terminates if the property no longer serves extremely-low-income, very-low-income, or low-income persons pursuant to the recorded agreement. (c) To receive the exemption under paragraph (a), a qualified applicant must submit an application to the county property appraiser by March 1. (d) The property appraiser shall apply the exemption to those portions of the affordable housing property that provide housing to natural persons or families meeting the extremely-low-income, very-low-income, or low-income limits specified in s. 420.0004 before certifying the tax roll to the tax collector. (3) 1 (a) As used in this subsection, the term: 1. “Corporation” means the Florida Housing Finance Corporation. 2. “Newly constructed” means an improvement to real property which was substantially completed within 5 years before the date of an applicant’s first submission of a request for a certification notice pursuant to this subsection. 3. “Substantially completed” has the same meaning as in s. 192.042(1). 1 (b) Notwithstanding ss. 196.195 and 196.196, portions of property in a multifamily project are considered property used for a charitable purpose and are eligible to receive an ad valorem property tax exemption if such portions meet all of the following conditions: 1. Provide affordable housing to natural persons or families meeting the income limitations provided in paragraph (d). 2.a. Are within a newly constructed multifamily project that contains more than 70 units dedicated to housing natural persons or families meeting the income limitations provided in paragraph (d); or b. Are within a newly constructed multifamily project in an area of critical state concern, as designated by s. 380.0552 or chapter 28-36, Florida Administrative Code, which contains more than 10 units dedicated to housing natural persons or families meeting the income limitations provided in paragraph (d). 3. Are rented for an amount that does not exceed the amount as specified by the most recent multifamily rental programs income and rent limit chart posted by the corporation and derived from the Multifamily Tax Subsidy Projects Income Limits published by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development or 90 percent of the fair market value rent as determined by a rental market study meeting the requirements of paragraph (l), whichever is less. 1 (c) If a unit that in the previous year received the exemption under this subsection and was occupied by a tenant is vacant on January 1, the vacant unit is eligible for the exemption if the use of the unit is restricted to providing affordable housing that would otherwise meet the requirements of this subsection and a reasonable effort is made to lease the unit to eligible persons or families. 1 (d)1. The property appraiser shall exempt: a. Seventy-five percent of the assessed value of the units in multifamily projects that meet the requirements of this subsection and are used to house natural persons or families whose annual household income is greater than 80 percent but not more than 120 percent of the median annual adjusted gross income for households within the metropolitan statistical area or, if not within a metropolitan statistical area, within the county in which the person or family resides; and b. From ad valorem property taxes the units in multifamily projects that meet the requirements of this subsection and are used to house natural persons or families whose annual household income does not exceed 80 percent of the median annual adjusted gross income for households within the metropolitan statistical area or, if not within a metropolitan statistical area, within the county in which the person or family resides. 2. When determining the value of a unit for purposes of applying an exemption pursuant to this paragraph, the property appraiser must include in such valuation the proportionate share of the residential common areas, including the land, fairly attributable to such unit. 1 (e) To be eligible to receive an exemption under this subsection, a property owner must submit an application on a form prescribed by the department by March 1 for the exemption, accompanied by a certification notice from the corporation to the property appraiser. The property appraiser shall review the application and determine whether the applicant meets all of the requirements of this subsection and is entitled to an exemption. A property appraiser may request and review additional information necessary to make such determination. A property appraiser may grant an exemption only for a property for which the corporation has issued a certification notice and which the property appraiser determines is entitled to an exemption. 1 (f) To receive a certification notice, a property owner must submit a request to the corporation on a form provided by the corporation which includes all of the following: 1. The most recently completed rental market study meeting the requirements of paragraph (l). 2. A list of the units for which the property owner seeks an exemption. 3. The rent amount received by the property owner for each unit for which the property owner seeks an exemption. If a unit is vacant and qualifies for an exemption under paragraph (c), the property owner must provide evidence of the published rent amount for each vacant unit. 4. A sworn statement, under penalty of perjury, from the applicant restricting the property for a period of not less than 3 years to housing persons or families who meet the income limitations under this subsection. 1 (g) The corporation shall review the request for a certification notice and certify whether a property meets the criteria of paragraphs (b) and (c). A determination by the corporation regarding a request for a certification notice does not constitute a grant of an exemption pursuant to this subsection or final agency action pursuant to chapter 120. 1. If the corporation determines that the property meets the criteria, the corporation must send a certification notice to the property owner and the property appraiser. 2. If the corporation determines that the property does not meet the criteria, the corporation must notify the property owner and include the reasons for such determination. 1 (h) The corporation shall post on its website the deadline to submit a request for a certification notice. The deadline must allow adequate time for a property owner to submit a timely application for exemption to the property appraiser. 1 (i) If the property appraiser determines that for any year during the immediately previous 10 years a person who was not entitled to an exemption under this subsection was granted such an exemption, the property appraiser must serve upon the owner a notice of intent to record in the public records of the county a notice of tax lien against any property owned by that person in the county, and that property must be identified in the notice of tax lien. Any property owned by the taxpayer and situated in this state is subject to the taxes exempted by the improper exemption, plus a penalty of 50 percent of the unpaid taxes for each year and interest at a rate of 15 percent per annum. If an exemption is improperly granted as a result of a clerical mistake or an omission by the property appraiser, the property owner improperly receiving the exemption may not be assessed a penalty or interest. 1 (j) Units subject to an agreement with the corporation pursuant to chapter 420 recorded in the official records of the county in which the property is located to provide housing to natural persons or families meeting the extremely-low-income, very-low-income, or low-income limits specified in s. 420.0004 are not eligible for this exemption. 1 (k) Property receiving an exemption pursuant to s. 196.1979 or units used as a transient public lodging establishment as defined in s. 509.013 are not eligible for this exemption. 1 (l) A rental market study submitted as required by subparagraph (f)1. must identify the fair market value rent of each unit for which a property owner seeks an exemption. Only a certified general appraiser as defined in s. 475.611 may issue a rental market study. The certified general appraiser must be independent of the property owner who requests the rental market study. In preparing the rental market study, a certified general appraiser shall comply with the standards of professional practice pursuant to part II of chapter 475 and use comparable property within the same geographic area and of the same type as the property for which the exemption is sought. A rental market study must have been completed within 3 years before submission of the application. 1 (m) The corporation may adopt rules to implement this section. 1 (n) This subsection first applies to the 2024 tax roll and is repealed December 31, 2059. (o)1. Beginning with the 2025 tax roll, a taxing authority may elect, upon adoption of an ordinance or resolution approved by a two-thirds vote of the governing body, not to exempt property under sub-subparagraph (d)1.a. located in a county specified pursuant to subparagraph 2., subject to the conditions of this paragraph. 2. A taxing authority must make a finding in the ordinance or resolution that the most recently published Shimberg Center for Housing Studies Annual Report, prepared pursuant to s. 420.6075, identifies that a county that is part of the jurisdiction of the taxing authority is within a metropolitan statistical area or region where the number of affordable and available units in the metropolitan statistical area or region is greater than the number of renter households in the metropolitan statistical area or region for the category entitled “0-120 percent AMI.” 3. An election made pursuant to this paragraph may apply only to the ad valorem property tax levies imposed within a county specified pursuant to subparagraph 2. by the taxing authority making the election. 4. The ordinance or resolution must take effect on the January 1 immediately succeeding adoption and shall expire on the second January 1 after the January 1 in which the ordinance or resolution takes effect. The ordinance or resolution may be renewed prior to its expiration pursuant to this paragraph. 5. The taxing authority proposing to make an election under this paragraph must advertise the ordinance or resolution or renewal thereof pursuant to the requirements of s. 50.011(1) prior to adoption. 6. The taxing authority must provide to the property appraiser the adopted ordinance or resolution or renewal thereof by the effective date of the ordinance or resolution or renewal thereof. 7. Notwithstanding an ordinance or resolution or renewal thereof adopted pursuant to this paragraph, property in a multifamily project that received an exemption pursuant to sub-subparagraph (d)1.a. before the adoption or renewal of such ordinance or resolution may continue to receive such exemption for each subsequent consecutive year that the same owner or each successive owner applies for and is granted the exemption. (4)(a) Notwithstanding ss. 196.195 and 196.196, property in a multifamily project that meets the requirements of this subsection is considered property used for a charitable purpose and is exempt from ad valorem tax beginning with the January 1 assessment immediately succeeding the date the property was placed in service allowing the property to be used as an affordable housing property that provides housing to natural persons or families meeting the extremely-low-income, very-low-income, or low-income limits specified in s. 420.0004. 2 (b) The multifamily project must: 1. Be composed of an improvement to land where an improvement did not previously exist or the construction of a new improvement where an old improvement was removed, which was substantially completed within 2 years before the first submission of an application for exemption under this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, the term “substantially completed” has the same definition as in s. 192.042(1). 2. Contain more than 70 units that are used to provide affordable housing to natural persons or families meeting the extremely-low-income, very-low-income, or low-income limits specified in s. 420.0004. 3. Be subject to a land use restriction agreement with the Florida Housing Finance Corporation, or a housing finance authority pursuant to part IV of chapter 159, recorded in the official records of the county in which the property is located that requires that the property be used for 99 years to provide affordable housing to natural persons or families meeting the extremely-low-income, very-low-income, low-income, or moderate-income limits specified in s. 420.0004. The agreement must include a provision for a penalty for ceasing to provide affordable housing under the agreement before the end of the agreement term that is equal to 100 percent of the total amount financed by the corporation, or a housing finance authority pursuant to part IV of chapter 159, multiplied by each year remaining in the agreement. The agreement may be terminated or modified without penalty if the exemption under this subsection is repealed. The property is no longer eligible for this exemption if the property no longer serves extremely-low-income, very-low-income, or low-income persons pursuant to the recorded agreement. (c) To be eligible to receive the exemption under this subsection, the property owner must submit an application to the property appraiser by March 1. The property appraiser shall review the application and determine whether the applicant meets all of the requirements of this subsection and is entitled to an exemption. A property appraiser may request and review additional information necessary to make such determination. (d)1. The property appraiser shall apply the exemption to those portions of the affordable housing property that provide housing to natural persons or families meeting the extremely-low-income, very-low-income, or low-income limits specified in s. 420.0004 before certifying the tax roll to the tax collector. 2. When determining the value of the portion of property used to provide affordable housing for purposes of applying an exemption pursuant to this subsection, the property appraiser must include in such valuation the proportionate share of the residential common areas, including the land, fairly attributable to such portion of property. (e) If the property appraiser determines that for any year a person who was not entitled to an exemption under this subsection was granted such an exemption, the property appraiser must serve upon the owner a notice of intent to record in the public records of the county a notice of tax lien against any property owned by that person in the county, and that property must be identified in the notice of tax lien. Any property owned by the taxpayer and situated in this state is subject to the taxes exempted by the improper exemption, plus a penalty of 50 percent of the unpaid taxes for each year and interest at a rate of 15 percent per annum. If an exemption is improperly granted as a result of a clerical mistake or an omission by the property appraiser, the property owner improperly receiving the exemption may not be assessed a penalty or interest. (f) Property receiving an exemption pursuant to subsection (3) or s. 196.1979 is not eligible for this exemption. (g) This subsection first applies to the 2026 tax roll.

      "text": "1 196.198 Educational property exemption.—Educational institutions within this state and their property used by them or by any other exempt entity or educational institution exclusively for educational purposes are exempt from taxation. Sheltered workshops providing rehabilitation and retraining of individuals who have disabilities and exempted by a certificate under s. (d) of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, are declared wholly educational in purpose and are exempt from certification, accreditation, and membership requirements set forth in s. 196.012. Those portions of property of college fraternities and sororities certified by the president of the college or university to the appropriate property appraiser as being essential to the educational process are exempt from ad valorem taxation. The use of property by public fairs and expositions chartered by chapter 616 is presumed to be an educational use of such property and is exempt from ad valorem taxation to the extent of such use. Property used exclusively for educational purposes shall be deemed owned by an educational institution if the entity owning 100 percent of the educational institution is owned by the identical persons who own the property, or if the entity owning 100 percent of the educational institution and the entity owning the property are owned by the identical natural persons, or if the educational institution is a lessee that owns the leasehold interest in a bona fide lease for a nominal amount per year having an original term of 98 years or more. Land, buildings, and other improvements to real property used exclusively for educational purposes shall be deemed owned by an educational institution if the entity owning 100 percent of the land is a nonprofit entity and the land is used, under a ground lease or other contractual arrangement, by an educational institution that owns the buildings and other improvements to the real property, is a nonprofit entity under s. 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, and provides education limited to students in prekindergarten through grade 8. Land, buildings, and other improvements to real property used exclusively for educational purposes are deemed owned by an educational institution if the educational institution that currently uses the land, buildings, and other improvements for educational purposes received the exemption under this section on the same property in any 10 consecutive prior years, or, is an educational institution described in s. 212.0602, and, under a lease, the educational institution is responsible for any taxes owed and for ongoing maintenance and operational expenses for the land, buildings, and other improvements. For such leasehold properties, the educational institution shall receive the full benefit of the exemption. The owner of the property shall disclose to the educational institution the full amount of the benefit derived from the exemption and the method for ensuring that the educational institution receives the benefit. Any portion of real property used by a child care facility that has achieved Gold Seal Quality status under s. 1002.945 is deemed owned by such facility and used for an educational purpose if, under a lease, the operator of a facility is responsible for payment of ad valorem taxes. The owner of such property shall disclose to the lessee child care facility operator the total amount of the benefit derived from the exemption and the method for ensuring that the operator receives the benefit. Notwithstanding ss. 196.195 and 196.196, property owned by a house of public worship and used by an educational institution for educational purposes limited to students in preschool through grade 8 shall be exempt from ad valorem taxes. If legal title to property is held by a governmental agency that leases the property to a lessee, the property is deemed to be owned by the governmental agency and used exclusively for educational purposes if the governmental agency continues to use such property exclusively for educational purposes pursuant to a sublease or other contractual agreement with that lessee. If the title to land is held by the trustee of an irrevocable inter vivos trust and if the trust grantor owns 100 percent of the entity that owns an educational institution that is using the land exclusively for educational purposes, the land is deemed to be property owned by the educational institution for purposes of this exemption. Property owned by an educational institution is deemed to be used for an educational purpose if the institution has taken affirmative steps to prepare the property for educational use. The term “affirmative steps” means environmental or land use permitting activities, creation of architectural plans or schematic drawings, land clearing or site preparation, construction or renovation activities, or other similar activities that demonstrate commitment of the property to an educational use.

      "text": "196.199 Government property exemption.— (1) Property owned and used by the following governmental units shall be exempt from taxation under the following conditions: (a)1. All property of the United States is exempt from ad valorem taxation, except such property as is subject to tax by this state or any political subdivision thereof or any municipality under any law of the United States. 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of the exemption from ad valorem taxation provided in subparagraph 1., property of the United States includes any leasehold interest of and improvements affixed to land owned by the United States, any branch of the United States Armed Forces, or any agency or quasi-governmental agency of the United States if the leasehold interest and improvements are acquired or constructed and used pursuant to the federal Military Housing Privatization Initiative of 1996, 10 U.S.C. ss. 2871 et seq. As used in this subparagraph, the term “improvements” includes actual housing units and any facilities that are directly related to such housing units, including any housing maintenance facilities, housing rental and management offices, parks and community centers, and recreational facilities. Any leasehold interest and improvements described in this subparagraph, regardless of whether title is held by the United States, shall be construed as being owned by the United States, the applicable branch of the United States Armed Forces, or the applicable agency or quasi-governmental agency of the United States and are exempt from ad valorem taxation without the necessity of an application for exemption being filed or approved by the property appraiser. This subparagraph does not apply to a transient public lodging establishment as defined in s. 509.013 and does not affect any existing agreement to provide municipal services by a municipality or county. (b) All property of this state which is used for governmental purposes shall be exempt from ad valorem taxation except as otherwise provided by law. (c) All property of the several political subdivisions and municipalities of this state or of entities created by general or special law and composed entirely of governmental agencies, or property conveyed to a nonprofit corporation which would revert to the governmental agency, which is used for governmental, municipal, or public purposes shall be exempt from ad valorem taxation, except as otherwise provided by law. (d) All property of municipalities is exempt from ad valorem taxation if used as an essential ancillary function of a facility constructed with financing obtained in part by pledging proceeds from the tax authorized under s. 212.0305(4) which is upon exempt or immune federal, state, or county property. (2) Property owned by the following governmental units but used by nongovernmental lessees shall only be exempt from taxation under the following conditions: (a) Leasehold interests in property of the United States, of the state or any of its several political subdivisions, or of municipalities, agencies, authorities, and other public bodies corporate of the state shall be exempt from ad valorem taxation and the intangible tax pursuant to paragraph (b) only when the lessee serves or performs a governmental, municipal, or public purpose or function, as defined in s. 196.012(6). In all such cases, all other interests in the leased property shall also be exempt from ad valorem taxation. However, a leasehold interest in property of the state may not be exempted from ad valorem taxation when a nongovernmental lessee uses such property for the operation of a multipurpose hazardous waste treatment facility. (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c), the exemption provided by this subsection shall not apply to those portions of a leasehold or other interest defined by s. 199.023(1)(d), Florida Statutes 2005, subject to the provisions of subsection (7). Such leasehold or other interest shall be taxed only as intangible personal property pursuant to chapter 199, Florida Statutes 2005, if rental payments are due in consideration of such leasehold or other interest. All applicable collection, administration, and enforcement provisions of chapter 199, Florida Statutes 2005, shall apply to taxation of such leaseholds. If no rental payments are due pursuant to the agreement creating such leasehold or other interest, the leasehold or other interest shall be taxed as real property. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to exempt personal property, buildings, or other real property improvements owned by the lessee from ad valorem taxation. (c) Any governmental property leased to an organization which uses the property exclusively for literary, scientific, religious, or charitable purposes shall be exempt from taxation. (3) Nothing herein or in s. 196.001 shall require a governmental unit or authority to impose taxes upon a leasehold estate created, extended, or renewed prior to April 15, 1976, if the lease agreement creating such leasehold estate contains a covenant on the part of such governmental unit or authority as lessor to refrain from imposing taxes on the leasehold estate during the term of the leasehold estate; but any such covenant shall not prevent taxation of a leasehold estate by any such taxing unit or authority other than the unit or authority making such covenant. (4) Property owned by any municipality, agency, authority, or other public body corporate of the state which becomes subject to a leasehold interest or other possessory interest of a nongovernmental lessee other than that described in paragraph (2)(a), after April 14, 1976, shall be subject to ad valorem taxation unless the lessee is an organization which uses the property exclusively for literary, scientific, religious, or charitable purposes. (5) Leasehold interests in governmental property shall not be exempt pursuant to this subsection unless an application for exemption has been filed on or before March 1 with the property appraiser. The property appraiser shall review the application and make findings of fact which shall be presented to the value adjustment board at its convening, whereupon the board shall take appropriate action regarding the application. If the exemption in whole or in part is granted, or established by judicial proceeding, it shall remain valid for the duration of the lease unless the lessee changes its use, in which case the lessee shall again submit an application for exemption. The requirements set forth in s. 196.194 shall apply to all applications made under this subsection. (6) No exemption granted before June 1, 1976, shall be revoked by this chapter if such revocation will impair any existing bond agreement. (7) Property which is originally leased for 100 years or more, exclusive of renewal options, or property which is financed, acquired, or maintained utilizing in whole or in part funds acquired through the issuance of bonds pursuant to parts II, III, and V of chapter 159, shall be deemed to be owned for purposes of this section. (8)(a) Any and all of the aforesaid taxes on any leasehold described in this section shall not become a lien on same or the property itself but shall constitute a debt due and shall be recoverable by legal action or by the issuance of tax executions that shall become liens upon any other property in any county of this state of the taxpayer who owes said tax. The sheriff of the county shall execute the tax execution in the same manner as other executions are executed under chapters 30 and 56. (b) Nonpayment of any such taxes by the lessee shall result in the revocation of any occupational license of such person or the revocation, upon certification hereunder by the property appraiser to the Department of State, of the corporate charter of any such domestic corporation or the revocation, upon certification hereunder by the property appraiser to the Department of State, of the authority of any foreign corporation to do business in this state, as appropriate, which such license, charter, or authority is related to the leased property. (9) Improvements to real property which are located on state-owned land and which are leased to a public educational institution shall be deemed owned by the public educational institution for purposes of this section where, by the terms of the lease, the improvement will become the property of the public educational institution or the State of Florida at the expiration of the lease. (10) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, property held by a port authority and any leasehold interest in such property are exempt from ad valorem taxation to the same extent that county property is immune from taxation, provided such property is located in a county described in s. 9, Art. VIII of the State Constitution of 1885, as restated in s. 6(e), Art. VIII of the State Constitution.

VII of the State Constitution if: (a) The board of county commissioners of the county or the governing authority of the municipality votes to hold such referendum; (b) The board of county commissioners of the county or the governing authority of the municipality receives a petition signed by 10 percent of the registered electors of its respective jurisdiction, which petition calls for the holding of such referendum; or (c) The board of county commissioners of a charter county receives a petition or initiative signed by the required percentage of registered electors in accordance with the procedures established in the county’s charter for the enactment of ordinances or for approval of amendments of the charter, if less than 10 percent, which petition or initiative calls for the holding of such referendum. (2) The ballot question in such referendum shall be in substantially the following form: Shall the board of county commissioners of this county (or the governing authority of this municipality, or both) be authorized to grant, pursuant to s. 3, Art. VII of the State Constitution, property tax exemptions to new businesses and expansions of existing businesses that are expected to create new, full-time jobs in the county (or municipality, or both)? Yes—For authority to grant exemptions. No—Against authority to grant exemptions. (3) The board of county commissioners or the governing authority of the municipality that calls a referendum within its total jurisdiction to determine whether its respective jurisdiction may grant economic development ad valorem tax exemptions may vote to limit the effect of the referendum to authority to grant economic development tax exemptions for new businesses and expansions of existing businesses located in an enterprise zone or a brownfield area, as defined in s. 376.79. If an area nominated to be an enterprise zone pursuant to s. 290.0055 has not yet been designated pursuant to s. 290.0065, the board of county commissioners or the governing authority of the municipality may call such referendum prior to such designation; however, the authority to grant economic development ad valorem tax exemptions does not apply until such area is designated pursuant to s. 290.0065. The ballot question in such referendum shall be in substantially the following form and shall be used in lieu of the ballot question prescribed in subsection (2): Shall the board of county commissioners of this county (or the governing authority of this municipality, or both) be authorized to grant, pursuant to s. 3, Art. VII of the State Constitution, property tax exemptions for new businesses and expansions of existing businesses that are located in an enterprise zone or a brownfield area and that are expected to create new, full-time jobs in the county (or municipality, or both)? Yes—For authority to grant exemptions. No—Against authority to grant exemptions. (4) A referendum pursuant to this section may be called only once in any 12-month period. (5) Upon a majority vote in favor of such authority, the board of county commissioners or the governing authority of the municipality, at its discretion, by ordinance may exempt from ad valorem taxation up to 100 percent of the assessed value of all improvements to real property made by or for the use of a new business and of all tangible personal property of such new business, or up to 100 percent of the assessed value of all added improvements to real property made to facilitate the expansion of an existing business and of the net increase in all tangible personal property acquired to facilitate such expansion of an existing business. To qualify for this exemption, the improvements to real property must be made or the tangible personal property must be added or increased after approval by motion or resolution of the local governing body, subject to ordinance adoption or on or after the day the ordinance is adopted. However, if the authority to grant exemptions is approved in a referendum in which the ballot question contained in subsection (3) appears on the ballot, the authority of the board of county commissioners or the governing authority of the municipality to grant exemptions is limited solely to new businesses and expansions of existing businesses that are located in an area which was designated as an enterprise zone pursuant to chapter 290 as of December 30, 2015, or in a brownfield area. New businesses and expansions of existing businesses located in an area that was designated as an enterprise zone pursuant to chapter 290 as of December 30, 2015, but is not in a brownfield area, may qualify for the ad valorem tax exemption only if approved by motion or resolution of the local governing body, subject to ordinance adoption, or by ordinance, enacted before December 31, 2015. Property acquired to replace existing property shall not be considered to facilitate a business expansion. All data center equipment for a data center shall be exempt from ad valorem taxation for the term of the approved exemption. The exemption applies only to taxes levied by the respective unit of government granting the exemption. The exemption does not apply, however, to taxes levied for the payment of bonds or to taxes authorized by a vote of the electors pursuant to s. 9(b) or s. 12, Art. VII of the State Constitution. Any such exemption shall remain in effect for up to 10 years with respect to any particular facility, or up to 20 years for a data center, regardless of any change in the authority of the county or municipality to grant such exemptions or the expiration of the Enterprise Zone Act pursuant to chapter 290. The exemption shall not be prolonged or extended by granting exemptions from additional taxes or by virtue of any reorganization or sale of the business receiving the exemption. (6) With respect to a new business as defined by s. 196.012(14)(c), the municipality annexing the property on which the business is situated may grant an economic development ad valorem tax exemption under this section to that business for a period that will expire upon the expiration of the exemption granted by the county. If the county renews the exemption under subsection (7), the municipality may also extend its exemption. A municipal economic development ad valorem tax exemption granted under this subsection may not extend beyond the duration of the county exemption. (7) The authority to grant exemptions under this section expires 10 years after the date such authority was approved in an election, but such authority may be renewed for subsequent 10-year periods if each 10-year renewal is approved in a referendum called and held pursuant to this section. (8) Any person, firm, or corporation which desires an economic development ad valorem tax exemption shall, in the year the exemption is desired to take effect, file a written application on a form prescribed by the department with the board of county commissioners or the governing authority of the municipality, or both. The application shall request the adoption of an ordinance granting the applicant an exemption pursuant to this section and shall include the following information: (a) The name and location of the new business or the expansion of an existing business; (b) A description of the improvements to real property for which an exemption is requested and the date of commencement of construction of such improvements; (c) A description of the tangible personal property for which an exemption is requested and the dates when such property was or is to be purchased; (d) Proof, to the satisfaction of the board of county commissioners or the governing authority of the municipality, that the applicant is a new business or an expansion of an existing business, as defined in s. 196.012; (e) The number of jobs the applicant expects to create along with the average wage of the jobs and whether the jobs are full-time or part-time; (f) The expected time schedule for job creation; and (g) Other information deemed necessary or appropriate by the department, county, or municipality. (9) Before it takes action on the application, the board of county commissioners or the governing authority of the municipality shall deliver a copy of the application to the property appraiser of the county. After careful consideration, the property appraiser shall report the following information to the board of county commissioners or the governing authority of the municipality: (a) The total revenue available to the county or municipality for the current fiscal year from ad valorem tax sources, or an estimate of such revenue if the actual total revenue available cannot be determined; (b) Any revenue lost to the county or municipality for the current fiscal year by virtue of exemptions previously granted under this section, or an estimate of such revenue if the actual revenue lost cannot be determined; (c) An estimate of the revenue which would be lost to the county or municipality during the current fiscal year if the exemption applied for were granted had the property for which the exemption is requested otherwise been subject to taxation; and (d) A determination as to whether the property for which an exemption is requested is to be incorporated into a new business or the expansion of an existing business, as defined in s. 196.012, or into neither, which determination the property appraiser shall also affix to the face of the application. Upon the request of the property appraiser, the department shall provide to him or her such information as it may have available to assist in making such determination. (10) In considering any application for an exemption under this section, the board of county commissioners or the governing authority of the municipality must take into account the following: (a) The total number of net new jobs to be created by the applicant; (b) The average wage of the new jobs; (c) The capital investment to be made by the applicant; (d) The type of business or operation and whether it qualifies as a targeted industry as may be identified from time to time by the board of county commissioners or the governing authority of the municipality; (e) The environmental impact of the proposed business or operation; (f) The extent to which the applicant intends to source its supplies and materials within the applicable jurisdiction; and (g) Any other economic-related characteristics or criteria deemed necessary by the board of county commissioners or the governing authority of the municipality. (11) An ordinance granting an exemption under this section shall be adopted in the same manner as any other ordinance of the county or municipality and shall include the following: (a) The name and address of the new business or expansion of an existing business to which the exemption is granted; (b) The total amount of revenue available to the county or municipality from ad valorem tax sources for the current fiscal year, the total amount of revenue lost to the county or municipality for the current fiscal year by virtue of economic development ad valorem tax exemptions currently in effect, and the estimated revenue loss to the county or municipality for the current fiscal year attributable to the exemption of the business named in the ordinance; (c) The period of time for which the exemption will remain in effect and the expiration date of the exemption, which may be any period of time up to 10 years, or up to 20 years for a data center; and (d) A finding that the business named in the ordinance meets the requirements of s. 196.012(14) or (15). (12) Upon approval of an application for a tax exemption under this section, the board of county commissioners or the governing authority of the municipality and the applicant may enter into a written tax exemption agreement, which may include performance criteria and must be consistent with the requirements of this section or other applicable laws. The agreement must require the applicant to report at a specific time before the expiration of the exemption the actual number of new, full-time jobs created and their actual average wage. The agreement may provide the board of county commissioners or the governing authority of the municipality with authority to revoke, in whole or in part, the exemption if the applicant fails to meet the expectations and representations described in subsection (8).

      "text": "196.1997 Ad valorem tax exemptions for historic properties.— (1) The board of county commissioners of any county or the governing authority of any municipality may adopt an ordinance to allow ad valorem tax exemptions under s. 3, Art. VII of the State Constitution to historic properties if the owners are engaging in the restoration, rehabilitation, or renovation of such properties in accordance with guidelines established in this section. (2) The board of county commissioners or the governing authority of the municipality by ordinance may authorize the exemption from ad valorem taxation of up to 100 percent of the assessed value of all improvements to historic properties which result from the restoration, renovation, or rehabilitation of such properties. The exemption applies only to improvements to real property. In order for the property to qualify for the exemption, any such improvements must be made on or after the day the ordinance authorizing ad valorem tax exemption for historic properties is adopted. (3) The ordinance shall designate the type and location of historic property for which exemptions may be granted, which may include any property meeting the provisions of subsection (11), which property may be further required to be located within a particular geographic area or areas of the county or municipality. (4) The ordinance must specify that such exemptions shall apply only to taxes levied by the unit of government granting the exemption. The exemptions do not apply, however, to taxes levied for the payment of bonds or to taxes authorized by a vote of the electors pursuant to s. 9(b) or s. 12, Art. VII of the State Constitution. (5) The ordinance must specify that any exemption granted remains in effect for up to 10 years with respect to any particular property, regardless of any change in the authority of the county or municipality to grant such exemptions or any change in ownership of the property. In order to retain the exemption, however, the historic character of the property, and improvements which qualified the property for an exemption, must be maintained over the period for which the exemption is granted. (6) The ordinance shall designate either a local historic preservation office or the Division of Historical Resources of the Department of State to review applications for exemptions. The local historic preservation office or the division, whichever is applicable, must recommend that the board of county commissioners or the governing authority of the municipality grant or deny the exemption. Such reviews must be conducted in accordance with rules adopted by the Department of State. The recommendation, and the reasons therefor, must be provided to the applicant and to the governing entity before consideration of the application at an official meeting of the governing entity. For the purposes of this section, local historic preservation offices must be approved and certified by the Department of State. (7) To qualify for an exemption, the property owner must enter into a covenant or agreement with the governing body for the term for which the exemption is granted. The form of the covenant or agreement must be established by the Department of State and must require that the character of the property, and the qualifying improvements to the property, be maintained during the period that the exemption is granted. The covenant or agreement shall be binding on the current property owner, transferees, and their heirs, successors, or assigns. Violation of the covenant or agreement results in the property owner being subject to the payment of the differences between the total amount of taxes which would have been due in March in each of the previous years in which the covenant or agreement was in effect had the property not received the exemption and the total amount of taxes actually paid in those years, plus interest on the difference calculated as provided in s. 212.12(3). (8) Any person, firm, or corporation that desires an ad valorem tax exemption for the improvement of a historic property must, in the year the exemption is desired to take effect, file with the board of county commissioners or the governing authority of the municipality a written application on a form prescribed by the Department of State. The application must include the following information: (a) The name of the property owner and the location of the historic property. (b) A description of the improvements to real property for which an exemption is requested and the date of commencement of construction of such improvements. (c) Proof, to the satisfaction of the designated local historic preservation office or the Division of Historical Resources, whichever is applicable, that the property that is to be rehabilitated or renovated is a historic property under this section. (d) Proof, to the satisfaction of the designated local historic preservation office or the Division of Historical Resources, whichever is applicable, that the improvements to the property will be consistent with the United States Secretary of Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and will be made in accordance with guidelines developed by the Department of State. (e) Other information deemed necessary by the Department of State. (9) The board of county commissioners or the governing authority of the municipality shall deliver a copy of each application for a historic preservation ad valorem tax exemption to the property appraiser of the county. Upon certification of the assessment roll, or recertification, if applicable, pursuant to s. 193.122, for each fiscal year during which the ordinance is in effect, the property appraiser shall report the following information to the local governing body: (a) The total taxable value of all property within the county or municipality for the current fiscal year. (b) The total exempted value of all property in the county or municipality which has been approved to receive historic preservation ad valorem tax exemption for the current fiscal year. (10) A majority vote of the board of county commissioners of the county or of the governing authority of the municipality shall be required to approve a written application for exemption. Such exemption shall take effect on the January 1 following substantial completion of the improvement. The board of county commissioners or the governing authority of a municipality shall include the following in the resolution or ordinance approving the written application for exemption: (a) The name of the owner and the address of the historic property for which the exemption is granted. (b) The period of time for which the exemption will remain in effect and the expiration date of the exemption. (c) A finding that the historic property meets the requirements of this section. (11) Property is qualified for an exemption under this section if: (a) At the time the exemption is granted, the property: 1. Is individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended; or 2. Is a contributing property to a national-register-listed district; or 3. Is designated as a historic property, or as a contributing property to a historic district, under the terms of a local preservation ordinance; and (b) The local historic preservation office or the Division of Historical Resources, whichever is applicable, has certified to the local governing authority that the property for which an exemption is requested satisfies paragraph (a). (12) In order for an improvement to a historic property to qualify the property for an exemption, the improvement must: (a) Be consistent with the United States Secretary of Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. (b) Be determined by the Division of Historical Resources or the local historic preservation office, whichever is applicable, to meet criteria established in rules adopted by the Department of State. (13) The Department of State shall adopt rules as provided in chapter 120 for the implementation of this section. These rules must specify the criteria for determining whether a property is eligible for exemption; guidelines to determine improvements to historic properties which qualify the property for an exemption; criteria for the review of applications for exemptions; procedures for the cancellation of exemptions for violations to the agreement required by subsection (7); the manner in which local historic preservation offices may be certified as qualified to review applications; and other requirements necessary to implement this section.

Such purposes may include more than one class of exempt use.(3)“Predominant use of property” means use of property for exempt purposes in excess of 50 percent but less than exclusive.(4)“Use” means the exercise of any right or power over real or personal property incident to the ownership of the property.(5)“Educational institution” means a federal, state, parochial, church, or private school, college, or university conducting regular classes and courses of study required for eligibility to certification by, accreditation to, or membership in the State Department of Education of Florida, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, or the Florida Council of Independent Schools; a nonprofit private school the principal activity of which is conducting regular classes and courses of study accepted for continuing postgraduate dental education credit by a board of the Division of Medical Quality Assurance; educational direct-support organizations created pursuant to ss. 1001.24, 1004.28, and 1004.70; facilities located on the property of eligible entities which will become owned by those entities on a date certain; and institutions of higher education, as defined under and participating in the Higher Educational Facilities Financing Act.1(6)Governmental, municipal, or public purpose or function shall be deemed to be served or performed when the lessee under any leasehold interest created in property of the United States, the state or any of its political subdivisions, or any municipality, agency, special district, authority, or other public body corporate of the state is demonstrated to perform a function or serve a governmental purpose which could properly be performed or served by an appropriate governmental unit or which is demonstrated to perform a function or serve a purpose which would otherwise be a valid subject for the allocation of public funds. For purposes of the preceding sentence, an activity undertaken by a lessee which is permitted under the terms of its lease of real property designated as an aviation area on an airport layout plan which has been approved by the Federal Aviation Administration and which real property is used for the administration, operation, business offices and activities related specifically thereto in connection with the conduct of an aircraft full service fixed base operation which provides goods and services to the general aviation public in the promotion of air commerce shall be deemed an activity which serves a governmental, municipal, or public purpose or function. Any activity undertaken by a lessee which is permitted under the terms of its lease of real property designated as a public airport as defined in s. 332.004(14) by municipalities, agencies, special districts, authorities, or other public bodies corporate and public bodies politic of the state, a spaceport as defined in s. 331.303, or which is located in a deepwater port identified in s. 403.021(9)(b) and owned by one of the foregoing governmental units, subject to a leasehold or other possessory interest of a nongovernmental lessee that is deemed to perform an aviation, airport, aerospace, maritime, or port purpose or operation shall be deemed an activity that serves a governmental, municipal, or public purpose. The use by a lessee, licensee, or management company of real property or a portion thereof as a convention center, visitor center, sports facility with permanent seating, concert hall, arena, stadium, park, or beach is deemed a use that serves a governmental, municipal, or public purpose or function when access to the property is open to the general public with or without a charge for admission. If property deeded to a municipality by the United States is subject to a requirement that the Federal Government, through a schedule established by the Secretary of the Interior, determine that the property is being maintained for public historic preservation, park, or recreational purposes and if those conditions are not met the property will revert back to the Federal Government, then such property shall be deemed to serve a municipal or public purpose. The term “governmental purpose” also includes a direct use of property on federal lands in connection with the Federal Government’s Space Exploration Program or spaceport activities as defined in s. 212.02(22).
