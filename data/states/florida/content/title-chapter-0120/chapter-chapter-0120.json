      "id": "section-12052definitions",
      "number": "120.52",
      "heading": "Definitions",
      "text": "120.52 Definitions.—As used in this act: (1) “Agency” means the following officers or governmental entities if acting pursuant to powers other than those derived from the constitution: (a) The Governor; each state officer and state department, and each departmental unit described in s. 20.04; the Board of Governors of the State University System; the Commission on Ethics; the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission; a regional water supply authority; a regional planning agency; a multicounty special district, but only if a majority of its governing board is comprised of nonelected persons; educational units; and each entity described in chapters 163, 373, 380, and 582 and s. 186.504. (b) Each officer and governmental entity in the state having statewide jurisdiction or jurisdiction in more than one county. (c) Each officer and governmental entity in the state having jurisdiction in one county or less than one county, to the extent they are expressly made subject to this chapter by general or special law or existing judicial decisions. This definition does not include a municipality or legal entity created solely by a municipality; a legal entity or agency created in whole or in part pursuant to part II of chapter 361; a metropolitan planning organization created pursuant to s. 339.175; a separate legal or administrative entity created pursuant to s. 339.175 of which a metropolitan planning organization is a member; an expressway authority pursuant to chapter 348 or any transportation authority or commission under chapter 343 or chapter 349; or a legal or administrative entity created by an interlocal agreement pursuant to s. 163.01(7), unless any party to such agreement is otherwise an agency as defined in this subsection. (2) “Agency action” means the whole or part of a rule or order, or the equivalent, or the denial of a petition to adopt a rule or issue an order. The term also includes any denial of a request made under s. 120.54(7). (3) “Agency head” means the person or collegial body in a department or other governmental unit statutorily responsible for final agency action. An agency head appointed by and serving at the pleasure of an appointing authority remains subject to the direction and supervision of the appointing authority, but actions taken by the agency head as authorized by statute are official acts. (4) “Committee” means the Administrative Procedures Committee. (5) “Division” means the Division of Administrative Hearings. Any document filed with the division by a party represented by an attorney shall be filed by electronic means through the division’s website. Any document filed with the division by a party not represented by an attorney shall, whenever possible, be filed by electronic means through the division’s website. (6) “Educational unit” means a local school district, a community college district, the Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind, or a state university when the university is acting pursuant to statutory authority derived from the Legislature. (7) “Final order” means a written final decision which results from a proceeding under s. 120.56, s. 120.565, s. 120.569, s. 120.57, s. 120.573, or s. 120.574 which is not a rule, and which is not excepted from the definition of a rule, and which has been filed with the agency clerk, and includes final agency actions which are affirmative, negative, injunctive, or declaratory in form. A final order includes all materials explicitly adopted in it. The clerk shall indicate the date of filing on the order. (8) “Invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority” means action that goes beyond the powers, functions, and duties delegated by the Legislature. A proposed or existing rule is an invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority if any one of the following applies: (a) The agency has materially failed to follow the applicable rulemaking procedures or requirements set forth in this chapter; (b) The agency has exceeded its grant of rulemaking authority, citation to which is required by s. 120.54(3)(a)1.; (c) The rule enlarges, modifies, or contravenes the specific provisions of law implemented, citation to which is required by s. 120.54(3)(a)1.; (d) The rule is vague, fails to establish adequate standards for agency decisions, or vests unbridled discretion in the agency; (e) The rule is arbitrary or capricious. A rule is arbitrary if it is not supported by logic or the necessary facts; a rule is capricious if it is adopted without thought or reason or is irrational; or (f) The rule imposes regulatory costs on the regulated person, county, or city which could be reduced by the adoption of less costly alternatives that substantially accomplish the statutory objectives. A grant of rulemaking authority is necessary but not sufficient to allow an agency to adopt a rule; a specific law to be implemented is also required. An agency may adopt only rules that implement or interpret the specific powers and duties granted by the enabling statute. No agency shall have authority to adopt a rule only because it is reasonably related to the purpose of the enabling legislation and is not arbitrary and capricious or is within the agency’s class of powers and duties, nor shall an agency have the authority to implement statutory provisions setting forth general legislative intent or policy. Statutory language granting rulemaking authority or generally describing the powers and functions of an agency shall be construed to extend no further than implementing or interpreting the specific powers and duties conferred by the enabling statute. (9) “Law implemented” means the language of the enabling statute being carried out or interpreted by an agency through rulemaking. (10) “License” means a franchise, permit, certification, registration, charter, or similar form of authorization required by law, but it does not include a license required primarily for revenue purposes when issuance of the license is merely a ministerial act. (11) “Licensing” means the agency process respecting the issuance, denial, renewal, revocation, suspension, annulment, withdrawal, or amendment of a license or imposition of terms for the exercise of a license. (12) “Official reporter” means the publication in which an agency publishes final orders, the index to final orders, and the list of final orders which are listed rather than published. (13) “Party” means: (a) Specifically named persons whose substantial interests are being determined in the proceeding. (b) Any other person who, as a matter of constitutional right, provision of statute, or provision of agency regulation, is entitled to participate in whole or in part in the proceeding, or whose substantial interests will be affected by proposed agency action, and who makes an appearance as a party. (c) Any other person, including an agency staff member, allowed by the agency to intervene or participate in the proceeding as a party. An agency may by rule authorize limited forms of participation in agency proceedings for persons who are not eligible to become parties. (d) Any county representative, agency, department, or unit funded and authorized by state statute or county ordinance to represent the interests of the consumers of a county, when the proceeding involves the substantial interests of a significant number of residents of the county and the board of county commissioners has, by resolution, authorized the representative, agency, department, or unit to represent the class of interested persons. The authorizing resolution shall apply to a specific proceeding and to appeals and ancillary proceedings thereto, and it shall not be required to state the names of the persons whose interests are to be represented. The term “party” does not include a member government of a regional water supply authority or a governmental or quasi-judicial board or commission established by local ordinance or special or general law where the governing membership of such board or commission is shared with, in whole or in part, or appointed by a member government of a regional water supply authority in proceedings under s. 120.569, s. 120.57, or s. 120.68, to the extent that an interlocal agreement under ss. 163.01 and 373.713 exists in which the member government has agreed that its substantial interests are not affected by the proceedings or that it is to be bound by alternative dispute resolution in lieu of participating in the proceedings. This exclusion applies only to those particular types of disputes or controversies, if any, identified in an interlocal agreement. (14) “Person” means any person described in s. 1.01, any unit of government in or outside the state, and any agency described in subsection (1). (15) “Recommended order” means the official recommendation of an administrative law judge assigned by the division or of any other duly authorized presiding officer, other than an agency head or member of an agency head, for the final disposition of a proceeding under ss. 120.569 and 120.57. (16) “Rule” means each agency statement of general applicability that implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy or describes the procedure or practice requirements of an agency and includes any form which imposes any requirement or solicits any information not specifically required by statute or by an existing rule. The term also includes the amendment or repeal of a rule. The term does not include: (a) Internal management memoranda which do not affect either the private interests of any person or any plan or procedure important to the public and which have no application outside the agency issuing the memorandum. (b) Legal memoranda or opinions issued to an agency by the Attorney General or agency legal opinions prior to their use in connection with an agency action. (c) The preparation or modification of: 1. Agency budgets. 2. Statements, memoranda, or instructions to state agencies issued by the Chief Financial Officer or Comptroller as chief fiscal officer of the state and relating or pertaining to claims for payment submitted by state agencies to the Chief Financial Officer or Comptroller. 3. Contractual provisions reached as a result of collective bargaining. 4. Memoranda issued by the Executive Office of the Governor relating to information resources management. (17) “Rulemaking authority” means statutory language that explicitly authorizes or requires an agency to adopt, develop, establish, or otherwise create any statement coming within the definition of the term “rule.” (18) “Small city” means any municipality that has an unincarcerated population of 10,000 or less according to the most recent decennial census. (19) “Small county” means any county that has an unincarcerated population of 75,000 or less according to the most recent decennial census. (20) “Technical change” means a change to a rule or a statement of estimated regulatory cost that is limited to correcting citations or grammatical, typographical, or similar errors that do not affect the substance of the rule or statement. (21) “Unadopted rule” means an agency statement that meets the definition of the term “rule,” but that has not been adopted pursuant to the requirements of s. 120.54. (22) “Variance” means a decision by an agency to grant a modification to all or part of the literal requirements of an agency rule to a person who is subject to the rule. Any variance shall conform to the standards for variances outlined in this chapter and in the uniform rules adopted pursuant to s. 120.54(5). (23) “Waiver” means a decision by an agency not to apply all or part of a rule to a person who is subject to the rule. Any waiver shall conform to the standards for waivers outlined in this chapter and in the uniform rules adopted pursuant to s. 120.54(5).

The database must allow users to research and retrieve the full texts of agency final orders by: (a) The name of the agency that issued the final order. (b) The date the final order was issued. (c) The type of final order. (d) The subject of the final order. (e) Terms contained in the text of the final order. (2) The agency final orders that must be electronically transmitted to the centralized electronic database include: (a) Each final order resulting from a proceeding under s. 120.57 or s. 120.573. (b) Each final order rendered pursuant to s. 120.57(4) which contains a statement of agency policy that may be the basis of future agency decisions or that may otherwise contain a statement of precedential value. (c) Each declaratory statement issued by an agency. (d) Each final order resulting from a proceeding under s. 120.56 or s. 120.574. (3) Each agency shall maintain a list of all final orders rendered pursuant to s. 120.57(4) that are not required to be electronically transmitted to the centralized electronic database because they do not contain statements of agency policy or statements of precedential value. The list must include the name of the parties to the proceeding and the number assigned to the final order. (4) Each final order, whether rendered by the agency or the division, that must be electronically transmitted to the centralized electronic database or maintained on a list pursuant to subsection (3) must be electronically transmitted to the database or added to the list within 90 days after the final order is rendered. Each final order that must be electronically transmitted to the database or added to the list must have attached a copy of the complete text of any materials incorporated by reference; however, if the quantity of the materials incorporated makes attachment of the complete text of the materials impractical, the final order may contain a statement of the location of such materials and the manner in which the public may inspect or obtain copies of the materials incorporated by reference. (5) Nothing in this section relieves an agency from its responsibility for maintaining a subject matter index of final orders rendered before July 1, 2015, and identifying the location of the subject matter index on the agency’s website. In addition, an agency may electronically transmit to the centralized electronic database certified copies of all of the final orders that were rendered before July 1, 2015, which were required to be in the subject matter index. The centralized electronic database constitutes the official compilation of administrative final orders rendered on or after July 1, 2015, for each agency.

An agency may adopt only rules that implement or interpret the specific powers and duties granted by the enabling statute. No agency shall have authority to adopt a rule only because it is reasonably related to the purpose of the enabling legislation and is not arbitrary and capricious or is within the agency’s class of powers and duties, nor shall an agency have the authority to implement statutory provisions setting forth general legislative intent or policy. Statutory language granting rulemaking authority or generally describing the powers and functions of an agency shall be construed to extend no further than implementing or interpreting the specific powers and duties conferred by the enabling statute. (2) Unless otherwise expressly provided by law: (a) The repeal of one or more provisions of law implemented by a rule that on its face implements only the provision or provisions repealed and no other provision of law nullifies the rule. Whenever notice of the nullification of a rule under this subsection is received from the committee or otherwise, the Department of State shall remove the rule from the Florida Administrative Code as of the effective date of the law effecting the nullification and update the historical notes for the code to show the rule repealed by operation of law. (b) The repeal of one or more provisions of law implemented by a rule that on its face implements the provision or provisions repealed and one or more other provisions of law nullifies the rule or applicable portion of the rule to the extent that it implements the repealed law. The agency having authority to repeal or amend the rule shall, within 180 days after the effective date of the repealing law, publish a notice of rule development identifying all portions of rules affected by the repealing law, and if no notice is timely published the operation of each rule implementing a repealed provision of law shall be suspended until such notice is published. (c) The repeal of one or more provisions of law that, other than as provided in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b), causes a rule or portion of a rule to be of uncertain enforceability requires the Department of State to treat the rule as provided by s. 120.555. A rule shall be considered to be of uncertain enforceability under this paragraph if the division notifies the Department of State that a rule or a portion of the rule has been invalidated in a division proceeding based upon a repeal of law, or the committee gives written notification to the Department of State and the agency having power to amend or repeal the rule that a law has been repealed creating doubt about whether the rule is still in full force and effect. (3) The Administrative Procedures Committee or any substantially affected person may petition an agency to repeal any rule, or portion thereof, because it exceeds the rulemaking authority permitted by this section. Not later than 30 days after the date of filing the petition if the agency is headed by an individual, or not later than 45 days if the agency is headed by a collegial body, the agency shall initiate rulemaking proceedings to repeal the rule, or portion thereof, or deny the petition, giving a written statement of its reasons for the denial. (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to change the legal status of a rule that has otherwise been judicially or administratively determined to be invalid. (5) Unless otherwise expressly authorized by law, a rule may not include a provision whereby the entire rule, or a provision thereof, automatically expires or is repealed on a specific date or at the end of a specified period.

Related matters are not sufficiently resolved to enable the agency to address a statement by rulemaking. 2. Rulemaking shall be presumed practicable to the extent necessary to provide fair notice to affected persons of relevant agency procedures and applicable principles, criteria, or standards for agency decisions unless the agency proves that: a. Detail or precision in the establishment of principles, criteria, or standards for agency decisions is not reasonable under the circumstances; or b. The particular questions addressed are of such a narrow scope that more specific resolution of the matter is impractical outside of an adjudication to determine the substantial interests of a party based on individual circumstances. (b) Whenever an act of the Legislature is enacted which requires implementation of the act by rules of an agency within the executive branch of state government, the agency must publish a notice of rule development as provided in this section within 30 days after the effective date of the law that requires rulemaking and provides a grant of rulemaking authority. (c) No statutory provision shall be delayed in its implementation pending an agency’s adoption of implementing rules unless there is an express statutory provision prohibiting its application until the adoption of implementing rules. (d) In adopting rules, all agencies must, among the alternative approaches to any regulatory objective and to the extent allowed by law, choose the alternative that does not impose regulatory costs on the regulated person, county, or city which could be reduced by the adoption of less costly alternatives that substantially accomplish the statutory objectives. (e) No agency has inherent rulemaking authority, nor has any agency authority to establish penalties for violation of a rule unless the Legislature, when establishing a penalty, specifically provides that the penalty applies to rules. (f) An agency may adopt rules authorized by law and necessary to the proper implementation of a statute prior to the effective date of the statute, but the rules may not be effective until the statute upon which they are based is effective. An agency may not adopt retroactive rules, including retroactive rules intended to clarify existing law, unless that power is expressly authorized by statute. (g) Each rule adopted shall contain only one subject. (h) In rulemaking proceedings, the agency may recognize any material which may be judicially noticed, and it may provide that materials so recognized be incorporated into the record of the proceeding. Before the record of any proceeding is completed, all parties shall be provided a list of these materials and given a reasonable opportunity to examine them and offer written comments or written rebuttal. (i)1. A rule may incorporate material by reference but only as the material exists on the date the rule is adopted. For purposes of the rule, changes in the material are not effective unless the rule is amended to incorporate the changes. 2. An agency rule that incorporates by specific reference another rule of that agency automatically incorporates subsequent amendments to the referenced rule unless a contrary intent is clearly indicated in the referencing rule. A notice of amendments to a rule that has been incorporated by specific reference in other rules of that agency must explain the effect of those amendments on the referencing rules. 3. In rules adopted after December 31, 2010, or reviewed pursuant to s. 120.5435, material may not be incorporated by reference unless: a. The material has been submitted in the prescribed electronic format to the Department of State and the full text of the material can be made available for free public access through an electronic hyperlink from the rule making the reference in the Florida Administrative Code; or b. The agency has determined that posting the material on the Internet for purposes of public examination and inspection would constitute a violation of federal copyright law, in which case a statement to that effect, along with the addresses of the locations at the Department of State and the agency at which the material is available for public inspection and examination, must be included in the notice required by subparagraph (3)(a)1. 4. In rules proposed after July 1, 2025, material may not be incorporated by reference unless: a. The material has been submitted in the prescribed electronic format to the Department of State and the full text of the material, in a text-searchable format, can be made available for free public access through an electronic hyperlink from the rule making the reference in the Florida Administrative Register; or b. The agency has determined that posting the material on the Internet for purposes of public examination and inspection would constitute a violation of federal copyright law, in which case a statement to that effect, along with the addresses of the locations at the Department of State and the agency at which the material is available for public inspection and examination, must be included in the notice required by subparagraph (3)(a)1. 5. A rule may not be amended by reference only. Amendments must set out the amended rule in full in the same manner as required by the State Constitution for laws. 6. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in this section, when an adopted rule of the Department of Environmental Protection or a water management district is incorporated by reference in the other agency’s rule to implement a provision of part IV of chapter 373, subsequent amendments to the rule are not effective as to the incorporating rule unless the agency incorporating by reference notifies the committee and the Department of State of its intent to adopt the subsequent amendment, publishes notice of such intent in the Florida Administrative Register, and files with the Department of State a copy of the amended rule incorporated by reference. Changes in the rule incorporated by reference are effective as to the other agency 20 days after the date of the published notice and filing with the Department of State. The Department of State shall amend the history note of the incorporating rule to show the effective date of such change. Any substantially affected person may, within 14 days after the date of publication of the notice of intent in the Florida Administrative Register, file an objection to rulemaking with the agency. The objection must specify the portions of the rule incorporated by reference to which the person objects and the reasons for the objection. The agency does not have the authority under this subparagraph to adopt those portions of the rule specified in such objection. The agency shall publish notice of the objection and of its action in response in the next available issue of the Florida Administrative Register. 7. If an agency updates or makes a change to a document that the agency created and which is incorporated by reference pursuant to paragraph (3)(a) or subparagraph (3)(e)1., the update or change must be coded by underlining new text and striking through deleted text. 8. The Department of State may adopt by rule requirements for incorporating materials pursuant to this paragraph. (j) A rule published in the Florida Administrative Code must be indexed by the Department of State within 90 days after the rule is filed. The Department of State shall by rule establish procedures for indexing rules. (k) An agency head may delegate the authority to initiate rule development under subsection (2); however, rulemaking responsibilities of an agency head under subparagraph (3)(a)1., subparagraph (3)(e)1., or subparagraph (3)(e)6. may not be delegated or transferred. (2) RULE DEVELOPMENT; WORKSHOPS; NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING.— (a)1. Except when the intended action is the repeal of a rule, agencies shall provide notice of the development of proposed rules by publication of a notice of rule development in the Florida Administrative Register at least 7 days before providing notice of a proposed rule as required by paragraph (3)(a). The notice of rule development must: a. Indicate the subject area to be addressed by rule development. b. Provide a short, plain explanation of the purpose and effect of the proposed rule. c. Cite the grant of rulemaking authority for the proposed rule and the law being implemented. d. Include the proposed rule number and, if available, either the preliminary text of the proposed rule and any incorporated documents, or a statement of how a person may promptly obtain, without cost, a copy of any preliminary draft of such rule or documents. 2. A notice of a proposed rule must be published in the Florida Administrative Register within 180 days after the most recent notice of rule development, unless the Legislature expressly provides a different date. The agency may only exceed this timeframe if it submits to the committee, at least 7 business days before the end of the 180-day timeframe, a concise statement that identifies the reasons for the delay in rulemaking. The agency must update this statement each quarter thereafter until it has filed a notice of proposed rule in the applicable matter. (b) All rules should be drafted in readable language. The language is readable if: 1. It avoids the use of obscure words and unnecessarily long or complicated constructions; and 2. It avoids the use of unnecessary technical or specialized language that is understood only by members of particular trades or professions. (c) An agency may hold public workshops for purposes of rule development or information gathering for the preparation of the statement of estimated regulatory costs. An agency must hold public workshops, including workshops in various regions of the state or the agency’s service area, for purposes of rule development if requested in writing by any affected person, unless the agency head explains in writing why a workshop is unnecessary. The explanation is not final agency action subject to review pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57. The failure to provide the explanation when required may be a material error in procedure pursuant to s. 120.56(1)(c). When a workshop or public hearing is held, the agency must ensure that the persons responsible for preparing the proposed rule and the statement of estimated regulatory costs, if applicable, are available to explain the agency’s proposal and to respond to questions or comments regarding the rule being developed. The workshop may be facilitated or mediated by a neutral third person, or the agency may employ other types of dispute resolution alternatives for the workshop that are appropriate for rule development. Notice of a workshop for rule development or for information gathering for the preparation of a statement of estimated regulatory costs must be by publication in the Florida Administrative Register not less than 14 days before the date on which the workshop is scheduled to be held and must indicate the subject area that will be addressed; the agency contact person; and the place, date, and time of the workshop. (d)1. An agency may use negotiated rulemaking in developing and adopting rules. The agency should consider the use of negotiated rulemaking when complex rules are being drafted or strong opposition to the rules is anticipated. The agency should consider, but is not limited to considering, whether a balanced committee of interested persons who will negotiate in good faith can be assembled, whether the agency is willing to support the work of the negotiating committee, and whether the agency can use the group consensus as the basis for its proposed rule. Negotiated rulemaking uses a committee of designated representatives to draft a mutually acceptable proposed rule. 2. An agency that chooses to use the negotiated rulemaking process described in this paragraph shall publish in the Florida Administrative Register a notice of negotiated rulemaking that includes a listing of the representative groups that will be invited to participate in the negotiated rulemaking process. Any person who believes that his or her interest is not adequately represented may apply to participate within 30 days after publication of the notice. All meetings of the negotiating committee must be noticed and open to the public pursuant to this chapter. The negotiating committee shall be chaired by a neutral facilitator or mediator. 3. The agency’s decision to use negotiated rulemaking, its selection of the representative groups, and approval or denial of an application to participate in the negotiated rulemaking process are not agency action. This subparagraph is not intended to affect the rights of a substantially affected person to challenge a proposed rule developed under this paragraph in accordance with s. 120.56(2). (3) ADOPTION PROCEDURES.— (a) Notices.— 1. Before the adoption, amendment, or repeal of any rule other than an emergency rule, an agency shall, upon approval of the agency head, give notice of its intended action. The notice must include the following: a. A short, plain explanation of the purpose and effect of the proposed action. b. The proposed rule number. c. The full text of the proposed rule or amendment and a summary thereof. d. A reference to the grant of rulemaking authority pursuant to which the rule is adopted. e. A reference to the section or subsection of the Florida Statutes or the Laws of Florida being implemented or interpreted. f. The name, e-mail address, and telephone number of the agency employee who may be contacted regarding the intended action. g. A concise summary of the agency’s statement of the estimated regulatory costs, if one has been prepared, based on the factors set forth in s. 120.541(2) that describes the regulatory impact of the rule in readable language. h. An agency website address where the statement of estimated regulatory costs can be viewed in its entirety, if one has been prepared. i. A statement that any person who wishes to provide the agency with information regarding the statement of estimated regulatory costs, or to provide a proposal for a lower cost regulatory alternative as provided by s. 120.541(1), must do so in writing within 21 days after publication of the notice. j. A statement as to whether, based on the statement of the estimated regulatory costs or other information expressly relied upon and described by the agency if no statement of regulatory costs is required, the proposed rule is expected to require legislative ratification pursuant to s. 120.541(3). k. A description of the procedure for requesting a public hearing on the proposed rule. l. Except when the intended action is the repeal of a rule, a reference both to the date on which and to the place where the notice of rule development that is required by subsection (2) appeared. 2. The notice must be published in the Florida Administrative Register at least 7 days after the notice of rule development and at least 28 days before the intended action. The proposed rule, including all material proposed to be incorporated by reference, must be available for inspection and copying by the public at the time of the publication of notice. Material proposed to be incorporated by reference in the notice must be made available in the manner prescribed by sub-subparagraph (1)(i)3.a. or sub-subparagraph (1)(i)3.b. 3. The notice must be mailed or delivered electronically to all persons named in the proposed rule and mailed or delivered electronically to all persons who, at least 14 days before publication of the notice, have made requests of the agency for advance notice of its proceedings. The agency shall also give such notice as is prescribed by rule to those particular classes of persons to whom the intended action is directed. 4. The adopting agency shall file with the committee, at least 21 days before the proposed adoption date, a copy of each rule it proposes to adopt; a copy of any material incorporated by reference in the rule; a detailed written statement of the facts and circumstances justifying the proposed rule; a copy of any statement of estimated regulatory costs that has been prepared pursuant to s. 120.541; a statement of the extent to which the proposed rule relates to federal standards or rules on the same subject; and the notice required by subparagraph 1. 5. If any of the information that is required to be included in the notice under subparagraph 1., other than substantive changes to the rule text, is omitted or is incorrect, the agency must publish a notice of correction in the Florida Administrative Register at least 7 days before the intended agency action. The publication of a notice of correction does not affect the timeframes for filing the rule for adoption as set forth in paragraph (e). Technical changes must be published as a notice of correction. (b) Special matters to be considered in rule adoption.— 1. Statement of estimated regulatory costs.—Before the adoption, amendment, or repeal of any rule, other than an emergency rule, an agency is encouraged to prepare a statement of estimated regulatory costs of the proposed rule, as provided by s. 120.541. However, an agency must prepare a statement of estimated regulatory costs of the proposed rule, as provided by s. 120.541, if: a. The proposed rule will have an adverse impact on small business; or b. The proposed rule is likely to directly or indirectly increase regulatory costs in excess of $200,000 in the aggregate in this state within 1 year after the implementation of the rule. The agency must make available any information created or used by the agency in determining whether a proposed rule meets the factors listed in sub-subparagraphs a. and b., and such information shall be a part of the rulemaking record. The agency must consider in this determination the factors outlined in s. 120.541(2); however, the agency is not required to estimate the proposed rule’s impact to these factors as part of this determination. 2. Small businesses, small counties, and small cities.— a. Each agency, before the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, shall consider the impact of the rule on small businesses as defined by s. 288.703 and the impact of the rule on small counties or small cities as defined by s. 120.52. Whenever practicable, an agency shall tier its rules to reduce disproportionate impacts on small businesses, small counties, or small cities to avoid regulating small businesses, small counties, or small cities that do not contribute significantly to the problem the rule is designed to address. The agency shall consider each of the following methods for reducing the impact of the proposed rule on small businesses, small counties, and small cities, or any combination of these entities: (I) Establishing less stringent compliance or reporting requirements in the rule. (II) Establishing less stringent schedules or deadlines in the rule for compliance or reporting requirements. (III) Consolidating or simplifying the rule’s compliance or reporting requirements. (IV) Establishing performance standards or best management practices to replace design or operational standards in the rule. (V) Exempting small businesses, small counties, or small cities from any or all requirements of the rule. b.(I) If the agency determines that the proposed action will affect small businesses, the agency shall send written notice of the rule to the rules ombudsman in the Executive Office of the Governor at least 28 days before the intended action. (II) Each agency shall adopt those regulatory alternatives offered by the rules ombudsman in the Executive Office of the Governor and provided to the agency no later than 21 days after the rules ombudsman’s receipt of the written notice of the rule which it finds are feasible and consistent with the stated objectives of the proposed rule and which would reduce the impact on small businesses. When regulatory alternatives are offered by the rules ombudsman in the Executive Office of the Governor, the 90-day period for filing the rule in subparagraph (e)2. is extended for a period of 21 days. An agency shall provide the committee a copy of any regulatory alternative offered to the agency within 7 days after its delivery to the agency. The agency may not file a rule for adoption before such regulatory alternative, if applicable, has been provided to the committee. (III) If an agency does not adopt all alternatives offered pursuant to this sub-subparagraph, it must, before rule adoption or amendment and pursuant to subparagraph (d)1., file a detailed written statement with the committee explaining the reasons for failure to adopt such alternatives. Within 3 working days after the filing of such notice, the agency shall send a copy of such notice to the rules ombudsman in the Executive Office of the Governor. (c) Hearings.— 1. If the intended action concerns any rule other than one relating exclusively to procedure or practice, the agency shall, on the request of any affected person received within 21 days after the date of publication of the notice of intended agency action, give affected persons an opportunity to present evidence and argument on all issues under consideration. The agency may schedule a public hearing on the rule and, if requested by any affected person, shall schedule a public hearing on the rule. When a public hearing is held, the agency must ensure that staff are available to explain the agency’s proposal and to respond to questions or comments regarding the rule. If the agency head is a board or other collegial body created under s. 20.165(4) or s. 20.43(3)(g), and one or more requested public hearings is scheduled, the board or other collegial body shall conduct at least one of the public hearings itself and may not delegate this responsibility without the consent of those persons requesting the public hearing. Any material pertinent to the issues under consideration submitted to the agency within 21 days after the date of publication of the notice or submitted to the agency between the date of publication of the notice and the end of the final public hearing shall be considered by the agency and made a part of the record of the rulemaking proceeding. 2. Rulemaking proceedings shall be governed solely by the provisions of this section unless a person timely asserts that the person’s substantial interests will be affected in the proceeding and affirmatively demonstrates to the agency that the proceeding does not provide adequate opportunity to protect those interests. If the agency determines that the rulemaking proceeding is not adequate to protect the person’s interests, it shall suspend the rulemaking proceeding and convene a separate proceeding under the provisions of ss. 120.569 and 120.57. Similarly situated persons may be requested to join and participate in the separate proceeding. Upon conclusion of the separate proceeding, the rulemaking proceeding shall be resumed. (d) Modification or withdrawal of proposed rules.— 1. After the final public hearing on the proposed rule, or after the time for requesting a hearing has expired, if the proposed rule has not been changed from the rule as previously filed with the committee, or contains only technical changes, the adopting agency must file a notice to that effect with the committee at least 7 days before filing the proposed rule for adoption. Any change, other than a technical change, must be supported by the record of public hearings held on the proposed rule, must be in response to written material submitted to the agency within 21 days after the date of publication of the notice of intended agency action or submitted to the agency between the date of publication of the notice and the end of the final public hearing, or must be in response to a proposed objection by the committee. Any change, other than a technical change, to a statement of estimated regulatory costs requires a notice of change. In addition, any change, other than a technical change, to proposed rule text or any material incorporated by reference requires the adopting agency to provide a copy of a notice of change by certified mail or actual delivery to any person who requests it in writing no later than 21 days after the notice required in paragraph (a). The agency shall file the notice of change with the committee, along with the reasons for the change, and provide the notice of change to persons requesting it, at least 21 days before filing the rule for adoption. The notice of change must be published in the Florida Administrative Register at least 21 days before filing the proposed rule for adoption. The notice of change must include a summary of any revision to the statement of estimated regulatory costs required by s. 120.541(1)(c). This subparagraph does not apply to emergency rules adopted pursuant to subsection (4). Material proposed to be incorporated by reference in the notice of change must be made available in the manner prescribed by sub-subparagraph (1)(i)3.a. or sub-subparagraph (1)(i)3.b. and include a summary of substantive revisions to any material proposed to be incorporated by reference in the proposed rule. 2. After the notice required by paragraph (a) and before adoption, the agency may withdraw the proposed rule in whole or in part. 3. After the notice required by paragraph (a), the agency must withdraw the proposed rule if the agency has either failed to adopt it within the prescribed timeframes in this chapter or failed to submit the concise statement required under subparagraph (2)(a)2. If, 30 days after notice by the committee that the agency has failed to either adopt the proposed rule within the prescribed timeframes in this chapter or submit the required statement, the agency has not given notice of the withdrawal of the proposed rule, the committee must notify the Department of State that the date for adoption of the rule or submission of the required statement has expired, and the Department of State must publish a notice of withdrawal of the proposed rule. Within 30 days after the withdrawal, the agency must initiate rulemaking again if the mandatory grant of rulemaking authority the agency relied upon as authority to pursue the original rule action is still in effect at the time of the original rule’s withdrawal. 4. After adoption and before the rule becomes effective, a rule may be modified or withdrawn only in the following circumstances: a. When the committee objects to the rule; b. When a final order, which is not subject to further appeal, is entered in a rule challenge brought pursuant to s. 120.56 after the date of adoption but before the rule becomes effective pursuant to subparagraph (e)6.; c. If the rule requires ratification, when the Legislature does not ratify the rule by the adjournment sine die of the regular session immediately following the timely filing for adoption of the rule, in which case the rule must be withdrawn, and within 90 days after adjournment sine die, the agency: (I) May initiate rulemaking again by publishing the notice required by paragraph (a); or (II) Must initiate rulemaking again by publishing the notice required by paragraph (a), if the mandatory grant of rulemaking authority the agency relied upon as authority to pursue the original rule action is still in effect at the time of the original rule’s withdrawal; or d. When the committee notifies the agency that an objection to the rule is being considered, in which case the rule may be modified to extend the effective date by not more than 60 days. 5. The agency shall give notice of its decision to withdraw or modify a rule in the first available issue of the publication in which the original notice of rulemaking was published, shall notify those persons described in subparagraph (a)3. in accordance with the requirements of that subparagraph, and must notify the Department of State if the rule is required to be filed with the Department of State. 6. After a rule has become effective, it may be repealed or amended only through the rulemaking procedures specified in this chapter. 7. The committee must, within 15 days after the end of each calendar quarter, compile and post on its website a list of each failure by an agency to file a notice of proposed rule within the timeframe prescribed by subparagraph (2)(a)2. that has occurred within the last quarter. The committee’s list must provide the following: a. The name of the agency that failed to timely file a notice of proposed rule. b. The website address where the relevant notice of rule development may be found. c. A citation to the applicable grant of rulemaking authority for the proposed rule and the law being implemented. d. If the timeframe for filing a notice of proposed rule prescribed in subparagraph (2)(a)2. has been exceeded but a notice of proposed rule has not been filed, the length of time since the filing of the notice of rule development. e. If the timeframe for filing a notice of proposed rule in subparagraph (2)(a)2. has been exceeded and a notice of proposed rule has been filed, the length of time between the agency filing the notice of rule development and the filing of the notice of proposed rule. f. A copy of the agency’s concise statement required under subparagraph (2)(a)2. (e) Filing for final adoption; effective date.— 1. If the adopting agency is required to publish its rules in the Florida Administrative Code, the agency, upon approval of the agency head, must electronically file with the Department of State a certified copy of the rule it proposes to adopt; one copy of any material incorporated by reference in the rule, certified by the agency; a summary of the rule; a summary of any hearings held on the rule; and a detailed written statement of the facts and circumstances justifying the rule. Agencies not required to publish their rules in the Florida Administrative Code shall file one certified copy of the proposed rule, and the other material required by this subparagraph, in the office of the agency head, and such rules must be open to the public. 2. A rule may not be filed for adoption less than 28 days or more than 90 days after the notice required by paragraph (a), until 21 days after the notice of change required by paragraph (d), until 14 days after the final public hearing, until 21 days after a statement of estimated regulatory costs required under s. 120.541 has been provided to all persons who submitted a lower cost regulatory alternative and made available to the public, or until the administrative law judge has rendered a decision under s. 120.56(2), whichever applies. When a required notice of change is published before the expiration of the time to file the rule for adoption, the period during which a rule must be filed for adoption is extended to 45 days after the date of publication. If notice of a public hearing is published before the expiration of the time to file the rule for adoption, the period during which a rule must be filed for adoption is extended to 45 days after adjournment of the final hearing on the rule, 21 days after receipt of all material authorized to be submitted at the hearing, or 21 days after receipt of the transcript, if one is made, whichever is latest. The term “public hearing” includes any public meeting held by any agency at which the rule is considered. If a petition for an administrative determination under s. 120.56(2) is filed, the period during which a rule must be filed for adoption is extended to 60 days after the administrative law judge files the final order with the clerk or until 60 days after subsequent judicial review is complete. 3. At the time a rule is filed, the agency shall certify that the time limitations prescribed by this paragraph have been complied with, that all statutory rulemaking requirements have been met, and that there is no administrative determination pending on the rule. 4. At the time a rule is filed, the committee shall certify whether the agency has responded in writing to all material and timely written comments or written inquiries made on behalf of the committee. The department shall reject any rule that is not filed within the prescribed time limits; that does not comply with all statutory rulemaking requirements and rules of the department; upon which an agency has not responded in writing to all material and timely written inquiries or written comments; upon which an administrative determination is pending; or which does not include a statement of estimated regulatory costs, if required. 5. If a rule has not been adopted within the time limits imposed by this paragraph or has not been adopted in compliance with all statutory rulemaking requirements, the agency proposing the rule must withdraw the rule and give notice of its action in the next available issue of the Florida Administrative Register. 6. The proposed rule is adopted upon being filed with the Department of State and becomes effective 20 days after being filed, on a later date specified in the notice required by subparagraph (a)1., on a date required by statute, or upon ratification by the Legislature pursuant to s. 120.541(3). Rules not required to be filed with the Department of State become effective when adopted by the agency head, on a later date specified by rule or statute, or upon ratification by the Legislature pursuant to s. 120.541(3). If the committee notifies an agency that an objection to a rule is being considered, the agency may postpone the adoption of the rule to accommodate review of the rule by the committee. When an agency postpones adoption of a rule to accommodate review by the committee, the 90-day period for filing the rule is tolled until the committee notifies the agency that it has completed its review of the rule. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “administrative determination” does not include subsequent judicial review. (4) EMERGENCY RULES.— (a) If an agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare requires emergency action, or if the Legislature authorizes the agency to adopt emergency rules and finds that all conditions specified in this paragraph are met, the agency may, within the authority granted to the agency under the State Constitution or delegated to it by the Legislature, adopt any rule necessitated by the immediate danger or legislative finding. The agency may adopt a rule by any procedure which is fair under the circumstances if: 1. The procedure provides at least the procedural protection given by other statutes, the State Constitution, or the United States Constitution. 2. The agency takes only that action necessary to protect the public interest under the emergency procedure. 3. The agency publishes in writing at the time of, or prior to, its action the specific facts and reasons for finding an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare and its reasons for concluding that the procedure used is fair under the circumstances. In any event, notice of emergency rules, other than those of educational units or units of government with jurisdiction in only one or a part of one county, including the full text of the rules and the agency’s findings of immediate danger, necessity, and procedural fairness or a citation to the grant of emergency rulemaking authority, must be published in the first available issue of the Florida Administrative Register and provided to the committee along with any material incorporated by reference in the rules. The agency’s findings of immediate danger, necessity, and procedural fairness are judicially reviewable. (b) Rules pertaining to the public health, safety, or welfare must include rules pertaining to perishable agricultural commodities or rules pertaining to the interpretation and implementation of the requirements of chapters 97-102 and chapter 105 of the Election Code. (c)1. An emergency rule adopted under this subsection may not be effective for a period longer than 90 days and may not be renewable, except when the agency has initiated rulemaking to adopt rules addressing the subject of the emergency rule and either: a. A challenge to the proposed rules has been filed and remains pending; or b. The proposed rules are awaiting ratification by the Legislature pursuant to s. 120.541(3). If the proposed rule is not ratified during the next regular legislative session, the emergency rule shall expire at adjournment sine die of that regular legislative session. The proposed rule must be withdrawn from ratification in accordance with paragraph (3)(d). 2. This paragraph does not prohibit the agency from adopting a rule or rules identical to the emergency rule through the rulemaking procedures specified in subsection (3). (d) Notice of the renewal of an emergency rule must be published in the Florida Administrative Register before the expiration of the existing emergency rule. The notice of renewal must state the specific facts and reasons for such renewal. (e) For emergency rules with an effective period greater than 90 days which are intended to replace existing rules, a note must be added to the history note of the existing rule which specifically identifies the emergency rule that is intended to supersede the existing rule and includes the date that the emergency rule was filed with the Department of State. (f) Emergency rules must be published in the Florida Administrative Code. (g) An agency may supersede an emergency rule in effect through adoption of another emergency rule before the superseded rule expires. The reason for adopting the superseding rule must be stated in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (a). The superseding rule may not be in effect longer than the duration of the effective period of the superseded rule. (h) An agency may make technical changes to an emergency rule within the first 7 days after the rule is adopted, and such changes must be published in the Florida Administrative Register as a notice of correction. (i) Subject to applicable constitutional and statutory provisions, an emergency rule becomes effective immediately on filing, or on a date less than 20 days thereafter if specified in the rule, if the adopting agency finds that such effective date is necessary because of immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare. (j) An agency may repeal an emergency rule before it expires by providing notice of its intended action in the Florida Administrative Register. The notice must include the full text of the emergency rule and a summary thereof; if applicable, a reference to the rule number; and a short, plain explanation as to why the conditions specified in accordance with paragraph (a) no longer require the emergency rule. (5) UNIFORM RULES.— (a)1. By July 1, 1997, the Administration Commission shall adopt one or more sets of uniform rules of procedure which shall be reviewed by the committee and filed with the Department of State. Agencies must comply with the uniform rules by July 1, 1998. The uniform rules shall establish procedures that comply with the requirements of this chapter. On filing with the department, the uniform rules shall be the rules of procedure for each agency subject to this chapter unless the Administration Commission grants an exception to the agency under this subsection. 2. An agency may seek exceptions to the uniform rules of procedure by filing a petition with the Administration Commission. The Administration Commission shall approve exceptions to the extent necessary to implement other statutes, to the extent necessary to conform to any requirement imposed as a condition precedent to receipt of federal funds or to permit persons in this state to receive tax benefits under federal law, or as required for the most efficient operation of the agency as determined by the Administration Commission. The reasons for the exceptions shall be published in the Florida Administrative Register. 3. Agency rules that provide exceptions to the uniform rules shall not be filed with the department unless the Administration Commission has approved the exceptions. Each agency that adopts rules that provide exceptions to the uniform rules shall publish a separate chapter in the Florida Administrative Code that delineates clearly the provisions of the agency’s rules that provide exceptions to the uniform rules and specifies each alternative chosen from among those authorized by the uniform rules. Each chapter shall be organized in the same manner as the uniform rules. (b) The uniform rules of procedure adopted by the commission pursuant to this subsection shall include, but are not limited to: 1. Uniform rules for the scheduling of public meetings, hearings, and workshops. 2. Uniform rules for use by each state agency that provide procedures for conducting public meetings, hearings, and workshops, and for taking evidence, testimony, and argument at such public meetings, hearings, and workshops, in person and by means of communications media technology. The rules shall provide that all evidence, testimony, and argument presented shall be afforded equal consideration, regardless of the method of communication. If a public meeting, hearing, or workshop is to be conducted by means of communications media technology, or if attendance may be provided by such means, the notice shall so state. The notice for public meetings, hearings, and workshops utilizing communications media technology shall state how persons interested in attending may do so and shall name locations, if any, where communications media technology facilities will be available. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to diminish the right to inspect public records under chapter 119. Limiting points of access to public meetings, hearings, and workshops subject to the provisions of s. 286.011 to places not normally open to the public shall be presumed to violate the right of access of the public, and any official action taken under such circumstances is void and of no effect. Other laws relating to public meetings, hearings, and workshops, including penal and remedial provisions, shall apply to public meetings, hearings, and workshops conducted by means of communications media technology, and shall be liberally construed in their application to such public meetings, hearings, and workshops. As used in this subparagraph, “communications media technology” means the electronic transmission of printed matter, audio, full-motion video, freeze-frame video, compressed video, and digital video by any method available. 3. Uniform rules of procedure for the filing of notice of protests and formal written protests. The Administration Commission may prescribe the form and substantive provisions of a required bond. 4. Uniform rules of procedure for the filing of petitions for administrative hearings pursuant to s. 120.569 or s. 120.57. Such rules shall require the petition to include: a. The identification of the petitioner, including the petitioner’s e-mail address, if any, for the transmittal of subsequent documents by electronic means. b. A statement of when and how the petitioner received notice of the agency’s action or proposed action. c. An explanation of how the petitioner’s substantial interests are or will be affected by the action or proposed action. d. A statement of all material facts disputed by the petitioner or a statement that there are no disputed facts. e. A statement of the ultimate facts alleged, including a statement of the specific facts the petitioner contends warrant reversal or modification of the agency’s proposed action. f. A statement of the specific rules or statutes that the petitioner contends require reversal or modification of the agency’s proposed action, including an explanation of how the alleged facts relate to the specific rules or statutes. g. A statement of the relief sought by the petitioner, stating precisely the action petitioner wishes the agency to take with respect to the proposed action. 5. Uniform rules for the filing of request for administrative hearing by a respondent in agency enforcement and disciplinary actions. Such rules shall require a request to include: a. The name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number of the party making the request and the name, address, and telephone number of the party’s counsel or qualified representative upon whom service of pleadings and other papers shall be made; b. A statement that the respondent is requesting an administrative hearing and disputes the material facts alleged by the petitioner, in which case the respondent shall identify those material facts that are in dispute, or that the respondent is requesting an administrative hearing and does not dispute the material facts alleged by the petitioner; and c. A reference by file number to the administrative complaint that the party has received from the agency and the date on which the agency pleading was received. The agency may provide an election-of-rights form for the respondent’s use in requesting a hearing, so long as any form provided by the agency calls for the information in sub-subparagraphs a. through c. and does not impose any additional requirements on a respondent in order to request a hearing, unless such requirements are specifically authorized by law. 6. Uniform rules of procedure for the filing and prompt disposition of petitions for declaratory statements. The rules shall also describe the contents of the notices that must be published in the Florida Administrative Register under s. 120.565, including any applicable time limit for the filing of petitions to intervene or petitions for administrative hearing by persons whose substantial interests may be affected. 7. Provision of a method by which each agency head shall provide a description of the agency’s organization and general course of its operations. The rules shall require that the statement concerning the agency’s organization and operations be published on the agency’s website. 8. Uniform rules establishing procedures for granting or denying petitions for variances and waivers pursuant to s. 120.542. (6) ADOPTION OF FEDERAL STANDARDS.—Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this section, in the pursuance of state implementation, operation, or enforcement of federal programs, an agency is empowered to adopt rules substantively identical to regulations adopted pursuant to federal law, in accordance with the following procedures: (a) The agency shall publish notice of intent to adopt a rule pursuant to this subsection in the Florida Administrative Register at least 21 days prior to filing the rule with the Department of State. The agency shall provide a copy of the notice of intent to adopt a rule to the committee at least 21 days prior to the date of filing with the Department of State. Prior to filing the rule with the Department of State, the agency shall consider any written comments received within 14 days after the date of publication of the notice of intent to adopt a rule. The rule shall be adopted upon filing with the Department of State. Substantive changes from the rules as noticed shall require republishing of notice as required in this subsection. (b) Any rule adopted pursuant to this subsection shall become effective upon the date designated by the agency in the notice of intent to adopt a rule; however, no such rule shall become effective earlier than the effective date of the substantively identical federal regulation. (c) Any substantially affected person may, within 14 days after the date of publication of the notice of intent to adopt a rule, file an objection to rulemaking with the agency. The objection shall specify the portions of the proposed rule to which the person objects and the specific reasons for the objection. The agency shall not proceed pursuant to this subsection to adopt those portions of the proposed rule specified in an objection, unless the agency deems the objection to be frivolous, but may proceed pursuant to subsection (3). An objection to a proposed rule, which rule in no material respect differs from the requirements of the federal regulation upon which it is based, is deemed to be frivolous. (d) Whenever any federal regulation adopted as an agency rule pursuant to this subsection is declared invalid or is withdrawn, revoked, repealed, remanded, or suspended, the agency shall, within 60 days thereafter, publish a notice of repeal of the substantively identical agency rule in the Florida Administrative Register. Such repeal is effective upon publication of the notice. Whenever any federal regulation adopted as an agency rule pursuant to this subsection is substantially amended, the agency may adopt the amended regulation as a rule. If the amended regulation is not adopted as a rule within 180 days after the effective date of the amended regulation, the original rule is deemed repealed and the agency shall publish a notice of repeal of the original agency rule in the next available Florida Administrative Register. (e) Whenever all or part of any rule proposed for adoption by the agency is substantively identical to a regulation adopted pursuant to federal law, such rule shall be written in a manner so that the rule specifically references the regulation whenever possible. (7) PETITION TO INITIATE RULEMAKING.— (a) Any person regulated by an agency or having substantial interest in an agency rule may petition an agency to adopt, amend, or repeal a rule or to provide the minimum public information required by this chapter. The petition must specify the proposed rule and action requested. The agency shall provide to the committee a copy of the petition within 7 days after its receipt. No later than 30 calendar days following the date of filing a petition, the agency shall initiate rulemaking proceedings under this chapter, otherwise comply with the requested action, or deny the petition with a written statement of its reasons for the denial. The agency shall notify the committee of its intended action or response within 7 days. (b) If the petition filed under this subsection is directed to an unadopted rule, the agency shall, not later than 30 days following the date of filing a petition, initiate rulemaking, or provide notice in the Florida Administrative Register that the agency will hold a public hearing on the petition within 30 days after publication of the notice. The purpose of the public hearing is to consider the comments of the public directed to the agency rule which has not been adopted by the rulemaking procedures or requirements of this chapter, its scope and application, and to consider whether the public interest is served adequately by the application of the rule on a case-by-case basis, as contrasted with its adoption by the rulemaking procedures or requirements set forth in this chapter. (c) If the agency does not initiate rulemaking or otherwise comply with the requested action within 30 days after the public hearing provided for in paragraph (b), the agency shall publish in the Florida Administrative Register a statement of its reasons for not initiating rulemaking or otherwise complying with the requested action and of any changes it will make in the scope or application of the unadopted rule. The agency shall file the statement with the committee. The committee shall forward a copy of the statement to the substantive committee with primary oversight jurisdiction of the agency in each house of the Legislature. The committee or the committee with primary oversight jurisdiction may hold a hearing directed to the statement of the agency. The committee holding the hearing may recommend to the Legislature the introduction of legislation making the rule a statutory standard or limiting or otherwise modifying the authority of the agency. (d) If the agency initiates rulemaking after the public hearing provided for in paragraph (b), the agency shall publish a notice of rule development within 30 days after the hearing and file a notice of proposed rule within 180 days after the notice of rule development unless, before the 180th day, the agency publishes in the Florida Administrative Register a statement explaining its reasons for not having filed the notice. If rulemaking is initiated under this paragraph, the agency may not rely on the unadopted rule unless the agency publishes in the Florida Administrative Register a statement explaining why rulemaking under paragraph (1)(a) is not feasible or practicable until the conclusion of the rulemaking proceeding. (8) RULEMAKING RECORD.—In all rulemaking proceedings the agency shall compile a rulemaking record. The record shall include, if applicable, copies of: (a) All notices given for the proposed rule. (b) Any statement of estimated regulatory costs for the rule. (c) A written summary of hearings on the proposed rule. (d) The written comments and responses to written comments as required by this section and s. 120.541. (e) All notices and findings made under subsection (4). (f) All materials filed by the agency with the committee under subsection (3). (g) All materials filed with the Department of State under subsection (3). (h) All written inquiries from standing committees of the Legislature concerning the rule. Each state agency shall retain the record of rulemaking as long as the rule is in effect. When a rule is no longer in effect, the record may be destroyed pursuant to the records-retention schedule developed under s. 257.36(6).

      "heading": "Statement of estimated regulatory costs.",
      "text": "120.541 Statement of estimated regulatory costs.— (1)(a) Within 21 days after publication of the notice required under s. 120.54(3)(a), a substantially affected person may submit to an agency a good faith written proposal for a lower cost regulatory alternative to a proposed rule which substantially accomplishes the objectives of the law being implemented. The proposal may include the alternative of not adopting any rule if the proposal explains how the lower costs and objectives of the law will be achieved by not adopting any rule. If submitted after a notice of change, a proposal for a lower cost regulatory alternative is deemed to be made in good faith only if the person reasonably believes, and the proposal states the person’s reasons for believing, that the proposed rule, as changed by the notice of change, increases the regulatory costs or creates an adverse impact on small businesses which was not created by the previously proposed rule. If such a proposal is submitted, the 90-day period for filing the rule is extended 21 days. Upon the submission of the lower cost regulatory alternative, the agency shall prepare a statement of estimated regulatory costs as provided in subsection (2), or shall revise its prior statement of estimated regulatory costs, and either adopt the alternative or provide a statement of the reasons for rejecting the alternative in favor of the proposed rule. The agency shall provide to the committee, within 7 days after its receipt, a copy of any proposal for a lower cost regulatory alternative, and within 7 days after its release, a copy of the agency’s response thereto. The agency may not file a rule for adoption before such documents, if applicable, have been provided to the committee. (b) If a proposed rule will have an adverse impact on small business or if the proposed rule is likely to directly or indirectly increase regulatory costs in excess of $200,000 in the aggregate within 1 year after the implementation of the rule, the agency shall prepare a statement of estimated regulatory costs as required by s. 120.54(3)(b). (c) The agency shall revise a statement of estimated regulatory costs if any change to the rule made under s. 120.54(3)(d) increases the regulatory costs of the rule. (d) At least 21 days before filing the rule for adoption, an agency that is required to revise a statement of estimated regulatory costs shall provide the statement to the person who submitted the lower cost regulatory alternative and to the committee and shall provide notice on the agency’s website that it is available to the public. (e) Notwithstanding s. 120.56(1)(c), the failure of the agency to prepare a statement of estimated regulatory costs or to respond to a written lower cost regulatory alternative as provided in this subsection is a material failure to follow the applicable rulemaking procedures or requirements set forth in this chapter. (f) An agency’s failure to prepare a statement of estimated regulatory costs or to respond to a written lower cost regulatory alternative may not be raised in a proceeding challenging the validity of a rule pursuant to s. 120.52(8)(a) unless: 1. Raised in a petition filed no later than 1 year after the effective date of the rule; and 2. Raised by a person whose substantial interests are affected by the rule’s regulatory costs. (g) A rule that is challenged pursuant to s. 120.52(8)(f) may not be declared invalid unless: 1. The issue is raised in an administrative proceeding within 1 year after the effective date of the rule; 2. The challenge is to the agency’s rejection of a lower cost regulatory alternative offered under paragraph (a) or s. 120.54(3)(b)2.b.; and 3. The substantial interests of the person challenging the rule are materially affected by the rejection. (2) A statement of estimated regulatory costs shall include: (a) An economic analysis showing whether the rule directly or indirectly: 1. Is likely to have an adverse impact on economic growth, private sector job creation or employment, or private sector investment in excess of $1 million in the aggregate within 5 years after the implementation of the rule; 2. Is likely to have an adverse impact on business competitiveness, including the ability of persons doing business in the state to compete with persons doing business in other states or domestic markets, productivity, or innovation in excess of $1 million in the aggregate within 5 years after the implementation of the rule; or 3. Is likely to increase regulatory costs, including any transactional costs, in excess of $1 million in the aggregate within 5 years after the implementation of the rule. (b) A good faith estimate of the number of individuals and entities likely to be required to comply with the rule, together with a general description of the types of individuals likely to be affected by the rule. (c) A good faith estimate of the cost to the agency, and to any other state and local government entities, of implementing and enforcing the proposed rule, and any anticipated effect on state or local revenues. (d) A good faith estimate of the transactional costs likely to be incurred by individuals and entities, including local government entities, required to comply with the requirements of the rule. As used in this section, “transactional costs” are direct costs that are readily ascertainable by the agency based upon standard business practices, and may include: 1. Filing fees. 2. Expenses to obtain a license. 3. Necessary equipment. 4. Installation, utilities for, and maintenance of necessary equipment. 5. Necessary operations or procedures. 6. Accounting, financial, information management, and other administrative processes. 7. Labor, based on relevant wages, salaries, and benefits. 8. Materials and supplies. 9. Capital expenditures, including financing costs. 10. Professional and technical services, including contracted services necessary to implement and maintain compliance. 11. Monitoring and reporting. 12. Qualifying and recurring education, training, and testing. 13. Travel. 14. Insurance and surety requirements. 15. A fair and reasonable allocation of administrative costs and other overhead. 16. Reduced sales or other revenue. 17. Other items suggested by the rules ombudsman in the Executive Office of the Governor or by any interested person, business organization, or business representative. (e) An analysis of the impact on small businesses as defined by s. 288.703, and an analysis of the impact on small counties and small cities as defined in s. 120.52. The impact analysis for small businesses must include the basis for the agency’s decision not to implement alternatives that would reduce adverse impacts on small businesses. (f) In evaluating the impacts described in paragraphs (a) and (e), an agency must include, if applicable, the market impacts likely to result from compliance with the proposed rule, including: 1. Changes to customer charges for goods or services. 2. Changes to the market value of goods or services produced, provided, or sold. 3. Changes to costs resulting from the purchase of substitute or alternative goods or services. 4. The reasonable value of time to be spent by owners, officers, operators, and managers to understand and comply with the proposed rule, including, but not limited to, time to be spent completing requiring education, training, or testing. (g) Any additional information that the agency determines may be useful. (h) In the statement or revised statement, whichever applies, a description of any regulatory alternatives submitted under paragraph (1)(a) and a statement adopting the alternative or a statement of the reasons for rejecting the alternative in favor of the proposed rule. (3) If the adverse impact or regulatory costs of the rule exceed any of the criteria established in paragraph (2)(a), the rule must be submitted to the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives no later than 30 days before the next regular legislative session, and the rule may not take effect until it is ratified by the Legislature. The agency shall notify the committee of its submission of the rule to the Legislature for ratification within 3 business days after submittal. 1 (4) Subsection (3) does not apply to the adoption of: (a) Federal standards pursuant to s. 120.54(6). (b) Triennial updates of and amendments to the Florida Building Code which are expressly authorized by s. 553.73. (c) Triennial updates of and amendments to the Florida Fire Prevention Code which are expressly authorized by s. 633.202. (d) Emergency rules adopted pursuant to s. 120.54(4). (5) For purposes of subsections (2) and (3), adverse impacts and regulatory costs likely to occur within 5 years after implementation of the rule include adverse impacts and regulatory costs estimated to occur within 5 years after the effective date of the rule. However, if any provision of the rule is not fully implemented upon the effective date of the rule, the adverse impacts and regulatory costs associated with such provision must be adjusted to include any additional adverse impacts and regulatory costs estimated to occur within 5 years after implementation of such provision. (6)(a) The Department of State shall include on the Florida Administrative Register website the agency website addresses where statements of estimated regulatory costs can be viewed in their entirety. (b) An agency that prepares a statement of estimated regulatory costs must provide, as part of the notice required under s. 120.54(3)(a), the agency website address where the statement of estimated regulatory costs can be read in its entirety to the Department of State for publication in the Florida Administrative Register. (c) If an agency revises its statement of estimated regulatory costs, the agency must provide notice that a revision has been made in the manner provided under s. 120.54(3)(d)1. Such notice must also include the agency website address where the revision can be viewed in its entirety. (7) The rules ombudsman in the Executive Office of the Governor must prescribe and post on a publicly accessible website a form that incorporates the factors in subsection (2). Agencies must use this form to prepare a statement of estimated regulatory costs as required by this section.

Section 2, ch. 2011-225, also amended subsection (4), and the language of that version conflicted with the version by s. 1, ch. 2011-222. The introductory paragraph of subsection (4) as amended by s. 92, ch. 2013-183, was published without change by s. 4, ch. 2025-189, for the purpose of adding paragraph (d) to the text version. As amended by s. 2, ch. 2011-225, subsection (4) reads: (4) This section does not apply to the adoption of emergency rules pursuant to s. 120.54(4) or the adoption of federal standards pursuant to s. 120.54(6).

      "text": "120.542 Variances and waivers.— (1) Strict application of uniformly applicable rule requirements can lead to unreasonable, unfair, and unintended results in particular instances. The Legislature finds that it is appropriate in such cases to adopt a procedure for agencies to provide relief to persons subject to regulation. A public employee is not a person subject to regulation under this section for the purpose of petitioning for a variance or waiver to a rule that affects that public employee in his or her capacity as a public employee. Agencies are authorized to grant variances and waivers to requirements of their rules consistent with this section and with rules adopted under the authority of this section. An agency may limit the duration of any grant of a variance or waiver or otherwise impose conditions on the grant only to the extent necessary for the purpose of the underlying statute to be achieved. This section does not authorize agencies to grant variances or waivers to statutes or to rules required by the Federal Government for the agency’s implementation or retention of any federally approved or delegated program, except as allowed by the program or when the variance or waiver is also approved by the appropriate agency of the Federal Government. This section is supplemental to, and does not abrogate, the variance and waiver provisions in any other statute. (2) Variances and waivers shall be granted when the person subject to the rule demonstrates that the purpose of the underlying statute will be or has been achieved by other means by the person and when application of a rule would create a substantial hardship or would violate principles of fairness. For purposes of this section, “substantial hardship” means a demonstrated economic, technological, legal, or other type of hardship to the person requesting the variance or waiver. For purposes of this section, “principles of fairness” are violated when the literal application of a rule affects a particular person in a manner significantly different from the way it affects other similarly situated persons who are subject to the rule. (3) The Governor and Cabinet, sitting as the Administration Commission, shall adopt uniform rules of procedure pursuant to the requirements of s. 120.54(5) establishing procedures for granting or denying petitions for variances and waivers. The uniform rules shall include procedures for the granting, denying, or revoking of emergency and temporary variances and waivers. Such provisions may provide for expedited timeframes, waiver of or limited public notice, and limitations on comments on the petition in the case of such temporary or emergency variances and waivers. (4) Agencies shall advise persons of the remedies available through this section and shall provide copies of this section, the uniform rules on variances and waivers, and, if requested, the underlying statute, to persons who inquire about the possibility of relief from rule requirements. (5) A person who is subject to regulation by an agency rule may file a petition with that agency, with a copy to the committee, requesting a variance or waiver from the agency’s rule. In addition to any requirements mandated by the uniform rules, each petition shall specify: (a) The rule from which a variance or waiver is requested. (b) The type of action requested. (c) The specific facts that would justify a waiver or variance for the petitioner. (d) The reason why the variance or the waiver requested would serve the purposes of the underlying statute. (6) Within 15 days after receipt of a petition for variance or waiver, an agency shall provide notice of the petition to the Department of State, which shall publish notice of the petition in the first available issue of the Florida Administrative Register. The notice shall contain the name of the petitioner, the date the petition was filed, the rule number and nature of the rule from which variance or waiver is sought, and an explanation of how a copy of the petition can be obtained. The uniform rules shall provide a means for interested persons to provide comments on the petition. (7) Except for requests for emergency variances or waivers, within 30 days after receipt of a petition for a variance or waiver, an agency shall review the petition and request submittal of all additional information that the agency is permitted by this section to require. Within 30 days after receipt of such additional information, the agency shall review it and may request only that information needed to clarify the additional information or to answer new questions raised by or directly related to the additional information. If the petitioner asserts that any request for additional information is not authorized by law or by rule of the affected agency, the agency shall proceed, at the petitioner’s written request, to process the petition. (8) An agency shall grant or deny a petition for variance or waiver within 90 days after receipt of the original petition, the last item of timely requested additional material, or the petitioner’s written request to finish processing the petition. A petition not granted or denied within 90 days after receipt of a completed petition is deemed approved. A copy of the order granting or denying the petition shall be filed with the committee and shall contain a statement of the relevant facts and reasons supporting the agency’s action. The agency shall provide notice of the disposition of the petition to the Department of State, which shall publish the notice in the next available issue of the Florida Administrative Register. The notice shall contain the name of the petitioner, the date the petition was filed, the rule number and nature of the rule from which the waiver or variance is sought, a reference to the place and date of publication of the notice of the petition, the date of the order denying or approving the variance or waiver, the general basis for the agency decision, and an explanation of how a copy of the order can be obtained. The agency’s decision to grant or deny the petition shall be supported by competent substantial evidence and is subject to ss. 120.569 and 120.57. Any proceeding pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57 in regard to a variance or waiver shall be limited to the agency action on the request for the variance or waiver, except that a proceeding in regard to a variance or waiver may be consolidated with any other proceeding authorized by this chapter.

      "text": "120.5435 Agency review of rules.— (1) For the purposes of this section, the term “rule” means the rule number assigned by the Department of State. (2)(a) By July 1, 2030, each agency, in coordination with the committee, shall review all existing rules adopted by the agency before July 1, 2025, in accordance with this section. (b) Beginning October 1, 2025, each agency shall include a list of its existing rules in its annual regulatory plan, prepared and submitted pursuant to s. 120.74. The agency shall include a schedule of the rules it will review each year during the 5-year rule review period. The agency may amend its yearly schedule in subsequent regulatory plans, but must provide for the completed review of at least 20 percent of the agency’s rules per year, until all of its subject rules have been reviewed. (c) This subsection stands repealed July 1, 2032. (3) Any rule initially adopted after July 1, 2025, must be reviewed in accordance with this section in the fifth year following adoption. Such review must be completed before the day that marks the sixth year since the adoption of the rule. (4) The agency rule review must determine whether each rule: (a) Is a valid exercise of delegated legislative authority; (b) Has current statutory authority; (c) Reiterates or paraphrases statutory material; (d) Is in proper form; (e) Is consistent with expressed legislative intent pertaining to the specific provisions of law which the rule implements; (f) Requires a technical or substantive update to reflect current use; and (g) Requires updated references to statutory citations and incorporated materials. (5) By January 1 of each year, the agency shall submit to the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the committee a report that summarizes the agency’s intended action on each rule under review during the current fiscal year. (6) The agency shall take one of the following actions during its rule review: (a) Make no change to the rule. If the agency determines that no change is necessary, the agency must submit to the committee by April 1 a copy of the reviewed rule, a written statement of its intended action, and its assessment of factors specified in subsection (4). This determination is not subject to a challenge as a proposed rule pursuant to s. 120.56(2). (b) Make a technical change to the rule. If the agency determines that one or more technical changes are necessary, the agency must submit to the committee by April 1 a copy of the reviewed rule and the recommended technical change or changes coded by underlining new text and striking through deleted text, a written statement of its intended action, its assessment of the factors specified in subsection (4), and the facts and circumstances justifying the technical change or changes to the reviewed rule. This determination is not subject to a challenge as a proposed rule pursuant to s. 120.56(2). (c) Make a substantive change to the rule. If the agency determines that the rule requires a substantive change, the agency must make all changes, including any technical changes, to the rule in accordance with this chapter. The agency shall publish a notice of rule development in the Florida Administrative Register by April 1. The agency shall also submit to the committee by April 1 a copy of the reviewed rule and the recommended change or changes coded by underlining new text and striking through deleted text, a written statement of its intended action, and its assessment of factors specified in subsection (4). This submission to the committee does not constitute a notice of rule development as contemplated by s. 120.54(2)(a) and is not required to be in the same form as the rule that will be proposed by the agency. (d) Repeal the rule. If an agency determines that the rule should be repealed, the agency must repeal the rule in accordance with this chapter and publish the required notice in the Florida Administrative Register by April 1. The agency shall also submit to the committee by April 1 a written statement of its intended action and its assessment of factors specified in subsection (4). This submission to the committee does not constitute a notice of proposed rule as contemplated by s. 120.54(3)(a). (7)(a) By July 1, the committee shall examine each agency’s rule review submissions. The committee may request from an agency any information that is reasonably necessary for examination of a rule as required by subsections (2) and (3). (b) If the agency recommends no change or a technical change to a rule, the committee must certify whether the agency has responded in writing to all material and timely written comments or inquiries made on behalf of the committee. (8) The rule review is completed upon: (a) The agency, upon approval of the agency head or his or her designee, electronically filing a certified copy of the reviewed rule to which no changes or only technical changes were made, and the committee’s certification granted pursuant to subsection (7), with the Department of State; or (b) The agency, for a reviewed rule subject to substantive change or repeal, timely filing the appropriate notice pursuant to s. 120.54. (9) The Department of State shall publish in the Florida Administrative Register a notice of the completed rule review and shall update the history note of the rule in the Florida Administrative Code to reflect the date of completion, if applicable.

      "text": "120.545 Committee review of agency rules.— (1) As a legislative check on legislatively created authority, the committee shall examine each proposed rule, except for those proposed rules exempted by s. 120.81(1)(e) and (2), each emergency rule, each rule reviewed under s. 120.5435, and may examine any existing rule, and any accompanying material or associated documents used to interpret a proposed or existing rule, for the purpose of determining whether: (a) The rule is an invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority. (b) The statutory authority for the rule has been repealed. (c) The rule reiterates or paraphrases statutory material. (d) The rule is in proper form. (e) The notice given before its adoption was sufficient to give adequate notice of the purpose and effect of the rule. (f) The rule is consistent with expressed legislative intent pertaining to the specific provisions of law which the rule implements. (g) The rule is necessary to accomplish the apparent or expressed objectives of the specific provision of law which the rule implements. (h) The rule is a reasonable implementation of the law as it affects the convenience of the general public or persons particularly affected by the rule. (i) The rule could be made less complex or more easily comprehensible to the general public. (j) The rule’s statement of estimated regulatory costs complies with the requirements of s. 120.541 and whether the rule does not impose regulatory costs on the regulated person, county, or city which could be reduced by the adoption of less costly alternatives that substantially accomplish the statutory objectives. (k) The rule will require additional appropriations. (l) If the rule is an emergency rule, there exists an emergency justifying the adoption of such rule, the agency is within its statutory authority, and the rule was adopted in compliance with the requirements and limitations of s. 120.54(4). (m) The rule includes a provision not authorized by statute, whereby the entire rule, or a provision thereof, automatically expires or is repealed on a specific date or at the end of a specified period. (2) The committee may request from an agency such information as is reasonably necessary for examination of a rule as required by subsection (1). The committee shall consult with legislative standing committees having jurisdiction over the subject areas. If the committee objects to a rule, the committee shall, within 5 days after the objection, certify that fact to the agency whose rule has been examined and include with the certification a statement detailing its objections with particularity. The committee shall notify the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate of any objection to an agency rule concurrent with certification of that fact to the agency. Such notice shall include a copy of the rule and the statement detailing the committee’s objections to the rule. (3) Within 30 days after receipt of the objection, if the agency is headed by an individual, or within 45 days after receipt of the objection, if the agency is headed by a collegial body, the agency shall: (a) If the rule is not yet in effect: 1. File notice pursuant to s. 120.54(3)(d) of only such modifications as are necessary to address the committee’s objection; 2. File notice pursuant to s. 120.54(3)(d) of withdrawal of the rule; or 3. Notify the committee in writing that it refuses to modify or withdraw the rule. (b) If the rule is in effect: 1. File notice pursuant to s. 120.54(3)(a), without prior notice of rule development, to amend the rule to address the committee’s objection; 2. File notice pursuant to s. 120.54(3)(a) to repeal the rule; or 3. Notify the committee in writing that the agency refuses to amend or repeal the rule. (c) If the objection is to the statement of estimated regulatory costs: 1. Prepare a corrected statement of estimated regulatory costs, give notice of the availability of the corrected statement in the first available issue of the Florida Administrative Register, and file a copy of the corrected statement with the committee; or 2. Notify the committee that it refuses to prepare a corrected statement of estimated regulatory costs. (4) Failure of the agency to respond to a committee objection to a rule that is not yet in effect within the time prescribed in subsection (3) constitutes withdrawal of the rule in its entirety. In this event, the committee shall notify the Department of State that the agency, by its failure to respond to a committee objection, has elected to withdraw the rule. Upon receipt of the committee’s notice, the Department of State shall publish a notice to that effect in the next available issue of the Florida Administrative Register. Upon publication of the notice, the rule shall be stricken from the files of the Department of State and the files of the agency. (5) Failure of the agency to respond to a committee objection to a rule that is in effect within the time prescribed in subsection (3) constitutes a refusal to amend or repeal the rule. (6) Failure of the agency to respond to a committee objection to a statement of estimated regulatory costs within the time prescribed in subsection (3) constitutes a refusal to prepare a corrected statement of estimated regulatory costs. (7) If the committee objects to a rule and the agency refuses to modify, amend, withdraw, or repeal the rule, the committee shall file with the Department of State a notice of the objection, detailing with particularity the committee’s objection to the rule. The Department of State shall publish this notice in the Florida Administrative Register. If the rule is published in the Florida Administrative Code, a reference to the committee’s objection and to the issue of the Florida Administrative Register in which the full text thereof appears shall be recorded in a history note. (8)(a) If the committee objects to a rule, or portion of a rule, and the agency fails to initiate administrative action to modify, amend, withdraw, or repeal the rule consistent with the objection within 60 days after the objection, or thereafter fails to proceed in good faith to complete such action, the committee may submit to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives a recommendation that legislation be introduced to address the committee’s objection. (b)1. If the committee votes to recommend the introduction of legislation to address the committee’s objection, the committee shall, within 5 days after this determination, certify that fact to the agency whose rule or proposed rule has been examined. The committee may request that the agency temporarily suspend the rule or suspend the adoption of the proposed rule, pending consideration of proposed legislation during the next regular session of the Legislature. 2. Within 30 days after receipt of the certification, if the agency is headed by an individual, or within 45 days after receipt of the certification, if the agency is headed by a collegial body, the agency shall: a. Temporarily suspend the rule or suspend the adoption of the proposed rule; or b. Notify the committee in writing that the agency refuses to temporarily suspend the rule or suspend the adoption of the proposed rule. 3. If the agency elects to temporarily suspend the rule or suspend the adoption of the proposed rule, the agency shall give notice of the suspension in the Florida Administrative Register. The rule or the rule adoption process shall be suspended upon publication of the notice. An agency may not base any agency action on a suspended rule or suspended proposed rule, or portion of such rule, prior to expiration of the suspension. A suspended rule or suspended proposed rule, or portion of such rule, continues to be subject to administrative determination and judicial review as provided by law. 4. Failure of an agency to respond to committee certification within the time prescribed by subparagraph 2. constitutes a refusal to suspend the rule or to suspend the adoption of the proposed rule. (c) The committee shall prepare proposed legislation to address the committee’s objection in accordance with the rules of the Senate and the House of Representatives for prefiling and introduction in the next regular session of the Legislature. The proposed legislation shall be presented to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives with the committee recommendation. (d) If proposed legislation addressing the committee’s objection fails to become law, any temporary agency suspension shall expire.

Through a continuous revision and publication system, compile and publish electronically, on a website managed by the department, the “Florida Administrative Code.” The Florida Administrative Code must contain all rules adopted by each agency, citing the grant of rulemaking authority and the specific law implemented pursuant to which each rule was adopted, all history notes as authorized in ss. 120.5435 and 120.545(7), complete indexes to all rules and any material incorporated by reference contained in the code, and any other material required or authorized by law or deemed useful by the department. The electronic code must display each rule chapter currently in effect in browse mode and allow full text search of the code and each rule chapter. The department may contract with a publishing firm for a printed publication; however, the department retains responsibility for the code as provided in this section. The electronic publication is the official compilation of the administrative rules of this state. The Department of State retains the copyright over the Florida Administrative Code. 2. Rules general in form but applicable to only one school district, community college district, or county, or a part thereof, or state university rules relating to internal personnel or business and finance may not be published in the Florida Administrative Code. Exclusion from publication in the Florida Administrative Code does not affect the validity or effectiveness of such rules. 3. At the beginning of the section of the code dealing with an agency that files copies of its rules with the department, the department shall publish the address and telephone number of the executive offices of each agency, the manner by which the agency indexes its rules, a listing of all rules of that agency excluded from publication in the code, a listing of all forms and material incorporated by reference adopted by rule which are used by the agency, and a statement as to where those rules may be inspected. 4. Forms may not be published in the Florida Administrative Code; but any form which an agency uses in its dealings with the public, along with any accompanying instructions, must be filed with the committee before it is used. Any form or instruction which meets the definition of the term “rule” provided in s. 120.52 must be incorporated by reference into the appropriate rule. The reference must specifically state that the form is being incorporated by reference and include the number, title, and effective date of the form and an explanation of how the form may be obtained. Each form created by an agency which is incorporated by reference in a rule notice of which is given under s. 120.54(3)(a) after December 31, 2007, must clearly display the number, title, and effective date of the form and the number of the rule in which the form is incorporated. 5. After December 31, 2025, the department shall require any material incorporated by reference in adopted rules to be filed in the manner prescribed by s. 120.54(1)(i)3.a. or b. When a proposed rule is filed for adoption with incorporated material in electronic form, the department’s publication of the Florida Administrative Code on its website must contain a hyperlink from the incorporating reference in the rule directly to that material. The department may not allow hyperlinks from rules in the Florida Administrative Code to any material other than that filed with and maintained by the department, but may allow hyperlinks to incorporated material maintained by the department from the adopting agency’s website or other sites. 6. The department shall include the date of any technical changes in the history note of the rule in the Florida Administrative Code. A technical change does not affect the effective date of the rule. A technical change made after the adoption of a rule must be published as a notice of correction. (b) Electronically publish on a website managed by the department a continuous revision and publication entitled the “Florida Administrative Register,” which serves as the official publication and must contain: 1. All notices required by s. 120.54(2) and (3)(a), showing the text of all rules proposed for consideration. 2. All notices of public meetings, hearings, and workshops conducted in accordance with s. 120.525, including a statement of the manner in which a copy of the agenda may be obtained. 3. A notice of each request for authorization to amend or repeal an existing uniform rule or for the adoption of new uniform rules. 4. Notice of petitions for declaratory statements or administrative determinations. 5. A list of all rules that were not timely reviewed by their respective agency, pursuant to s. 120.5435, updated at least annually. 6. A summary of each objection to any rule filed by the Administrative Procedures Committee. 7. A list of rules filed for adoption in the previous 7 days. 8. A list of all rules filed for adoption pending legislative ratification under s. 120.541(3). A rule shall be removed from the list once notice of ratification or withdrawal of the rule is received. 9. The full text of each emergency rule in effect on the date of publication. 10. Any other material required or authorized by law or deemed useful by the department. The department may contract with a publishing firm for a printed publication of the Florida Administrative Register and make copies available on an annual subscription basis. (c) Prescribe by rule the style and form required for rules, notices, and other materials submitted for filing, including any rule requiring that documents created by an agency which are proposed to be incorporated by reference in notices published pursuant to s. 120.54(3)(a) and (d) be coded as required in s. 120.54(1)(i)7. (d) Charge each agency using the Florida Administrative Register a space rate to cover the costs related to the Florida Administrative Register and the Florida Administrative Code. (e) Maintain a permanent record of all notices published in the Florida Administrative Register. (2) The Florida Administrative Register website must allow users to: (a) Search for notices by type, publication date, rule number, word, subject, and agency. (b) Search a database that makes available all notices published on the website for a period of at least 5 years. (c) Subscribe to an automated e-mail notification of selected notices to be sent out before or concurrently with publication of the electronic Florida Administrative Register. Such notification must include in the text of the e-mail a summary of the content of each notice. (d) View agency forms and other materials submitted to the department in electronic form and incorporated by reference in proposed rules. (e) Comment on proposed rules. (3) Publication of material required by paragraph (1)(b) on the Florida Administrative Register website does not preclude publication of such material on an agency’s website or by other means. (4) Each agency shall provide copies of its rules upon request, with citations to the grant of rulemaking authority and the specific law implemented for each rule. (5) Each agency that provides an e-mail notification service to inform licensees or other registered recipients of notices shall use that service to notify recipients of each notice required under s. 120.54(2) and (3) and provide Internet links to the appropriate rule page on the Secretary of State’s website or Internet links to an agency website that contains the proposed rule or final rule. (6) Any publication of a proposed rule promulgated by an agency, whether published in the Florida Administrative Register or elsewhere, shall include, along with the rule, the name of the person or persons originating such rule, the name of the agency head who approved the rule, and the date upon which the rule was approved. (7) Access to the Florida Administrative Register website and its contents, including the e-mail notification service, shall be free for the public. (8)(a) All fees and moneys collected by the Department of State under this chapter shall be deposited in the Records Management Trust Fund for the purpose of paying for costs incurred by the department in carrying out this chapter. (b) The unencumbered balance in the Records Management Trust Fund for fees collected pursuant to this chapter may not exceed $300,000 at the beginning of each fiscal year, and any excess shall be transferred to the General Revenue Fund. (9) The failure to comply with this section may not be raised in a proceeding challenging the validity of a rule pursuant to s. 120.52(8)(a).

(c) The petition shall be filed by electronic means with the division which shall, immediately upon filing, forward by electronic means copies to the agency whose rule is challenged, the Department of State, and the committee. Within 10 days after receiving the petition, the division director shall, if the petition complies with paragraph (b), assign an administrative law judge who shall conduct a hearing within 30 days thereafter, unless the petition is withdrawn or a continuance is granted by agreement of the parties or for good cause shown. Evidence of good cause includes, but is not limited to, written notice of an agency’s decision to modify or withdraw the proposed rule or a written notice from the chair of the committee stating that the committee will consider an objection to the rule at its next scheduled meeting. The failure of an agency to follow the applicable rulemaking procedures or requirements set forth in this chapter shall be presumed to be material; however, the agency may rebut this presumption by showing that the substantial interests of the petitioner and the fairness of the proceedings have not been impaired. (d) Within 30 days after the hearing, the administrative law judge shall render a decision and state the reasons for his or her decision in writing. The division shall forthwith transmit by electronic means copies of the administrative law judge’s decision to the agency, the Department of State, and the committee. (e) Hearings held under this section shall be de novo in nature. The standard of proof shall be the preponderance of the evidence. Hearings shall be conducted in the same manner as provided by ss. 120.569 and 120.57, except that the administrative law judge’s order shall be final agency action. The petitioner and the agency whose rule is challenged shall be adverse parties. Other substantially affected persons may join the proceedings as intervenors on appropriate terms which shall not unduly delay the proceedings. Failure to proceed under this section does not constitute failure to exhaust administrative remedies. (2) CHALLENGING PROPOSED RULES; SPECIAL PROVISIONS.— (a) A petition alleging the invalidity of a proposed rule shall be filed within 21 days after the date of publication of the notice required by s. 120.54(3)(a); within 10 days after the final public hearing is held on the proposed rule as provided by s. 120.54(3)(e)2.; within 20 days after the statement of estimated regulatory costs or revised statement of estimated regulatory costs, if applicable, has been prepared and made available as provided in s. 120.541(1)(d); or within 20 days after the date of publication of the notice required by s. 120.54(3)(d). The petitioner has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the petitioner would be substantially affected by the proposed rule. The agency then has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the proposed rule is not an invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority as to the objections raised. A person who is not substantially affected by the proposed rule as initially noticed, but who is substantially affected by the rule as a result of a change, may challenge any provision of the resulting proposed rule. (b) The administrative law judge may declare the proposed rule wholly or partly invalid. Unless the decision of the administrative law judge is reversed on appeal, the proposed rule or provision of a proposed rule declared invalid shall not be adopted. After a petition for administrative determination has been filed, the agency may proceed with all other steps in the rulemaking process, including the holding of a factfinding hearing. In the event part of a proposed rule is declared invalid, the adopting agency may, in its sole discretion, withdraw the proposed rule in its entirety. The agency whose proposed rule has been declared invalid in whole or part shall give notice of the decision in the first available issue of the Florida Administrative Register. (c) When any substantially affected person seeks determination of the invalidity of a proposed rule pursuant to this section, the proposed rule is not presumed to be valid or invalid. (3) CHALLENGING RULES IN EFFECT; SPECIAL PROVISIONS.— (a) A petition alleging the invalidity of an existing rule may be filed at any time during which the rule is in effect. The petitioner has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the existing rule is an invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority as to the objections raised. (b) The administrative law judge may declare all or part of a rule invalid. The rule or part thereof declared invalid shall become void when the time for filing an appeal expires. The agency whose rule has been declared invalid in whole or part shall give notice of the decision in the Florida Administrative Register in the first available issue after the rule has become void. (4) CHALLENGING AGENCY STATEMENTS DEFINED AS UNADOPTED RULES; SPECIAL PROVISIONS.— (a) Any person substantially affected by an agency statement that is an unadopted rule may seek an administrative determination that the statement violates s. 120.54(1)(a). The petition shall include the text of the statement or a description of the statement and shall state facts sufficient to show that the statement constitutes an unadopted rule. (b) The administrative law judge may extend the hearing date beyond 30 days after assignment of the case for good cause. Upon notification to the administrative law judge provided before the final hearing that the agency has published a notice of rulemaking under s. 120.54(3), such notice shall automatically operate as a stay of proceedings pending adoption of the statement as a rule. The administrative law judge may vacate the stay for good cause shown. A stay of proceedings pending rulemaking shall remain in effect so long as the agency is proceeding expeditiously and in good faith to adopt the statement as a rule. (c) If a hearing is held and the petitioner proves the allegations of the petition, the agency shall have the burden of proving that rulemaking is not feasible or not practicable under s. 120.54(1)(a). (d) The administrative law judge may determine whether all or part of a statement violates s. 120.54(1)(a). The decision of the administrative law judge shall constitute a final order. The division shall transmit a copy of the final order to the Department of State and the committee. The Department of State shall publish notice of the final order in the first available issue of the Florida Administrative Register. (e) If an administrative law judge enters a final order that all or part of an unadopted rule violates s. 120.54(1)(a), the agency must immediately discontinue all reliance upon the unadopted rule or any substantially similar statement as a basis for agency action. (f) If proposed rules addressing the challenged unadopted rule are determined to be an invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority as defined in s. 120.52(8)(b)-(f), the agency must immediately discontinue reliance upon the unadopted rule and any substantially similar statement until rules addressing the subject are properly adopted, and the administrative law judge shall enter a final order to that effect. (g) All proceedings to determine a violation of s. 120.54(1)(a) shall be brought pursuant to this subsection. A proceeding pursuant to this subsection may be consolidated with a proceeding under subsection (3) or under any other section of this chapter. This paragraph does not prevent a party whose substantial interests have been determined by an agency action from bringing a proceeding pursuant to s. 120.57(1)(e). (5) CHALLENGING EMERGENCY RULES; SPECIAL PROVISIONS.—Challenges to the validity of an emergency rule shall be subject to the following time schedules in lieu of those established by paragraphs (1)(c) and (d). Within 7 days after receiving the petition, the division director shall, if the petition complies with paragraph (1)(b), assign an administrative law judge, who shall conduct a hearing within 14 days, unless the petition is withdrawn. The administrative law judge shall render a decision within 14 days after the hearing.

(2) The petition seeking a declaratory statement shall state with particularity the petitioner’s set of circumstances and shall specify the statutory provision, rule, or order that the petitioner believes may apply to the set of circumstances.

      "text": "120.569 Decisions which affect substantial interests.— (1) The provisions of this section apply in all proceedings in which the substantial interests of a party are determined by an agency, unless the parties are proceeding under s. 120.573 or s. 120.574. Unless waived by all parties, s. 120.57(1) applies whenever the proceeding involves a disputed issue of material fact. Unless otherwise agreed, s. 120.57(2) applies in all other cases. If a disputed issue of material fact arises during a proceeding under s. 120.57(2), then, unless waived by all parties, the proceeding under s. 120.57(2) shall be terminated and a proceeding under s. 120.57(1) shall be conducted. Parties shall be notified of any order, including a final order. Unless waived, a copy of the order shall be delivered or mailed to each party or the party’s attorney of record at the address of record. Each notice shall inform the recipient of any administrative hearing or judicial review that is available under this section, s. 120.57, or s. 120.68; shall indicate the procedure which must be followed to obtain the hearing or judicial review; and shall state the time limits which apply. (2)(a) Except for any proceeding conducted as prescribed in s. 120.56, a petition or request for a hearing under this section shall be filed with the agency. If the agency requests an administrative law judge from the division, it shall so notify the division by electronic means through the division’s website within 15 days after receipt of the petition or request. A request for a hearing shall be granted or denied within 15 days after receipt. On the request of any agency, the division shall assign an administrative law judge with due regard to the expertise required for the particular matter. The referring agency shall take no further action with respect to a proceeding under s. 120.57(1), except as a party litigant, as long as the division has jurisdiction over the proceeding under s. 120.57(1). Any party may request the disqualification of the administrative law judge by filing an affidavit with the division prior to the taking of evidence at a hearing, stating the grounds with particularity. (b) All parties shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing after reasonable notice of not less than 14 days; however, the 14-day notice requirement may be waived with the consent of all parties. The notice shall include: 1. A statement of the time, place, and nature of the hearing. 2. A statement of the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is to be held. (c) Unless otherwise provided by law, a petition or request for hearing shall include those items required by the uniform rules adopted pursuant to s. 120.54(5)(b). Upon the receipt of a petition or request for hearing, the agency shall carefully review the petition to determine if it contains all of the required information. A petition shall be dismissed if it is not in substantial compliance with these requirements or it has been untimely filed. Dismissal of a petition shall, at least once, be without prejudice to petitioner’s filing a timely amended petition curing the defect, unless it conclusively appears from the face of the petition that the defect cannot be cured. The agency shall promptly give written notice to all parties of the action taken on the petition, shall state with particularity its reasons if the petition is not granted, and shall state the deadline for filing an amended petition if applicable. This paragraph does not eliminate the availability of equitable tolling as a defense to the untimely filing of a petition. (d) The agency may refer a petition to the division for the assignment of an administrative law judge only if the petition is in substantial compliance with the requirements of paragraph (c). (e) All pleadings, motions, or other papers filed in the proceeding must be signed by the party, the party’s attorney, or the party’s qualified representative. The signature constitutes a certificate that the person has read the pleading, motion, or other paper and that, based upon reasonable inquiry, it is not interposed for any improper purposes, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay, or for frivolous purpose or needless increase in the cost of litigation. If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in violation of these requirements, the presiding officer shall impose upon the person who signed it, the represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay the other party or parties the amount of reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion, or other paper, including a reasonable attorney’s fee. (f) The presiding officer has the power to swear witnesses and take their testimony under oath, to issue subpoenas, and to effect discovery on the written request of any party by any means available to the courts and in the manner provided in the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, including the imposition of sanctions, except contempt. However, no presiding officer has the authority to issue any subpoena or order directing discovery to any member or employee of the Legislature when the subpoena or order commands the production of documents or materials or compels testimony relating to the legislative duties of the member or employee. Any subpoena or order directing discovery directed to a member or an employee of the Legislature shall show on its face that the testimony sought does not relate to legislative duties. (g) Irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded, but all other evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs shall be admissible, whether or not such evidence would be admissible in a trial in the courts of Florida. Any part of the evidence may be received in written form, and all testimony of parties and witnesses shall be made under oath. (h) Documentary evidence may be received in the form of a copy or excerpt. Upon request, parties shall be given an opportunity to compare the copy with the original, if available. (i) When official recognition is requested, the parties shall be notified and given an opportunity to examine and contest the material. (j) A party shall be permitted to conduct cross-examination when testimony is taken or documents are made a part of the record. (k)1. Any person subject to a subpoena may, before compliance and on timely petition, request the presiding officer having jurisdiction of the dispute to invalidate the subpoena on the ground that it was not lawfully issued, is unreasonably broad in scope, or requires the production of irrelevant material. 2. A party may seek enforcement of a subpoena, order directing discovery, or order imposing sanctions issued under the authority of this chapter by filing a petition for enforcement in the circuit court of the judicial circuit in which the person failing to comply with the subpoena or order resides. A failure to comply with an order of the court shall result in a finding of contempt of court. However, no person shall be in contempt while a subpoena is being challenged under subparagraph 1. The court may award to the prevailing party all or part of the costs and attorney’s fees incurred in obtaining the court order whenever the court determines that such an award should be granted under the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. 3. Any public employee subpoenaed to appear at an agency proceeding shall be entitled to per diem and travel expenses at the same rate as that provided for state employees under s. 112.061 if travel away from such public employee’s headquarters is required. All other witnesses appearing pursuant to a subpoena shall be paid such fees and mileage for their attendance as is provided in civil actions in circuit courts of this state. In the case of a public employee, such expenses shall be processed and paid in the manner provided for agency employee travel expense reimbursement, and in the case of a witness who is not a public employee, payment of such fees and expenses shall accompany the subpoena. (l) Unless the time period is waived or extended with the consent of all parties, the final order in a proceeding which affects substantial interests must be in writing and include findings of fact, if any, and conclusions of law separately stated, and it must be rendered within 90 days: 1. After the hearing is concluded, if conducted by the agency; 2. After a recommended order is submitted to the agency and mailed to all parties, if the hearing is conducted by an administrative law judge; or 3. After the agency has received the written and oral material it has authorized to be submitted, if there has been no hearing. (m) Findings of fact, if set forth in a manner which is no more than mere tracking of the statutory language, must be accompanied by a concise and explicit statement of the underlying facts of record which support the findings. (n) If an agency head finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare requires an immediate final order, it shall recite with particularity the facts underlying such finding in the final order, which shall be appealable or enjoinable from the date rendered. (o) On the request of any party, the administrative law judge shall enter an initial scheduling order to facilitate the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of the proceeding. The initial scheduling order shall establish a discovery period, including a deadline by which all discovery shall be completed, and the date by which the parties shall identify expert witnesses and their opinions. The initial scheduling order also may require the parties to meet and file a joint report by a date certain. (p) For any proceeding arising under chapter 373, chapter 378, or chapter 403, if a nonapplicant petitions as a third party to challenge an agency’s issuance of a license, permit, or conceptual approval, the order of presentation in the proceeding is for the permit applicant to present a prima facie case demonstrating entitlement to the license, permit, or conceptual approval, followed by the agency. This demonstration may be made by entering into evidence the application and relevant material submitted to the agency in support of the application, and the agency’s staff report or notice of intent to approve the permit, license, or conceptual approval. Subsequent to the presentation of the applicant’s prima facie case and any direct evidence submitted by the agency, the petitioner initiating the action challenging the issuance of the license, permit, or conceptual approval has the burden of ultimate persuasion and has the burden of going forward to prove the case in opposition to the license, permit, or conceptual approval through the presentation of competent and substantial evidence. The permit applicant and agency may on rebuttal present any evidence relevant to demonstrating that the application meets the conditions for issuance. Notwithstanding subsection (1), this paragraph applies to proceedings under s. 120.574.

If the administrative law judge assigned to a hearing becomes unavailable, the division shall assign another administrative law judge who shall use any existing record and receive any additional evidence or argument, if any, which the new administrative law judge finds necessary. (b) All parties shall have an opportunity to respond, to present evidence and argument on all issues involved, to conduct cross-examination and submit rebuttal evidence, to submit proposed findings of facts and orders, to file exceptions to the presiding officer’s recommended order, and to be represented by counsel or other qualified representative. When appropriate, the general public may be given an opportunity to present oral or written communications. If the agency proposes to consider such material, then all parties shall be given an opportunity to cross-examine or challenge or rebut the material. (c) Hearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining other evidence, but it shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions. (d) Notwithstanding s. 120.569(2)(g), similar fact evidence of other violations, wrongs, or acts is admissible when relevant to prove a material fact in issue, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident, but it is inadmissible when the evidence is relevant solely to prove bad character or propensity. When the state in an administrative proceeding intends to offer evidence of other acts or offenses under this paragraph, the state shall furnish to the party whose substantial interests are being determined and whose other acts or offenses will be the subject of such evidence, no fewer than 10 days before commencement of the proceeding, a written statement of the acts or offenses it intends to offer, describing them and the evidence the state intends to offer with particularity. Notice is not required for evidence of acts or offenses which is used for impeachment or on rebuttal. (e)1. An agency or an administrative law judge may not base agency action that determines the substantial interests of a party on an unadopted rule or a rule that is an invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority. This subparagraph does not preclude application of valid adopted rules and applicable provisions of law to the facts. 2. In a matter initiated as a result of agency action proposing to determine the substantial interests of a party, the party’s timely petition for hearing may challenge the proposed agency action based on a rule that is an invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority or based on an alleged unadopted rule. For challenges brought under this subparagraph: a. The challenge may be pled as a defense using the procedures set forth in s. 120.56(1)(b). b. Section 120.56(3)(a) applies to a challenge alleging that a rule is an invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority. c. Section 120.56(4)(c) applies to a challenge alleging an unadopted rule. d. This subparagraph does not preclude the consolidation of any proceeding under s. 120.56 with any proceeding under this paragraph. 3. Notwithstanding subparagraph 1., if an agency demonstrates that the statute being implemented directs it to adopt rules, that the agency has not had time to adopt those rules because the requirement was so recently enacted, and that the agency has initiated rulemaking and is proceeding expeditiously and in good faith to adopt the required rules, then the agency’s action may be based upon those unadopted rules if the administrative law judge determines that rulemaking is neither feasible nor practicable and the unadopted rules would not constitute an invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority if adopted as rules. An unadopted rule shall not be presumed valid. The agency must demonstrate that the unadopted rule: a. Is within the powers, functions, and duties delegated by the Legislature or, if the agency is operating pursuant to authority vested in the agency by the State Constitution, is within that authority; b. Does not enlarge, modify, or contravene the specific provisions of law implemented; c. Is not vague, establishes adequate standards for agency decisions, or does not vest unbridled discretion in the agency; d. Is not arbitrary or capricious. A rule is arbitrary if it is not supported by logic or the necessary facts; a rule is capricious if it is adopted without thought or reason or is irrational; e. Is not being applied to the substantially affected party without due notice; and f. Does not impose excessive regulatory costs on the regulated person, county, or city. 4. The recommended and final orders in any proceeding shall be governed by paragraphs (k) and (l), except that the administrative law judge’s determination regarding an unadopted rule under subparagraph 1. or subparagraph 2. shall not be rejected by the agency unless the agency first determines from a review of the complete record, and states with particularity in the order, that such determination is clearly erroneous or does not comply with essential requirements of law. In any proceeding for review under s. 120.68, if the court finds that the agency’s rejection of the determination regarding the unadopted rule does not comport with this subparagraph, the agency action shall be set aside and the court shall award to the prevailing party the reasonable costs and a reasonable attorney fee for the initial proceeding and the proceeding for review. 5. A petitioner may pursue a separate, collateral challenge under s. 120.56 even if an adequate remedy exists through a proceeding under this section. The administrative law judge may consolidate the proceedings. (f) The record in a case governed by this subsection shall consist only of: 1. All notices, pleadings, motions, and intermediate rulings. 2. Evidence admitted. 3. Those matters officially recognized. 4. Proffers of proof and objections and rulings thereon. 5. Proposed findings and exceptions. 6. Any decision, opinion, order, or report by the presiding officer. 7. All staff memoranda or data submitted to the presiding officer during the hearing or prior to its disposition, after notice of the submission to all parties, except communications by advisory staff as permitted under s. 120.66(1), if such communications are public records. 8. All matters placed on the record after an ex parte communication. 9. The official transcript. (g) The agency shall accurately and completely preserve all testimony in the proceeding, and, on the request of any party, it shall make a full or partial transcript available at no more than actual cost. (h) Any party to a proceeding in which an administrative law judge has final order authority may move for a summary final order when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. A summary final order shall be rendered if the administrative law judge determines from the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any, that no genuine issue as to any material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled as a matter of law to the entry of a final order. A summary final order shall consist of findings of fact, if any, conclusions of law, a disposition or penalty, if applicable, and any other information required by law to be contained in the final order. (i) When, in any proceeding conducted pursuant to this subsection, a dispute of material fact no longer exists, any party may move the administrative law judge to relinquish jurisdiction to the agency. An order relinquishing jurisdiction shall be rendered if the administrative law judge determines from the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with supporting and opposing affidavits, if any, that no genuine issue as to any material fact exists. If the administrative law judge enters an order relinquishing jurisdiction, the agency may promptly conduct a proceeding pursuant to subsection (2), if appropriate, but the parties may not raise any issues of disputed fact that could have been raised before the administrative law judge. An order entered by an administrative law judge relinquishing jurisdiction to the agency based upon a determination that no genuine dispute of material fact exists, need not contain findings of fact, conclusions of law, or a recommended disposition or penalty. (j) Findings of fact shall be based upon a preponderance of the evidence, except in penal or licensure disciplinary proceedings or except as otherwise provided by statute, and shall be based exclusively on the evidence of record and on matters officially recognized. (k) The presiding officer shall complete and submit to the agency and all parties a recommended order consisting of findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended disposition or penalty, if applicable, and any other information required by law to be contained in the final order. All proceedings conducted under this subsection shall be de novo. The agency shall allow each party 15 days in which to submit written exceptions to the recommended order. The final order shall include an explicit ruling on each exception, but an agency need not rule on an exception that does not clearly identify the disputed portion of the recommended order by page number or paragraph, that does not identify the legal basis for the exception, or that does not include appropriate and specific citations to the record. (l) The agency may adopt the recommended order as the final order of the agency. The agency in its final order may reject or modify the conclusions of law over which it has substantive jurisdiction and interpretation of administrative rules over which it has substantive jurisdiction. When rejecting or modifying such conclusion of law or interpretation of administrative rule, the agency must state with particularity its reasons for rejecting or modifying such conclusion of law or interpretation of administrative rule and must make a finding that its substituted conclusion of law or interpretation of administrative rule is as or more reasonable than that which was rejected or modified. Rejection or modification of conclusions of law may not form the basis for rejection or modification of findings of fact. The agency may not reject or modify the findings of fact unless the agency first determines from a review of the entire record, and states with particularity in the order, that the findings of fact were not based upon competent substantial evidence or that the proceedings on which the findings were based did not comply with essential requirements of law. The agency may accept the recommended penalty in a recommended order, but may not reduce or increase it without a review of the complete record and without stating with particularity its reasons therefor in the order, by citing to the record in justifying the action. (m) If a recommended order is submitted to an agency, the agency shall provide a copy of its final order and any exceptions to the division within 15 days after the order is filed with the agency clerk. (n) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, when statutes or rules impose conflicting time requirements for the scheduling of expedited hearings or issuance of recommended or final orders, the director of the division shall have the authority to set the proceedings for the orderly operation of this chapter. (2) ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES APPLICABLE TO HEARINGS NOT INVOLVING DISPUTED ISSUES OF MATERIAL FACT.—In any case to which subsection (1) does not apply: (a) The agency shall: 1. Give reasonable notice to affected persons of the action of the agency, whether proposed or already taken, or of its decision to refuse action, together with a summary of the factual, legal, and policy grounds therefor. 2. Give parties or their counsel the option, at a convenient time and place, to present to the agency or hearing officer written or oral evidence in opposition to the action of the agency or to its refusal to act, or a written statement challenging the grounds upon which the agency has chosen to justify its action or inaction. 3. If the objections of the parties are overruled, provide a written explanation within 7 days. (b) An agency may not base agency action that determines the substantial interests of a party on an unadopted rule or a rule that is an invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority. (c) The record shall only consist of: 1. The notice and summary of grounds. 2. Evidence received. 3. All written statements submitted. 4. Any decision overruling objections. 5. All matters placed on the record after an ex parte communication. 6. The official transcript. 7. Any decision, opinion, order, or report by the presiding officer. (3) ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES APPLICABLE TO PROTESTS TO CONTRACT SOLICITATION OR AWARD.—Agencies subject to this chapter shall use the uniform rules of procedure, which provide procedures for the resolution of protests arising from the contract solicitation or award process. Such rules shall at least provide that: (a) The agency shall provide notice of a decision or intended decision concerning a solicitation, contract award, or exceptional purchase by electronic posting. This notice shall contain the following statement: “Failure to file a protest within the time prescribed in section 120.57(3), Florida Statutes, or failure to post the bond or other security required by law within the time allowed for filing a bond shall constitute a waiver of proceedings under chapter 120, Florida Statutes.” (b) Any person who is adversely affected by the agency decision or intended decision shall file with the agency a notice of protest in writing within 72 hours after the posting of the notice of decision or intended decision. With respect to a protest of the terms, conditions, and specifications contained in a solicitation, including any provisions governing the methods for ranking bids, proposals, or replies, awarding contracts, reserving rights of further negotiation, or modifying or amending any contract, the notice of protest shall be filed in writing within 72 hours after the posting of the solicitation. The formal written protest shall be filed within 10 days after the date the notice of protest is filed. Failure to file a notice of protest or failure to file a formal written protest shall constitute a waiver of proceedings under this chapter. The formal written protest shall state with particularity the facts and law upon which the protest is based. Saturdays, Sundays, and state holidays shall be excluded in the computation of the 72-hour time periods provided by this paragraph. (c) Upon receipt of the formal written protest that has been timely filed, the agency shall stop the solicitation or contract award process until the subject of the protest is resolved by final agency action, unless the agency head sets forth in writing particular facts and circumstances which require the continuance of the solicitation or contract award process without delay in order to avoid an immediate and serious danger to the public health, safety, or welfare. (d)1. The agency shall provide an opportunity to resolve the protest by mutual agreement between the parties within 7 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and state holidays, after receipt of a formal written protest. 2. If the subject of a protest is not resolved by mutual agreement within 7 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and state holidays, after receipt of the formal written protest, and if there is no disputed issue of material fact, an informal proceeding shall be conducted pursuant to subsection (2) and applicable agency rules before a person whose qualifications have been prescribed by rules of the agency. 3. If the subject of a protest is not resolved by mutual agreement within 7 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and state holidays, after receipt of the formal written protest, and if there is a disputed issue of material fact, the agency shall refer the protest to the division by electronic means through the division’s website for proceedings under subsection (1). (e) Upon receipt of a formal written protest referred pursuant to this subsection, the director of the division shall expedite the hearing and assign an administrative law judge who shall commence a hearing within 30 days after the receipt of the formal written protest by the division and enter a recommended order within 30 days after the hearing or within 30 days after receipt of the hearing transcript by the administrative law judge, whichever is later. Each party shall be allowed 10 days in which to submit written exceptions to the recommended order. A final order shall be entered by the agency within 30 days of the entry of a recommended order. The provisions of this paragraph may be waived upon stipulation by all parties. (f) In a protest to an invitation to bid or request for proposals procurement, no submissions made after the bid or proposal opening which amend or supplement the bid or proposal shall be considered. In a protest to an invitation to negotiate procurement, no submissions made after the agency announces its intent to award a contract, reject all replies, or withdraw the solicitation which amend or supplement the reply shall be considered. Unless otherwise provided by statute, the burden of proof shall rest with the party protesting the proposed agency action. In a competitive-procurement protest, other than a rejection of all bids, proposals, or replies, the administrative law judge shall conduct a de novo proceeding to determine whether the agency’s proposed action is contrary to the agency’s governing statutes, the agency’s rules or policies, or the solicitation specifications. The standard of proof for such proceedings shall be whether the proposed agency action was clearly erroneous, contrary to competition, arbitrary, or capricious. In any bid-protest proceeding contesting an intended agency action to reject all bids, proposals, or replies, the standard of review by an administrative law judge shall be whether the agency’s intended action is illegal, arbitrary, dishonest, or fraudulent. (g) For purposes of this subsection, the definitions in s. 287.012 apply. (4) INFORMAL DISPOSITION.—Unless precluded by law, informal disposition may be made of any proceeding by stipulation, agreed settlement, or consent order.

If the agency and all parties to the administrative action agree to mediation, in writing, within 10 days after the time period stated in the announcement for election of an administrative remedy under ss. 120.569 and 120.57, the time limitations imposed by ss. 120.569 and 120.57 shall be tolled to allow the agency and parties to mediate the administrative dispute. The mediation shall be concluded within 60 days of such agreement unless otherwise agreed by the parties. The mediation agreement shall include provisions for mediator selection, the allocation of costs and fees associated with mediation, and the mediating parties’ understanding regarding the confidentiality of discussions and documents introduced during mediation. If mediation results in settlement of the administrative dispute, the agency shall enter a final order incorporating the agreement of the parties.

The initial order shall also contain a statement advising the addressees that a summary hearing is available upon the agreement of all parties under subsection (2) and briefly describing the expedited time sequences, limited discovery, and final order provisions of the summary procedure. (b) Within 15 days after service of the initial order, any party may file with the division a motion for summary hearing in accordance with subsection (2). If all original parties agree, in writing, to the summary proceeding, the proceeding shall be conducted within 30 days of the agreement, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2). (c) Intervenors in the proceeding shall be governed by the decision of the original parties regarding whether the case will proceed in accordance with the summary hearing process and shall not have standing to challenge that decision. (d) If a motion for summary hearing is not filed within 15 days after service of the division’s initial order, the matter shall proceed in accordance with ss. 120.569 and 120.57. (2) In any case to which this subsection is applicable, the following procedures apply: (a) Motions shall be limited to the following: 1. A motion in opposition to the petition. 2. A motion requesting discovery beyond the informal exchange of documents and witness lists described in paragraph (b). Upon a showing of necessity, additional discovery may be permitted in the discretion of the administrative law judge, but only if it can be completed not later than 5 days prior to the final hearing. 3. A motion for continuance of the final hearing date. 4. A motion requesting a prehearing conference, or the administrative law judge may require a prehearing conference, for the purpose of identifying: the legal and factual issues to be considered at the final hearing; the names and addresses of witnesses who may be called to testify at the final hearing; documentary evidence that will be offered at the final hearing; the range of penalties that may be imposed upon final hearing; and any other matter that the administrative law judge determines would expedite resolution of the proceeding. The prehearing conference may be held by telephone conference call. 5. During or after any preliminary hearing or conference, any party or the administrative law judge may suggest that the case is no longer appropriate for summary disposition. Following any argument requested by the parties, the administrative law judge may enter an order referring the case back to the formal adjudicatory process described in s. 120.57(1), in which event the parties shall proceed accordingly. (b) Not later than 5 days prior to the final hearing, the parties shall furnish to each other copies of documentary evidence and lists of witnesses who may testify at the final hearing. (c) All parties shall have an opportunity to respond, to present evidence and argument on all issues involved, to conduct cross-examination and submit rebuttal evidence, and to be represented by counsel or other qualified representative. (d) The record in a case governed by this subsection shall consist only of: 1. All notices, pleadings, motions, and intermediate rulings. 2. Evidence received. 3. A statement of matters officially recognized. 4. Proffers of proof and objections and rulings thereon. 5. Matters placed on the record after an ex parte communication. 6. The written decision of the administrative law judge presiding at the final hearing. 7. The official transcript of the final hearing. (e) The agency shall accurately and completely preserve all testimony in the proceeding and, upon request by any party, shall make a full or partial transcript available at no more than actual cost. (f) The decision of the administrative law judge shall be rendered within 30 days after the conclusion of the final hearing or the filing of the transcript thereof, whichever is later. The administrative law judge’s decision, which shall be final agency action subject to judicial review under s. 120.68, shall include the following: 1. Findings of fact based exclusively on the evidence of record and matters officially recognized. 2. Conclusions of law. 3. Imposition of a fine or penalty, if applicable. 4.

      "text": "120.60 Licensing.— (1) Upon receipt of a license application, an agency shall examine the application and, within 30 days after such receipt, notify the applicant of any apparent errors or omissions and request any additional information the agency is permitted by law to require. An agency may not deny a license for failure to correct an error or omission or to supply additional information unless the agency timely notified the applicant within this 30-day period. The agency may establish by rule the time period for submitting any additional information requested by the agency. For good cause shown, the agency shall grant a request for an extension of time for submitting the additional information. If the applicant believes the agency’s request for additional information is not authorized by law or rule, the agency, at the applicant’s request, shall proceed to process the application. An application is complete upon receipt of all requested information and correction of any error or omission for which the applicant was timely notified or when the time for such notification has expired. An application for a license must be approved or denied within 90 days after receipt of a completed application unless a shorter period of time for agency action is provided by law. The 90-day time period is tolled by the initiation of a proceeding under ss. 120.569 and 120.57. Any application for a license which is not approved or denied within the 90-day or shorter time period, within 15 days after conclusion of a public hearing held on the application, or within 45 days after a recommended order is submitted to the agency and the parties, whichever action and timeframe is latest and applicable, is considered approved unless the recommended order recommends that the agency deny the license. Subject to the satisfactory completion of an examination if required as a prerequisite to licensure, any license that is considered approved shall be issued and may include such reasonable conditions as are authorized by law. Any applicant for licensure seeking to claim licensure by default under this subsection shall notify the agency clerk of the licensing agency, in writing, of the intent to rely upon the default license provision of this subsection, and may not take any action based upon the default license until after receipt of such notice by the agency clerk. (2) If an applicant seeks a license for an activity that is exempt from licensure, the agency shall notify the applicant and return any tendered application fee within 30 days after receipt of the original application. (3) Each applicant shall be given written notice, personally or by mail, that the agency intends to grant or deny, or has granted or denied, the application for license. The notice must state with particularity the grounds or basis for the issuance or denial of the license, except when issuance is a ministerial act. Unless waived, a copy of the notice shall be delivered or mailed to each party’s attorney of record and to each person who has made a written request for notice of agency action. Each notice must inform the recipient of the basis for the agency decision, inform the recipient of any administrative hearing pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57 or judicial review pursuant to s. 120.68 which may be available, indicate the procedure that must be followed, and state the applicable time limits. The issuing agency shall certify the date the notice was mailed or delivered, and the notice and the certification must be filed with the agency clerk. (4) When a licensee has made timely and sufficient application for the renewal of a license which does not automatically expire by statute, the existing license shall not expire until the application for renewal has been finally acted upon by the agency or, in case the application is denied or the terms of the license are limited, until the last day for seeking review of the agency order or a later date fixed by order of the reviewing court. (5) No revocation, suspension, annulment, or withdrawal of any license is lawful unless, prior to the entry of a final order, the agency has served, by personal service or certified mail, an administrative complaint which affords reasonable notice to the licensee of facts or conduct which warrant the intended action and unless the licensee has been given an adequate opportunity to request a proceeding pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57. When personal service cannot be made and the certified mail notice is returned undelivered, the agency shall cause a short, plain notice to the licensee to be published once each week for 4 consecutive weeks in a newspaper published in the county of the licensee’s last known address as it appears on the records of the agency. If no newspaper is published in that county, the notice may be published in a newspaper of general circulation in that county. (6) If the agency finds that immediate serious danger to the public health, safety, or welfare requires emergency suspension, restriction, or limitation of a license, the agency may take such action by any procedure that is fair under the circumstances if: (a) The procedure provides at least the same procedural protection as is given by other statutes, the State Constitution, or the United States Constitution; (b) The agency takes only that action necessary to protect the public interest under the emergency procedure; and (c) The agency states in writing at the time of, or prior to, its action the specific facts and reasons for finding an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare and its reasons for concluding that the procedure used is fair under the circumstances. The agency’s findings of immediate danger, necessity, and procedural fairness are judicially reviewable. Summary suspension, restriction, or limitation may be ordered, but a suspension or revocation proceeding pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57 shall also be promptly instituted and acted upon. (7) No agency shall include as a condition of approval of any license any provision that is based upon a statement, policy, or guideline of another agency unless the statement, policy, or guideline is within the jurisdiction of the other agency. The other agency shall identify for the licensing agency the specific legal authority for each such statement, policy, or guideline. The licensing agency must provide the licensee with an opportunity to challenge the condition as invalid. If the licensing agency bases a condition of approval or denial of the license upon the statement, policy, or guideline of the other agency, any party to an administrative proceeding that arises from the approval with conditions or denial of the license may require the other agency to join as a party in determining the validity of the condition.

(a) Prior to the granting of any exemption authorized by this section, the commission shall hold a public hearing after notice given as provided in s. 120.525. Upon the conclusion of the hearing, the commission, through the Executive Office of the Governor, shall issue an order specifically granting or denying the exemption and specifying any processes or proceedings exempted and the extent of the exemption; transmit to the committee and to the Department of State a copy of the petition, a certified copy of the order granting or denying the petition, and a copy of any alternative procedures prescribed; and give notice of the petition and the commission’s response in the Florida Administrative Register. (b) An exemption and any alternative procedure prescribed shall terminate 90 days following adjournment sine die of the then-current or next regular legislative session after issuance of the exemption order, or upon the effective date of any subsequent legislation incorporating the exemption or any partial exemption related thereto, whichever is earlier. The exemption granted by the commission shall be renewable upon the same or similar facts not more than once. Such renewal shall terminate as would an original exemption.

The director, who shall also serve as the chief administrative law judge, and any deputy chief administrative law judge must possess the same minimum qualifications as the administrative law judges employed by the division. The Deputy Chief Judge of Compensation Claims must possess the minimum qualifications established in s. 440.45(2) and shall report to the director. The division shall be a separate budget entity, and the director shall be its agency head for all purposes. The Department of Management Services shall provide administrative support and service to the division to the extent requested by the director. The division shall not be subject to control, supervision, or direction by the Department of Management Services in any manner, including, but not limited to, personnel, purchasing, transactions involving real or personal property, and budgetary matters. (2) The director has the right to appeal actions by the Executive Office of the Governor that affect amendments to the division’s approved operating budget or any personnel actions pursuant to chapter 216 to the Administration Commission, which shall decide such issue by majority vote. The appropriations committees may advise the Administration Commission on the issue. If the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives object in writing to the effects of the appeal, the appeal may be affirmed by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the commission members present. (3) Each state agency as defined in chapter 216 and each political subdivision shall make its facilities available, at a time convenient to the provider, for use by the division in conducting proceedings pursuant to this chapter. (4) The division shall employ administrative law judges to conduct hearings required by this chapter or other law. Any person employed by the division as an administrative law judge must have been a member of The Florida Bar in good standing for the preceding 5 years. (5) If the division cannot furnish a division administrative law judge promptly in response to an agency request, the director shall designate in writing a qualified full-time employee of an agency other than the requesting agency to conduct the hearing. The director shall have the discretion to designate such a hearing officer who is located in that part of the state where the parties and witnesses reside. (6) The division is authorized to provide administrative law judges on a contract basis to any governmental entity to conduct any hearing not covered by this section. (7) Rules promulgated by the division may authorize any reasonable sanctions except contempt for violation of the rules of the division or failure to comply with a reasonable order issued by an administrative law judge, which is not under judicial review. (8) Not later than February 1 of each year, the division shall issue a written report to the Administrative Procedures Committee and the Administration Commission, including at least the following information: (a) A summary of the extent and effect of agencies’ utilization of administrative law judges, court reporters, and other personnel in proceedings under this chapter. (b) Recommendations for change or improvement in the Administrative Procedure Act or any agency’s practice or policy with respect thereto. (c) Recommendations as to those types of cases or disputes which should be conducted under the summary hearing process described in s. 120.574. (d) A report regarding each agency’s compliance with the filing requirement in s. 120.57(1)(m).

(b) A preliminary, procedural, or intermediate order of the agency or of an administrative law judge of the Division of Administrative Hearings is immediately reviewable if review of the final agency decision would not provide an adequate remedy. (2)(a) Judicial review shall be sought in the appellate district where the agency maintains its headquarters or where a party resides or as otherwise provided by law. All proceedings shall be instituted by filing a notice of appeal or petition for review in accordance with the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure within 30 days after the rendition of the order being appealed. If the appeal is of an order rendered in a proceeding initiated under s. 120.56, the agency whose rule is being challenged shall transmit a copy of the notice of appeal to the committee. (b) When proceedings under this chapter are consolidated for final hearing and the parties to the consolidated proceeding seek review of final or interlocutory orders in more than one district court of appeal, the courts of appeal are authorized to transfer and consolidate the review proceedings. The court may transfer such appellate proceedings on its own motion, upon motion of a party to one of the appellate proceedings, or by stipulation of the parties to the appellate proceedings. In determining whether to transfer a proceeding, the court may consider such factors as the interrelationship of the parties and the proceedings, the desirability of avoiding inconsistent results in related matters, judicial economy, and the burden on the parties of reproducing the record for use in multiple appellate courts. (3) The filing of the petition does not itself stay enforcement of the agency decision, but if the agency decision has the effect of suspending or revoking a license, supersedeas shall be granted as a matter of right upon such conditions as are reasonable, unless the court, upon petition of the agency, determines that a supersedeas would constitute a probable danger to the health, safety, or welfare of the state. The agency also may grant a stay upon appropriate terms, but, whether or not the action has the effect of suspending or revoking a license, a petition to the agency for a stay is not a prerequisite to a petition to the court for supersedeas. In any event the court shall specify the conditions, if any, upon which the stay or supersedeas is granted. (4) Judicial review of any agency action shall be confined to the record transmitted and any additions made thereto in accordance with paragraph (7)(a). (5) The record for judicial review shall be compiled in accordance with the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure. (6)(a) The reviewing court’s decision may be mandatory, prohibitory, or declaratory in form, and it shall provide whatever relief is appropriate irrespective of the original form of the petition. The court may: 1. Order agency action required by law; order agency exercise of discretion when required by law; set aside agency action; remand the case for further agency proceedings; or decide the rights, privileges, obligations, requirements, or procedures at issue between the parties; and 2. Order such ancillary relief as the court finds necessary to redress the effects of official action wrongfully taken or withheld. (b) If the court sets aside agency action or remands the case to the agency for further proceedings, it may make such interlocutory order as the court finds necessary to preserve the interests of any party and the public pending further proceedings or agency action. (7) The court shall remand a case to the agency for further proceedings consistent with the court’s decision or set aside agency action, as appropriate, when it finds that: (a) There has been no hearing prior to agency action and the reviewing court finds that the validity of the action depends upon disputed facts; (b) The agency’s action depends on any finding of fact that is not supported by competent, substantial evidence in the record of a hearing conducted pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57; however, the court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on any disputed finding of fact; (c) The fairness of the proceedings or the correctness of the action may have been impaired by a material error in procedure or a failure to follow prescribed procedure; (d) The agency has erroneously interpreted a provision of law and a correct interpretation compels a particular action; or (e) The agency’s exercise of discretion was: 1. Outside the range of discretion delegated to the agency by law; 2. Inconsistent with agency rule; 3. Inconsistent with officially stated agency policy or a prior agency practice, if deviation therefrom is not explained by the agency; or 4. Otherwise in violation of a constitutional or statutory provision; but the court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency on an issue of discretion. (8) Unless the court finds a ground for setting aside, modifying, remanding, or ordering agency action or ancillary relief under a specified provision of this section, it shall affirm the agency’s action. (9) A petition challenging an agency rule as an invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority shall not be instituted pursuant to this section, except to review an order entered pursuant to a proceeding under s. 120.56 or s. 120.57(1)(e)1. or (2)(b) or an agency’s findings of immediate danger, necessity, and procedural fairness prerequisite to the adoption of an emergency rule pursuant to s. 120.54(4), unless the sole issue presented by the petition is the constitutionality of a rule and there are no disputed issues of fact. (10) If an administrative law judge’s final order depends on any fact found by the administrative law judge, the court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative law judge as to the weight of the evidence on any disputed finding of fact. The court shall, however, set aside the final order of the administrative law judge or remand the case to the administrative law judge, if it finds that the final order depends on any finding of fact that is not supported by competent substantial evidence in the record of the proceeding.

(b) A petition for enforcement of any agency action may be filed by any substantially interested person who is a resident of the state. However, no such action may be commenced: 1. Prior to 60 days after the petitioner has given notice of the violation of the agency action to the head of the agency concerned, the Attorney General, and any alleged violator of the agency action. 2. If an agency has filed, and is diligently prosecuting, a petition for enforcement. (c) A petition for enforcement filed by a nongovernmental person shall be in the name of the State of Florida on the relation of the petitioner, and the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel shall apply. (d) In an action brought under paragraph (b), the agency whose action is sought to be enforced, if not a party, may intervene as a matter of right. (2) A petition for enforcement may request declaratory relief; temporary or permanent equitable relief; any fine, forfeiture, penalty, or other remedy provided by statute; any combination of the foregoing; or, in the absence of any other specific statutory authority, a fine not to exceed $1,000. (3) After the court has rendered judgment on a petition for enforcement, no other petition shall be filed or adjudicated against the same agency action, on the basis of the same transaction or occurrence, unless expressly authorized on remand. The doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel shall apply, and the court shall make such orders as are necessary to avoid multiplicity of actions. (4) In all enforcement proceedings: (a) If enforcement depends on any facts other than those appearing in the record, the court may ascertain such facts under procedures set forth in s. 120.68(7)(a). (b) If one or more petitions for enforcement and a petition for review involving the same agency action are pending at the same time, the court considering the review petition may order all such actions transferred to and consolidated in one court. Each party shall be under an affirmative duty to notify the court when it becomes aware of multiple proceedings. (c) Should any party willfully fail to comply with an order of the court, the court shall punish that party in accordance with the law applicable to contempt committed by a person in the trial of any other action. (5) In any enforcement proceeding the respondent may assert as a defense the invalidity of any relevant statute, the inapplicability of the administrative determination to respondent, compliance by the respondent, the inappropriateness of the remedy sought by the agency, or any combination of the foregoing. In addition, if the petition for enforcement is filed during the time within which the respondent could petition for judicial review of the agency action, the respondent may assert the invalidity of the agency action. (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, upon receipt of evidence that an alleged violation of an agency’s action presents an imminent and substantial threat to the public health, safety, or welfare, the agency may bring suit for immediate temporary relief in an appropriate circuit court, and the granting of such temporary relief shall not have res judicata or collateral estoppel effect as to further relief sought under a petition for enforcement relating to the same violation. (7) In any final order on a petition for enforcement the court may award to the prevailing party all or part of the costs of litigation and reasonable attorney’s fees and expert witness fees, whenever the court determines that such an award is appropriate.

(a) The plan must include a listing of each law enacted or amended during the previous 12 months which creates or modifies the duties or authority of the agency. If the Governor or the Attorney General provides a letter to the committee stating that a law affects all or most agencies, the agency may exclude the law from its plan. For each law listed by an agency under this paragraph, the plan must state: 1. Whether the agency must adopt rules to implement the law. 2. If rulemaking is necessary to implement the law: a. Whether a notice of rule development has been published and, if so, the citation to such notice in the Florida Administrative Register. b. The date by which the agency expects to publish the notice of proposed rule under s. 120.54(3)(a). 3. If rulemaking is not necessary to implement the law, a concise written explanation of the reasons why the law may be implemented without rulemaking. (b) The plan must also include a listing of each law not otherwise listed pursuant to paragraph (a) which the agency expects to implement by rulemaking before the following July 1, except emergency rulemaking. For each law listed under this paragraph, the plan must state whether the rulemaking is intended to simplify, clarify, increase efficiency, improve coordination with other agencies, reduce regulatory costs, or delete obsolete, unnecessary, or redundant rules. (c) The plan must include any desired update to the prior year’s regulatory plan or supplement published pursuant to subsection (5). If, in a prior year, a law was identified under this paragraph or under subparagraph (a)1. as a law requiring rulemaking to implement but a notice of proposed rule has not been published: 1. The agency shall identify and again list such law, noting the applicable notice of rule development by citation to the Florida Administrative Register; or 2. If the agency has subsequently determined that rulemaking is not necessary to implement the law, the agency shall identify such law, reference the citation to the applicable notice of rule development in the Florida Administrative Register, and provide a concise written explanation of the reason why the law may be implemented without rulemaking. (d) The plan must include a certification executed on behalf of the agency by both the agency head, or, if the agency head is a collegial body, the presiding officer; and the individual acting as principal legal advisor to the agency head. The certification must: 1. Verify that the persons executing the certification have reviewed the plan. 2. Verify that the agency regularly reviews all of its rules and identify the period during which all rules have most recently been reviewed to determine if the rules remain consistent with the agency’s rulemaking authority and the laws implemented. (e) The plan also includes all of the following: 1. A list of the agency’s existing rules scheduled for review pursuant to s. 120.5435. 2. A 5-year schedule for the review of all existing rules as of July 1, 2025. 3. A yearly schedule for the rules it will review each year during the 5-year rule review. The agency may amend this schedule, if necessary. (f) The plan must include any desired update to the prior year’s regulatory plan or supplement thereof, published pursuant to subsection (5). If, in a prior year, the agency identified a rule under this paragraph as one requiring review pursuant to s. 120.5435, but the agency has not yet completed an action described in s. 120.5435(5): 1. The agency must identify and list such rule in its regulatory plan as an untimely rule review and notify the committee of such action; or 2.

The supplement must include the information required in paragraph (1)(a) and shall be published as required in subsection (2), but no certification or delivery to the committee is required. The agency shall publish in the Florida Administrative Register notice of publication of the supplement, and include a hyperlink on its website or web address for direct access to the published supplement.

      "text": "120.52 Definitions.—As used in this act: (1) “Agency” means the following officers or governmental entities if acting pursuant to powers other than those derived from the constitution: (a) The Governor; each state officer and state department, and each departmental unit described in s. 20.04; the Board of Governors of the State University System; the Commission on Ethics; the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission; a regional water supply authority; a regional planning agency; a multicounty special district, but only if a majority of its governing board is comprised of nonelected persons; educational units; and each entity described in chapters 163, 373, 380, and 582 and s. 186.504. (b) Each officer and governmental entity in the state having statewide jurisdiction or jurisdiction in more than one county. (c) Each officer and governmental entity in the state having jurisdiction in one county or less than one county, to the extent they are expressly made subject to this chapter by general or special law or existing judicial decisions. This definition does not include a municipality or legal entity created solely by a municipality; a legal entity or agency created in whole or in part pursuant to part II of chapter 361; a metropolitan planning organization created pursuant to s. 339.175; a separate legal or administrative entity created pursuant to s. 339.175 of which a metropolitan planning organization is a member; an expressway authority pursuant to chapter 348 or any transportation authority or commission under chapter 343 or chapter 349; or a legal or administrative entity created by an interlocal agreement pursuant to s. 163.01(7), unless any party to such agreement is otherwise an agency as defined in this subsection. (2) “Agency action” means the whole or part of a rule or order, or the equivalent, or the denial of a petition to adopt a rule or issue an order. The term also includes any denial of a request made under s. 120.54(7). (3) “Agency head” means the person or collegial body in a department or other governmental unit statutorily responsible for final agency action. An agency head appointed by and serving at the pleasure of an appointing authority remains subject to the direction and supervision of the appointing authority, but actions taken by the agency head as authorized by statute are official acts. (4) “Committee” means the Administrative Procedures Committee. (5) “Division” means the Division of Administrative Hearings. Any document filed with the division by a party represented by an attorney shall be filed by electronic means through the division’s website. Any document filed with the division by a party not represented by an attorney shall, whenever possible, be filed by electronic means through the division’s website. (6) “Educational unit” means a local school district, a community college district, the Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind, or a state university when the university is acting pursuant to statutory authority derived from the Legislature.

A final order includes all materials explicitly adopted in it. The clerk shall indicate the date of filing on the order. (8) “Invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority” means action that goes beyond the powers, functions, and duties delegated by the Legislature. A proposed or existing rule is an invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority if any one of the following applies: (a) The agency has materially failed to follow the applicable rulemaking procedures or requirements set forth in this chapter; (b) The agency has exceeded its grant of rulemaking authority, citation to which is required by s. 120.54(3)(a)1.; (c) The rule enlarges, modifies, or contravenes the specific provisions of law implemented, citation to which is required by s. 120.54(3)(a)1.; (d) The rule is vague, fails to establish adequate standards for agency decisions, or vests unbridled discretion in the agency; (e) The rule is arbitrary or capricious. A rule is arbitrary if it is not supported by logic or the necessary facts; a rule is capricious if it is adopted without thought or reason or is irrational; or (f) The rule imposes regulatory costs on the regulated person, county, or city which could be reduced by the adoption of less costly alternatives that substantially accomplish the statutory objectives. A grant of rulemaking authority is necessary but not sufficient to allow an agency to adopt a rule; a specific law to be implemented is also required. An agency may adopt only rules that implement or interpret the specific powers and duties granted by the enabling statute. No agency shall have authority to adopt a rule only because it is reasonably related to the purpose of the enabling legislation and is not arbitrary and capricious or is within the agency’s class of powers and duties, nor shall an agency have the authority to implement statutory provisions setting forth general legislative intent or policy. Statutory language granting rulemaking authority or generally describing the powers and functions of an agency shall be construed to extend no further than implementing or interpreting the specific powers and duties conferred by the enabling statute. (9) “Law implemented” means the language of the enabling statute being carried out or interpreted by an agency through rulemaking. (10) “License” means a franchise, permit, certification, registration, charter, or similar form of authorization required by law, but it does not include a license required primarily for revenue purposes when issuance of the license is merely a ministerial act. (11) “Licensing” means the agency process respecting the issuance, denial, renewal, revocation, suspension, annulment, withdrawal, or amendment of a license or imposition of terms for the exercise of a license. (12) “Official reporter” means the publication in which an agency publishes final orders, the index to final orders, and the list of final orders which are listed rather than published. (13) “Party” means: (a) Specifically named persons whose substantial interests are being determined in the proceeding. (b) Any other person who, as a matter of constitutional right, provision of statute, or provision of agency regulation, is entitled to participate in whole or in part in the proceeding, or whose substantial interests will be affected by proposed agency action, and who makes an appearance as a party. (c) Any other person, including an agency staff member, allowed by the agency to intervene or participate in the proceeding as a party. An agency may by rule authorize limited forms of participation in agency proceedings for persons who are not eligible to become parties. (d) Any county representative, agency, department, or unit funded and authorized by state statute or county ordinance to represent the interests of the consumers of a county, when the proceeding involves the substantial interests of a significant number of residents of the county and the board of county commissioners has, by resolution, authorized the representative, agency, department, or unit to represent the class of interested persons. The authorizing resolution shall apply to a specific proceeding and to appeals and ancillary proceedings thereto, and it shall not be required to state the names of the persons whose interests are to be represented. The term “party” does not include a member government of a regional water supply authority or a governmental or quasi-judicial board or commission established by local ordinance or special or general law where the governing membership of such board or commission is shared with, in whole or in part, or appointed by a member government of a regional water supply authority in proceedings under s. 120.569, s. 120.57, or s. 120.68, to the extent that an interlocal agreement under ss. 163.01 and 373.713 exists in which the member government has agreed that its substantial interests are not affected by the proceedings or that it is to be bound by alternative dispute resolution in lieu of participating in the proceedings. This exclusion applies only to those particular types of disputes or controversies, if any, identified in an interlocal agreement. (14) “Person” means any person described in s. 1.01, any unit of government in or outside the state, and any agency described in subsection (1). (15) “Recommended order” means the official recommendation of an administrative law judge assigned by the division or of any other duly authorized presiding officer, other than an agency head or member of an agency head, for the final disposition of a proceeding under ss. 120.569 and 120.57. (16) “Rule” means each agency statement of general applicability that implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy or describes the procedure or practice requirements of an agency and includes any form which imposes any requirement or solicits any information not specifically required by statute or by an existing rule. The term also includes the amendment or repeal of a rule. The term does not include: (a) Internal management memoranda which do not affect either the private interests of any person or any plan or procedure important to the public and which have no application outside the agency issuing the memorandum. (b) Legal memoranda or opinions issued to an agency by the Attorney General or agency legal opinions prior to their use in connection with an agency action. (c) The preparation or modification of: 1. Agency budgets. 2. Statements, memoranda, or instructions to state agencies issued by the Chief Financial Officer or Comptroller as chief fiscal officer of the state and relating or pertaining to claims for payment submitted by state agencies to the Chief Financial Officer or Comptroller. 3. Contractual provisions reached as a result of collective bargaining. 4. Memoranda issued by the Executive Office of the Governor relating to information resources management. (17) “Rulemaking authority” means statutory language that explicitly authorizes or requires an agency to adopt, develop, establish, or otherwise create any statement coming within the definition of the term “rule.” (18) “Small city” means any municipality that has an unincarcerated population of 10,000 or less according to the most recent decennial census. (19) “Small county” means any county that has an unincarcerated population of 75,000 or less according to the most recent decennial census. (20) “Technical change” means a change to a rule or a statement of estimated regulatory cost that is limited to correcting citations or grammatical, typographical, or similar errors that do not affect the substance of the rule or statement. (21) “Unadopted rule” means an agency statement that meets the definition of the term “rule,” but that has not been adopted pursuant to the requirements of s. 120.54. (22) “Variance” means a decision by an agency to grant a modification to all or part of the literal requirements of an agency rule to a person who is subject to the rule. Any variance shall conform to the standards for variances outlined in this chapter and in the uniform rules adopted pursuant to s. 120.54(5). (23) “Waiver” means a decision by an agency not to apply all or part of a rule to a person who is subject to the rule.

      "text": "120.60 Licensing.— (1) Upon receipt of a license application, an agency shall examine the application and, within 30 days after such receipt, notify the applicant of any apparent errors or omissions and request any additional information the agency is permitted by law to require. An agency may not deny a license for failure to correct an error or omission or to supply additional information unless the agency timely notified the applicant within this 30-day period. The agency may establish by rule the time period for submitting any additional information requested by the agency. For good cause shown, the agency shall grant a request for an extension of time for submitting the additional information. If the applicant believes the agency’s request for additional information is not authorized by law or rule, the agency, at the applicant’s request, shall proceed to process the application. An application is complete upon receipt of all requested information and correction of any error or omission for which the applicant was timely notified or when the time for such notification has expired. An application for a license must be approved or denied within 90 days after receipt of a completed application unless a shorter period of time for agency action is provided by law. The 90-day time period is tolled by the initiation of a proceeding under ss. 120.569 and 120.57. Any application for a license which is not approved or denied within the 90-day or shorter time period, within 15 days after conclusion of a public hearing held on the application, or within 45 days after a recommended order is submitted to the agency and the parties, whichever action and timeframe is latest and applicable, is considered approved unless the recommended order recommends that the agency deny the license. Subject to the satisfactory completion of an examination if required as a prerequisite to licensure, any license that is considered approved shall be issued and may include such reasonable conditions as are authorized by law. Any applicant for licensure seeking to claim licensure by default under this subsection shall notify the agency clerk of the licensing agency, in writing, of the intent to rely upon the default license provision of this subsection, and may not take any action based upon the default license until after receipt of such notice by the agency clerk. (2) If an applicant seeks a license for an activity that is exempt from licensure, the agency shall notify the applicant and return any tendered application fee within 30 days after receipt of the original application. (3) Each applicant shall be given written notice, personally or by mail, that the agency intends to grant or deny, or has granted or denied, the application for license. The notice must state with particularity the grounds or basis for the issuance or denial of the license, except when issuance is a ministerial act. Unless waived, a copy of the notice shall be delivered or mailed to each party’s attorney of record and to each person who has made a written request for notice of agency action. Each notice must inform the recipient of the basis for the agency decision, inform the recipient of any administrative hearing pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57 or judicial review pursuant to s. 120.68 which may be available, indicate the procedure that must be followed, and state the applicable time limits. The issuing agency shall certify the date the notice was mailed or delivered, and the notice and the certification must be filed with the agency clerk. (4) When a licensee has made timely and sufficient application for the renewal of a license which does not automatically expire by statute, the existing license shall not expire until the application for renewal has been finally acted upon by the agency or, in case the application is denied or the terms of the license are limited, until the last day for seeking review of the agency order or a later date fixed by order of the reviewing court. (5) No revocation, suspension, annulment, or withdrawal of any license is lawful unless, prior to the entry of a final order, the agency has served, by personal service or certified mail, an administrative complaint which affords reasonable notice to the licensee of facts or conduct which warrant the intended action and unless the licensee has been given an adequate opportunity to request a proceeding pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57. When personal service cannot be made and the certified mail notice is returned undelivered, the agency shall cause a short, plain notice to the licensee to be published once each week for 4 consecutive weeks in a newspaper published in the county of the licensee’s last known address as it appears on the records of the agency. If no newspaper is published in that county, the notice may be published in a newspaper of general circulation in that county. (6) If the agency finds that immediate serious danger to the public health, safety, or welfare requires emergency suspension, restriction, or limitation of a license, the agency may take such action by any procedure that is fair under the circumstances if: (a) The procedure provides at least the same procedural protection as is given by other statutes, the State Constitution, or the United States Constitution; (b) The agency takes only that action necessary to protect the public interest under the emergency procedure; and (c) The agency states in writing at the time of, or prior to, its action the specific facts and reasons for finding an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare and its reasons for concluding that the procedure used is fair under the circumstances. The agency’s findings of immediate danger, necessity, and procedural fairness are judicially reviewable. Summary suspension, restriction, or limitation may be ordered, but a suspension or revocation proceeding pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57 shall also be promptly instituted and acted upon. (7) No agency shall include as a condition of approval of any license any provision that is based upon a statement, policy, or guideline of another agency unless the statement, policy, or guideline is within the jurisdiction of the other agency. The other agency shall identify for the licensing agency the specific legal authority for each such statement, policy, or guideline. The licensing agency must provide the licensee with an opportunity to challenge the condition as invalid. If the licensing agency bases a condition of approval or denial of the license upon the statement, policy, or guideline of the other agency, any party to an administrative proceeding that arises from the approval with conditions or denial of the license may require the other agency to join as a party in determining the validity of the condition.
