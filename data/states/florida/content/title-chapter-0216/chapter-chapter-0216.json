It is, therefore, the intent of the Legislature in enacting this legislation that a comprehensive capital facilities planning and budgeting process be established and maintained to enable the state to better meet the demands for new and properly maintained infrastructure in a fiscally responsible manner. (3) The comprehensive capital facilities planning and budgeting process requires integration and coordination by all government agencies and by the judicial branch. The process includes: (a) An inventory of current facilities owned, leased, rented, or otherwise occupied by any agency of the state or the judicial branch; (b) An assessment of current population, economic, social, physical, and environmental trends and conditions that relate to public facilities; (c) A determination of future demographic conditions deemed most appropriate and likely for this state and of a set of goals and objectives; (d) A determination of unmet needs by comparing existing facilities to goals and objectives; (e) A strategic matching of funding options and facility needs to ensure the most effective development strategy; and (f) A management structure that maintains, operates, repairs, renovates, and replaces capital facilities to obtain the maximum value for each public dollar spent. (4) In order to carry out this act, the Executive Office of the Governor is designated as the agency responsible for the coordination, development, direction, monitoring, and evaluation of the comprehensive capital facilities planning and budgeting process, including the plans revised pursuant to that process. The Executive Office of the Governor shall publish an annual report of the progress being made by the state toward meeting the state goals and objectives of the plans. (5) All agencies of government and the judicial branch are directed to extend maximum cooperation and assistance in the furtherance of this program.

(1) The Department of Environmental Protection shall create, administer, and maintain a comprehensive system for all state lands and real property leased, owned, rented, and otherwise occupied or maintained by any state agency, by the judicial branch, and by any water management district. The comprehensive state-owned real property system shall allow the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund to perform its statutory responsibilities and the Division of State Lands in the Department of Environmental Protection to conduct strategic analyses and prepare annual valuation and disposition analyses and recommendations for all state real property assets. (a) The comprehensive state-owned real property system must contain a database that includes an accurate inventory of all real property that is leased, owned, rented, occupied, or managed by the state, the judicial branch, or the water management districts. (b) The Division of State Lands in the Department of Environmental Protection shall be the statewide custodian of the real property information and shall be accountable for its accuracy. (c) All state agencies and water management districts shall enter required real property information in the comprehensive system according to standards published by the Division of State Lands. (2) The comprehensive state-owned real property system must accomplish the following objectives: (a) Eliminate the need for redundant state real property information collection processes and state agency information systems. (b) Reduce the need to lease or acquire additional real property as a result of an annual surplus valuation, utilization, and disposition analysis. (c) Enable regional planning as a tool for cost-effective buy, sell, and lease decisions. (d) Increase state revenues and maximize operational efficiencies by annually identifying those state-owned real properties that are the best candidates for surplus or disposition. (e) Ensure all state real property is identified by collaborating and integrating with the Department of Revenue data as submitted by the county property appraisers. (f) Implement required functionality and processes for state agencies to electronically submit all applicable real property information using a web browser application. (3) By October 1, 2010, and annually thereafter, the Division of State Lands in the Department of Environmental Protection shall submit to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives a report that lists the state-owned real property recommended for disposition, including a report by the Department of Management Services of surplus buildings recommended for disposition.

In order to accomplish this type of study, the Executive Office of the Governor may request any or all agencies to submit a budget plan with respect to targets established by the Governor. Such a request shall not influence the agencies’ independent judgments in making legislative budget requests, as required by law. (2) Prepare an analysis of the legislative budget requests submitted by state agencies and the judicial branch covering their respective operational and fixed capital outlay requirements. (3) Prepare such other data as will reflect the financial condition of the state and its agencies at the close of the prior fiscal year and an estimate of what that condition will be at the close of the current fiscal year. (4) Prepare a statement of policy to assure that fixed capital outlay appropriations recommended by the Governor will be consistent with recommended operational standards related to programs and utilization. (5) Provide to the Legislature any information used to justify and evaluate the Governor’s recommended balanced budget. (6) Consult with the Office of State-Federal Relations in Washington, D.C., under the Executive Office of the Governor, in order to: (a) Evaluate current levels of federal authorization to determine how the state might obtain a more equitable share of federal funding. (b) Develop a federal-aid formula database in order to catalog all existing federal formulas and identify funding inequities. (c) Establish a federal formula modeling capability, to the extent allowable by resources. Such a modeling component should be designed in a manner which assists the state and its federal representatives in assessing periodic legislation before Congress which disseminates financial assistance to state and local governments based on a formula or set of formulas. (d) Develop and implement a communications network to link the Legislature and the executive branch with Florida’s Congressional Delegation. Such a network should allow for the rapid transmittal of: 1. Data on restructuring formula-based legislation. 2. Information on block grants and the impact of periodic proposals related thereto. 3. Information relating to federal mandate issues. 4. Data pertaining to other matters associated with federally derived funds which have an impact upon the state.

Amendments to the approved operating budgets for operational and fixed capital outlay expenditures from state agencies may be requested only through the Executive Office of the Governor and approved by the Governor and the Legislative Budget Commission as provided in this chapter. Amendments from the judicial branch may be requested only through the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and must be approved by the Chief Justice and the Legislative Budget Commission as provided in this chapter. This includes amendments which are necessary to implement the provisions of s. 216.212 or s. 216.221. (2) Amendments to the original approved operating budgets for operational and fixed capital outlay expenditures must comply with the following guidelines in order to be approved by the Governor and the Legislative Budget Commission for the executive branch and the Chief Justice and the Legislative Budget Commission for the judicial branch: (a) The amendment must be consistent with legislative policy and intent. (b) The amendment may not initiate or commence a new program or a fixed capital outlay project, except as authorized by this chapter, or eliminate an existing program. (c) Except as authorized in s. 216.292 or other provisions of this chapter, the amendment may not provide funding or increased funding for items which were funded by the Legislature in an amount less than that requested by the agency in the legislative budget request or recommended by the Governor, or which were vetoed by the Governor. (d) For amendments that involve trust funds, there must be adequate and appropriate revenues available in the trust fund and the amendment must be consistent with the laws authorizing such trust funds and the laws relating to the use of the trust funds. However, a trust fund shall not be increased in excess of the original approved budget, except as provided in subsection (11). (e) The amendment shall not conflict with any provision of law. (f) The amendment must not provide funding for any issue which was requested by the agency or branch in its legislative budget request and not funded in the General Appropriations Act. (g) The amendment must include a written description of the purpose of the proposed change, an indication of why interim budget action is necessary, and the intended recipient of any funds for contracted services. (h) The amendment must not provide general salary increases which the Legislature has not authorized in the General Appropriations Act or other laws. (3) All amendments to original approved operating budgets, regardless of funding source, are subject to the notice and objection procedures set forth in s. 216.177. (4) To the extent possible, individual members of the Senate and the House of Representatives should be advised of budget amendments requested by the executive branch and judicial branch. (5) An amendment to the original operating budget for an information technology project or initiative that involves more than one agency, has an outcome that impacts another agency, or exceeds $500,000 in total cost over a 1-year period, except for those projects that are a continuation of hardware or software maintenance or software licensing agreements, or that are for desktop replacement that is similar to the technology currently in use must be approved by the Executive Office of the Governor for the executive branch or by the Chief Justice for the judicial branch, and shall be subject to approval by the Legislative Budget Commission as well as the notice and objection procedures set forth in s. 216.177. (6)(a) A detailed plan allocating a lump-sum appropriation to traditional appropriations categories shall be submitted by the affected agency to the Executive Office of the Governor or the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The Executive Office of the Governor and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall submit such plan to the chair and vice chair of the Legislative Budget Commission either before or concurrent with the submission of any budget amendment that recommends the transfer and release of the balance of a lump-sum appropriation. (b) The Executive Office of the Governor and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may amend, without approval of the Legislative Budget Commission, state agency and judicial branch entity budgets, respectively, to reflect the transferred funds and to provide the associated increased salary rate based on the approved plans for lump-sum appropriations. Any action proposed pursuant to this paragraph is subject to the procedures set forth in s. 216.177. The Executive Office of the Governor shall transmit to each state agency and the Chief Financial Officer, and the Chief Justice shall transmit to each judicial branch component and the Chief Financial Officer, any approved amendments to the approved operating budgets. (7) The Executive Office of the Governor may, for the purpose of improved contract administration, authorize the consolidation of two or more fixed capital outlay appropriations for an agency, and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court for the judicial branch, except for projects authorized under chapter 1013, provided the original scope and purpose of each project are not changed. (8) As part of the approved operating budget, the Executive Office of the Governor shall furnish to each state agency, and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall furnish to the entity of the judicial branch, an approved annual salary rate for each budget entity containing a salary appropriation. This rate shall be based upon the actual salary rate and shall be consistent with the General Appropriations Act or special appropriations acts. The annual salary rate shall be: (a) Determined by the salary rate specified in the General Appropriations Act and adjusted for reorganizations authorized by law, for any other appropriations made by law, and, subject to s. 216.177, for distributions of lump-sum appropriations and administered funds and for actions that require authorization of salary rate from salary rate reserve and placement of salary rate in salary rate reserve. (b) Controlled by department or agency; except for the Department of Education, which shall be controlled by division and for the judicial branch, which shall be controlled at the branch level. (c) Assigned to the number of authorized positions. (9) No agency or the judicial branch may exceed its maximum approved annual salary rate for the fiscal year. However, at any time during the fiscal year, an agency or entity of the judicial branch may exceed its approved rate for all budget entities by no more than 5 percent, provided that, by June 30 of every fiscal year, the agency or entity of the judicial branch has reduced its salary rate so that the salary rate for each department is within the approved rate limit for that department. (10)(a) The Legislative Budget Commission may authorize increases or decreases in the approved salary rate, except as authorized in paragraph (8)(a), for positions pursuant to the request of the agency filed with the Executive Office of the Governor or pursuant to the request of an entity of the judicial branch filed with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, if deemed necessary and in the best interest of the state and consistent with legislative policy and intent. (b) Lump-sum salary bonuses may be provided only if specifically appropriated or provided pursuant to s. 110.1245 or s. 216.1815. (c) The salary rate provisions of subsections (8) and (9) and this subsection do not apply to the general office program of the Executive Office of the Governor. (11)(a) The Executive Office of the Governor and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may approve changes in the amounts appropriated from state trust funds in excess of those in the approved operating budget up to $1 million only pursuant to the federal funds provisions of s. 216.212, when grants and donations are received after April 1, or when deemed necessary due to a set of conditions that were unforeseen at the time the General Appropriations Act was adopted and that are essential to correct in order to continue the operation of government. (b) Changes in the amounts appropriated from state trust funds in excess of those in the approved operating budget which are in excess of $1 million may be approved only by the Legislative Budget Commission pursuant to the request of a state agency filed with the Executive Office of the Governor or pursuant to the request of an entity of the judicial branch filed with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) to the contrary, the Executive Office of the Governor may approve changes in the amounts appropriated to the Department of Military Affairs for fixed capital outlay projects when the department has received federal funds for specific fixed capital outlay projects that do not carry a continuing commitment for future appropriations by the Legislature. 1 (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) and paragraph (2)(b), and for the 2025-2026 fiscal year only, the Legislative Budget Commission may approve budget amendments for new fixed capital outlay projects or increase the amounts appropriated to state agencies for fixed capital outlay projects. This paragraph expires July 1, 2026. The provisions of this subsection are subject to the notice and objection procedures set forth in s. 216.177. (12) There is appropriated nonoperating budget for refunds, payments to the United States Treasury, and payments of the service charge to the General Revenue Fund. Such authorized budget, together with related releases, shall be transmitted by the state agency or by the judicial branch to the Chief Financial Officer for entry in his or her records in the manner and format prescribed by the Executive Office of the Governor in consultation with the Chief Financial Officer. A copy of such authorized budgets shall be furnished to the Executive Office of the Governor or the Chief Justice, the chairs of the legislative committees responsible for developing the general appropriations acts, and the Auditor General. Notwithstanding the duty specified for each state agency in s. 17.61(3), the Governor may withhold approval of nonoperating investment authority for certain trust funds when deemed in the best interest of the state. The Governor for the executive branch, and the Chief Justice for the judicial branch, may establish nonoperating budgets, with the approval of the chairs of the Senate and the House of Representatives appropriations committees, for transfers, purchase of investments, special expenses, distributions, transfers of funds specifically required by law, and any other nonoperating budget categories they deem necessary and in the best interest of the state and consistent with legislative intent and policy. For purposes of this section, the term “nonoperating budgets” means nonoperating disbursement authority for purchase of investments, refunds, payments to the United States Treasury, transfers of funds specifically required by law, distributions of assets held by the state in a trustee capacity as an agent of fiduciary, special expenses, and other nonoperating budget categories, as determined necessary by the Executive Office of the Governor and the chairs of the Senate and the House of Representatives appropriations committees, not otherwise appropriated in the General Appropriations Act. The establishment of nonoperating budget authority shall be deemed approved by a chair of a legislative committee if written notice of the objection is not provided to the Governor or Chief Justice, as appropriate, within 14 days of the chair receiving notice of the action pursuant to the provisions of s. 216.177. (13) Each state agency and the judicial branch shall develop the internal management procedures and budgets necessary to assure compliance with the approved operating budget. (14) The Executive Office of the Governor and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall certify the amounts approved for operations and fixed capital outlay, together with any relevant supplementary materials or information, to the Chief Financial Officer; and such certification shall be the Chief Financial Officer’s guide with reference to the expenditures of each state agency pursuant to s. 216.192. (15) The provisions of this section do not apply to the budgets for the legislative branch. (16)(a) Funds provided in any specific appropriation in the General Appropriations Act may be advanced if the General Appropriations Act specifically so provides. (b) Any agency, or the judicial branch, that has been authorized by the General Appropriations Act or expressly authorized by other law to make advances for program startup or advances for contracted services, in total or periodically, shall limit such disbursements to other governmental entities and not-for-profit corporations. The amount that may be advanced shall not exceed the expected cash needs of the contractor or recipient within the initial 3 months. Thereafter, disbursements shall only be made on a reimbursement basis. Any agreement that provides for advancements may contain a clause that permits the contractor or recipient to temporarily invest the proceeds, provided that any interest income shall either be returned to the agency or be applied against the agency’s obligation to pay the contract amount. This paragraph does not constitute lawful authority to make any advance payment not otherwise authorized by laws relating to a particular agency or general laws relating to the expenditure or disbursement of public funds. The Chief Financial Officer may, after consultation with the legislative appropriations committees, advance funds beyond a 3-month requirement if it is determined to be consistent with the intent of the approved operating budget. (17) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter or chapter 339, a change to the approved operating budget may not initiate or commence a fixed capital outlay project.

(2) To be eligible to retain funds, an agency or the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court must submit a plan and an associated request to amend its approved operating budget to the Legislative Budget Commission specifying: (a) The modifications to approved programs resulting in efficiencies and cost savings; (b) The amount and source of the funds and positions saved; (c) The specific positions, rate, amounts, and sources of funds the agency or the judicial branch wishes to include in its incentive expenditures; (d) How the agency or the judicial branch will meet the goals and objectives established in its long-range program plan; (e) How the agency or the judicial branch will meet performance standards, including those in its long-range program plan; and (f) Any other incentive expenditures which the agency or the judicial branch believes will enhance its performance. (3) Notwithstanding the 14-day notice requirement contained in s. 216.177(2)(a), all plans and budget amendments submitted to the Legislative Budget Commission pursuant to this section shall be delivered at least 30 days prior to the date of the commission meeting at which the request will be considered. (4) In determining the amount the agency or the judicial branch will be allowed to retain, the commission shall consider the actual savings projected for the current budget year and the annualized savings. (5) The amount to be retained by the agency or the judicial branch shall be no less than 5 percent and no more than 25 percent of the annual savings and may be used by the agency or the judicial branch for salary increases or other expenditures specified in the agency’s or the judicial branch’s plan if the salary increases or other expenditures do not create a recurring cost to the state in excess of the recurring savings achieved by the agency or the judicial branch in the plan.

All actions of the Executive Office of the Governor shall be reported to the legislative appropriations committees, and the committees may advise the Executive Office of the Governor relative to the release of such funds. (b) The release of appropriated funds classified as “emergency” shall be approved only if an act or circumstance caused by an act of God, civil disturbance, natural disaster, or other circumstance of an emergency nature threatens, endangers, or damages the property, safety, health, or welfare of the state or its residents, which condition has not been provided for in appropriation acts of the Legislature. Funds allocated for this purpose may be used to pay overtime pay to personnel of agencies called upon to perform extra duty because of any civil disturbance or other emergency as defined in s. 252.34 and to provide the required state match for federal grants under the federal Disaster Relief Act. (2) The release of appropriated funds classified as “deficiency” shall be approved only when a General Revenue Fund appropriation for operations of a state agency or of the judicial branch is inadequate because the workload or cost of the operation exceeds that anticipated by the Legislature and a determination has been made by the Governor that the deficiency will result in an impairment of the activities of an agency or of the judicial branch to the extent that the agency is unable to carry out its program as provided by the Legislature in the general appropriations acts. These funds may not be used for creation of any new agency or program, for increases of salary, or for the construction or equipping of additional buildings. (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, moneys appropriated in any appropriations act to the Governor for discretionary contingencies may be expended at his or her discretion to promote general government and intergovernmental cooperation and to enhance the image of the state. All funds expended for such purposes shall be accounted for, and a report showing the amounts expended, the names of the persons receiving the amounts expended, and the purpose of each expenditure shall be annually reported to the Auditor General and the legislative appropriations committees.

      "text": "216.262 Authorized positions.— (1)(a) Unless otherwise expressly provided by law, the total number of authorized positions may not exceed the total provided in the appropriations acts. In the event any state agency or entity of the judicial branch finds that the number of positions so provided is not sufficient to administer its authorized programs, it may file an application with the Executive Office of the Governor or the Chief Justice; and, if the Executive Office of the Governor or Chief Justice certifies that there are no authorized positions available for addition, deletion, or transfer within the agency as provided in paragraph (c) and recommends an increase in the number of positions, the Governor or the Chief Justice may recommend an increase in the number of positions for the following reasons only: 1. To implement or provide for continuing federal grants or changes in grants not previously anticipated. 2. To meet emergencies pursuant to s. 252.36. 3. To satisfy new federal regulations or changes therein. 4. To take advantage of opportunities to reduce operating expenditures or to increase the revenues of the state or local government. 5. To authorize positions that were not fixed by the Legislature through error in drafting the appropriations acts. Actions recommended pursuant to this paragraph are subject to approval by the Legislative Budget Commission. The certification and the final authorization shall be provided to the Legislative Budget Commission, the appropriations committees, and the Auditor General. (b) The Governor and the Chief Justice may, after a public hearing, delete supervisory or managerial positions within a department and establish direct service delivery positions in excess of the number of supervisory or managerial positions deleted. The salary rate for all positions authorized under this paragraph may not exceed the salary rate for all positions deleted under this paragraph. Positions affected by changes made under this paragraph may be funded only from identical funding sources. (c)1. The Executive Office of the Governor, under such procedures and qualifications as it deems appropriate, shall, upon agency request, delegate to any state agency authority to add and delete authorized positions or transfer authorized positions from one budget entity to another budget entity within the same division, and may approve additions and deletions of authorized positions or transfers of authorized positions within the state agency when such changes would enable the agency to administer more effectively its authorized and approved programs. The additions or deletions must be consistent with the intent of the approved operating budget, must be consistent with legislative policy and intent, and must not conflict with specific spending policies specified in the General Appropriations Act. 2. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall have the authority to establish procedures for the judicial branch to add and delete authorized positions or transfer authorized positions from one budget entity to another budget entity, and to add and delete authorized positions within the same budget entity, when such changes are consistent with legislative policy and intent and do not conflict with spending policies specified in the General Appropriations Act. (d) An individual employed by a state agency or by the judicial branch may not hold more than one employment during his or her normal working hours with the state, such working hours to be determined by the head of the state agency affected, unless approved by the Department of Management Services, or otherwise delegated to the agency head, or by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, respectively. (e) An individual employed by a state agency or by the judicial branch may not fill more than a total of one full-time equivalent established position, receive compensation simultaneously from any appropriation other than appropriations for salaries, or receive compensation simultaneously from more than one state agency unless approved by the Department of Management Services, or otherwise delegated to the agency head, or by the Chief Justice, respectively, during each fiscal year. The Department of Management Services may adopt uniform rules applicable to the executive branch agencies to implement its responsibilities under this paragraph. (f) Perquisites may not be furnished by a state agency or by the judicial branch unless approved by the Department of Management Services, or otherwise delegated to the agency head, or by the Chief Justice, respectively, during each fiscal year. Whenever a state agency or the judicial branch is to furnish perquisites, the Department of Management Services or the agency head to which the approval has been delegated or the Chief Justice, respectively, must approve the kind and monetary value of such perquisites before they may be furnished. Perquisites may be furnished only when in the best interest of the state due to the exceptional or unique requirements of the position. The value of a perquisite may not be used to compute an employee’s base rate of pay or regular rate of pay unless required by the Fair Labor Standards Act. Permissible perquisites include, but are not limited to, moving expenses, clothing, use of vehicles and other transportation, domestic services, groundskeeping services, telephone services, medical services, housing, utilities, and meals. The Department of Management Services may adopt uniform rules applicable to the executive branch agencies to implement its responsibilities under this paragraph, which rules may specify additional perquisites, establish additional criteria for each kind of perquisite, provide the procedure to be used by executive agencies in applying for approvals, and establish the required justification. As used in this section, the term “perquisites” means those things, or the use thereof, or services of a kind that confer on the officers or employees receiving them some benefit that is in the nature of additional compensation, or that reduce to some extent the normal personal expenses of the officer or employee receiving them. The term includes, but is not limited to, such things as quarters, subsistence, utilities, laundry services, medical service, use of state-owned vehicles for other than state purposes, and servants paid by the state. (g) If goods and services are to be sold to officers and employees of a state agency or of the judicial branch rather than being furnished as perquisites, the kind and selling price thereof shall be approved by the Department of Management Services, unless otherwise delegated to the agency head, or by the Chief Justice, respectively, during each fiscal year before such sales are made. The selling price may be deducted from any amounts due by the state to any person receiving such things. The amount of cash so deducted shall be faithfully accounted for. This paragraph does not apply to sales to officers or employees of items generally sold to the public and does not apply to meals which may be provided without charge to volunteers under a volunteer service program approved by the Department of Management Services. The goods and services may include, but are not limited to, medical services, long-term and short-term rental housing, and laundry and transportation services. The Department of Management Services may adopt uniform rules applicable to the executive branch agencies to implement its responsibilities under this paragraph, which rules may specify other items that may be approved, the required justification for proposed sales, and the manner in which agencies will apply for approvals. (2) The provisions of paragraphs (1)(d) and (e) do not apply to an individual filling a position the salary of which has been specifically fixed or limited by law. Unless specifically authorized by law, an individual filling or performing the duties of a position the salary of which has been specifically fixed or limited by law may not receive compensation from more than one appropriation, or in excess of the amount so fixed or limited by law, regardless of any additional duties performed by that individual in any capacity or position. However, this subsection does not prohibit additional compensation from an educational appropriation to any person holding a position the salary of which is specifically fixed or limited by law, provided such compensation does not exceed payment for more than one course of instruction during any one academic term and that such compensation is approved as provided in paragraphs (1)(d) and (e). Any compensation received by any person pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall not be computed as a part of average final compensation for retirement purposes under the provisions of chapter 121. (3) No full-time position shall be filled by more than the equivalent of one full-time officer or employee, except when extenuating circumstances exist. Extenuating circumstances will be provided for in rules to be adopted by the Department of Management Services or by the Chief Justice, respectively. 1 (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter relating to increasing the number of authorized positions, and for the 2025-2026 fiscal year only, if the actual inmate population of the Department of Corrections exceeds the inmate population projections of the February 21, 2025, Criminal Justice Estimating Conference by 1 percent for 2 consecutive months or 2 percent for any month, the Executive Office of the Governor, with the approval of the Legislative Budget Commission, shall immediately notify the Criminal Justice Estimating Conference, which shall convene as soon as possible to revise the estimates. The Department of Corrections may then submit a budget amendment requesting the establishment of positions in excess of the number authorized by the Legislature and additional appropriations from unallocated general revenue sufficient to provide for essential staff, fixed capital improvements, and other resources to provide classification, security, food services, health services, and other variable expenses within the institutions to accommodate the estimated increase in the inmate population. All actions taken pursuant to this subsection are subject to review and approval by the Legislative Budget Commission. This subsection expires July 1, 2026.
