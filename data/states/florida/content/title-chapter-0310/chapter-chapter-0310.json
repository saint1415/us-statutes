To that end, it is the legislative intent to regulate pilots, piloting, and pilotage to the full extent of any congressional grant of authority, except as limited in this chapter.",

      "text": "310.0015 Piloting regulation; general provisions.— (1) Piloting is an essential service of such paramount importance that its continued existence must be secured by the state and may not be left open to market forces. (2) Because safety is the primary objective in the regulation of piloting by the state and because of the significant economies of scale in delivering the service, the requirement of a large capital investment in order to provide required service, and the fact that pilots are supplying services that are considered to be essential to the economy and the public welfare, it is determined that economic regulation, rather than competition in the marketplace, will better serve to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. (3) The rate-setting process, the issuance of licenses only in numbers deemed necessary or prudent by the board, and other aspects of the economic regulation of piloting established in this chapter are intended to protect the public from the adverse effects of unrestricted competition which would result from an unlimited number of licensed pilots being allowed to market their services on the basis of lower prices rather than safety concerns. This system of regulation benefits and protects the public interest by maximizing safety, avoiding uneconomic duplication of capital expenses and facilities, and enhancing state regulatory oversight. The system seeks to provide pilots with reasonable revenues, taking into consideration the normal uncertainties of vessel traffic and port usage, sufficient to maintain reliable, stable piloting operations. Pilots have certain restrictions and obligations under this system, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) Pilots may not refuse to provide piloting services to any person or entity that may lawfully request such services, except for justifiable concerns relating to safety, or, in the case of a vessel planning a departure, for nonpayment of pilotage. (b) Pilots may not unilaterally determine the pilotage rates they charge. Such pilotage rates shall instead be determined by the Pilotage Rate Review Committee, in the public interest, as set forth in s. 310.151. (c) Pilots shall maintain or secure adequate pilot boats, office facilities and equipment, dispatch systems, communication equipment and other facilities, and equipment and support services necessary for a modern, dependable piloting operation. (d) The pilot or pilots in a port shall train and compensate all member deputy pilots in that port. Failure to train or compensate such deputy pilots constitutes a ground for disciplinary action under s. 310.101. Nothing in this subsection may be deemed to create an agency or employment relationship between a pilot or deputy pilot and the pilot or pilots in a port. (e) In any instance of a payment or transfer of funds, a request for the payment or transfer of funds, or a contractual obligation assumed in respect to the payment or transfer of funds from a licensee payor to a pilot or group of pilots, or to any legal entity or fund administered or controlled by or under common control with such pilot or group of pilots, the pilot or group of pilots shall provide to the licensee payor, at the time the payment or transfer or request for the payment or transfer is made or the obligation is assumed in respect to the payment or transfer, a detailed accounting of the specific assets, tangible or intangible, in which an interest is being directly or indirectly purchased or for which the licensee payor is being granted an interest in return for such payment or transfer of funds or such contractual obligation. This paragraph does not apply to either payments or transfers of funds if their aggregate amounts are less than $1,000. As used in this paragraph, “licensee payor” means any current or prospective state pilot or deputy pilot.

At least 2 years of service at sea during the 5-year period immediately preceding the examination, 1 year of which must have been in at least the capacity of an unlimited second mate; 2. At least 2 years of service during the 5-year period immediately preceding the examination in a deepwater United States port as an active first-class unlimited pilot serving on at least an unlimited second mate’s license or a license as master of freight and towing vessel of at least 1,600 gross registered tons upon oceans, and acting under authority of a duly constituted governmental regulatory entity; 3. At least 2 years of service during the 5-year period immediately preceding the examination as an active first-class unlimited pilot serving on a Great Lakes unlimited master’s license; 4. At least 2 years of towing experience during the 5-year period immediately preceding the examination, 1 year of which must have been in the capacity of master of a tugboat/barge combination of at least 5,000 gross registered tons, combined tonnage, while holding a license as master of freight and towing vessel of at least 1,600 gross registered tons upon oceans; or 5. At least 3 years of experience as a deck watch officer during the 10-year period immediately preceding the examination, 1 year of which in the 5-year period immediately preceding the exam must have been as the commanding officer, executive officer, or operations officer of a United States Navy vessel or a United States Coast Guard vessel of at least 1,600 gross tons, and must currently hold a United States Coast Guard license of at least an unlimited second mate. (e) Submit full documentation of sea time through discharges, continuous discharge books, or other official documents. (f) Submit proof of sufficient maritime background and experience, except for required trips, to enable the applicant, if not already so licensed, to be eligible to obtain a valid United States Coast Guard first-class unlimited pilot’s license covering all of the waters of the port in which service as a deputy pilot is intended within 90 days of the appointment as a deputy pilot. (2) The board may adopt rules authorizing equivalent combinations of service from two or more of the areas specified in subparagraphs (1)(d)1., 2., 3., 4., and 5. However, the board may waive the maritime experience requirements prescribed in paragraph (1)(d) when necessary to fill an opening, provided an applicant meeting such requirements has not applied for the opening and the opening has been advertised more than once.

During this period, the board shall thoroughly evaluate the deputy pilot’s performance for suitability to continue training and shall make appropriate recommendations to the department. Upon receipt of a favorable recommendation by the board, the department shall issue a certificate to the deputy pilot, which shall be valid for a period of 2 years. The certificate may be renewed only two times, except in the case of a fully licensed pilot who is cross-licensed as a deputy pilot in another port, and provided the deputy pilot meets the requirements specified for pilots in paragraph (1)(c). (4) Notwithstanding s. 112.011 or any other provision of law relating to the restoration of civil rights, an applicant shall be disqualified from applying for and shall be denied a deputy pilot certificate if the applicant, regardless of adjudication, has ever been found guilty of, or pled guilty or nolo contendere to, a charge which was: (a) A felony or first degree misdemeanor which directly related to the navigation or operation of a vessel; or (b) A felony involving the sale of or trafficking in, or conspiracy to sell or traffic in, a controlled substance as defined by chapter 893, or an offense under the laws of any state or country which, if committed in this state, would constitute the felony of selling or trafficking in, or conspiracy to sell or traffic in, such controlled substance.

The following requirements constitute the parameters within which deputy pilot training programs are to be established and carried out by the licensed state pilots at all ports in this state: (1) Upon receiving his or her appointment, a deputy pilot must report to the licensed state pilots at the port he or she is appointed to serve and must serve a period of not less than 90 days as an observer trainee. During such period: (a) The observer trainee must accompany licensed state pilots, becoming thoroughly familiar with all of the waters, the channels, the harbor, and the port under varied conditions. (b) The observer trainee must obtain a valid United States Coast Guard first-class unlimited pilot’s license covering all of the waters of the port before the board may authorize him or her to pilot vessels within the limits and specifications established by the licensed state pilots of the port. (2) Upon completion of the observer-trainee period, the deputy pilot must submit to the board a deputy pilot vessel handling form for each vessel upon which he or she has accompanied a licensed state pilot. Each such form must be signed by the pilot in charge who accompanied the deputy pilot and must accurately recite: (a) The vessel’s registry, length, gross tonnage, and draft; (b) The name of the berth from which or to which the vessel was piloted; (c) The weather and sea conditions encountered; (d) The time of day; (e) Any marine incidents required to be reported under s. 310.111; and (f) The comments of the pilot in charge, including whether, under his or her supervision, the pilot in charge turned the navigation of the vessel over to the deputy pilot. (3) Each request to increase the limits and specifications under which a deputy pilot is authorized to pilot must be submitted to the board and must be accompanied by a deputy pilot vessel handling form as provided in subsection (2) for each vessel the deputy pilot has piloted since his or her limits and specifications were last increased by the board. (4) For successful completion of the deputy pilot training program, a deputy pilot must have gradually been increased in his or her authorized limits and specifications until the deputy pilot has been authorized by the board to pilot vessels with a maximum draft of not more than 3 feet less than the normal maximum draft allowable in the port in which the deputy pilot is authorized to pilot, as proposed by the licensed state pilots in that port and approved by the board.

      "text": "310.101 Grounds for disciplinary action by the board.— (1) Any act of misconduct, inattention to duty, negligence, or incompetence; any willful violation of any law or rule, including the rules of the road, applicable to a licensed state pilot or certificated deputy pilot; or any failure to exercise that care which a reasonable and prudent licensed state pilot or certificated deputy pilot would exercise under the same or similar circumstances may result in disciplinary action. Examples of acts by a licensed state pilot or certificated deputy pilot which constitute grounds for disciplinary action include, but are not limited to: (a) Failure to make allowances for the foreseeable effects of wind, current, and tide. (b) Failure to obtain or properly use information available to the pilot. (c) Failure to navigate with caution in restricted visibility. (d) Navigating in channels where the depth of water under the keel is less than the prescribed bottom clearance as recommended by the licensed state pilots of that port and approved by the board. (e) Excessive speed. (f) Having a license or certificate to practice piloting revoked, suspended, restricted, placed on probation, or in any way acted against, including, but not limited to, the relinquishing or depositing of the license or certificate in lieu of further disciplinary action, in anticipation of the filing of charges, or in lieu of prosecution, by the regulatory authority of another state, the Federal Government, a territory, or another country for an act which would constitute a ground for discipline if the act had occurred while piloting under authority of the Florida state pilot’s license or deputy pilot’s certificate. (g) Making or filing, or inducing another person to make or file, a report which the pilot knows to be false or intentionally or negligently failing to file, or willfully impeding or obstructing the filing of, a report or record required by state law or by rule of the board or the department. Such reports or records include only those which are signed by the pilot in his or her capacity as a licensed state pilot or certificated deputy pilot. (h) Being unable to perform the duties of a pilot with reasonable skill and safety by reason of illness or use of alcohol, drugs, narcotics, chemicals, or any other type of material or as a result of any mental or physical condition such as, but not limited to, poor eyesight or hearing, heart disease, or diabetes. In enforcing this paragraph, the department shall have authority, upon recommendation of the probable cause panel of the board, to compel a licensed state pilot or certificated deputy pilot to submit to a mental or physical examination by physicians designated by the department. The failure of a pilot to submit to such an examination when so directed constitutes an admission of the allegations against the pilot, unless the failure is due to circumstances beyond his or her control, consequent upon which an emergency suspension order may be entered by the department suspending the pilot’s license until he or she complies with the order for a compulsory mental or physical examination. A licensed state pilot or certificated deputy pilot affected under this paragraph must be afforded, at reasonable intervals, an opportunity to demonstrate that he or she can resume the competent practice of piloting with reasonable skill and safety. (i) Practicing or offering to practice beyond the scope permitted by law or accepting and performing professional responsibilities that the pilot knows or has reason to know he or she is not competent to perform. (j) Delegating professional responsibilities to a person when the pilot delegating such responsibilities knows or has reason to know that such person is not qualified by training, experience, or license to perform them. (k) Engaging in any practice which does not meet acceptable standards of safe piloting. (l) Failure to maintain a valid United States Coast Guard first-class unlimited pilot’s license covering the waters of the port in which the state pilot’s license was issued. (m) Having a license to operate a motor vehicle revoked, suspended, or otherwise acted against by any jurisdiction, including its agencies or subdivisions, for operating the vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The jurisdiction’s acceptance of a relinquishment of license, stipulation, consent order, plea of nolo contendere, penalty in any form, or other settlement offered in response to or in anticipation of the filing of charges related to the license to operate a motor vehicle shall be construed as action against the license. (n) Being unable to perform piloting with reasonable skill and safety by reason of illness or use of alcohol, drugs, narcotics, or chemicals. (2) When the board finds any person has committed any act set forth in subsection (1), it may enter an order imposing one or more of the following penalties: (a) Refusing to certify to the department an application for license or certification. (b) Revoking or suspending the license or certificate. (c) Restricting the practice of the violator. (d) Imposing an administrative fine not to exceed $5,000 for each count or separate offense. (e) Issuing a reprimand. (f) Placing the licensed state pilot or certificated deputy pilot on probation for such period of time and subject to such conditions as the board may specify, including, but not limited to, requiring the pilot to submit to treatment, submit to additional or remedial training, submit to reexamination, or undergo a complete physical examination. (3) The board shall not reinstate the license or certificate of a state pilot or deputy pilot or cause a license or certificate to be issued to a person whom it has determined to be unqualified until the board is satisfied that such person has complied with all the terms and conditions set forth in the final order and that such person is capable of safely engaging in the practice of piloting. (4) In any foreign vessel or foreign trading vessel movement that an individual holding a state pilot license or deputy pilot certificate is engaged in directing, whether movement of the vessel in or out of the port or movement in close proximity to a dock or any other movement undertaken in furtherance of his or her piloting duties, such individual is operating under the authority of his or her state license or certificate and is accountable to the board for his or her actions.

      "text": "310.102 Treatment programs for impaired pilots and deputy pilots.— (1) The department shall designate approved treatment programs for impaired pilots and deputy pilots under this section. The department may set forth appropriate criteria for approval of treatment providers. (2) The department shall retain one or more impaired practitioner consultants as recommended by the committee. A consultant shall be a licensee under the jurisdiction of the Division of Medical Quality Assurance within the Department of Health, and at least one consultant must be a practitioner licensed under chapter 458, chapter 459, or part I of chapter 464. The consultant shall assist the probable cause panel and department in carrying out the responsibilities of this section. This shall include working with department investigators to determine whether a pilot or deputy pilot is, in fact, impaired. (3)(a) Whenever the department receives a written or oral legally sufficient complaint alleging that a pilot or deputy pilot licensed or certificated by the department is impaired as a result of the misuse or abuse of alcohol or drugs, or both, or due to a mental or physical condition which could affect the pilot’s or deputy pilot’s ability to practice with skill and safety, and no complaint against the pilot or deputy pilot other than impairment exists, the reporting of such information shall not constitute a complaint within the meaning of s. 455.225 if the probable cause panel finds: 1. The pilot or deputy pilot has acknowledged the impairment problem. 2. The pilot or deputy pilot has voluntarily enrolled in an appropriate, approved treatment program. 3. The pilot or deputy pilot has voluntarily withdrawn from piloting or limited the scope of piloting as determined by the panel, in each case, until such time as the panel is satisfied the pilot or deputy pilot has successfully completed an approved treatment program. 4. The pilot or deputy pilot has executed releases for medical records, authorizing the release of all records of evaluations, diagnoses, and treatment of the pilot or deputy pilot, including records of treatment for emotional or mental conditions, to the consultant. The consultant shall make no copies or reports of records that do not regard the issue of the pilot’s or deputy pilot’s impairment and his or her participation in a treatment program. (b) If, however, the pilot or deputy pilot agrees to withdraw from piloting until such time as the consultant determines the pilot or deputy pilot has satisfactorily completed an approved treatment program or evaluation, the probable cause panel shall not become involved in the pilot’s or deputy pilot’s case. (c) Inquiries related to impairment treatment programs designed to provide information to the pilot or deputy pilot and others and which do not indicate that the pilot or deputy pilot presents a danger to the public shall not constitute a complaint within the meaning of s. 455.225 and shall be exempt from the provisions of this subsection. (d) Whenever the department receives a legally sufficient complaint alleging that a pilot or deputy pilot is impaired as described in paragraph (a) and no complaint against the pilot or deputy pilot other than impairment exists, the department shall forward all information in its possession regarding the impaired pilot or deputy pilot to the consultant. (e) The probable cause panel shall work directly with the consultant, and all information concerning a licensee obtained by the panel from the consultant shall remain confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution, subject to the provisions of subsections (5) and (6). (f) A finding of probable cause shall not be made as long as the panel is satisfied, based upon information it receives from the consultant and the department, that the pilot or deputy pilot is progressing satisfactorily in an approved treatment program. (4) In any disciplinary action for a violation other than impairment, if a pilot or deputy pilot establishes that the violation for which the pilot or deputy pilot is being prosecuted was due to or connected with impairment and further establishes that the pilot or deputy pilot is satisfactorily progressing through or has successfully completed an approved treatment program pursuant to this section, such information may be considered by the board as a mitigating factor in determining the appropriate penalty. This subsection does not limit mitigating factors the board may consider. (5)(a) An approved treatment provider shall, upon request, disclose to the consultant all information in its possession regarding the issue of a licensee’s impairment and participation in the treatment program. All information obtained by the consultant and department pursuant to this section is confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution, subject to the provisions of this subsection and subsection (6). Failure to provide such information to the consultant is grounds for withdrawal of approval of such program or provider. (b) If in the opinion of the consultant, after consultation with the treatment provider, an impaired licensee has not progressed satisfactorily in a treatment program, all information regarding the issue of a licensee’s impairment and participation in a treatment program in the consultant’s possession shall be disclosed to the department. Such disclosure shall constitute a complaint pursuant to the general provisions of s. 455.225. Whenever the consultant concludes that impairment affects a licensee’s practice and constitutes an immediate, serious danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, that conclusion shall be communicated to the secretary of the department. (6) A consultant, licensee, or approved treatment provider who makes a disclosure pursuant to this section is not subject to civil liability for such disclosure or its consequences. The provisions of s. 766.101 apply to any officer, employee, or agent of the department or the board and to any officer, employee, or agent of any entity with which the department has contracted pursuant to this section.

      "text": "310.151 Rates of pilotage; Pilotage Rate Review Committee.— (1)(a) As used in this section, the term: 1. “Committee” means the Pilotage Rate Review Committee established under this section as part of the Board of Pilot Commissioners. 2. “Board” means the Board of Pilot Commissioners. (b) To carry out the provisions of this section, the Pilotage Rate Review Committee is established as part of the Board of Pilot Commissioners within the Department of Business and Professional Regulation. The committee shall consist of the following seven members of the board: two board members who are licensed state pilots actively practicing their profession, who shall be appointed by majority vote of the licensed state pilots serving on the board; two board members who are actively involved in a professional or business capacity in the maritime industry, marine shipping industry, or commercial passenger cruise industry; one board member who is a certified public accountant with at least 5 years of experience in financial management; and two board members who are citizens of the state. (c) Committee members shall comply with the disclosure requirements of s. 112.3143(4) if participating in any matter that would result in special private gain or loss as described in that subsection. (d) The committee has authority to adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 to implement provisions of this section conferring duties upon it. The department shall provide the staff required by the committee to carry out its duties under this section. (e) All funds received pursuant to this section shall be placed in the account of the Board of Pilot Commissioners, and the Board of Pilot Commissioners shall pay for all expenses incurred pursuant to this section. (2) Any pilot, group of pilots, or other person or group of persons whose substantial interests are directly affected by the rates established by the committee may apply to the committee for a change in rates. However, an application for a change in rates shall not be considered for any port for which rates have been changed by this committee in the 18 months preceding the filing of the application. All applications for changes in rates shall be made to the committee, in writing, pursuant to rules prescribed by the committee. In the case of an application for a rate change on behalf of a pilot or group of pilots, the application shall be accompanied by a consolidated financial statement, statement of profit or loss, and balance sheet prepared by a certified public accountant of the pilot or group of pilots and all relevant information, fiscal and otherwise, on the piloting activities within the affected port area, including financial information on all entities owned or partially owned by the pilot or group of pilots which provide pilot-related services in the affected port area. In the case of an application for a rate change filed on behalf of persons other than a pilot or group of pilots, information regarding the financial state of interested parties other than pilots shall be required only to the extent that such financial information is made relevant by the application or subsequent argument before the committee. The committee shall have the authority to set, by rule, a rate review application fee of up to $1,000, which must be submitted to the committee upon the filing of the application for a rate change. (3) The committee shall investigate and determine whether the requested rate change will result in fair, just, and reasonable rates of pilotage pursuant to rules prescribed by the committee. In addition to publication as required by law, notice of a hearing to determine rates shall be mailed to each person who has formally requested notice of any rate change in the affected port area. The notice shall advise all interested parties that they may file an answer, an additional or alternative petition, or any other applicable pleading or response, within 30 days after the date of publication of the notice, and the notice shall specify the last date by which any such pleading must be filed. The committee may, for good cause, extend the period for responses to a petition. Multiple petitions filed in this manner do not warrant separate hearings, and these petitions shall be consolidated to the extent that it shall not be necessary to hold a separate hearing on each petition. The committee shall conclude its investigation, conduct a public hearing, and determine whether to modify the existing rates of pilotage in that port within 60 days after the filing of the completed application, except that the committee may not be required to complete a hearing for more than one port within any 60-day period. Hearings shall be held in the affected port area, unless a different location is agreed upon by all parties to the proceeding. (4)(a) The applicant shall be given written notice, either in person or by certified mail, that the committee intends to modify the pilotage rates in that port and that the applicant may, within 21 days after receipt of the notice, request a hearing pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. Notice of the intent to modify the pilotage rates in that port shall also be published in the Florida Administrative Register and in a newspaper of general circulation in the affected port area and shall be mailed to any person who has formally requested notice of any rate change in the affected port area. Within 21 days after receipt or publication of notice, any person whose substantial interests will be affected by the intended committee action may request a hearing pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. If the committee concludes that the petitioner has raised a disputed issue of material fact, the committee shall designate a hearing, which shall be conducted by formal proceeding before an administrative law judge assigned by the Division of Administrative Hearings pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57(1), unless waived by all parties. If the committee concludes that the petitioner has not raised a disputed issue of material fact and does not designate the petition for hearing, that decision shall be considered final agency action for purposes of s. 120.68. The failure to request a hearing within 21 days after receipt or publication of notice shall constitute a waiver of any right to an administrative hearing and shall cause the order modifying the pilotage rates in that port to be entered. If an administrative hearing is requested pursuant to this subsection, notice of the time, date, and location of the hearing shall be published in the Florida Administrative Register and in a newspaper of general circulation in the affected port area and shall be mailed to the applicant and to any person who has formally requested notice of any rate change for the affected port area. (b) In any administrative proceeding pursuant to this section, the committee’s proposed rate determination shall be immediately effective and shall not be stayed during the administrative proceeding, provided that, pending rendition of the committee’s final order, the pilot or pilots in the subject port deposit in an interest-bearing account all amounts received which represent the difference between the previous rates and the proposed rates. The pilot or pilots in the subject port shall keep an accurate accounting of all amounts deposited, specifying by whom or on whose behalf such amounts were paid, and shall produce such an accounting upon request of the committee. Upon rendition of the committee’s final order: 1. Any amounts deposited in the interest-bearing account which are sustained by the final order shall be paid over to the pilot or pilots in the subject port, including all interest accrued on such funds; and 2. Any amounts deposited which exceed the rates sustained in the committee’s final order shall be refunded, with the accrued interest, to those customers from whom the funds were collected. Any funds that are not refunded after diligent effort of the pilot or pilots to do so shall be disbursed by the pilot or pilots as the committee shall direct. (5)(a) In determining whether the requested rate change will result in fair, just, and reasonable rates, the committee shall give primary consideration to the public interest in promoting and maintaining efficient, reliable, and safe piloting services. (b) The committee shall also give consideration to the following factors: 1. The public interest in having qualified pilots available to respond promptly to vessels needing their service. 2. A determination of the average net income of pilots in the port, including the value of all benefits derived from service as a pilot. For the purposes of this subparagraph, “net income of pilots” refers to total pilotage fees collected in the port, minus reasonable operating expenses, divided by the number of licensed and active state pilots within the ports. 3. Reasonable operating expenses of pilots. 4. Pilotage rates in other ports. 5. The amount of time each pilot spends on actual piloting duty and the amount of time spent on other essential support services. 6. The prevailing compensation available to individuals in other maritime services of comparable professional skill and standing as that sought in pilots, it being recognized that in order to attract to the profession of piloting, and to hold the best and most qualified individuals as pilots, the overall compensation accorded pilots should be equal to or greater than that available to such individuals in comparable maritime employment. 7. The impact rate change may have in individual pilot compensation and whether such change will lead to a shortage of licensed state pilots, certificated deputy pilots, or qualified pilot applicants. 8. Projected changes in vessel traffic. 9. Cost of retirement and medical plans. 10. Physical risks inherent in piloting. 11. Special characteristics, dangers, and risks of the particular port. 12. Any other factors the committee deems relevant in determining a just and reasonable rate. (c) The committee may take into consideration the consumer price index or any other comparable economic indicator when fixing rates of pilotage; however, because the consumer price index or such other comparable economic indicator is primarily related to net income rather than rates, the committee shall not use it as the sole factor in fixing rates of pilotage. (6) The committee shall fix rates of pilotage pursuant to this section based upon the following vessel characteristics: (a) Length. (b) Beam. (c) Net tonnage, gross tonnage, or dead weight tonnage. (d) Freeboard or height above the waterline. (e) Draft or molded depth. (f) Any combination of the vessel characteristics listed in this subsection or any other relevant vessel characteristic or characteristics. (7) The decisions of the committee regarding rates are not appealable to the board.
