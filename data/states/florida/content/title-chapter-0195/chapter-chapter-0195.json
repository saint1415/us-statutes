It shall also have supervision over tax collection and all other aspects of the administration of such taxes. The supervision of the department shall consist primarily of aiding and assisting county officers in the assessing and collection functions, with particular emphasis on the more technical aspects. In this regard, the department shall conduct schools to upgrade assessment skills of both state and local assessment personnel. (2) In furtherance of its duty to conduct schools to upgrade assessment skills and collection skills, the department may establish by rule committees on admissions and certification. The department may also incur reasonable expenses for hiring instructors, travel, office operations, certificates of completion, badges or awards, food service incidental to conducting such schools, salaries and benefits of department employees whose duties are directly associated with developing and conducting such schools, and administering any certification program under s. 145.10, s. 145.11, or s. 194.035. The department may charge a tuition fee and an examination fee to any person who attends such a school and may charge a fee to certify or recertify any person under such a program. The department shall deposit such fees into the Certification Program Trust Fund which is created in the State Treasury. There shall be separate school accounts and program accounts in the trust fund for property appraisers, tax collectors, and special magistrates. The department shall use money in the fund to pay such expenses. History.—s. 35, ch. 70-243; s. 7, ch. 74-234; s. 5, ch. 86-300; s. 25, ch. 90-203; s. 1, ch. 2008-138; s. 8, ch. 2008-197.

The department shall prescribe a form for each purpose. The county officer shall reproduce forms for distribution at the expense of his or her office. A county officer may use a form other than the form prescribed by the department upon obtaining written permission from the executive director of the department; however, a county officer may not use a form if the substantive content of the form varies from the form prescribed by the department for the same or a similar purpose. If the executive director finds good cause to grant such permission he or she may do so. The county officer may continue to use the approved form until the law that specifies the form is amended or repealed or until the officer receives written disapproval from the executive director. Otherwise, all such officers and their employees shall use the forms, and follow the instructions applicable to the forms, which are prescribed by the department. Upon request of any property appraiser or, in any event, at least once every 3 years, the department shall prescribe and furnish such aerial photographs and nonproperty ownership maps to the property appraisers as necessary to ensure that all real property within the state is properly listed on the roll. All photographs and maps furnished to counties with a population of 25,000 or fewer shall be paid for by the department as provided by law. For counties with a population greater than 25,000, the department shall furnish such items at the property appraiser’s expense. The department may incur reasonable expenses for procuring aerial photographs and nonproperty ownership maps and may charge a fee to the respective property appraiser equal to the cost incurred. The department shall deposit such fees into the Certification Program Trust Fund created pursuant to s. 195.002. There shall be a separate account in the trust fund for the aid and assistance activity of providing aerial photographs and nonproperty ownership maps to property appraisers. The department shall use money in the fund to pay such expenses. All forms and maps and instructions relating to their use must be substantially uniform throughout the state. An officer may employ supplemental forms and maps, at the expense of his or her office, which he or she deems expedient for the purpose of administering and collecting ad valorem taxes. The forms required in ss. 193.461(3)(a) and 196.011(1) for renewal purposes must require sufficient information for the property appraiser to evaluate the changes in use since the prior year. If the property appraiser determines, in the case of a taxpayer, that he or she has insufficient current information upon which to approve the exemption, or if the information on the renewal form is inadequate for him or her to evaluate the taxable status of the property, he or she may require the resubmission of an original application.

It is hereby declared to be the legislative intent that the department shall formulate such rules and regulations that property will be assessed, taxes will be collected, and the administration will be uniform, just, and otherwise in compliance with the requirements of the general law and the constitution. (2) It is the legislative intent that all counties operate on computer programs that are substantially similar and produce data which are directly comparable. The rules and regulations shall prescribe uniform standards and procedures for computer programs and operations for all programs installed in any property appraiser’s office. It is the legislative intent that the department shall require a high degree of uniformity so that data will be comparable among counties and that a single audit procedure will be practical for all property appraisers’ offices. (3) The rules and regulations shall provide procedures whereby the property appraiser, the Department of Revenue, and the Auditor General shall be able to obtain access, where necessary, to financial records relating to nonhomestead property which records are required to make a determination of the proper assessment as to the particular property in question. Access to a taxpayer’s records shall be provided only in those instances in which it is determined that such records are necessary to determine either the classification or the value of the taxable nonhomestead property. Access shall be provided only to those records which pertain to the property physically located in the taxing county as of January 1 of each year and to the income from such property generated in the taxing county for the year in which a proper assessment is made. All records produced by the taxpayer under this subsection shall be deemed to be confidential in the hands of the property appraiser, the department, the tax collector, and the Auditor General and shall not be divulged to any person, firm, or corporation, except upon court order or order of an administrative body having quasi-judicial powers in ad valorem tax matters, and such records are exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1). (4)(a) The rules and regulations prescribed by the department shall require a return of tangible personal property which shall include: 1. A general identification and description of the property or, when more than one item constitutes a class of similar items, a description of the class. 2. The location of such property. 3. The original cost of such property and, in the case of a class of similar items, the average cost. 4. The age of such property and, in the case of a class of similar items, the average age. 5. The condition, including functional and economic depreciation or obsolescence. 6. The taxpayer’s estimate of fair market value. (b) For purposes of this subsection, a class of property shall include only those items which are substantially similar in function and use. Nothing in this chapter shall authorize the department to prescribe a return requiring information other than that contained in this subsection; nor shall the department issue or promulgate any rule or regulation directing the assessment of property by the consideration of factors other than those enumerated in s. 193.011. (5) The rules and regulations shall require that the property appraiser deliver copies of all pleadings in court proceedings in which his or her office is involved to the Department of Revenue. (6) The fees and costs of the sale or purchase and terms of financing shall be presumed to be usual unless the buyer or seller or agent thereof files a form which discloses the unusual fees, costs, and terms of financing. Such form shall be filed with the clerk of the circuit court at the time of recording. The rules and regulations shall prescribe an information form to be used for this purpose. Either the buyer or the seller or the agent of either shall complete the information form and certify that the form is accurate to the best of his or her knowledge and belief. The information form shall be confidential in the hands of all persons after delivery to the clerk, except that the Department of Revenue and the Auditor General shall have access to it in the execution of their official duties, and such form is exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1). The information form may be used in any judicial proceeding, upon a motion to produce duly made by any party to such proceedings. Failure of the clerk to obtain an information form with the recording shall not impair the validity of the recording or the conveyance. The form shall provide for a notation by the clerk indicating the book and page number of the conveyance in the official record books of the county. The clerk shall promptly deliver all information forms received to the property appraiser for his or her custody and use.

(b) This subsection expires on the date specified in s. 290.016 for the expiration of the Florida Enterprise Zone Act. (5) Rules adopted pursuant to this section shall provide for the separate identification of property granted an economic development ad valorem tax exemption, in addition to classification according to use. (6) To the greatest extent practicable and based on existing information, all publicly owned real property required to be listed on the assessment roll shall also be separately classified according to ownership by federal, state, or local government; water management district; or other public entity.

Venue for such actions shall be in the county in which the official duties of the property appraiser are to be performed. (2) The property appraiser or any taxing authority shall have the authority to bring and maintain such actions as may be necessary to contest the validity of any rule, regulation, order, directive, or determination of any agency of the state, including, but not limited to, disapproval of all or any part of an assessment roll or a determination of assessment levels. The defendant in such actions shall be the agency head, and service of process shall be on such person or, when the head of the agency is a collegial body, its executive director, if there be one. Such action shall be brought within 60 days of the date the rule, regulation, order, directive, or determination becomes effective. Venue for such actions shall be in Leon County. The circuit court judge, upon proper motion, may agree to hear the case in the county where the property is located if trial in Leon County would result in substantial expense and inconvenience to the necessary participants. Appeal shall be to the First District Court of Appeal. (3) No action shall be instituted to compel reappraisal of property or adjustment of the tax rolls unless the executive director has first met or in good faith has attempted to meet in conference with the affected property appraiser and has been unable to resolve differences or obtain acceptable written assurance of the implementation of a plan to ensure compliance with general law and the constitutional requirement of just value. (4) In any action instituted against a property appraiser to compel the performance of his or her official duties, the court may order the implementation of a plan of reappraisal to be completed within a prescribed period of time. To implement its decision, the court shall have the power to: (a) Enter such orders as are necessary to ensure that assessments shall be uniform, equitable, at just value, and otherwise in compliance with law. (b) Maintain jurisdiction until such time as all of the requirements of the court as expressed in its order have been met. (5) Chapter 120 shall not apply to this section.

      "heading": "Review of assessment rolls.",
      "text": "195.096 Review of assessment rolls.— (1) The assessment rolls of each county shall be subject to review by the Department of Revenue. (2) The department shall conduct, no less frequently than once every 2 years, an in-depth review of the real property assessment roll of each county. The department need not individually study every use-class of property set forth in s. 195.073, but shall at a minimum study the level of assessment in relation to just value of each classification specified in subsection (3). Such in-depth review may include proceedings of the value adjustment board and the audit or review of procedures used by the counties to appraise property. (a) The department shall, at least 30 days prior to the beginning of an in-depth review in any county, notify the property appraiser in the county of the pending review. At the request of the property appraiser, the department shall consult with the property appraiser regarding the classifications and strata to be studied, in order that the review will be useful to the property appraiser in evaluating his or her procedures. (b) Every property appraiser whose upcoming roll is subject to an in-depth review shall, if requested by the department on or before January 1, deliver upon completion of the assessment roll a list of the parcel numbers of all parcels that did not appear on the assessment roll of the previous year, indicating the parcel number of the parent parcel from which each new parcel was created or “cut out.” (c) In conducting assessment ratio studies, the department must use all practicable steps, including stratified statistical and analytical reviews and sale-qualification studies, to maximize the representativeness or statistical reliability of samples of properties in tests of each classification, stratum, or roll made the subject of a ratio study published by it. The department shall document and retain records of the measures of representativeness of the properties studied in compliance with this section. Such documentation must include a record of findings used as the basis for the approval or disapproval of the tax roll in each county pursuant to s. 193.1142. In addition, to the greatest extent practicable, the department shall study assessment roll strata by subclassifications such as value groups and market areas for each classification or stratum to be studied, to maximize the representativeness of ratio study samples. For purposes of this section, the department shall rely primarily on an assessment-to-sales-ratio study in conducting assessment ratio studies in those classifications of property specified in subsection (3) for which there are adequate market sales. The department shall compute the median and the value-weighted mean for each classification or subclassification studied and for the roll as a whole. (d) In the conduct of these reviews, the department shall adhere to all standards to which the property appraisers are required to adhere. (e) The department and each property appraiser shall cooperate in the conduct of these reviews, and each shall make available to the other all matters and records bearing on the preparation and computation of the reviews. The property appraisers shall provide any and all data requested by the department in the conduct of the studies, including electronic data processing tapes. Any and all data and samples developed or obtained by the department in the conduct of the studies shall be confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) until a presentation of the findings of the study is made to the property appraiser. After the presentation of the findings, the department shall provide any and all data requested by a property appraiser developed or obtained in the conduct of the studies, including tapes. Direct reimbursable costs of providing the data shall be borne by the party who requested it. Copies of existing data or records, whether maintained or required pursuant to law or rule, or data or records otherwise maintained, shall be submitted within 30 days from the date requested, in the case of written or printed information, and within 14 days from the date requested, in the case of computerized information. (f) Within 120 days after receipt of a county assessment roll by the executive director of the department pursuant to s. 193.1142(1), or within 10 days after approval of the assessment roll, whichever is later, the department shall complete the review for that county and publish the department’s findings. The findings must include measures as may be appropriate for each classification or subclassification studied and related statistical and analytical details. The measures in the findings must be based on: 1. A 95-percent level of confidence; or 2. Ratio study standards that are generally accepted by professional appraisal organizations in developing a statistically valid sampling plan if a 95-percent level of confidence is not attainable. (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, in one or more assessment years following a natural disaster in counties for which a state of emergency was declared by executive order or proclamation of the Governor pursuant to chapter 252, if the department determines that the natural disaster creates difficulties in its statistical and analytical reviews of the assessment rolls in affected counties, the department shall take all practicable steps to maximize the representativeness and reliability of its statistical and analytical reviews and may use the best information available to estimate the levels of assessment. This paragraph first applies to the 2019 assessment roll and operates retroactively to January 1, 2019. (3)(a) Upon completion of review pursuant to paragraph (2)(f), the department shall publish the results of reviews conducted under this section. The results must include all statistical and analytical measures computed under this section for the real property assessment roll and independently for the following real property classes if the classes constituted 5 percent or more of the total assessed value of real property in a county on the previous tax roll: 1. Residential property that consists of one primary living unit, including, but not limited to, single-family residences, condominiums, cooperatives, and mobile homes. 2. Residential property that consists of two to nine primary living units. 3. Agricultural, high-water recharge, historic property used for commercial or certain nonprofit purposes, and other use-valued property. 4. Vacant lots. 5. Nonagricultural acreage and other undeveloped parcels. 6. Improved commercial and industrial property, including apartments with more than nine units. 7. Taxable institutional or governmental, utility, locally assessed railroad, oil, gas and mineral land, subsurface rights, and other real property. If one of the above classes constituted less than 5 percent of the total assessed value of all real property in a county on the previous assessment roll, the department may combine it with one or more other classes of real property for purposes of assessment ratio studies or use the weighted average of the other classes for purposes of calculating the level of assessment for all real property in a county. The department shall also publish such results for any subclassifications of the classes or assessment roll it may have chosen to study. (b) If necessary for compliance with s. 1011.62, and for those counties not being studied in the current year, the department shall project value-weighted mean levels of assessment for each county. The department shall make its projection based upon the best information available, using professionally accepted methodology, and shall separately allocate changes in total assessed value to: 1. New construction, additions, and deletions. 2. Changes in the value of the dollar. 3. Changes in the market value of property other than those attributable to changes in the value of the dollar. 4. Changes in the level of assessment. In lieu of the statistical and analytical measures published pursuant to paragraph (a), the department shall publish details concerning the computation of estimated assessment levels and the allocation of changes in assessed value for those counties not subject to an in-depth review. (c) Upon publication of data and findings as required by this subsection, the department shall notify the committees of the Senate and of the House of Representatives having oversight responsibility for taxation, the appropriate property appraiser, and the county commission chair or corresponding official under a consolidated charter. Copies of the data and findings shall be provided upon request. (4) It is declared to be the legislative intent that approval of the rolls by the department pursuant to s. 193.1142 and certification by the value adjustment board pursuant to s. 193.122(1) shall not be deemed to impugn the use of postcertification reviews to require adjustments in the preparation of succeeding assessment rolls to ensure that such succeeding assessment rolls do meet the constitutional mandates of just value. (5) It is the legislative intent that the department utilize to the fullest extent practicable objective measures of market value in the conduct of reviews pursuant to this section. (6) Reviews conducted under this section must include an evaluation of whether nonhomestead exempt values determined by the appraiser under applicable provisions of chapter 196 are correct and whether agricultural and high-water recharge classifications and classifications of historic property used for commercial and certain nonprofit purposes were granted in accordance with law. (7) When a roll is prepared as an interim roll pursuant to s. 193.1145, the department shall compute assessment levels for both the interim roll and the final approved roll. (8) Chapter 120 shall not apply to this section.
