      "text": "190.002 Legislative findings, policies, and intent.— (1) The Legislature finds that: (a) There is a need for uniform, focused, and fair procedures in state law to provide a reasonable alternative for the establishment, power, operation, and duration of independent districts to manage and finance basic community development services; and that, based upon a proper and fair determination of applicable facts, an independent district can constitute a timely, efficient, effective, responsive, and economic way to deliver these basic services, thereby providing a solution to the state’s planning, management, and financing needs for delivery of capital infrastructure in order to service projected growth without overburdening other governments and their taxpayers. (b) It is in the public interest that any independent special district created pursuant to state law not outlive its usefulness and that the operation of such a district and the exercise by the district of its powers be consistent with applicable due process, disclosure, accountability, ethics, and government-in-the-sunshine requirements which apply both to governmental entities and to their elected and appointed officials. (c) It is in the public interest that long-range planning, management, and financing and long-term maintenance, upkeep, and operation of basic services for community development districts be under one coordinated entity. (2) It is the policy of this state: (a) That the needless and indiscriminate proliferation, duplication, and fragmentation of local general-purpose government services by independent districts is not in the public interest. (b) That independent districts are a legitimate alternative method available for use by the private and public sectors, as authorized by state law, to manage and finance basic services for community developments. (c) That the exercise by any independent district of its powers as set forth by uniform general law comply with all applicable governmental laws, rules, regulations, and policies governing planning and permitting of the development to be serviced by the district, to ensure that neither the establishment nor operation of such district is a development order under chapter 380 and that the district so established does not have any zoning or permitting powers governing development. (d) That the process of establishing such a district pursuant to uniform general law be fair and based only on factors material to managing and financing the service delivery function of the district, so that any matter concerning permitting or planning of the development is not material or relevant. (3) It is the legislative intent and purpose, based upon, and consistent with, its findings of fact and declarations of policy, to authorize a uniform procedure by general law to establish an independent special district as an alternative method to manage and finance basic services for community development. It is further the legislative intent and purpose to provide by general law for the uniform operation, exercise of power, and procedure for termination of any such independent district. It is further the purpose and intent of the Legislature that a district created under this chapter not have or exercise any zoning or development permitting power, that the establishment of the independent community development district as provided in this act not be a development order within the meaning of chapter 380, and that all applicable planning and permitting laws, rules, regulations, and policies control the development of the land to be serviced by the district. It is further the purpose and intent of the Legislature that no debt or obligation of a district constitute a burden on any local general-purpose government without its consent.

(c) Such county and each such municipality required by law to receive a petition may conduct a public hearing to consider the relationship of the petition to the factors specified in paragraph (e). The public hearing shall be concluded within 45 days after the date the petition is filed unless an extension of time is requested by the petitioner and granted by the county or municipality. The county or municipality holding such public hearing may by resolution express its support of, or objection to the granting of, the petition by the Florida Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission. A resolution must base any objection to the granting of the petition upon the factors specified in paragraph (e).

Whenever possible, the advertisement shall appear in a newspaper that is published at least weekly, unless the only newspaper in the community is published less than weekly. If the notice is published in the print edition of the newspaper, the map must also be included in any online advertisement pursuant to s. 50.0211. All affected units of general-purpose local government and the general public shall be given an opportunity to appear at the hearing and present oral or written comments on the petition. (e) The Florida Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission shall consider the entire record of the local hearing, the transcript of the hearing, resolutions adopted by local general-purpose governments as provided in paragraph (c), and the following factors and make a determination to grant or deny a petition for the establishment of a community development district: 1. Whether all statements contained within the petition have been found to be true and correct. 2. Whether the establishment of the district is inconsistent with any applicable element or portion of the state comprehensive plan or of the effective local government comprehensive plan. 3. Whether the area of land within the proposed district is of sufficient size, is sufficiently compact, and is sufficiently contiguous to be developable as one functional interrelated community. 4. Whether the district is the best alternative available for delivering community development services and facilities to the area that will be served by the district. 5. Whether the community development services and facilities of the district will be incompatible with the capacity and uses of existing local and regional community development services and facilities. 6. Whether the area that will be served by the district is amenable to separate special-district government. (f) The Florida Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission shall not adopt any rule which would expand, modify, or delete any provision of the uniform community development district charter as set forth in ss. 190.006-190.041, except as provided in s. 190.012. A rule establishing a community development district shall only contain the following: 1. A metes and bounds description of the external boundaries of the district and any real property within the external boundaries of the district which is to be excluded. 2. The names of five persons designated to be the initial members of the board of supervisors. 3. The name of the district. (g) The Florida Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission may adopt rules setting forth its procedures for considering petitions to establish, expand, modify, or delete uniform community development districts or portions thereof consistent with the provisions of this section. (2) The exclusive and uniform method for the establishment of a community development district of less than 2,500 acres in size or a community development district of up to 7,000 acres in size located within a connected-city corridor established pursuant to s. 163.3246(13) shall be pursuant to an ordinance adopted by the county commission of the county having jurisdiction over the majority of land in the area in which the district is to be located granting a petition for the establishment of a community development district as follows: (a) A petition for the establishment of a community development district shall be filed by the petitioner with the county commission. The petition shall contain the same information as required in paragraph (1)(a). (b) A public hearing on the petition shall be conducted by the county commission in accordance with the requirements and procedures of paragraph (1)(d). (c) The county commission shall consider the record of the public hearing and the factors set forth in paragraph (1)(e) in making its determination to grant or deny a petition for the establishment of a community development district. (d) The county commission may not adopt any ordinance which would expand, modify, or delete any provision of the uniform community development district charter as set forth in ss. 190.006-190.041. An ordinance establishing a community development district shall only include the matters provided for in paragraph (1)(f) unless the commission consents to any of the optional powers under s. 190.012(2) at the request of the petitioner. (e) If all of the land in the area for the proposed district is within the territorial jurisdiction of a municipal corporation, then the petition requesting establishment of a community development district under this act shall be filed by the petitioner with that particular municipal corporation. In such event, the duties of the county, hereinabove described, in action upon the petition shall be the duties of the municipal corporation. If any of the land area of a proposed district is within the land area of a municipality, the county commission may not create the district without municipal approval. If all of the land in the area for the proposed district, even if less than 2,500 acres, is within the territorial jurisdiction of two or more municipalities or two or more counties, except for proposed districts within a connected-city corridor established pursuant to s. 163.3246(13), the petition shall be filed with the Florida Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission and proceed in accordance with subsection (1). (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, within 90 days after a petition for the establishment of a community development district has been filed pursuant to this subsection, the governing body of the county or municipal corporation may transfer the petition to the Florida Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission, which shall make the determination to grant or deny the petition as provided in subsection (1). A county or municipal corporation shall have no right or power to grant or deny a petition that has been transferred to the Florida Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission. (3) The governing body of any existing special district, created to provide one or more of the public improvements and community facilities authorized by this act, may petition for reestablishment of the existing district as a community development district pursuant to this act. The petition shall contain the information specified in subparagraphs (1)(a)1., 3., 4., 5., 6., and 7. and shall not require payment of a fee pursuant to paragraph (1)(b). In such case, the new district so formed shall assume the existing obligations, indebtedness, and guarantees of indebtedness of the district so subsumed, and the existing district shall be terminated.

      "text": "190.006 Board of supervisors; members and meetings.— (1) The board of the district shall exercise the powers granted to the district pursuant to this act. The board shall consist of five members; except as otherwise provided herein, each member shall hold office for a term of 2 years or 4 years, as provided in this section, and until a successor is chosen and qualifies. The members of the board must be residents of the state and citizens of the United States. (2)(a) Within 90 days following the effective date of the rule or ordinance establishing the district, there shall be held a meeting of the landowners of the district for the purpose of electing five supervisors for the district. Notice of the landowners’ meeting shall be published once a week for 2 consecutive weeks in a newspaper which is in general circulation in the area of the district, the last day of such publication to be not fewer than 14 days or more than 28 days before the date of the election. The landowners, when assembled at such meeting, shall organize by electing a chair who shall conduct the meeting. The chair may be any person present at the meeting. If the chair is a landowner or proxy holder of a landowner, he or she may nominate candidates and make and second motions. (b) At such meeting, each landowner shall be entitled to cast one vote per acre of land owned by him or her and located within the district for each person to be elected. A landowner may vote in person or by proxy in writing. Each proxy must be signed by one of the legal owners of the property for which the vote is cast and must contain the typed or printed name of the individual who signed the proxy; the street address, legal description of the property, or tax parcel identification number; and the number of authorized votes. If the proxy authorizes more than one vote, each property must be listed and the number of acres of each property must be included. The signature on a proxy need not be notarized. A fraction of an acre shall be treated as 1 acre, entitling the landowner to one vote with respect thereto. For purposes of determining voting interests, platted lots shall be counted individually and rounded up to the nearest whole acre. The acreage of platted lots shall not be aggregated for determining the number of voting units held by a landowner or a landowner’s proxy. The two candidates receiving the highest number of votes shall be elected for a period of 4 years, and the three candidates receiving the next largest number of votes shall be elected for a period of 2 years, with the term of office for each successful candidate commencing upon election. The members of the first board elected by landowners shall serve their respective 4-year or 2-year terms; however, the next election by landowners shall be held on the first Tuesday in November. Thereafter, there shall be an election of supervisors for the district every 2 years in November on a date established by the board and noticed pursuant to paragraph (a). The second and subsequent landowners’ election shall be announced at a public meeting of the board at least 90 days prior to the date of the landowners’ meeting and shall also be noticed pursuant to paragraph (a). Instructions on how all landowners may participate in the election, along with sample proxies, shall be provided during the board meeting that announces the landowners’ meeting. The two candidates receiving the highest number of votes shall be elected to serve for a 4-year period, and the remaining candidate elected shall serve for a 2-year period. (3)(a)1. If the board proposes to exercise the ad valorem taxing power authorized by s. 190.021, the district board shall call an election at which the members of the board of supervisors will be elected. Such election shall be held in conjunction with a primary or general election unless the district bears the cost of a special election. Each member shall be elected by the qualified electors of the district for a term of 4 years, except that, at the first such election, three members shall be elected for a period of 4 years and two members shall be elected for a period of 2 years. All elected board members must be qualified electors of the district. 2.a. Regardless of whether a district has proposed to levy ad valorem taxes, commencing 6 years after the initial appointment of members or, for a district exceeding 5,000 acres in area or for a compact, urban, mixed-use district, 10 years after the initial appointment of members, the position of each member whose term has expired shall be filled by a qualified elector of the district, elected by the qualified electors of the district. However, for those districts established after June 21, 1991, and for those existing districts established after December 31, 1983, which have less than 50 qualified electors on June 21, 1991, sub-subparagraphs b. and d. shall apply. If, in the 6th year after the initial appointment of members, or 10 years after such initial appointment for districts exceeding 5,000 acres in area or for a compact, urban, mixed-use district, there are not at least 250 qualified electors in the district, or for a district exceeding 5,000 acres or for a compact, urban, mixed-use district, there are not at least 500 qualified electors, members of the board shall continue to be elected by landowners. b. After the 6th or 10th year, once a district reaches 250 or 500 qualified electors, respectively, then the positions of two board members whose terms are expiring shall be filled by qualified electors of the district, elected by the qualified electors of the district for 4-year terms. The remaining board member whose term is expiring shall be elected for a 4-year term by the landowners and is not required to be a qualified elector. Thereafter, as terms expire, board members shall be qualified electors elected by qualified electors of the district for a term of 4 years. c. Once a district qualifies to have any of its board members elected by the qualified electors of the district, the initial and all subsequent elections by the qualified electors of the district shall be held at the general election in November. The board shall adopt a resolution if necessary to implement this requirement when the board determines the number of qualified electors as required by sub-subparagraph d., to extend or reduce the terms of current board members. d. On or before June 1 of each year, the board shall determine the number of qualified electors in the district as of the immediately preceding April 15. The board shall use and rely upon the official records maintained by the supervisor of elections and property appraiser or tax collector in each county in making this determination. Such determination shall be made at a properly noticed meeting of the board and shall become a part of the official minutes of the district. (b) Elections of board members by qualified electors held pursuant to this subsection shall be nonpartisan and shall be conducted in the manner prescribed by law for holding general elections. The district shall publish a notice of the qualifying period set by the supervisor of elections for each election at least 2 weeks prior to the start of the qualifying period. Board members shall assume the office on the second Tuesday following their election. If no elector qualifies for a seat to be filled in an election, a vacancy in that seat shall be declared by the board effective on the second Tuesday following the election. Within 90 days thereafter, the board shall appoint a qualified elector to fill the vacancy. Until such appointment, the incumbent board member in that seat shall remain in office. (c) Candidates seeking election to office by qualified electors under this subsection shall conduct their campaigns in accordance with the provisions of chapter 106 and shall file qualifying papers and qualify for individual seats in accordance with s. 99.061. (d) The supervisor of elections shall appoint the inspectors and clerks of elections, prepare and furnish the ballots, designate polling places, and canvass the returns of the election of board members by qualified electors. The county canvassing board shall declare and certify the results of the election. (4) Members of the board shall be known as supervisors and, upon entering into office, shall take and subscribe to the oath of office as prescribed by s. 876.05. They shall hold office for the terms for which they were elected or appointed and until their successors are chosen and qualified. If, during the term of office, a vacancy occurs, the remaining members of the board shall fill the vacancy by an appointment for the remainder of the unexpired term. (5) A majority of the members of the board constitutes a quorum for the purposes of conducting its business and exercising its powers and for all other purposes. Action taken by the district shall be upon a vote of a majority of the members present unless general law or a rule of the district requires a greater number. (6) As soon as practicable after each election or appointment, the board shall organize by electing one of its members as chair and by electing a secretary, who need not be a member of the board, and such other officers as the board may deem necessary. (7) The board shall keep a permanent record book entitled “Record of Proceedings of (name of district) Community Development District,” in which shall be recorded minutes of all meetings, resolutions, proceedings, certificates, bonds given by all employees, and any and all corporate acts. The record book shall at reasonable times be opened to inspection in the same manner as state, county, and municipal records pursuant to chapter 119. The record book shall be kept at the office or other regular place of business maintained by the board in the county or municipality in which the district is located or within the boundaries of a development of regional impact or Florida Quality Development, or combination of a development of regional impact and Florida Quality Development, which includes the district. (8) Each supervisor shall be entitled to receive for his or her services an amount not to exceed $200 per meeting of the board of supervisors, not to exceed $4,800 per year per supervisor, or an amount established by the electors at referendum. In addition, each supervisor shall receive travel and per diem expenses as set forth in s. 112.061. (9) All meetings of the board shall be open to the public and governed by the provisions of chapter 286.

II of the State Constitution, a board member or a public employee of a district does not abuse his or her public position if the board member or public employee commits an act or omission that is authorized under this subsection, s. 112.313(7), (12), (15), or (16), or s. 112.3143(3)(b), and an abuse of a board member’s public position does not include any act or omission in connection with a vote when the board member has followed the procedures required by s. 112.3143. (2) The board shall designate a person who is a resident of the state as treasurer of the district, who shall have charge of the funds of the district. Such funds shall be disbursed only upon the order, or pursuant to the resolution, of the board by warrant or check countersigned by the treasurer and by such other person as may be authorized by the board. The board may give the treasurer such other or additional powers and duties as the board may deem appropriate and may fix his or her compensation. The board may require the treasurer to give a bond in such amount, on such terms, and with such sureties as may be deemed satisfactory to the board to secure the performance by the treasurer of his or her powers and duties. The financial records of the board shall be audited by an independent certified public accountant at least once a year. (3) The board is authorized to select as a depository for its funds any qualified public depository as defined in s. 280.02 which meets all the requirements of chapter 280 and has been designated by the Chief Financial Officer as a qualified public depository, upon such terms and conditions as to the payment of interest by such depository upon the funds so deposited as the board may deem just and reasonable.

Bonds may be sold at public or private sale after such advertisement, if any, as the board may deem advisable but not in any event at less than 90 percent of the par value thereof, together with accrued interest thereon. Bonds may be sold or exchanged for refunding bonds. Special assessment and revenue bonds may be delivered by the district as payment of the purchase price of any project or part thereof, or a combination of projects or parts thereof, or as the purchase price or exchange for any property, real, personal, or mixed, including franchises or services rendered by any contractor, engineer, or other person, all at one time or in blocks from time to time, in such manner and upon such terms as the board in its discretion shall determine. The price or prices for any bonds sold, exchanged, or delivered may be: (a) The money paid for the bonds; (b) The principal amount, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption or exchange, or outstanding obligations exchanged for refunding bonds; and (c) In the case of special assessment or revenue bonds, the amount of any indebtedness to contractors or other persons paid with such bonds, or the fair value of any properties exchanged for the bonds, as determined by the board. (2) AUTHORIZATION AND FORM OF BONDS.—Any general obligation bonds, benefit bonds, or revenue bonds may be authorized by resolution or resolutions of the board which shall be adopted by a majority of all the members thereof then in office. Such resolution or resolutions may be adopted at the same meeting at which they are introduced and need not be published or posted. The board may, by resolution, authorize the issuance of bonds and fix the aggregate amount of bonds to be issued; the purpose or purposes for which the moneys derived therefrom shall be expended, including, but not limited to, payment of costs as defined in s. 190.003(8); the rate or rates of interest, in compliance with s. 215.84; the denomination of the bonds; whether or not the bonds are to be issued in one or more series; the date or dates of maturity, which shall not exceed 40 years from their respective dates of issuance; the medium of payment; the place or places within or without the state where payment shall be made; registration privileges; redemption terms and privileges, whether with or without premium; the manner of execution; the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto; the manner of execution of bonds and coupons; and any and all other terms, covenants, and conditions thereof and the establishment of revenue or other funds. Such authorizing resolution or resolutions may further provide for the contracts authorized by s. 159.825(1)(f) and (g) regardless of the tax treatment of such bonds being authorized, subject to the finding by the board of a net saving to the district resulting by reason thereof. Such authorizing resolution may further provide that such bonds may be executed in accordance with the Registered Public Obligations Act, except that bonds not issued in registered form shall be valid if manually countersigned by an officer designated by appropriate resolution of the board. The seal of the district may be affixed, lithographed, engraved, or otherwise reproduced in facsimile on such bonds. In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he or she had remained in office until such delivery. (3) INTERIM CERTIFICATES; REPLACEMENT CERTIFICATES.—Pending the preparation of definitive bonds, the board may issue interim certificates or receipts or temporary bonds, in such form and with such provisions as the board may determine, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery. The board may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which become mutilated, lost, or destroyed. (4) NEGOTIABILITY OF BONDS.—Any bond issued under this act or any temporary bond, in the absence of an express recital on the face thereof that it is nonnegotiable, shall be fully negotiable and shall be and constitute a negotiable instrument within the meaning and for all purposes of the law merchant and the laws of the state. (5) DEFEASANCE.—The board may make such provision with respect to the defeasance of the right, title, and interest of the holders of any of the bonds and obligations of the district in any revenues, funds, or other properties by which such bonds are secured as the board deems appropriate and, without limitation on the foregoing, may provide that when such bonds or obligations become due and payable or shall have been called for redemption and the whole amount of the principal and interest and premium, if any, due and payable upon the bonds or obligations then outstanding shall be held in trust for such purpose and provision shall also be made for paying all other sums payable in connection with such bonds or other obligations, then and in such event the right, title, and interest of the holders of the bonds in any revenues, funds, or other properties by which such bonds are secured shall thereupon cease, terminate, and become void; and the board may apply any surplus in any sinking fund established in connection with such bonds or obligations and all balances remaining in all other funds or accounts other than money held for the redemption or payment of the bonds or other obligations to any lawful purpose of the district as the board shall determine. (6) ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL BONDS.—If the proceeds of any bonds are less than the cost of completing the project in connection with which such bonds were issued, the board may authorize the issuance of additional bonds, upon such terms and conditions as the board may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance thereof, but only in compliance with the resolution or other proceedings authorizing the issuance of the original bonds. (7) REFUNDING BONDS.—The district shall have the power to issue bonds to provide for the retirement or refunding of any bonds or obligations of the district that at the time of such issuance are or subsequently thereto become due and payable, or that at the time of issuance have been called or are or will be subject to call for redemption within 10 years thereafter, or the surrender of which can be procured from the holders thereof at prices satisfactory to the board. Refunding bonds may be issued at any time when in the judgment of the board such issuance will be advantageous to the district. No approval of the qualified electors residing in the district shall be required for the issuance of refunding bonds except in cases in which such approval is required by the State Constitution. The board may by resolution confer upon the holders of such refunding bonds all rights, powers, and remedies to which the holders would be entitled if they continued to be the owners and had possession of the bonds for the refinancing of which such refunding bonds are issued, including, but not limited to, the preservation of the lien of such bonds on the revenues of any project or on pledged funds, without extinguishment, impairment, or diminution thereof. The provisions of this act pertaining to bonds of the district shall, unless the context otherwise requires, govern the issuance of refunding bonds, the form and other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the board with respect to them. (8) REVENUE BONDS.— (a) The district shall have the power to issue revenue bonds from time to time without limitation as to amount. Such revenue bonds may be secured by, or payable from, the gross or net pledge of the revenues to be derived from any project or combination of projects; from the rates, fees, or other charges to be collected from the users of any project or projects; from any revenue-producing undertaking or activity of the district; from special assessments; or from any other source or pledged security. Such bonds shall not constitute an indebtedness of the district, and the approval of the qualified electors shall not be required unless such bonds are additionally secured by the full faith and credit and taxing power of the district. (b) Any two or more projects may be combined and consolidated into a single project and may hereafter be operated and maintained as a single project. The revenue bonds authorized herein may be issued to finance any one or more of such projects, regardless of whether or not such projects have been combined and consolidated into a single project. If the board deems it advisable, the proceedings authorizing such revenue bonds may provide that the district may thereafter combine the projects then being financed or theretofore financed with other projects to be subsequently financed by the district and that revenue bonds to be thereafter issued by the district shall be on parity with the revenue bonds then being issued, all on such terms, conditions, and limitations as shall have been provided in the proceeding which authorized the original bonds. (9) GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS.— (a) The district shall have the power from time to time to issue general obligation bonds to finance or refinance capital projects or to refund outstanding bonds in an aggregate principal amount of bonds outstanding at any one time not in excess of 35 percent of the assessed value of the taxable property within the district as shown on the pertinent tax records at the time of the authorization of the general obligation bonds for which the full faith and credit of the district is pledged. Except for refunding bonds, no general obligation bonds shall be issued unless the bonds are issued to finance or refinance a capital project and the issuance has been approved at an election held in accordance with the requirements for such election as prescribed by the State Constitution. Such elections shall be called to be held in the district by the board of county commissioners of the county upon the request of the board of the district. The expenses of calling and holding an election shall be at the expense of the district, and the district shall reimburse the county for any expenses incurred in calling or holding such election. (b) The district may pledge its full faith and credit for the payment of the principal and interest on such general obligation bonds and for any reserve funds provided therefor and may unconditionally and irrevocably pledge itself to levy ad valorem taxes on all taxable property in the district, to the extent necessary for the payment thereof, without limitations as to rate or amount. (c) If the board determines to issue general obligation bonds for more than one capital project, the approval of the issuance of the bonds for each and all such projects may be submitted to the electors on one and the same ballot. The failure of the electors to approve the issuance of bonds for any one or more capital projects shall not defeat the approval of bonds for any capital project which has been approved by the electors. (d) In arriving at the amount of general obligation bonds permitted to be outstanding at any one time pursuant to paragraph (a), there shall not be included any general obligation bonds which are additionally secured by the pledge of: 1. Special assessments levied in an amount sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the general obligation bonds so additionally secured, which assessments have been equalized and confirmed by resolution or ordinance of the board pursuant to s. 170.08. 2. Water revenues, sewer revenues, or water and sewer revenues of the district to be derived from user fees in an amount sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the general obligation bonds so additionally secured. 3. Any combination of assessments and revenues described in subparagraphs 1. and 2. (10) BONDS AS LEGAL INVESTMENT OR SECURITY.— (a) Notwithstanding any provisions of any other law to the contrary, all bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall constitute legal investments for savings banks, banks, trust companies, insurance companies, executors, administrators, trustees, guardians, and other fiduciaries and for any board, body, agency, instrumentality, county, municipality, or other political subdivision of the state and shall be and constitute security which may be deposited by banks or trust companies as security for deposits of state, county, municipal, or other public funds or by insurance companies as required or voluntary statutory deposits. (b) Any bonds issued by the district shall be incontestable in the hands of bona fide purchasers or holders for value and shall not be invalid because of any irregularity or defect in the proceedings for the issue and sale thereof. (11) COVENANTS.—Any resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds may contain such covenants as the board may deem advisable, and all such covenants shall constitute valid and legally binding and enforceable contracts between the district and the bondholders, regardless of the time of issuance thereof. Such covenants may include, without limitation, covenants concerning the disposition of the bond proceeds; the use and disposition of project revenues; the pledging of revenues, taxes, and assessments; the obligations of the district with respect to the operation of the project and the maintenance of adequate project revenues; the issuance of additional bonds; the appointment, powers, and duties of trustees and receivers; the acquisition of outstanding bonds and obligations; restrictions on the establishing of competing projects or facilities; restrictions on the sale or disposal of the assets and property of the district; the priority of assessment liens; the priority of claims by bondholders on the taxing power of the district; the maintenance of deposits to assure the payment of revenues by users of district facilities and services; the discontinuance of district services by reason of delinquent payments; acceleration upon default; the execution of necessary instruments; the procedure for amending or abrogating covenants with the bondholders; and such other covenants as may be deemed necessary or desirable for the security of the bondholders. (12) VALIDATION PROCEEDINGS.—The power of the district to issue bonds under the provisions of this act may be determined, and any of the bonds of the district maturing over a period of more than 5 years shall be validated and confirmed, by court decree, under the provisions of chapter 75 and laws amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto. (13) ACT FURNISHES FULL AUTHORITY FOR ISSUANCE OF BONDS.—This act constitutes full and complete authority for the issuance of bonds and the exercise of the powers of the district provided herein. No procedures or proceedings, publications, notices, consents, approvals, orders, acts, or things by the board, or any board, officers, commission, department, agency, or instrumentality of the district, other than those required by this act, shall be required to perform anything under this act, except that the issuance or sale of bonds pursuant to the provisions of this act shall comply with the general law requirements applicable to the issuance or sale of bonds by the district. Nothing in this act shall be construed to authorize the district to utilize bond proceeds to fund the ongoing operations of the district. (14) PLEDGE BY THE STATE TO THE BONDHOLDERS OF THE DISTRICT.—The state pledges to the holders of any bonds issued under this act that it will not limit or alter the rights of the district to own, acquire, construct, reconstruct, improve, maintain, operate, or furnish the projects or to levy and collect the taxes, assessments, rentals, rates, fees, and other charges provided for herein and to fulfill the terms of any agreement made with the holders of such bonds or other obligations and that it will not in any way impair the rights or remedies of such holders. (15) DEFAULT.—A default on the bonds or obligations of a district shall not constitute a debt or obligation of a local general-purpose government or the state.
