      "text": "322.032 Digital proof of driver license or identification card.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Digital proof of driver license” means an electronic credential viewable on an electronic credentialing system. (b) “Digital proof of identification card” means an electronic credential viewable on an electronic credentialing system. (c) “Electronic credentialing system” means a computer system accessed using a computer, a cellular telephone, or any other personal device which queries the department’s driver license and identification card records, displays or transmits digital proofs of driver licenses and identification cards, and verifies the authenticity of those electronic credentials. (d) “Limited profile” means an electronic credential containing some, but not all, of the information displayed on a printed driver license or identification card. (e) “Scanning” means obtaining data from a digital proof of driver license or identification card in an electronic format. (2)(a) The department shall establish a secure and uniform system for issuing an optional digital proof of driver license or identification card. The department may contract with one or more private entities to develop an electronic credentialing system. (b) The electronic credentialing system may not retain Internet protocol addresses, geolocation data, or other information that describes the location, computer, computer system, or computer network from which a customer accesses the system. (3)(a) The digital proof of driver license or identification card established by the department or by an entity contracted by the department must be in such a format as to allow verification of the authenticity of the digital proof of driver license or identification card. The department may adopt rules to ensure valid authentication of digital driver licenses and identification cards. (b)1. Notwithstanding ss. 322.14-322.142, and any other law prescribing the design for, or information required to be displayed on, a driver license, a digital proof of driver license may comprise a limited profile that includes only information necessary to conduct a specific transaction on the electronic credentialing system. 2. Notwithstanding ss. 322.051 and 322.141, and any other law prescribing the design for, or information required to be displayed on, an identification card, a digital proof of identification card may comprise a limited profile that includes only information necessary to conduct a specific transaction on the electronic credentialing system. (4) A person may not be issued a digital proof of driver license or identification card until he or she satisfies all requirements of this chapter for issuance of the respective driver license or identification card and has been issued a printed driver license or identification card. The electronic credentialing system must, upon each presentation of a digital driver license or identification card, display or transmit current records for the driver license or identification card. If a licensee’s driving privilege is suspended, revoked, or disqualified, or if his or her driver license is otherwise canceled or expired, a digital proof of driver license may not be issued; however, a digital proof of identification card may be issued if the licensee is otherwise eligible for an identification card under s. 322.051. (5) The department may use a telephone number submitted by a licensee or cardholder in connection with a digital driver license or identification card only for purposes of communication regarding the digital proof of driver license or identification card or the motor vehicle records, as defined in s. 119.0712(2)(a), of the licensee or cardholder. (6) The department may enter into contracts with one or more private entities which authorize online data calls or offline data verification through the electronic credentialing system that queries the department’s driver license and identification card records, displays or transmits digital proofs of driver licenses or identification cards, or verifies the authenticity of such electronic credentials. (7)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), a private entity that scans a digital proof of driver license or identification card may not store, sell, or share personal information collected from such scanning of the digital proof of driver license or identification card. (b) An individual may consent to allow a private entity to collect and store personal information obtained by scanning his or her digital proof of driver license or identification card. However, the individual must be informed what information is collected and the purpose or purposes for which the information will be used. If the individual does not want the private entity to scan his or her digital proof of the individual’s driver license or identification card, the private entity may manually collect personal information from the individual. (c) A private entity that violates this subsection is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 per occurrence. (d) This subsection does not apply to a financial institution as defined in s. 655.005(1)(i). (8) A person who: (a) Manufactures a false digital proof of driver license or identification card commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. (b) Possesses a false digital proof of driver license or identification card commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082.

Issued to a person 15 years of age and older shall expire, unless canceled earlier, on the eighth birthday of the applicant following the date of original issue. Renewal of an identification card shall be made for the applicable term enumerated in this paragraph. Any application for renewal received later than 90 days after expiration of the identification card shall be considered the same as an application for an original identification card.

The fee must include payment for the color photograph or digital image of the applicant. Any person who loses an identification card and who, after obtaining a duplicate, finds the original card shall immediately surrender the original card to the department. The same documentary evidence shall be furnished for a duplicate as for an original identification card. (4) When used with reference to identification cards, “cancellation” means that an identification card is terminated without prejudice and must be surrendered. Cancellation of the card may be made when a card has been issued through error or when voluntarily surrendered to the department.

      "text": "322.0602 Youthful Drunk Driver Visitation Program.— (1) SHORT TITLE.—This section may be cited as the “Youthful Drunk Driver Visitation Program Act.” (2) COURT-ORDERED PARTICIPATION IN PROGRAM; PREFERENCE FOR PARTICIPATION.— (a) If a person is convicted of a violation of s. 316.193, the court may order, as a term and condition of probation in addition to any other term or condition required or authorized by law, that the probationer participate in the Youthful Drunk Driver Visitation Program. (b) The court shall give preference for participation in the program to probationers who are less than 18 years of age at the time of the offense if the facilities which participate in the program within the jurisdiction cannot accommodate all probationers who are eligible and who consent to participate in the program. (3) INVESTIGATION AND CONSULTATION BY COURT.—The court shall investigate and consult with the probationer, his or her counsel, if any, and any proposed supervisor of a visitation under the program. The court may consult with any other person whom the court finds may be of value, including, but not limited to, the probationer’s parents or other family members, in order to ascertain that the probationer is suitable for the program, that the visitation will be educational and meaningful to the probationer, and that there are no physical, emotional, or mental reasons to believe the program is not appropriate for the probationer or would cause any injury to the probationer. (4) VISITATION REQUIREMENT.— (a) To the extent that personnel and facilities are made available to the court, the court may include a requirement for supervised visitation by the probationer to all, or any, of the following: 1. A trauma center, as defined in s. 395.4001, or a hospital as defined in s. 395.002, which regularly receives victims of vehicle accidents, between the hours of 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. on a Friday or Saturday night, in order to observe appropriate victims of vehicle accidents involving drinking drivers, under the supervision of any of the following: a. A registered nurse trained in providing emergency trauma care or prehospital advanced life support. b. An emergency room physician. c. An emergency medical technician. 2. A licensed service provider, as defined in s. 397.311, which cares for substance abuse impaired persons, to observe persons in the terminal stages of substance abuse impairment, under the supervision of appropriately licensed medical personnel. Prior to any visitation of such terminally ill or disabled persons, the persons or their legal representatives must give their express consent to participate in the visitation program. 3. If approved by the county coroner, the county coroner’s office or the county morgue to observe appropriate victims of vehicle accidents involving drinking drivers, under the supervision of the coroner or a deputy coroner. (b) As used in this section, the term “appropriate victims” means victims or their legal representatives, including the next of kin, who have expressly given their consent to participate in the visitation program and victims whose condition is determined by the visitation supervisor to demonstrate the results of accidents involving drinking drivers without being excessively gruesome or traumatic to the probationer. (c) If persons trained in counseling or substance abuse are made available to the court, the court may coordinate the visitation program or the visitations at any of the appropriate facilities through those persons. (d) Any visitation shall include, before any observation of victims or disabled persons by the probationer, a comprehensive counseling session with the visitation supervisor at which the supervisor shall explain and discuss the experiences which may be encountered during the visitation in order to ascertain whether the visitation is appropriate for the probationer. (e) If at any time, either before or during a visitation, the supervisor of the probationer determines that the visitation may be or is traumatic or otherwise inappropriate for the probationer, or the supervisor is uncertain whether the visitation may be traumatic or inappropriate, the visitation shall be terminated without prejudice to the probationer. (5) POSTVISITATION CONFERENCE.— (a) Following completion of any of the required visitations, the program may include a personal conference among the sentencing judge, his or her designated representative, or the person responsible for coordinating the program for the judicial district and the probationer, the probationer’s counsel, and, if available, the probationer’s parents in order to discuss the experiences of the visitation and how those experiences may affect the probationer’s future conduct. (b) If a personal conference is not practicable because of the probationer’s absence from the jurisdiction, conflicting time schedules, or other reasons, the program shall require a written report or letter by the probationer to the court discussing the experiences and their effect on the probationer. (6) IMMUNITY FROM CIVIL LIABILITY.—The county, a court, any facility visited pursuant to the program, an agent, employee, or independent contractor of the court, county, or facility visited pursuant to the program, or any person supervising a probationer during the visitation, is not liable for any civil damages resulting from injury to the probationer, or civil damages caused by the probationer, during or from any activities relating to, the visitation, except for willful or grossly negligent acts intended to, or reasonably expected to, result in injury or damage. A probationer is eligible for workers’ compensation as prescribed by law if he or she performs community service at a facility as an additional term or condition of probation.

The department may not issue a driver license or learner’s driver license to, or shall suspend the driver license or learner’s driver license of, any minor concerning whom the department receives notification of noncompliance with the requirements of this section. (2) NOTIFICATION OF INTENT TO SUSPEND; SUSPENSION; RECORD OF NONCOMPLIANCE.— (a) The department shall notify each minor for whom the department has received notification of noncompliance with the requirements of this section as provided in s. 1003.27, and the minor’s parent or guardian, of the department’s intent to suspend the minor’s driving privileges. (b) The minor, or the parent or guardian of the minor, has 15 calendar days after the date of receipt of this notice to provide proof of compliance with the requirements of this section as provided in subsection (4) or to request a hardship waiver hearing under subsection (3).

(d) Upon notification of the outcome of a hardship waiver hearing, the department shall suspend the driver license or learner’s driver license of a minor who was denied a hardship waiver, or record the legal name, sex, date of birth, and social security number of a minor who does not possess a driver license or learner’s driver license and who was denied a hardship waiver. (e) The department may not issue a driver license or learner’s driver license to any minor for whom it has a record of noncompliance with the requirements of subsection (1) unless the minor submits verification of compliance pursuant to subsection (4). (3) HARDSHIP WAIVER AND APPEAL.— (a) A minor, or the parent or guardian of a minor, has 15 calendar days after the date of receipt of the notice of intent to suspend to request a hardship waiver hearing before the public school principal, the principal’s designee, or the designee of the governing body of a private school for the purpose of reviewing the pending suspension of driving privileges. The school official receiving the request shall notify the department of the request for a waiver hearing within 24 hours after receiving the request. Public school officials shall also notify the district school board of the request for a waiver hearing. The hearing must be conducted within 30 calendar days after the public school principal, the principal’s designee, or the designee of the governing body of a private school receives the request. (b) The public school principal, the principal’s designee, or the designee of the governing body of a private school shall waive the requirements of subsection (1) for any minor under the school’s jurisdiction for whom a personal or family hardship requires that the minor have a driver license for his or her own, or his or her family’s, employment or medical care. The minor or the minor’s parent or guardian may present other evidence that indicates compliance with the requirements of subsection (1) at the waiver hearing. The public school principal, the principal’s designee, or the designee of the governing body of a private school shall consider the recommendations of teachers, other school officials, certified school counselors, or academic advisers before waiving the requirements of subsection (1). (c) The public school principal, the principal’s designee, or the designee of the governing body of a private school shall notify the department of the outcome of a minor’s hardship waiver hearing within 24 hours after conducting the hearing. Public school officials shall also notify the district school board of the outcome of the hearing. (d) Any person denied a hardship waiver by a public school principal, the principal’s designee, or the designee of the governing body of a private school may appeal the decision to the district school board or the governing body of the private school. The district school board or the governing body of the private school shall notify the department if the hardship waiver is subsequently granted. (4) VERIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE AND REINSTATEMENT.—A district school board shall provide a minor with written verification that he or she is in compliance with the requirements of subsection (1) if the district determines that he or she has been in compliance for 30 days prior to the request for verification of compliance. Upon receiving written verification that the minor is again in compliance with the requirements of subsection (1), the department shall reinstate the minor’s driving privilege. Thereafter, if the school district determines that the minor is not in compliance with the requirements of subsection (1), the department shall suspend the minor’s driving privilege until the minor is 18 years of age or otherwise satisfies the requirements of subsection (1), whichever occurs first.

      "text": "322.12 Examination of applicants.— (1) It is the intent of the Legislature that every applicant for an original driver license in this state be required to pass an examination pursuant to this section. However, the department may waive the knowledge, endorsement, and skills tests for an applicant who is otherwise qualified and who surrenders a valid driver license from another state or a province of Canada, or a valid driver license issued by the United States Armed Forces, if the driver applies for a Florida license of an equal or lesser classification. An applicant who fails to pass the initial knowledge test incurs a $10 fee for each subsequent test, to be deposited into the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund, except that if a subsequent test is administered by the tax collector, the tax collector shall retain such $10 fee, less the general revenue service charge set forth in s. 215.20(1). An applicant who fails to pass the initial skills test incurs a $20 fee for each subsequent test, to be deposited into the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund, except that if a subsequent test is administered by the tax collector, the tax collector shall retain such $20 fee, less the general revenue service charge set forth in s. 215.20(1). A person who seeks to retain a hazardous-materials endorsement, pursuant to s. 322.57(1)(e), must pass the hazardous-materials test, upon surrendering his or her commercial driver license, if the person has not taken and passed the hazardous-materials test within 2 years before applying for a commercial driver license in this state. (2) The department shall examine every applicant for a driver license, including an applicant who is licensed in another state or country, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. A person who holds a learner’s driver license as provided for in s. 322.1615 is not required to pay a fee for successfully completing the examination showing his or her ability to operate a motor vehicle as provided for herein and need not pay the fee for a replacement license as provided in s. 322.17(2). 1 (3) For an applicant for a Class E driver license, such examination shall include all of the following: (a) A test of the applicant’s eyesight given by the driver license examiner designated by the department or by a licensed ophthalmologist, optometrist, or physician. (b) A test of the applicant’s hearing given by a driver license examiner or a licensed physician. (c) A test of the applicant’s ability to read and understand highway signs regulating, warning, and directing traffic; his or her knowledge of the traffic laws of this state, including laws regulating driving under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances, driving with an unlawful blood-alcohol level, and driving while intoxicated; and his or her knowledge of the effects of alcohol and controlled substances upon persons and the dangers of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances. At least 25 questions within the bank of test questions must address bicycle and pedestrian safety. (d) An actual demonstration of ability to exercise ordinary and reasonable control in the operation of a motor vehicle. 1 (4) The examination for an applicant for a commercial driver license shall include a test of the applicant’s eyesight given by a driver license examiner designated by the department or by a licensed ophthalmologist, optometrist, or physician and a test of the applicant’s hearing given by a driver license examiner or a licensed physician. The examination shall also include a test of the applicant’s ability to read and understand highway signs regulating, warning, and directing traffic; his or her knowledge of the traffic laws of this state pertaining to the class of motor vehicle which he or she is applying to be licensed to operate, including laws regulating driving under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances, driving with an unlawful blood-alcohol level, and driving while intoxicated; his or her knowledge of the effects of alcohol and controlled substances and the dangers of driving a motor vehicle after having consumed alcohol or controlled substances; and his or her knowledge of any special skills, requirements, or precautions necessary for the safe operation of the class of vehicle which he or she is applying to be licensed to operate. In addition, the examination shall include an actual demonstration of the applicant’s ability to exercise ordinary and reasonable control in the safe operation of a motor vehicle or combination of vehicles of the type covered by the license classification which the applicant is seeking, including an examination of the applicant’s ability to perform an inspection of his or her vehicle. (a) The portion of the examination which tests an applicant’s safe driving ability shall be administered by the department or by an entity authorized by the department to administer such examination, pursuant to s. 322.56. Such examination shall be administered at a location approved by the department. (b) A person who seeks to retain a hazardous-materials endorsement must, upon renewal, pass the test for such endorsement as specified in s. 322.57(1)(e), if the person has not taken and passed the hazardous-materials test within 2 years preceding his or her application for a commercial driver license in this state. (5)(a) The department shall formulate a separate examination for applicants for licenses to operate motorcycles. Any applicant for a driver license who wishes to operate a motorcycle, and who is otherwise qualified, must successfully complete such an examination, which is in addition to the examination administered under subsection (3). The examination must test the applicant’s knowledge of the operation of a motorcycle and of any traffic laws specifically relating thereto and must include an actual demonstration of his or her ability to exercise ordinary and reasonable control in the operation of a motorcycle. Any applicant who fails to pass the initial knowledge examination will incur a $5 fee for each subsequent examination, to be deposited into the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund. Any applicant who fails to pass the initial skills examination will incur a $10 fee for each subsequent examination, to be deposited into the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund. In the formulation of the examination, the department shall consider the use of the Motorcycle Operator Skills Test and the Motorcycle in Traffic Test offered by the Motorcycle Safety Foundation. The department shall indicate on the license of any person who successfully completes the examination that the licensee is authorized to operate a motorcycle. If the applicant wishes to be licensed to operate a motorcycle only, he or she need not take the skill or road test required under subsection (3) for the operation of a motor vehicle, and the department shall indicate such a limitation on his or her license as a restriction. Every first-time applicant for licensure to operate a motorcycle must provide proof of completion of a motorcycle safety course, as provided for in s. 322.0255, before the applicant may be licensed to operate a motorcycle. (b) The department may exempt any applicant from the examination provided in this subsection if the applicant presents a certificate showing successful completion of a course approved by the department, which course includes a similar examination of the knowledge and skill of the applicant in the operation of a motorcycle. (c) This subsection does not apply to the operation of an autocycle, as defined in s. 316.003.

(b) The department may further impose other suitable restrictions on use of the license with respect to time and purpose of use, including, but not limited to, a restriction providing for intrastate operation only, or may impose any other condition or restriction that the department considers necessary for driver improvement, safety, or control of drivers in this state. (c) The department may further, at any time, impose other restrictions on the use of the license with respect to time and purpose of use or may impose any other condition or restriction upon recommendation of any court, of the Florida Commission on Offender Review, or of the Department of Corrections with respect to any individual who is under the jurisdiction, supervision, or control of the entity that made the recommendation. (d) The department may impose a restriction upon the use of the license requiring that the licensee wear a medical identification bracelet when operating a motor vehicle. Medical identification bracelet restrictions must be coded on the license of the restricted operator. There is no penalty for violating this paragraph.

The possession of such an application form, whether filled out or in blank, or of a counterfeit thereof, not authorized by the department or its personnel constitutes a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (2) The department shall also maintain a record of all crash reports, abstracts of court records of convictions, and notices of revocation or suspension of a person’s driver license or driving privilege. Records of convictions of a person holding a foreign license shall be maintained by the department if the uniform traffic citation indicates an address located in this state. (3) The department shall maintain convenient records or make suitable notations, in order that the individual driver history record of each licensee is readily available for the consideration of the department upon application for renewal of a license and at other suitable times. The release by the department of the driver history record, with respect to crashes involving a licensee, shall not include any notation or record of the occurrence of a motor vehicle crash unless the licensee received a traffic citation as a direct result of the crash, and to this extent such notation or record is exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1). (4) It is unlawful for any person to falsify, alter, erase, remove, or destroy, or cause to be altered, erased, removed, or destroyed, any record maintained by the department unless the alteration, erasure, removal, or destruction has been duly authorized. (5) The department shall promulgate rules and procedures to ensure adequate safeguards and auditing capabilities to enable records of uniform traffic dispositions to be reported to the department in an automated fashion, through cooperative arrangements which may be entered into between court clerks and the department, in order to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of dispositions reported on the uniform traffic citation. Automated procedures must be subjected to tests to ensure that the integrity of the driver file is enhanced or maintained and that the intent of this chapter, as stated in s. 322.263, is given priority consideration with respect to either online data entry activities between the courts and the department or the forwarding of electronically recorded data. Departmental rules shall require that data verification be accompanied by comparison with data from uniform traffic disposition reports. (6) The department shall tabulate and publish statistics of traffic citation dispositions and provide records to court clerks for the purpose of verifying that the data was properly received and recorded. (7) The requirement for the department to keep records shall terminate upon the death of an individual licensed by the department upon notification by the Department of Health of such death. The department shall make such notification as is proper of the deletions from their records to the court clerks of the state. (8) Except as provided in chapter 119, the department may release records as provided in this section. (9) The department may, upon application, furnish to any person, from its records, a list of the names, addresses, and birth dates of the licensed drivers of the entire state or any portion thereof by age group. In addition, the department may furnish to the courts, for the purpose of establishing jury selection lists, the names, addresses, and birth dates of the persons of the entire state or any portion thereof by age group having identification cards issued by the department. Each person who requests such information shall pay a fee, set by the department, of 1 cent per name listed, except that the department shall furnish such information without charge to the courts for the purpose of jury selection or to any state agency or to any state attorney, sheriff, or chief of police. Such court, state agency, state attorney, or law enforcement agency may not sell, give away, or allow the copying of such information. Noncompliance with this prohibition shall authorize the department to charge the noncomplying court, state agency, state attorney, or law enforcement agency the appropriate fee for any subsequent lists requested. The department may adopt rules necessary to implement this subsection. (10) The department is authorized, upon application of any person and payment of the proper fees, to search and to assist such person in the search of the records of the department and make reports thereof and to make photographic copies of the departmental records and attestations thereof. (11)(a) The department may charge the following fees for the following services and documents: 1. For providing a transcript of any one individual’s driver history record or any portion thereof for the past 3 years..........$8 2. For providing a transcript of any one individual’s driver history record or any portion thereof for the past 7 years..........$10 3. For providing a certified copy of a transcript of the driver history record or any portion thereof for any one individual..........$10 4. For providing a certified photographic copy of a document, per page..........$1 5. For providing an exemplified record..........$15 6. For providing photocopies of documents, papers, letters, clearances, or license or insurance status reports, per page..........$0.50 7. For assisting persons in searching any one individual’s driver record at a terminal located at the department’s general headquarters in Tallahassee..........$2 8. For searching for any one individual’s driver history record when no record is found on file..........$2 9. For electronically searching for any one individual’s driver history record to determine if the record meets requested criteria..........$0.01 (b) The department shall furnish such information without charge to any local, state, or federal law enforcement agency or court upon proof satisfactory to the department as to the purpose of the investigation. (c) The clerks of court and tax collectors authorized under s. 322.135, may provide 3-year, 7-year, or complete driver records to any person requesting such records upon payment of the appropriate fees. In addition to the fees authorized under paragraph (a), clerks of court and tax collectors may assess the fee listed in s. 322.135(1)(c) for this service. The applicable record fees listed in paragraph (a) must be remitted to the department no later than 5 days after payment is received, unless a shorter remittance period is required by law. (12) The fees collected under this section shall be placed in the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund. (13) The department shall implement a system that allows either parent of a minor, or a guardian, or other responsible adult who signed a minor’s application for a driver license to have Internet access through a secure website to inspect the minor’s driver history record. Internet access to driver history records granted to a minor’s parents, guardian, or other responsible adult shall be furnished by the department at no fee and shall terminate when the minor attains 18 years of age. (14) The department is authorized in accordance with chapter 257 to destroy reports, records, documents, papers, and correspondence which are considered obsolete. (15) The department is authorized to photograph, microphotograph, or reproduce on film such documents, records, and reports as it may select. The photographs or microphotographs in the form of film or print of any records made in compliance with the provisions of this section shall have the same force and effect as the originals thereof and shall be treated as originals for the purpose of their admissibility in evidence. Duly certified or authenticated reproductions of such photographs or microphotographs shall be admitted in evidence equally with the original photographs or microphotographs. (16) The creation and maintenance of records by the Division of Motorist Services within the department pursuant to this chapter shall not be regarded as law enforcement functions of agency recordkeeping.

Further, any court or the office of the clerk of any court of this state which is electronically connected by a terminal device to the computer data center of the department may use as evidence in any case the information obtained by this device from the records of the department without need of such certification; however, if a genuine issue as to the authenticity of such information is raised by a party or by the court, the court may require that a record certified by the department be submitted for admission into evidence. For computer copies generated by a terminal device of a court or clerk of court, entry in a driver’s record that the notice required by s. 322.251 was given constitutes sufficient evidence that such notice was given.

(g) Each endorsement required by s. 322.57 is $7. (h) A hazardous-materials endorsement, as required by s. 322.57(1)(e), shall be set by the department by rule and must reflect the cost of the required criminal history check, including the cost of the state and federal fingerprint check, and the cost to the department of providing and issuing the license. The fee shall not exceed $100. This fee shall be deposited in the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund. The department may adopt rules to administer this section. (2) It is the duty of the director of the Division of Motorist Services to set up a division in the department with the necessary personnel to perform the necessary clerical and routine work for the department in issuing and recording applications, licenses, and certificates of eligibility, including the receiving and accounting of all license funds and their payment into the State Treasury, and other incidental clerical work connected with the administration of this chapter. The department may use such electronic, mechanical, or other devices as necessary to accomplish the purposes of this chapter. (3) The department shall prepare sufficient forms for certificates of eligibility, applications, notices, and license materials to supply all applicants for driver licenses and all renewal licenses. (4) If the department determines from its records or is otherwise satisfied that the holder of a license about to expire is entitled to have it renewed, the department shall mail a renewal notice to the licensee at his or her last known address, within 30 days before the licensee’s birthday. The licensee shall be issued a renewal license, after reexamination, if required, during the 30 days immediately preceding his or her birthday upon presenting a renewal notice, his or her current license, and the fee for renewal to the department at any driver license examining office. (5) The department shall collect and transmit all fees received by it under this section to the Chief Financial Officer to be deposited into the General Revenue Fund, and sufficient funds for the necessary expenses of the department shall be included in the appropriations act. The fees shall be used for the maintenance and operation of the department. (6) Any member of the Armed Forces or his or her spouse, daughter, son, stepdaughter, or stepson, who holds a Florida driver license and who presents an affidavit showing that he or she was out of the state due to service in the Armed Forces of the United States at the time of license expiration is exempt from paying the delinquent fee if the application for renewal is made within 15 months after the expiration of his or her license and within 90 days after the date of discharge or transfer to a military or naval establishment in this state as shown in the affidavit. However, such a person is not exempt from any reexamination requirement. (7) Any veteran honorably discharged from the Armed Forces who has been issued a valid identification card by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs in accordance with s. 295.17, has been determined by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs or its predecessor to have a 100-percent total and permanent service-connected disability rating for compensation, or has been determined to have a service-connected total and permanent disability rating of 100 percent, is in receipt of disability retirement pay from any branch of the United States Armed Services, and who is qualified to obtain a driver license under this chapter is exempt from all fees required by this section. (8) A person who applies for reinstatement following the suspension or revocation of the person’s driver license must pay a service fee of $45 following a suspension, and $75 following a revocation, which is in addition to the fee for a license. A person who applies for reinstatement of a commercial driver license following the disqualification or downgrade of the person’s privilege to operate a commercial motor vehicle must pay a service fee of $75, which is in addition to the fee for a license. The department shall collect all of these fees at the time of reinstatement. The department shall issue proper receipts for such fees and shall promptly transmit all funds received by it as follows: (a) Of the $45 fee received from a licensee for reinstatement following a suspension: 1. If the reinstatement is processed by the department, the department shall deposit $15 in the General Revenue Fund and $30 in the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund. 2. If the reinstatement is processed by the tax collector, $15, less the general revenue service charge set forth in s. 215.20(1), shall be retained by the tax collector, $15 shall be deposited into the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund, and $15 shall be deposited into the General Revenue Fund. (b) Of the $75 fee received from a licensee for reinstatement following a revocation, disqualification, or downgrade: 1. If the reinstatement is processed by the department, the department shall deposit $35 in the General Revenue Fund and $40 in the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund. 2. If the reinstatement is processed by the tax collector, $20, less the general revenue service charge set forth in s. 215.20(1), shall be retained by the tax collector, $20 shall be deposited into the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund, and $35 shall be deposited into the General Revenue Fund. If the revocation or suspension of the driver license was for a violation of s. 316.193, or for refusal to submit to a lawful breath, blood, or urine test, an additional fee of $130 must be charged. However, only one $130 fee may be collected from one person convicted of violations arising out of the same incident. The department shall collect the $130 fee and deposit the fee into the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund at the time of reinstatement of the person’s driver license, but the fee may not be collected if the suspension or revocation is overturned. If the revocation or suspension of the driver license was for a conviction for a violation of s. 817.234(8) or (9) or s. 817.505, an additional fee of $180 is imposed for each offense. The department shall collect and deposit the additional fee into the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund at the time of reinstatement of the person’s driver license. (9) An applicant: (a) Requesting a review authorized in s. 322.222, s. 322.2615, s. 322.2616, s. 322.27, s. 322.591, or s. 322.64 must pay a filing fee of $25 to be deposited into the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund.

Good cause as used herein shall be construed to mean that a licensee’s driving record, a report as provided in s. 322.126, or other evidence is sufficient to indicate that his or her driving privilege is detrimental to public safety. (2)(a) The department may require an examination or reexamination to determine the competence and driving ability of any driver causing or contributing to the cause of any crash resulting in death, personal injury, or property damage. (b) The department may, in its discretion, require any licensed driver to submit to an examination or reexamination prior to his or her normal renewal date upon receipt of a recommendation from a court having jurisdiction of traffic offenses, a law enforcement agency, or a physician stating that the driver’s ability to operate a motor vehicle safely is questionable. At the time of renewal of his or her license a driver may be required to submit to an examination or reexamination at the discretion of the examiner if the physical appearance or actions of the licensee give rise to serious doubt as to his or her ability to operate a vehicle safely. (c) If the department has reason to believe that a licensee is physically or mentally unqualified to operate a motor vehicle, it may require the licensee to submit medical reports regarding his or her physical or mental condition to the department’s medical advisory board for its review and recommendation. The submission of medical reports shall be made without expense to the state. (3) Upon the conclusion of such examination or reexamination the department shall take action as may be appropriate and may suspend or revoke the license of such person or permit him or her to retain such license, or may issue a license subject to restrictions as permitted under s. 322.16. Refusal or neglect of the licensee to submit to such examination or reexamination shall be ground for suspension or revocation of his or her license.

      "text": "322.2615 Suspension of license; right to review.— (1)(a) A law enforcement officer or correctional officer shall, on behalf of the department, suspend the driving privilege of a person who is driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle and who has an unlawful blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher, or of a person who has refused to submit to a urine test or a test of his or her breath-alcohol or blood-alcohol level. The officer shall take the person’s driver license and issue the person a 10-day temporary permit if the person is otherwise eligible for the driving privilege and shall issue the person a notice of suspension. If a blood test has been administered, the officer or the agency employing the officer shall transmit such results to the department within 5 days after receipt of the results. If the department then determines that the person had a blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher, the department shall suspend the person’s driver license pursuant to subsection (3). (b) The suspension under paragraph (a) shall be pursuant to, and the notice of suspension shall inform the driver of, the following: 1.a. The driver refused to submit to a lawful breath, blood, or urine test and his or her driving privilege is suspended for a period of 1 year for a first refusal or for a period of 18 months if his or her driving privilege has been previously suspended as a result of a refusal to submit to such a test; or b. The driver was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle and had an unlawful blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher and his or her driving privilege is suspended for a period of 6 months for a first offense or for a period of 1 year if his or her driving privilege has been previously suspended under this section. 2. The suspension period shall commence on the date of issuance of the notice of suspension. 3. The driver may request a formal or informal review of the suspension by the department within 10 days after the date of issuance of the notice of suspension or may request a review of eligibility for a restricted driving privilege under s. 322.271(7). 4. The temporary permit issued at the time of suspension expires at midnight of the 10th day following the date of issuance of the notice of suspension. 5. The driver may submit to the department any materials relevant to the suspension. (2)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (1)(a), the law enforcement officer shall forward to the department, within 5 days after issuing the notice of suspension, the driver license; an affidavit stating the officer’s grounds for belief that the person was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic beverages or chemical or controlled substances; the results of any breath or blood test or an affidavit stating that a breath, blood, or urine test was requested by a law enforcement officer or correctional officer and that the person refused to submit; the officer’s description of the person’s field sobriety test, if any; and the notice of suspension. The failure of the officer to submit materials within the 5-day period specified in this subsection and in subsection (1) does not affect the department’s ability to consider any evidence submitted at or prior to the hearing. (b) The officer may also submit a copy of the crash report and a copy of a video recording of the field sobriety test or the attempt to administer such test. Materials submitted to the department by a law enforcement agency or correctional agency shall be considered self-authenticating and shall be in the record for consideration by the hearing officer. Notwithstanding s. 316.066(4), the crash report shall be considered by the hearing officer. (3) If the department determines that the license should be suspended pursuant to this section and if the notice of suspension has not already been served upon the person by a law enforcement officer or correctional officer as provided in subsection (1), the department shall issue a notice of suspension and, unless the notice is mailed pursuant to s. 322.251, a temporary permit that expires 10 days after the date of issuance if the driver is otherwise eligible. (4) If the person whose license was suspended requests an informal review pursuant to subparagraph (1)(b)3., the department shall conduct the informal review by a hearing officer designated by the department. Such informal review hearing shall consist solely of an examination by the department of the materials submitted by a law enforcement officer or correctional officer and by the person whose license was suspended, and the presence of an officer or witness is not required. (5) After completion of the informal review, notice of the department’s decision sustaining, amending, or invalidating the suspension of the driver license of the person whose license was suspended must be provided to such person. Such notice must be mailed to the person at the last known address shown on the department’s records, or to the address provided in the law enforcement officer’s report if such address differs from the address of record, within 21 days after the expiration of the temporary permit issued pursuant to subsection (1) or subsection (3). (6)(a) If the person whose license was suspended requests a formal review, the department must schedule a hearing within 30 days after such request is received by the department and must notify the person of the date, time, and place of the hearing. (b) Such formal review hearing shall be held before a hearing officer designated by the department, and the hearing officer shall be authorized to administer oaths, examine witnesses and take testimony, receive relevant evidence, issue subpoenas for the officers and witnesses identified in documents provided under paragraph (2)(a), regulate the course and conduct of the hearing, question witnesses, and make a ruling on the suspension. The hearing officer may conduct hearings using communications technology. The party requesting the presence of a witness shall be responsible for the payment of any witness fees and for notifying in writing the state attorney’s office in the appropriate circuit of the issuance of the subpoena. If the person who requests a formal review hearing fails to appear and the hearing officer finds such failure to be without just cause, the right to a formal hearing is waived and the suspension shall be sustained. (c) The failure of a subpoenaed witness to appear at the formal review hearing is not grounds to invalidate the suspension. If a witness fails to appear, a party may seek enforcement of a subpoena under paragraph (b) by filing a petition for enforcement in the circuit court of the judicial circuit in which the person failing to comply with the subpoena resides or by filing a motion for enforcement in any criminal court case resulting from the driving or actual physical control of a motor vehicle that gave rise to the suspension under this section. A failure to comply with an order of the court shall result in a finding of contempt of court. However, a person is not in contempt while a subpoena is being challenged. (d) The department must, within 7 working days after a formal review hearing, send notice to the person of the hearing officer’s decision as to whether sufficient cause exists to sustain, amend, or invalidate the suspension. (7) In a formal review hearing under subsection (6) or an informal review hearing under subsection (4), the hearing officer shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether sufficient cause exists to sustain, amend, or invalidate the suspension. The scope of the review shall be limited to the following issues: (a) If the license was suspended for driving with an unlawful blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher: 1. Whether the law enforcement officer had probable cause to believe that the person whose license was suspended was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle in this state while under the influence of alcoholic beverages or chemical or controlled substances. 2. Whether the person whose license was suspended had an unlawful blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher as provided in s. 316.193. (b) If the license was suspended for refusal to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test: 1. Whether the law enforcement officer had probable cause to believe that the person whose license was suspended was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle in this state while under the influence of alcoholic beverages or chemical or controlled substances. 2. Whether the person whose license was suspended refused to submit to any such test after being requested to do so by a law enforcement officer or correctional officer. 3. Whether the person whose license was suspended was told that if he or she refused to submit to such test his or her privilege to operate a motor vehicle would be suspended for a period of 1 year or, in the case of a second or subsequent refusal, for a period of 18 months. (8) Based on the determination of the hearing officer pursuant to subsection (7) for both informal hearings under subsection (4) and formal hearings under subsection (6), the department shall: (a) Sustain the suspension of the person’s driving privilege for a period of 1 year for a first refusal, or for a period of 18 months if the driving privilege of such person has been previously suspended as a result of a refusal to submit to such tests, if the person refused to submit to a lawful breath, blood, or urine test. The suspension period commences on the date of issuance of the notice of suspension. (b) Sustain the suspension of the person’s driving privilege for a period of 6 months for a blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher, or for a period of 1 year if the driving privilege of such person has been previously suspended under this section as a result of driving with an unlawful alcohol level. The suspension period commences on the date of issuance of the notice of suspension. (9) A request for a formal review hearing or an informal review hearing shall not stay the suspension of the person’s driver license. If the department fails to schedule the formal review hearing within 30 days after receipt of the request therefor, the department shall invalidate the suspension. If the scheduled hearing is continued at the department’s initiative or the driver enforces the subpoena as provided in subsection (6), the department shall issue a temporary driving permit that shall be valid until the hearing is conducted if the person is otherwise eligible for the driving privilege. Such permit may not be issued to a person who sought and obtained a continuance of the hearing. The permit issued under this subsection shall authorize driving for business or employment use only. (10) A person whose driver license is suspended under subsection (1) or subsection (3) may apply for issuance of a license for business or employment purposes only if the person is otherwise eligible for the driving privilege pursuant to s. 322.271. (a) If the suspension of the driver license of the person for failure to submit to a breath, urine, or blood test is sustained, the person is not eligible to receive a license for business or employment purposes only, pursuant to s. 322.271, until 90 days have elapsed after the expiration of the last temporary permit issued. If the driver is not issued a 10-day permit pursuant to this section or s. 322.64 because he or she is ineligible for the permit and the suspension for failure to submit to a breath, urine, or blood test is not invalidated by the department, the driver is not eligible to receive a business or employment license pursuant to s. 322.271 until 90 days have elapsed from the date of the suspension. (b) If the suspension of the driver license of the person relating to unlawful blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher is sustained, the person is not eligible to receive a license for business or employment purposes only pursuant to s. 322.271 until 30 days have elapsed after the expiration of the last temporary permit issued. If the driver is not issued a 10-day permit pursuant to this section or s. 322.64 because he or she is ineligible for the permit and the suspension relating to unlawful blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher is not invalidated by the department, the driver is not eligible to receive a business or employment license pursuant to s. 322.271 until 30 days have elapsed from the date of the suspension. (11) The formal review hearing may be conducted upon a review of the reports of a law enforcement officer or a correctional officer, including documents relating to the administration of a breath test or blood test or the refusal to take either test or the refusal to take a urine test. However, as provided in subsection (6), the driver may subpoena the officer or any person who administered or analyzed a breath or blood test. If the arresting officer or the breath technician fails to appear pursuant to a subpoena as provided in subsection (6), the department shall invalidate the suspension. (12) The formal review hearing and the informal review hearing are exempt from the provisions of chapter 120. The department may adopt rules for the conduct of reviews under this section. (13) A person may appeal any decision of the department sustaining a suspension of his or her driver license by a petition for writ of certiorari to the circuit court in the county wherein such person resides or wherein a formal or informal review was conducted pursuant to s. 322.31. However, an appeal shall not stay the suspension. A law enforcement agency may appeal any decision of the department invalidating a suspension by a petition for writ of certiorari to the circuit court in the county wherein a formal or informal review was conducted. This subsection shall not be construed to provide for a de novo review. (14)(a) The decision of the department under this section or any circuit court review thereof may not be considered in any trial for a violation of s. 316.193, and a written statement submitted by a person in his or her request for departmental review under this section may not be admitted into evidence against him or her in any such trial. (b) The disposition of any related criminal proceedings does not affect a suspension for refusal to submit to a blood, breath, or urine test imposed under this section. (15) If the department suspends a person’s license under s. 322.2616, it may not also suspend the person’s license under this section for the same episode that was the basis for the suspension under s. 322.2616. (16) The department shall invalidate a suspension for driving with an unlawful blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level imposed under this section if the suspended person is found not guilty at trial of an underlying violation of s. 316.193.

      "text": "322.2715 Ignition interlock device.— (1) Before issuing a permanent or restricted driver license under this chapter, the department shall require the placement of a department-approved ignition interlock device for any person convicted of committing an offense of driving under the influence as specified in subsection (3), except that consideration may be given to those individuals having a documented medical condition that would prohibit the device from functioning normally. If a medical waiver has been granted for a convicted person seeking a restricted license, the convicted person shall not be entitled to a restricted license until the required ignition interlock device installation period under subsection (3) expires, in addition to the time requirements under s. 322.271. If a medical waiver has been approved for a convicted person seeking permanent reinstatement of the driver license, the convicted person must be restricted to an employment-purposes-only license and be supervised by a licensed DUI program until the required ignition interlock device installation period under subsection (3) expires. An interlock device shall be placed on all vehicles that are individually or jointly leased or owned and routinely operated by the convicted person. (2) For purposes of this section, any conviction for a violation of s. 316.193, a previous conviction for a violation of former s. 316.1931, or a conviction outside this state for driving under the influence, driving while intoxicated, driving with an unlawful blood-alcohol level, or any other similar alcohol-related or drug-related traffic offense is a conviction of driving under the influence. (3) If the person is convicted of: (a) A first offense of driving under the influence under s. 316.193 and has an unlawful blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level as specified in s. 316.193(1), the ignition interlock device may be installed for at least 6 continuous months. (b) A first offense of driving under the influence under s. 316.193 and has an unlawful blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level as specified in s. 316.193(4), or if a person is convicted of a violation of s. 316.193 and was at the time of the offense accompanied in the vehicle by a person younger than 18 years of age, the person shall have the ignition interlock device installed for at least 6 continuous months for the first offense and for at least 2 continuous years for a second offense. (c) A second offense of driving under the influence, the ignition interlock device shall be installed for a period of at least 1 continuous year. (d) A third offense of driving under the influence which occurs within 10 years after a prior conviction for a violation of s. 316.193, the ignition interlock device shall be installed for a period of at least 2 continuous years. (e) A third offense of driving under the influence which occurs more than 10 years after the date of a prior conviction, the ignition interlock device shall be installed for a period of at least 2 continuous years. (f) A fourth or subsequent offense of driving under the influence, the ignition interlock device shall be installed for a period of at least 5 years. (4) If the court fails to order the mandatory placement of the ignition interlock device or fails to order for the applicable period the mandatory placement of an ignition interlock device under s. 316.193 or s. 316.1937 at the time of imposing sentence or within 30 days thereafter, the department shall immediately require that the ignition interlock device be installed as provided in this section, except that consideration may be given to those individuals having a documented medical condition that would prohibit the device from functioning normally. This subsection applies to the reinstatement of the driving privilege following a revocation, suspension, or cancellation that is based upon a conviction for the offense of driving under the influence which occurs on or after July 1, 2005. (5) In addition to any fees authorized by rule for the installation and maintenance of the ignition interlock device, the authorized installer of the device shall collect and remit $12 for each installation to the department, which shall be deposited into the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund to be used for the operation of the Ignition Interlock Device Program.

      "text": "322.28 Period of suspension or revocation.— (1) Unless otherwise provided by this section, the department shall not suspend a license for a period of more than 1 year and, upon revoking a license, in any case except in a prosecution for the offense of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic beverages, chemical substances as set forth in s. 877.111, or controlled substances, shall not in any event grant a new license until the expiration of 1 year after such revocation. (2) In a prosecution for a violation of s. 316.193 or former s. 316.1931, the following provisions apply: (a) Upon conviction of the driver, the court, along with imposing sentence, shall revoke the driver license or driving privilege of the person so convicted, effective on the date of conviction, and shall prescribe the period of such revocation in accordance with the following provisions: 1. Upon a first conviction for a violation of the provisions of s. 316.193, except a violation resulting in death, the driver license or driving privilege shall be revoked for at least 180 days but not more than 1 year. 2. Upon a second conviction for an offense that occurs within a period of 5 years after the date of a prior conviction for a violation of the provisions of s. 316.193 or former s. 316.1931 or a combination of such sections, the driver license or driving privilege shall be revoked for at least 5 years. 3. Upon a third conviction for an offense that occurs within a period of 10 years after the date of a prior conviction for the violation of the provisions of s. 316.193 or former s. 316.1931 or a combination of such sections, the driver license or driving privilege shall be revoked for at least 10 years. For the purposes of this paragraph, a previous conviction outside this state for driving under the influence, driving while intoxicated, driving with an unlawful blood-alcohol level, or any other alcohol-related or drug-related traffic offense similar to the offense of driving under the influence as proscribed by s. 316.193 will be considered a previous conviction for violation of s. 316.193, and a conviction for violation of former s. 316.028, former s. 316.1931, or former s. 860.01 is considered a conviction for violation of s. 316.193. (b) If the period of revocation was not specified by the court at the time of imposing sentence or within 30 days thereafter, and is not otherwise specified by law, the department shall forthwith revoke the driver license or driving privilege for the maximum period applicable under paragraph (a) for a first conviction and for the minimum period applicable under paragraph (a) for any subsequent convictions. The driver may, within 30 days after such revocation by the department, petition the court for further hearing on the period of revocation, and the court may reopen the case and determine the period of revocation within the limits specified in paragraph (a). (c) The forfeiture of bail bond, not vacated within 20 days, in any prosecution for the offense of driving while under the influence of alcoholic beverages, chemical substances, or controlled substances to the extent of depriving the defendant of his or her normal faculties shall be deemed equivalent to a conviction for the purposes of this paragraph, and the department shall forthwith revoke the defendant’s driver license or driving privilege for the maximum period applicable under paragraph (a) for a first conviction and for the minimum period applicable under paragraph (a) for a second or subsequent conviction; however, if the defendant is later convicted of the charge, the period of revocation imposed by the department for such conviction shall not exceed the difference between the applicable maximum for a first conviction or minimum for a second or subsequent conviction and the revocation period under this subsection that has actually elapsed; upon conviction of such charge, the court may impose revocation for a period of time as specified in paragraph (a). This paragraph does not apply if an appropriate motion contesting the forfeiture is filed within the 20-day period. (d) The court shall permanently revoke the driver license or driving privilege of a person who has been convicted four times for violation of s. 316.193 or former s. 316.1931 or a combination of such sections. The court shall permanently revoke the driver license or driving privilege of any person who has been convicted of DUI manslaughter in violation of s. 316.193. If the court has not permanently revoked such driver license or driving privilege within 30 days after imposing sentence, the department shall permanently revoke the driver license or driving privilege pursuant to this paragraph. No driver license or driving privilege may be issued or granted to any such person. This paragraph applies only if at least one of the convictions for violation of s. 316.193 or former s. 316.1931 was for a violation that occurred after July 1, 1982. For the purposes of this paragraph, a conviction for violation of former s. 316.028, former s. 316.1931, or former s. 860.01 is also considered a conviction for violation of s. 316.193. Also, a conviction of driving under the influence, driving while intoxicated, driving with an unlawful blood-alcohol level, or any other similar alcohol-related or drug-related traffic offense outside this state is considered a conviction for the purposes of this paragraph. (e) Convictions that occur on the same date resulting from separate offense dates shall be treated as separate convictions, and the offense that occurred earlier will be deemed a prior conviction for the purposes of this section. (3) The court shall permanently revoke the driver license or driving privilege of a person who has been convicted of murder resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle. No driver license or driving privilege may be issued or granted to any such person. (4)(a) Upon a conviction for a violation of s. 316.193(3)(c)2., involving serious bodily injury, a conviction of manslaughter resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle, or a conviction of vehicular homicide, the court shall revoke the driver license of the person convicted for a minimum period of 3 years. If a conviction under s. 316.193(3)(c)2., involving serious bodily injury, is also a subsequent conviction as described under paragraph (2)(a), the court shall revoke the driver license or driving privilege of the person convicted for the period applicable as provided in paragraph (2)(a) or paragraph (2)(d). (b) Upon a conviction for a violation of s. 316.027(2)(a), (b), or (c) involving injury, serious bodily injury, or death, the court shall revoke the driver license of the person convicted for a minimum period of 3 years. (c) If the period of revocation was not specified by the court at the time of imposing sentence or within 30 days thereafter, the department shall revoke the driver license for the minimum period applicable under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) or, for a subsequent conviction, for the minimum period applicable under paragraph (2)(a) or paragraph (2)(d). (5) A court may not stay the administrative suspension of a driving privilege under s. 322.2615 or s. 322.2616 during judicial review of the departmental order that resulted in such suspension, and a suspension or revocation of a driving privilege may not be stayed upon an appeal of the conviction or order that resulted in the suspension or revocation. (6) In a prosecution for a violation of s. 316.172(1), and upon a showing of the department’s records that the licensee has received a second conviction within 5 years following the date of a prior conviction of s. 316.172(1), the department shall, upon direction of the court, suspend the driver license of the person convicted for a period of at least 90 days but not more than 6 months. (7) Following a second or subsequent violation of s. 796.07(2)(f) which involves a motor vehicle and which results in any judicial disposition other than acquittal or dismissal, in addition to any other sentence imposed, the court shall revoke the person’s driver license or driving privilege, effective upon the date of the disposition, for a period of at least 1 year. A person sentenced under this subsection may request a hearing under s. 322.271. (8) The court shall permanently revoke the commercial driver license of a person who is convicted of, or has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, regardless of whether adjudication is withheld, any felony involving human trafficking under state or federal law which involves the use of a commercial motor vehicle. If the court has not permanently revoked such driver license or driving privilege within 30 days after imposing a sentence, the department must permanently revoke the driver license or driving privilege pursuant to this section.

      "text": "322.44 Driver License Compact.—The Driver License Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows: ARTICLE I FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.— (1) The party states find that: (a) The safety of their streets and highways is materially affected by the degree of compliance with state laws and local ordinances relating to the operation of motor vehicles; (b) Violation of such a law or ordinance is evidence that the violator engages in conduct which is likely to endanger the safety of persons and property; (c) The continuance in force of a license to drive is predicated upon compliance with laws and ordinances relating to the operation of motor vehicles, in whichever jurisdiction the vehicle is operated. (2) It is the policy of each of the party states to: (a) Promote compliance with the laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles by their operators in each of the jurisdictions where such operators drive motor vehicles; (b) Make the reciprocal recognition of licenses to drive and eligibility therefor more just and equitable by considering the overall compliance with motor vehicle laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license by reason of which the licensee is authorized or permitted to operate a motor vehicle in any of the party states. ARTICLE II DEFINITIONS.—As used in this compact: (1) “State” means a state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. (2) “Home state” means the state which has issued and has the power to suspend or revoke the use of the license or permit to operate a motor vehicle. (3) “Conviction” means a conviction of any offense related to the use or operation of a motor vehicle which is prohibited by state law, municipal ordinance, or administrative rule or regulation, or a forfeiture of bail, bond, or other security deposited to secure appearance by a person charged with having committed any such offense, and which conviction or forfeiture is required to be reported to the licensing authority. ARTICLE III REPORTS OF CONVICTION.—The licensing authority of a party state shall report each conviction of a person from another party state occurring within its jurisdiction to the licensing authority of the home state of the licensee. Such report shall clearly identify the person convicted; describe the violation specifying the section of the statute, code, or ordinance violated; identify the court in which action was taken; indicate whether a plea of guilty or not guilty was entered or the conviction was a result of the forfeiture of bail, bond, or other security; and shall include any special findings made in connection therewith. ARTICLE IV EFFECT OF CONVICTION.— (1) The licensing authority in the home state, for the purposes of suspension, revocation, or limitation of the license to operate a motor vehicle, shall give the same effect to the conduct reported, pursuant to article III, as it would if such conduct had occurred in the home state, in the case of convictions for: (a) Manslaughter or negligent homicide resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle, as provided by ss. 316.193 and 322.26; (b) Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic beverages or a narcotic drug, or under the influence of any other drug to a degree which renders the driver incapable of safely driving a motor vehicle, as provided by s. 316.193; (c) Any felony in the commission of which a motor vehicle is used, as provided by s. 322.26; or (d) Failure to stop and render aid in the event of a motor vehicle crash resulting in the death or personal injury of another, as provided by s. 322.26. (2) As to other convictions, reported pursuant to article III, the licensing authority in the home state shall give such effect to the conduct as is provided by the laws of the home state. ARTICLE V APPLICATIONS FOR NEW LICENSES.—Upon application for a license to drive, the licensing authority in a party state shall ascertain whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license to drive issued by any other party state. The licensing authority in the state where application is made shall not issue a license to drive to the applicant if: (1) The applicant has held such a license, but the same has been suspended by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if such suspension period has not terminated. (2) The applicant has held such a license, but the same has been revoked by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if such revocation has not terminated, except that after the expiration of 1 year from the date the license was revoked, such person may make application for a new license if permitted by law. The licensing authority may refuse to issue a license to any such applicant if, after investigation, the licensing authority determines that it will not be safe to grant to such person the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on the public highways. (3) The applicant is the holder of a license to drive issued by another party state and currently in force unless the applicant surrenders such license. ARTICLE VI APPLICABILITY OF OTHER LAWS.—Except as expressly required by provisions of this compact, nothing contained herein shall be construed to affect the right of any party state to apply any of its other laws relating to licenses to drive to any person or circumstance, nor to invalidate or prevent any driver license agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party state and a nonparty state.

      "text": "322.50 Nonresident Violator Compact.—The Nonresident Violator Compact, hereinafter called “the compact,” is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows: ARTICLE I FINDINGS, DECLARATION OF POLICY, AND PURPOSE.— (1) The party jurisdictions find that: (a) In most instances, a motorist who is cited for a traffic violation in a jurisdiction other than his or her home jurisdiction must post collateral or bond to secure appearance for trial at a later date or, if unable to post collateral or bond, is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted or is taken directly to court for trial to be held. In some instances, the motorist’s driver license is deposited as collateral to be returned after he or she has complied with the terms of the citation. The purpose of the practices described is to obviate the difficulty of ensuring compliance with the terms of a traffic citation by the motorist who, if permitted to continue on his or her way after receiving the traffic citation, could return to his or her home jurisdiction and disregard his or her duty under the terms of the traffic citation. (b) A motorist receiving a traffic citation in his or her home jurisdiction is permitted, except for certain violations, to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to immediately continue on his or her way after promising or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation. (c) The practices described in paragraph (a) cause unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the motorist who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay the fine and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some arrangement can be made. (d) The deposit of a driver license as a bail bond, as described in paragraph (a), is viewed with disfavor. (e) The practices described herein consume an undue amount of law enforcement time. (2) It is the policy of the party jurisdictions to: (a) Seek compliance with the laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles in each of the jurisdictions. (b) Allow a motorist to accept a traffic citation for certain violations and to proceed on his or her way without delay whether or not the motorist is a resident of the jurisdiction in which the citation was issued. (c) Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the jurisdictions for obtaining compliance with the terms of a traffic citation issued in one jurisdiction to a resident of another jurisdiction. (d) Maximize effective utilization of law enforcement personnel and assist court systems in the efficient disposition of traffic violations. (3) The purposes of this compact are to: (a) Provide a means through which the party jurisdictions may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate the policies enumerated in subsection (2) in a uniform and orderly manner. (b) Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of traffic violators operating within party jurisdictions in recognition of the motorist’s right to due process and the sovereign status of a party jurisdiction. ARTICLE II DEFINITIONS.—As used in this compact, the following words have the meanings indicated, unless the context requires otherwise: (1) “Jurisdiction” means a state, territory, or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; or a Canadian province. (2) “Citation” means any summons, ticket, or other official document issued by a police officer for a traffic violation, containing an order which requires the motorist to respond. (3) “Home jurisdiction” means the jurisdiction which issued the driver license of the traffic violator. (4) “Driver license” means any license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle issued under the laws of the home jurisdiction. (5) “Collateral” means any cash or other security deposited to secure an appearance for trial following the issuance by a police officer of a citation for a traffic violation. (6) “Personal recognizance” means an agreement by a motorist made at the time of the issuance of a traffic citation that he or she will comply with the terms of that traffic citation. (7) “Court” means a court of law or a traffic tribunal. (8) “Motorist” means a driver of a motor vehicle operating in a party jurisdiction other than the home jurisdiction. (9) “Issuing jurisdiction” means the jurisdiction in which the traffic citation was issued to the motorist. (10) “Police officer” means any individual authorized by the party jurisdiction to issue a citation for a traffic violation. (11) “Terms of the citation” means those options expressly stated upon the citation. (12) “Comply with terms of the citation” means to appear in court or pay the fine and costs specified in the citation or to fulfill an obligation arising from any other option expressly stated upon the citation. ARTICLE III PROCEDURE FOR ISSUING JURISDICTION.— (1) When issuing a citation for a traffic violation, a police officer shall issue the citation to a motorist who possesses a driver license issued by a party jurisdiction and shall not, subject to the exceptions noted in subsection (2) of this Article, require the motorist to post collateral to secure appearance, if the officer receives the motorist’s personal recognizance that he or she will comply with the terms of the citation. (2) A personal recognizance is acceptable only if not prohibited by law. If a mandatory appearance is required, it should take place immediately following the issuance of the citation. (3) Upon the failure of a motorist to comply with the terms of a traffic citation, the appropriate official shall report the failure to comply to the licensing authority of the jurisdiction in which the traffic citation was issued. The report shall be made in accordance with procedures specified by the issuing jurisdiction and shall contain information as specified in the Compact Manual as minimum requirements for effective processing by the home jurisdiction. (4) Upon receipt of the report, the licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction shall transmit to the licensing authority in the home jurisdiction of the motorist the information in a form and content as contained in the Compact Manual. (5) The licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction need not suspend the driving privilege of a motorist for whom a report has been transmitted. (6) The licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction shall not transmit a report on a violation if the date of transmission is more than 6 months after the date on which the traffic citation was issued. (7) The licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction shall not transmit a report on a violation if the date of issuance of the citation predates the most recent of the effective dates of entry for the two jurisdictions affected. ARTICLE IV PROCEDURE FOR HOME JURISDICTION.— (1) Upon receipt of a report of a failure to comply from the licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction, the licensing authority of the home jurisdiction shall notify the motorist and initiate a suspension action, in accordance with the procedures of the home jurisdiction, to suspend the motorist’s driver license until satisfactory evidence of compliance with the terms of the traffic citation has been furnished to the licensing authority of the home jurisdiction. (2) The licensing authority of the home jurisdiction shall maintain a record of actions taken and make reports to issuing jurisdictions as provided in the Compact Manual. ARTICLE V APPLICABILITY OF OTHER LAWS.—Except as expressly required by provisions of this compact, nothing contained herein shall be construed to affect the right of any party jurisdiction to apply any of its other laws relating to licenses to drive to any person or circumstance or to invalidate or prevent any driver license agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party jurisdiction and a nonparty jurisdiction. ARTICLE VI COMPACT ADMINISTRATOR PROCEDURES.— (1) For the purpose of administering the provisions of this compact and to serve as a governing body for the resolution of all matters relating to the operation of this compact, the Board of Compact Administrators is created. The board shall be composed of one representative from each party jurisdiction, to be known as the “compact administrator.” The compact administrator shall be appointed by the executive of the jurisdiction and will serve and be subject to removal in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction he or she represents. A compact administrator may provide for the discharge of his or her duties and the performance of his or her functions as a board member by an alternate. An alternate may not be entitled to serve unless written notification of his or her identity has been given to the board. (2) Each member of the Board of Compact Administrators shall be entitled to one vote. No action of the board shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of votes on the board are cast in favor of such action. Action by the board shall be taken only at a meeting at which a majority of the party jurisdictions are represented. (3) The board shall elect annually, from its membership, a chair and a vice chair. (4) The board shall adopt bylaws, not inconsistent with the provisions of this compact or the laws of a party jurisdiction, for the conduct of its business and shall have the power to amend and rescind its bylaws. (5) The board may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this compact any and all donations, grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services, conditional or otherwise, from any jurisdiction, the United States, or any other governmental agency and may receive, utilize, and dispose of the same. (6) The board may contract with, or accept services or personnel from, any governmental or intergovernmental agency, person, firm, or corporation or any private, nonprofit organization or institution. (7) The board shall formulate all necessary procedures and develop uniform forms and documents for administering the provisions of this compact. All procedures and forms adopted pursuant to board action shall be contained in the Compact Manual. ARTICLE VII ENTRY INTO COMPACT AND WITHDRAWAL.— (1) This compact shall become effective when it has been adopted by at least two jurisdictions. (2)(a) Entry into the compact shall be made by a resolution of ratification executed by the authorized officials of the applying jurisdiction and submitted to the chair of the board. (b) The resolution shall be in a form and content as provided in the Compact Manual and shall include statements that in substance are as follows: 1. A citation of the authority by which the jurisdiction is empowered to become a party to this compact. 2. An agreement to comply with the terms and provisions of the compact. 3. A statement that compact entry is with all jurisdictions then party to the compact and with any jurisdiction that legally becomes a party to the compact. (c) The effective date of entry shall be specified by the applying jurisdiction, but it shall not be less than 60 days after notice has been given by the chair of the Board of Compact Administrators or by the secretariat of the board to each party jurisdiction that the resolution from the applying jurisdiction has been received. (3) A party jurisdiction may withdraw from this compact by official written notice to the other party jurisdictions, but a withdrawal shall not take effect until 90 days after notice of withdrawal is given. The notice shall be given to the compact administrator of each member jurisdiction. No withdrawal shall affect the validity of this compact as to the remaining party jurisdictions. ARTICLE VIII EXCEPTIONS.—The provisions of this compact shall not apply to parking or standing violations, highway weight limit violations, and violations of law governing the transportation of hazardous materials. ARTICLE IX AMENDMENTS TO THE COMPACT.— (1) This compact may be amended from time to time. Amendments shall be presented in resolution form to the chair of the Board of Compact Administrators and may be initiated by one or more party jurisdictions. (2) Adoption of an amendment shall require endorsement of all party jurisdictions and shall become effective 30 days after the date of the last endorsement. (3) Failure of a party jurisdiction to respond to the compact chair within 120 days after receipt of the proposed amendment shall constitute endorsement. ARTICLE X CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY.—This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes stated herein. The provisions of this compact shall be severable; and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party jurisdiction or of the United States or if the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the compact shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any jurisdiction party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining jurisdictions and in full force and effect as to the jurisdiction affected as to all severable matters.

(2) Any test given by a third-party administrator under contract with the state must be the same as the test that the state would otherwise give. (3) The contract or agreement between the third-party administrator and the state must, at a minimum, contain provisions that: (a) Allow the Federal Highway Administration, or its representative, to conduct random examinations, inspections, and audits without prior notice; (b) Allow the department, or its representative, to conduct random examinations, inspections, and audits without prior notice; (c) Allow the department to conduct onsite inspections at least annually; (d) Require that all third-party administrators meet the same qualifications and education and training standards as department examiners, to the extent necessary to conduct the written and driving skills portions of the examination; (e) Allow the department to test, at least annually, a random sample of the drivers approved by the third party for licensure; and (f) Reserve to the department the right to take prompt and appropriate action against a third party that fails to comply with state or federal standards for a driver license examination or that fails to comply with any terms of the contract. (4) The department shall monitor examinations administered under the authority of this section. Such monitoring shall, at a minimum, satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (3)(b), (c), (d), and (e). (5) An applicant who successfully completes a written and driving skills examination administered by an authorized third-party administrator shall provide evidence of such fact to the department prior to licensure. (6) To qualify as a third-party administrator, a person, an entity of state government, a subdivision of state government, a public or private corporation, a school, or an entity of a local government must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the department that it has the necessary qualified personnel, equipment, and facilities to administer the written and driving skills portions of the driver license examination. (7) This section does not exempt a person from the requirement that he or she successfully complete any other test required for licensure under this chapter. (8) The department shall contract with providers of approved online traffic law and substance abuse education courses to serve as third-party providers to conduct online, on behalf of the department, examinations required pursuant to ss. 322.12 and 322.1615 to applicants for Class E learner’s driver licenses. (a) The online testing program shall: 1. Use personal questions before the examination, which the applicant is required to answer during the examination, to strengthen test security to deter fraud; 2. Require, before the start of the examination, the applicant’s parent, guardian, or other responsible adult who meets the requirements of s. 322.09 to provide the third-party administrator with his or her driver license number and to certify that the parent, guardian, or responsible adult will monitor the applicant during the examination; and 3. Require, before issuance by the department of a learner’s driver license to an applicant who has passed an online examination, the applicant’s parent, guardian, or other responsible adult who meets the requirements of s. 322.09 to certify to the department that he or she monitored the applicant during the online examination. This certification shall be similar to the certification required by s. 322.05(3). This subsection does not preclude the department from continuing to provide written examinations at driver license facilities. (b) All data regarding an applicant’s completion of the examinations required in ss. 322.12 and 322.1615 must be submitted to the department electronically in a format specified by the department. This shall be the official documentation for the completion of the examination. A third-party provider that is found to be in violation of this paragraph is automatically ineligible to provide online testing on behalf of the department for a minimum of 1 year.
