      "text": "445.006 State plan for workforce development.— (1) STATE PLAN.—The state board, in conjunction with state and local partners in the workforce system, shall develop a state plan that produces an educated and skilled workforce. The state plan must consist of strategic and operational planning elements. The state plan shall be submitted by the Governor to the United States Department of Labor pursuant to the requirements of Pub. L. No. 113-128. (2) STRATEGIC PLANNING ELEMENTS.—The state board, in conjunction with state and local partners in the workforce development system, shall develop strategic planning elements, pursuant to Pub. L. No. 113-128, Title I, s. 102, for the state plan. (a) The strategic planning elements of the state plan must include, but need not be limited to, strategies for: 1. Fulfilling the workforce system goals and strategies prescribed in s. 445.004. 2. Aggregating, integrating, and leveraging workforce system resources. 3. Coordinating the activities of federal, state, and local workforce system partners. 4. Addressing the workforce needs of small businesses. 5. Fostering the participation of rural communities and distressed urban cores in the workforce system. (b) The strategic planning elements must include criteria for allocating workforce resources to local workforce development boards. With respect to allocating funds to serve customers of the welfare transition program, such criteria may include weighting factors that indicate the relative degree of difficulty associated with securing and retaining employment placements for specific subsets of the welfare transition caseload. (c) The state plan must describe: 1. How the activities will be carried out by the respective core programs to implement the strategy and how the activities will be aligned across the programs and among the entities administering the programs, including using coenrollment and other strategies. 2. How the activities will be aligned with other activities that are provided under employment; training; education, including career and technical education; and human services programs that are not covered by the state plan, as appropriate, to avoid duplication and assure coordination. 3. How the entities carrying out the respective core programs will coordinate activities and provide comprehensive, high-quality services, including supportive services, to individuals. 4. How the state’s strategy to engage Florida College System institutions and local career and technical education schools as partners in the workforce development system will enable the state to leverage other federal, state, and local investments and increase access to workforce development programs at those institutions. 5. How the activities will be coordinated with economic development strategies. 6. How the state’s strategy will improve access to activities leading to a state approved recognized postsecondary credential, including a credential that is an industry recognized certificate or certification that is portable and builds on additional education or training. (3) OPERATIONAL PLANNING ELEMENTS.—The state board, in conjunction with state and local partners in the workforce system, shall develop operational planning elements, pursuant to Pub. L. No. 113-128, Title I, s. 102, for the state plan. (4) WAIVERS.—The department shall prepare a federal waiver to be submitted by the Governor to the United States Department of Labor that: (a) Allows the state board to fulfill the roles and responsibilities of local workforce development boards or that reduces the number of local workforce development boards based on population size and commuting patterns in order to: 1. Eliminate multiple layers of administrative entities to improve coordination of the workforce development system. 2. Establish consistent eligibility standards across the state to improve the accountability of workforce related programs. 3. Provide greater flexibility in the allocation of resources to maximize the funds directed to training and business services. (b) Allows the Governor to reallocate funds among local areas that have a demonstrated need for additional funding and programmatic outcomes that will maximize the use of the additional funds to serve low-income individuals, public assistance recipients, dislocated workers, and unemployment insurance claimants.

      "text": "445.007 Local workforce development boards.— (1) One local workforce development board shall be appointed in each designated service delivery area and shall serve as the local workforce development board pursuant to Pub. L. No. 113-128. The membership of the local board must be consistent with Pub. L. No. 113-128, Title I, s. 107(b). If a public education or training provider is represented on the local board, a representative of a private education provider must also be appointed to the local board. The state board may waive this requirement if requested by a local board if it is demonstrated that such representatives do not exist in the region. The importance of minority and gender representation shall be considered when making appointments to the local board. The local board, its committees, subcommittees, and subdivisions, and other units of the workforce system, including units that may consist in whole or in part of local governmental units, may use any method of telecommunications to conduct meetings, including establishing a quorum through telecommunications, provided that the public is given proper notice of the telecommunications meeting and reasonable access to observe and, when appropriate, participate. Local boards are subject to chapters 119 and 286 and s. 24, Art. I of the State Constitution. Each member of a local board who is not otherwise required to file a full and public disclosure of financial interests under s. 8, Art. II of the State Constitution or s. 112.3144 shall file a statement of financial interests under s. 112.3145. The executive director or designated person responsible for the operational and administrative functions of the local board who is not otherwise required to file a full and public disclosure of financial interests under s. 8, Art. II of the State Constitution or s. 112.3144 shall file a statement of financial interests under s. 112.3145. The local board’s website, or the department’s website if the local board does not maintain a website, must inform the public that each disclosure or statement has been filed with the Commission on Ethics and provide information how each disclosure or statement may be reviewed. The notice to the public must remain on the website throughout the term of office or employment of the filer and until 1 year after the term on the local board or employment ends. (2)(a) The local workforce development board shall elect a chair from among the representatives described in Pub. L. No. 113-128, Title I, s. 107(b)(2)(A) to serve for a term of no more than 2 years who may not serve more than two terms as chair. Members of a local workforce development board shall serve staggered terms and may not serve for more than 8 consecutive years, unless such member is a representative of a governmental entity. Service in a term of office which commenced before July 1, 2021, does not count toward the 8-year limitation. (b) The Governor may remove a member of the local board, the executive director of the local board, or the designated person responsible for the operational and administrative functions of the local board for cause. (c) The chief elected official for the local board may remove a member of the local board, the executive director of the local board, or the designated person responsible for the operational and administrative functions of the local board for cause. (3) The department shall assign staff to meet with each local workforce development board annually to review the local board’s performance as determined under s. 445.004(8) and to certify that the local board is in compliance with applicable state and federal law. (4) In addition to the duties and functions specified by the state board and by the interlocal agreement approved by the local county or city governing bodies, the local workforce development board shall have the following responsibilities: (a) Develop, submit, ratify, or amend the local plan pursuant to Pub. L. No. 113-128, Title I, s. 108 and this act. (b) Conclude agreements necessary to designate the fiscal agent and administrative entity. A public or private entity, including an entity established under s. 163.01, which makes a majority of the appointments to a local board may serve as the local board’s administrative entity if approved by the department based upon a showing that a fair and competitive process was used to select the administrative entity. (c) Provide ongoing oversight related to administrative costs, duplicated services, career counseling, economic development, equal access, compliance and accountability, and performance outcomes. (d) Oversee the one-stop delivery system in its local area. (5) The department and CareerSource Florida, Inc., in consultation with the state board, shall implement a training program for the local workforce development boards to familiarize local board members with the state’s workforce development goals and strategies. (6) Consistent with federal and state law, the local workforce development board shall designate all local service providers and may not transfer this authority to a third party. Consistent with the intent of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, local boards should provide the greatest possible choice of training providers to those who qualify for training services. A local board may not restrict the choice of training providers based upon cost, location, or historical training arrangements. However, a local board may restrict the amount of training resources available to any one client. Such restrictions may vary based upon the cost of training in the client’s chosen occupational area. The local board may be designated as a one-stop operator and direct provider of intake, assessment, eligibility determinations, or other direct provider services except training services. Such designation may occur only with the agreement of the chief elected official and the Governor as specified in 29 U.S.C. s. 2832(f)(2). The state board shall establish procedures by which a local board may request permission to operate under this section and the criteria under which such permission may be granted. The criteria shall include, but need not be limited to, a reduction in the cost of providing the permitted services. Such permission shall be granted for a period not to exceed 3 years for any single request submitted by the local board. (7) Local workforce development boards shall adopt a committee structure consistent with applicable federal law and state policies established by the state board. (8) The importance of minority and gender representation shall be considered when appointments are made to any committee established by the local workforce development board. (9) For purposes of procurement, local workforce development boards and their administrative entities are not state agencies and are exempt from chapters 120 and 287. The local boards shall apply the procurement and expenditure procedures required by federal law and policies of the department and the state board for the expenditure of federal, state, and nonpass-through funds. The making or approval of smaller, multiple payments for a single purchase with the intent to avoid or evade the monetary thresholds and procedures established by federal law and policies of the department and the state board is grounds for removal for cause. Local boards; their administrative entities, committees, and subcommittees; and other workforce units may authorize expenditures to award suitable framed certificates, pins, or other tokens of recognition for performance by units of the workforce development system. Local boards; their administrative entities, committees, and subcommittees; and other workforce units may authorize expenditures for promotional items, such as t-shirts, hats, or pens printed with messages promoting the state’s workforce system to employers, job seekers, and program participants. However, such expenditures are subject to federal regulations applicable to the expenditure of federal funds. All contracts executed by local boards must include specific performance expectations and deliverables. (10) State and federal funds provided to the local workforce development boards may not be used directly or indirectly to pay for meals, food, or beverages for members, staff, or employees of local boards, the state board, or the department except as expressly authorized by state law. Preapproved, reasonable, and necessary per diem allowances and travel expenses may be reimbursed. Such reimbursement shall be at the standard travel reimbursement rates established in s. 112.061 and shall be in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. The department shall provide fiscal and programmatic guidance to the state board, CareerSource Florida, Inc., and all local boards to hold both the state and local boards strictly accountable for adherence to the policy and subject to regular and periodic monitoring by the department. Local boards are prohibited from expending state or federal funds for entertainment costs and recreational activities for local board members and employees as these terms are defined by 2 C.F.R. part 200. (11)(a) To increase transparency and accountability, a local workforce development board must comply with the requirements of this section before contracting with a member of the local board; a relative, as defined in s. 112.3143(1)(c), of a local board member; an organization or individual represented on the local board; or an employee of the local board. Such contracts may not be executed before or without the prior approval of the department. Such contracts, as well as documentation demonstrating adherence to this section as specified by the department, must be submitted to the department for review and approval. Such a contract must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the local board, a quorum having been established; all conflicts of interest must be disclosed before the vote in a manner that is consistent with the procedures outlined in s. 112.3143(4); and any member who may benefit from the contract, or whose organization or relative may benefit from the contract, must abstain from the vote. A contract subject to the requirements of this subsection may not be included on a consent agenda. (b) A contract under $10,000 between a local board; a relative, as defined in s. 112.3143(1)(c), of a local board member; or an employee of the local board is not required to have the prior approval of the department, but must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the local board, a quorum having been established, and must be reported to the department and the state board within 30 days after approval. (c) All contracts between a local board and a member of the local board; a relative, as defined in s. 112.3143(1)(c), of a local board member; an organization or individual represented on the local board; or an employee of the local board, approved on or after July 1, 2021, must also be published on the local board’s website, or on the department’s website if the local board does not maintain a website, within 10 days after approval by the local board or department, whichever is later. Such contracts must remain published on the website for at least 1 year after termination of the contract. (d) In considering whether to approve a contract under this subsection, the department shall review and consider all documentation provided to the department by the local board, including the performance of the entity with which the local board is proposing to contract with, if applicable, and the nature, size, and makeup of the business community served by the local board, including whether the entity with which the local board is proposing to contract with is the only provider of the desired goods or services within the area served by the local board. (12) Each local workforce development board shall develop a budget for the purpose of carrying out the duties of the local board under this section, subject to the approval of the chief elected official. Each local board shall submit its annual budget for review to the department no later than 2 weeks after the chair approves the budget. The local board shall publish the budget on its website, or the department’s website if the local board does not maintain a website, within 10 days after approval by the department. The budget shall remain published on the website for the duration of the fiscal year for which it accounts for the expenditure of funds. (13) Each local workforce development board shall annually, within 30 days after the end of the fiscal year, disclose to the department, in a manner determined by the department, the amount and nature of compensation paid to all executives, officers, directors, trustees, key employees, and the highest compensated employees, as defined for purposes of the Internal Revenue Service Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax, including salary, bonuses, present value of vested benefits including but not limited to retirement, accrued leave and paid time off, cashed-in leave, cash equivalents, severance pay, pension plan accruals and contributions, deferred compensation, real property gifts, and any other liability owed to such persons. The disclosure must be accompanied by a written declaration, as provided for under s. 92.525(2), from the chief financial officer, or his or her designee, that he or she has read the foregoing document and the facts stated in it are true. Such information must also be published on the local board’s website, or the department’s website if the local board does not maintain a website, for a period of 3 years after it is first published. (14) Each local workforce development board shall annually publish its most recent Internal Revenue Service Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax, on its website, or the department’s website if the local board does not maintain a website. The form must be posted on the local board’s website within 60 calendar days after it is filed with the Internal Revenue Service and remain posted for 3 years after it is filed. (15) Each local workforce development board shall create an education and industry consortium composed of representatives of educational entities and businesses in the designated service delivery area. Each consortium shall provide quarterly reports to the applicable local board which provide community-based information related to educational programs and industry needs to assist the local board in making decisions on programs, services, and partnerships in the service delivery area. The local board shall consider the information obtained from the consortium to determine the most effective ways to grow, retain, and attract talent to the service delivery area. The chair of the local workforce development board shall appoint the consortium members. A member of a local workforce development board may not serve as a member of the consortium. Consortium members shall be appointed for 2-year terms beginning on January 1 of the year of appointment, and any vacancy on the consortium must be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term in the same manner as the original appointment.

      "text": "445.009 One-stop delivery system.— (1) The one-stop delivery system is the state’s primary customer-service strategy for offering every Floridian access, through service sites or telephone or computer networks, to the following services: (a) Job search, referral, and placement assistance. (b) Career counseling and educational planning. (c) Consumer reports on service providers. (d) Recruitment and eligibility determination. (e) Support services, including child care and transportation assistance to gain employment. (f) Employability skills training. (g) Adult education, basic skills training, integrated education and training, and the Graduation Alternative to Traditional Education Program under s. 1004.933. (h) Technical training leading to a certification and degree. (i) Claim filing for reemployment assistance services. (j) Temporary income, health, nutritional, and housing assistance. (k) Benefit management and career planning using a tool to demonstrate future financial impacts of the participant’s change in income and benefits over time. (l) Other appropriate and available workforce development services. (2)(a) Subject to a process designed by the state board, and in compliance with Pub. L. No. 113-128, local workforce development boards shall designate one-stop delivery system operators. (b) A local workforce development board may designate as its one-stop delivery system operator any public or private entity that is eligible to provide services under any state or federal workforce program that is a mandatory or discretionary partner in the local workforce development area’s one-stop delivery system if approved by the department upon a showing by the local workforce development board that a fair and competitive process was used in the selection. As a condition of authorizing a local workforce development board to designate such an entity as its one-stop delivery system operator, the department must require the local workforce development board to demonstrate that safeguards are in place to ensure that the one-stop delivery system operator will not exercise an unfair competitive advantage or unfairly refer or direct customers of the one-stop delivery system to services provided by that one-stop delivery system operator. A local workforce development board may retain its current one-stop career center operator without further procurement action if the local board has an established one-stop career center that has complied with federal and state law. (c) The local workforce development board must enter into a memorandum of understanding with each mandatory or optional partner participating in the one-stop delivery system which details the partner’s required contribution to infrastructure costs, as required by Pub. L. No. 113-128, s. 121(h). (3) Local workforce development boards shall enter into a memorandum of understanding with the department for the delivery of employment services authorized by the federal Wagner-Peyser Act. This memorandum of understanding must be performance based. (a) Unless otherwise required by federal law, at least 90 percent of the Wagner-Peyser funding must go into direct customer service costs. (b) Employment services must be provided through the one-stop delivery system, under the guidance of one-stop delivery system operators. One-stop delivery system operators shall have overall authority for directing the staff of the workforce system. Personnel matters shall remain under the ultimate authority of the department. However, the one-stop delivery system operator shall submit to the department information concerning the job performance of employees of the department who deliver employment services. The department shall consider any such information submitted by the one-stop delivery system operator in conducting performance appraisals of the employees. (c) The department shall retain fiscal responsibility and accountability for the administration of funds allocated to the state under the Wagner-Peyser Act. An employee of the department who is providing services authorized under the Wagner-Peyser Act shall be paid using Wagner-Peyser Act funds. (4) One-stop delivery system partners shall enter into a memorandum of understanding pursuant to Pub. L. No. 113-128, Title I, s. 121, with the local workforce development board. Failure of a local partner to participate cannot unilaterally block the majority of partners from moving forward with their one-stop delivery system, and the state board, in conjunction with the department, may notify the Governor of a local partner that fails to participate. (5) To the extent possible, local workforce development boards shall include as partners in the local one-stop delivery system entities that provide programs or activities designed to meet the needs of homeless persons. (6)(a) To the extent possible, core services, as defined by Pub. L. No. 113-128, shall be provided electronically, using existing systems. These electronic systems shall be linked and integrated into a comprehensive service system to simplify access to core services by: 1. Maintaining staff to serve as the first point of contact with the public seeking access to employment services who are knowledgeable about each program located in each one-stop delivery system center as well as related services. An initial determination of the programs for which a customer is likely to be eligible and any referral for a more thorough eligibility determination must be made at this first point of contact; and 2. Establishing an automated, integrated intake screening and eligibility process where customers will provide information through a self-service intake process that may be accessed by staff from any participating program. (b) To expand electronic capabilities, the state board and the department, working with local workforce development boards, shall develop a centralized help center to assist local workforce development boards in fulfilling core services, minimizing the need for fixed-site one-stop delivery system centers. (c) To the extent feasible, core services shall be accessible through the Internet. Through this technology, core services shall be made available at public libraries, public and private educational institutions, community centers, kiosks, neighborhood facilities, and satellite one-stop delivery system sites. Each local workforce development board’s web page shall serve as a portal for contacting potential employees by integrating the placement efforts of universities and private companies, including staffing services firms, into the existing one-stop delivery system. (7) Intensive services and training provided pursuant to Pub. L. No. 113-128 shall be provided to individuals through Intensive Service Accounts and Individual Training Accounts. The state board shall develop an implementation plan, including identification of initially eligible training providers, transition guidelines, and criteria for use of these accounts. Individual Training Accounts must be compatible with Individual Development Accounts for education allowed in federal and state welfare reform statutes. (8)(a) Individual Training Accounts must be expended on programs that prepare people to enter occupations identified by the Labor Market Statistics Center within the Department of Commerce and the Labor Market Estimating Conference created by s. 216.136, and on other programs recommended and approved by the state board following a review by the department to determine the program’s compliance with federal law. (b) For each approved training program, local workforce development boards, in consultation with training providers, shall establish a fair-market purchase price to be paid through an Individual Training Account. The purchase price must be based on prevailing costs and reflect local economic factors, program complexity, and program benefits, including time to beginning of training and time to completion. The price shall ensure the fair participation of public and nonpublic postsecondary educational institutions as authorized service providers and shall prohibit the use of unlawful remuneration to the student in return for attending an institution. Unlawful remuneration does not include student financial assistance programs. (c) The department shall periodically review Individual Training Account pricing schedules developed by local workforce development boards and present findings and recommendations for process improvement to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. (d) To the maximum extent possible, training providers shall use funding sources other than the funding provided under Pub. L. No. 113-128. The state board shall develop a system to encourage the leveraging of appropriated resources for the workforce system and shall report on such efforts as part of the required annual report. (e) Training services provided through Individual Training Accounts must be performance-based. (f) The accountability measures to be used in documenting competencies acquired by the participant during training shall be literacy completion points and occupational completion points. Literacy completion points refers to the academic or workforce readiness competencies that qualify a person for further basic education, career education, or for employment. Occupational completion points refers to the career competencies that qualify a person to enter an occupation that is linked to a career program. (9)(a) The state board, working with the department, shall coordinate among the agencies a plan for a One-Stop Electronic Network made up of one-stop delivery system centers and other partner agencies that are operated by authorized public or private for-profit or not-for-profit agents. The plan shall identify resources within existing revenues to establish and support this electronic network for service delivery that includes Government Services Direct. If necessary, the plan shall identify additional funding needed to achieve the provisions of this subsection. (b) The network shall assure that a uniform method is used to determine eligibility for and management of services provided by agencies that conduct workforce development activities. The Department of Management Services shall develop strategies to allow access to the databases and information management systems of the following systems in order to link information in those databases with the one-stop delivery system: 1. The Reemployment Assistance Program under chapter 443. 2. The public employment service described in s. 443.181. 3. The public assistance information system used by the Department of Children and Families and the components related to temporary cash assistance, food assistance, and Medicaid eligibility. 4. The Student Financial Assistance System of the Department of Education. 5. Enrollment in the public postsecondary education system. 6. Other information systems determined appropriate by the state board, in consultation with the department. (10) To the maximum extent feasible, the one-stop delivery system may use private sector staffing services firms in the provision of workforce services to individuals and employers in the state. Local workforce development boards may collaborate with staffing services firms in order to facilitate the provision of workforce services. Local workforce development boards may contract with private sector staffing services firms to design programs that meet the employment needs of the local workforce development area. All such contracts must be performance-based and require a specific period of job tenure before payment. (11) A participant in an adult or youth work experience activity administered under this chapter shall be deemed an employee of the state for purposes of workers’ compensation coverage. In determining the average weekly wage, all remuneration received from the employer shall be considered a gratuity, and the participant is not entitled to any benefits otherwise payable under s. 440.15, regardless of whether the participant may be receiving wages and remuneration from other employment with another employer and regardless of his or her future wage-earning capacity.

This system must include, but is not limited to, the following: (a) An integrated management system for the one-stop service delivery system, which includes, at a minimum, common registration and intake for required one-stop partners, screening for needs and benefits, benefit management and career planning using a tool to demonstrate future financial impacts of the participant’s change in income and benefits over time, case management, training benefits management, service and training provider management, performance reporting, executive information and reporting, and customer-satisfaction tracking and reporting. 1. The system should report current budgeting, expenditure, and performance information for assessing performance related to outcomes, service delivery, and financial administration for workforce programs pursuant to s. 445.004(5) and (9). 2. The system should include auditable systems and controls to ensure financial integrity and valid and reliable performance information. 3. The system should support service integration and case management across programs and agencies by providing for case tracking for participants in workforce programs, participants who receive benefits pursuant to public assistance programs under chapter 414, and participants in welfare transition programs under this chapter. (b) An automated job-matching information system that is accessible to employers, job seekers, and other users via the Internet, and that includes, at a minimum, all of the following: 1. Skill match information, including skill gap analysis; résumé creation; job order creation; skill tests; job search by area, employer type, and employer name; and training provider linkage. 2. Job market information based on surveys, including local, state, regional, national, and international occupational and job availability information. 3. Service provider information, including education and training providers, child care facilities and related information, health and social service agencies, and other providers of services that would be useful to job seekers. (2) The department may procure independent verification and validation services associated with developing and implementing the consumer-first workforce system. (3) The department shall coordinate development and implementation of the consumer-first workforce system with the state chief information officer to ensure compatibility with the state’s information system strategy and enterprise architecture. (4) Any contract entered into or renewed on or after July 1, 2021, for the purpose of implementing this section must be performance based. (5) The department shall develop training for required one-stop partners on the use of the consumer-first workforce system, best practices for the use of a tool demonstrating future financial impacts of the participant’s change in income and benefits over time, the different case management methods, the availability of welfare transition services, and how to prequalify individuals for workforce programs.

Under the program, a local workforce development board may apply, on a competitive basis, for funds to support the provision of such services to small businesses through the local workforce development area’s one-stop delivery system. (2) Eligible uses of funds under this program include, but are not limited to: (a) Identifying common training needs among small businesses; (b) Developing curriculum to address common training needs among small businesses; (c) Facilitating the provision of training services for such small businesses through eligible training providers; (d) Assisting small businesses to identify incentives and complete applications or other paperwork associated with such incentives; and (e) Establishing a single point of contact for the provision of preemployment and postemployment services to small businesses. (3) The state board shall establish guidelines governing the administration of this program and shall establish criteria to be used in evaluating applications for funding. Such criteria must include, but need not be limited to, a showing that the local workforce development board has in place a detailed plan for establishing a one-stop delivery system designed to meet the workforce needs of small businesses and for leveraging other funding sources in support of such activities.

(3) Incentive payments may be made to for-profit or not-for-profit agents selected by local workforce development boards who successfully place untried workers in full-time employment for 6 months with an employer after the employee successfully completes a probationary placement of no more than 6 months with that employer. Full-time employment that includes health care benefits will receive an additional incentive payment. (4) The for-profit and not-for-profit agents shall contract to provide services for no more than 1 year. Contracts may be renewed upon successful review by the contracting agent. (5) Incentives must be paid according to the incentive schedule developed by CareerSource Florida, Inc., the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Children and Families which costs the state less per placement than the state’s 12-month expenditure on a welfare recipient. (6) During an untried worker’s probationary placement, the for-profit or not-for-profit agent shall be the employer of record of that untried worker, and shall provide workers’ compensation and reemployment assistance coverage as provided by law. The business employing the untried worker through the agent may be eligible to apply for any tax credits, wage supplementation, wage subsidy, or employer payment for that employee that are authorized in law or by agreement with the employer. After satisfactory completion of such a probationary period, an untried worker shall not be considered an untried worker. (7) This section shall not be used for the purpose of displacing or replacing an employer’s regular employees, and shall not interfere with executed collective bargaining agreements. Untried workers shall be paid by the employer at the same rate as similarly situated and assessed workers in the same place of employment. (8) An employer that demonstrates a pattern of unsuccessful placements shall be disqualified from participation in these pilots because of poor return on the public’s investment. (9) Any employer that chooses to employ untried workers is eligible to receive such incentives and benefits that are available and provided in law, as long as the long-term, cost savings can be quantified with each such additional inducement.

      "text": "445.017 Diversion.— (1) Many customers of the one-stop delivery system do not need ongoing temporary cash assistance, but, due to an unexpected circumstance or emergency situation, require some immediate assistance to secure or retain employment or child support. These immediate obligations may include a shelter or utility payment, a car repair to continue employment, or other services that will alleviate the applicant’s emergency financial need and allow the person to focus on obtaining or continuing employment. (2) Up-front diversion shall involve four steps: (a) Linking applicants with job opportunities as the first option. (b) Offering services, such as child care or transportation, as an alternative to welfare. (c) Screening applicants to respond to emergency needs. (d) Offering a one-time payment of up to $1,000 per family. (3) Before finding an applicant family eligible for up-front diversion services, the local workforce development board must determine that all requirements of eligibility for diversion services would likely be met. (4)(a) The local workforce development board shall screen each family on a case-by-case basis for barriers to obtaining or retaining employment. The screening must identify barriers that, if corrected, may prevent the family from receiving temporary cash assistance on a regular basis. At the time of screening, the local workforce development board shall administer the intake survey required under s. 445.035(2). (b) Assistance to overcome a barrier to employment is not limited to cash, but may include vouchers or other in-kind benefits. (5) The family receiving up-front diversion must sign an agreement restricting the family from applying for temporary cash assistance for 3 months, unless an emergency is demonstrated to the local workforce development board. If a demonstrated emergency forces the family to reapply for temporary cash assistance within 3 months after receiving a diversion payment, the diversion payment shall be prorated over an 8-month period and deducted from any temporary assistance for which the family is eligible. (6) The department may adopt rules governing the administration of this section and may establish guidelines for screening criteria, referrals to community resources, restrictions on receipt of up-front diversion and transitional services, definitions of emergency services, verification requirements, and processing timeframes.

      "text": "445.018 Diversion program to strengthen Florida’s families.— (1) The diversion program to strengthen families in this state is intended to provide services that assist families in avoiding welfare dependency by gaining and retaining employment. (2) Before finding a family eligible for the diversion program created under this section, a determination must be made that: (a) The family includes a pregnant woman or a parent with one or more minor children or a caretaker relative with one or more minor children. (b) The family is at risk of welfare dependency because the family’s income does not exceed 200 percent of the federal poverty level. (c) The provision of services related to employment, including assessment, service planning and coordination, job placement, employment-related education or training, child care services, transportation services, relocation services, workplace employment support services, individual or family counseling, or a Retention Incentive Training Account (RITA), are likely to prevent the family from becoming dependent on welfare by enabling employable adults in the family to become employed, remain employed, or pursue career advancement. (3) The services provided under this section are not considered assistance under federal law or guidelines. (4) Each family that receives services under this section must sign an agreement not to apply for temporary cash assistance for 6 months following the receipt of services, unless an unanticipated emergency situation arises. If a family applies for temporary cash assistance without a documented emergency, the family must repay the value of the diversion services provided. Repayment may be prorated over 8 months and shall be paid through a reduction in the amount of any monthly temporary cash assistance payment received by the family. (5) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, a family that meets the requirements of subsection (2) is considered a needy family and is eligible for services under this section.

Accordingly, there is established a program to assist families in relocating to communities with greater opportunities for self-sufficiency. (2) The relocation assistance program shall involve five steps by the local workforce development board, in cooperation with the Department of Children and Families: (a) A determination that the family is receiving temporary cash assistance or that all requirements of eligibility for diversion services would likely be met. (b) A determination that there is a basis for believing that relocation will contribute to the ability of the applicant to achieve self-sufficiency. For example, the applicant: 1. Is unlikely to achieve economic self-sufficiency at the current community of residence; 2. Has secured a job that provides an increased salary or improved benefits and that requires relocation to another community; 3. Has a family support network that will contribute to job retention in another community; 4. Is determined, pursuant to criteria or procedures established by the state board, to be a victim of domestic violence who would experience reduced probability of further incidents through relocation; or 5. Must relocate in order to receive education or training that is directly related to the applicant’s employment or career advancement. (c) Establishment of a relocation plan that includes such requirements as are necessary to prevent abuse of the benefit and provisions to protect the safety of victims of domestic violence and avoid provisions that place them in anticipated danger. The payment to defray relocation expenses shall be determined based on criteria approved by the state board. Participants in the relocation program shall be eligible for diversion or transitional benefits. (d) A determination, pursuant to criteria adopted by the state board that a community receiving a relocated family has the capacity to provide needed services and employment opportunities. (e) Monitoring the relocation. (3) A family receiving relocation assistance for reasons other than domestic violence must sign an agreement restricting the family from applying for temporary cash assistance for a period of 6 months, unless an emergency is demonstrated to the local workforce development board. If a demonstrated emergency forces the family to reapply for temporary cash assistance within such period, after receiving a relocation assistance payment, repayment must be made on a prorated basis and subtracted from any regular payment of temporary cash assistance for which the applicant may be eligible. (4) The state board may establish criteria for developing and implementing relocation plans and for drafting agreements to restrict a family from applying for temporary cash assistance for a specified period after receiving a relocation assistance payment.

The following categories of work activities, based on federal law and regulations, may be used individually or in combination to satisfy the work requirements for a participant in the temporary cash assistance program: (a) Unsubsidized employment. (b) Subsidized private sector employment. (c) Subsidized public sector employment. (d) On-the-job training. (e) Community service programs. (f) Work experience. (g) Job search and job readiness assistance. (h) Vocational educational training. (i) Job skills training directly related to employment. (j) Education directly related to employment. (k) Satisfactory attendance at a secondary school or in a course of study leading to a high school equivalency diploma. (l) Providing child care services. (2) WORK ACTIVITY REQUIREMENTS.—Each individual who is not otherwise exempt from work activity requirements must participate in a work activity for the maximum number of hours allowable under federal law; however, a participant may not be required to work more than 40 hours per week. The maximum number of hours each month that a family may be required to participate in community service or work experience programs is the number of hours that would result from dividing the family’s monthly amount for temporary cash assistance and food assistance by the applicable minimum wage. However, the maximum hours required per week for community service or work experience may not exceed 40 hours. (a)1. A participant who has not earned a high school diploma or its equivalent may participate in adult general education, as defined in s. 1004.02(3), or a high school equivalency examination preparation, as defined in s. 1004.02(16). A participant must participate in such program or course for at least 20 hours per week in order to satisfy the participant’s work activity requirement. 2. If the state’s TANF work participation rate, as provided by federal law, does not exceed the federal minimum work participation rate by 10 percentage points in any month, the requirements of this subsection may be suspended by the department until the work participation rate exceeds the federal minimum work participation rate by 10 percentage points for at least 3 consecutive months. 3. If the requirements of this subsection are suspended, the department must issue notice to the affected participants of the changed work requirements within 5 days after the change in such work requirements. (b) A participant in a work activity may also be required to enroll in and attend a course of instruction designed to increase literacy skills to a level necessary for obtaining or retaining employment if the instruction plus the work activity does not require more than 40 hours per week. (c) Program funds may be used, as available, to support the efforts of a participant who meets the work activity requirements and who wishes to enroll in or continue enrollment in an adult general education program or other training programs. (3) EXEMPTION FROM WORK ACTIVITY REQUIREMENTS.—The following individuals are exempt from work activity requirements: (a) An individual who receives benefits under the Supplemental Security Income program or the Social Security Disability Insurance program. (b) An adult who is not defined as a work-eligible individual under federal law. (c) A single parent of a child under 3 months of age, except that the parent may be required to attend parenting classes or other activities to better prepare for the responsibilities of raising a child. (d) An individual who is exempt from the time period pursuant to s. 414.105. (4) PRIORITIZATION OF WORK REQUIREMENTS.—Local workforce development boards shall require participation in work activities to the maximum extent possible, subject to federal and state funding. If funds are projected to be insufficient to allow full-time work activities by all program participants who are required to participate in work activities, local workforce development boards shall screen participants and assign priority based on the following: (a) In accordance with federal requirements, at least one adult in each two-parent family shall be assigned priority for full-time work activities. (b) Among single-parent families, a family that has older preschool children or school-age children shall be assigned priority for work activities. (c) A participant who has access to child care services may be assigned priority for work activities. (d) Priority may be assigned based on the amount of time remaining until the participant reaches the applicable time limit for program participation or may be based on requirements of a case plan. Local workforce development boards may limit a participant’s weekly work requirement to the minimum required to meet federal work activity requirements. Local workforce development boards may develop screening and prioritization procedures based on the allocation of resources, the availability of community resources, the provision of supportive services, or the work activity needs of the service area. (5) USE OF CONTRACTS.—Local workforce development boards shall provide work activities, training, and other services, as appropriate, through contracts. In contracting for work activities, training, or services, the following applies: (a) A contract must be performance-based. Payment shall be tied to performance outcomes that include factors such as, but not limited to, diversion from cash assistance, job entry, job entry at a target wage, job retention, and connection to transition services rather than tied to completion of training or education or any other phase of the program participation process. (b) A contract may include performance-based incentive payments that may vary according to the extent to which the participant is more difficult to place. Contract payments may be weighted proportionally to reflect the extent to which the participant has limitations associated with the long-term receipt of welfare and difficulty in sustaining employment. The factors may include the extent of prior receipt of welfare, lack of employment experience, lack of education, lack of job skills, and other factors determined appropriate by the local workforce development board. (c) Notwithstanding the exemption from the competitive sealed bid requirements provided in s. 287.057(3)(e) for certain contractual services, each contract awarded under this chapter must be awarded on the basis of a competitive sealed bid, except for a contract with a governmental entity as determined by the local workforce development board. (d) Local workforce development boards may contract with commercial, charitable, or religious organizations. A contract must comply with federal requirements with respect to nondiscrimination and other requirements that safeguard the rights of participants. Services may be provided under contract, certificate, voucher, or other form of disbursement. (e) The administrative costs associated with a contract for services provided under this section may not exceed the applicable administrative cost ceiling established in federal law. An agency or entity that is awarded a contract under this section may not charge more than 7 percent of the value of the contract for administration unless an exception is approved by the local workforce development board. A list of any exceptions approved must be submitted to the state board for review, and the state board may rescind approval of the exception. (f) Local workforce development boards may enter into contracts to provide short-term work experience for the chronically unemployed as provided in this section. (g) A tax-exempt organization under s. 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which receives funds under this chapter must disclose receipt of federal funds on any advertising, promotional, or other material in accordance with federal requirements. (6) PROTECTIONS FOR PARTICIPANTS.—Each participant is subject to the same health, safety, and nondiscrimination standards established under federal, state, or local laws that otherwise apply to other individuals engaged in similar activities who are not participants in the welfare transition program. (7) PROTECTION FOR CURRENT EMPLOYEES.—In establishing and contracting for work experience and community service activities, other work experience activities, on-the-job training, subsidized employment, and work supplementation under the welfare transition program, an employed worker may not be displaced, either completely or partially. A participant may not be assigned to an activity or employed in a position if the employer has created the vacancy or terminated an existing employee without good cause in order to fill that position with a program participant.

If resources do not permit the provision of needed support services, the local workforce development board may prioritize or otherwise limit provision of support services. This section does not constitute an entitlement to support services. Lack of provision of support services may be considered as a factor in determining whether good cause exists for failing to comply with work activity requirements but does not automatically constitute good cause for failing to comply with work activity requirements, and does not affect any applicable time limit on the receipt of temporary cash assistance or the provision of services under chapter 414. Support services shall include, but need not be limited to: (1) TRANSPORTATION.—Transportation expenses may be provided to any participant when the assistance is needed to comply with work activity requirements or employment requirements, including transportation to and from a child care provider. Payment may be made in cash or tokens in advance or through reimbursement paid against receipts or invoices. Transportation services may include, but are not limited to, cooperative arrangements with the following: public transit providers; community transportation coordinators designated under chapter 427; school districts; churches and community centers; donated motor vehicle programs, van pools, and ridesharing programs; small enterprise developments and entrepreneurial programs that encourage participants to become transportation providers; public and private transportation partnerships; and other innovative strategies to expand transportation options available to program participants. (a) Local workforce development boards may provide payment for vehicle operational and repair expenses, including repair expenditures necessary to make a vehicle functional; vehicle registration fees; driver license fees; and liability insurance for the vehicle for a period of up to 6 months. Request for vehicle repairs must be accompanied by an estimate of the cost prepared by a repair facility registered under s. 559.904. (b) Transportation disadvantaged funds as defined in chapter 427 do not include support services funds or funds appropriated to assist persons eligible under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. It is the intent of the Legislature that local workforce development boards consult with local community transportation coordinators designated under chapter 427 regarding the availability and cost of transportation services through the coordinated transportation system before contracting for comparable transportation services outside the coordinated system. (2) ANCILLARY EXPENSES.—Ancillary expenses such as books, tools, clothing, fees, and costs necessary to comply with work activity requirements or employment requirements may be provided. (3) MEDICAL SERVICES.—A family that meets the eligibility requirements for Medicaid shall receive medical services under the Medicaid program. (4) PERSONAL AND FAMILY COUNSELING AND THERAPY.—Counseling may be provided to participants who have a personal or family problem or problems caused by substance abuse that is a barrier to compliance with work activity requirements or employment requirements. In providing these services, local workforce development boards shall use services that are available in the community at no additional cost. If these services are not available, local workforce development boards may use support services funds. Personal or family counseling not available through Medicaid may not be considered a medical service for purposes of the required statewide implementation plan or use of federal funds.

In the event of an emergency, such agreement shall provide for an exception to this restriction, provided that the one-time payment shall be deducted from any cash assistance for which the family subsequently is approved. This deduction may be prorated over an 8-month period. The state board shall adopt criteria defining the conditions under which a family may receive cash assistance due to such emergency.

      "text": "445.048 Passport to Economic Progress program.— (1) AUTHORIZATION.—Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the state board, in conjunction with the department and the Department of Children and Families, shall implement a Passport to Economic Progress program consistent with this section. The state board may designate local workforce development boards to participate in the program. Expenses for the program may come from appropriated revenues or from funds otherwise available to a local workforce development board which may be legally used for such purposes. The state board must consult with the applicable local workforce development boards and the applicable local offices of the Department of Children and Families which serve the program areas and must encourage community input into the implementation process. (2) WAIVERS.—If the state board, in consultation with the Department of Children and Families, finds that federal waivers would facilitate implementation of the program, the department shall immediately request such waivers, and the state board shall report to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives if any refusal of the Federal Government to grant such waivers prevents the implementation of the program. If the state board finds that federal waivers to provisions of the Food Assistance Program would facilitate implementation of the program, the Department of Children and Families shall immediately request such waivers in accordance with s. 414.175. (3) TRANSITIONAL BENEFITS AND SERVICES.—In order to assist them in making the transition to economic self-sufficiency, former recipients of temporary cash assistance participating in the passport program shall be eligible for the following benefits and services: (a) Notwithstanding the time period specified in s. 445.030, transitional education and training support services as specified in s. 445.030 for up to 4 years after the family is no longer receiving temporary cash assistance; (b) Notwithstanding the time period specified in s. 445.031, transitional transportation support services as specified in s. 445.031 for up to 4 years after the family is no longer receiving temporary cash assistance; and (c) Notwithstanding the time period specified in s. 445.032, transitional child care as specified in s. 445.032 for up to 4 years after the family is no longer receiving temporary cash assistance. All other provisions of ss. 445.030, 445.031, and 445.032 apply to such individuals, as appropriate. This subsection does not constitute an entitlement to transitional benefits and services. If funds are insufficient to provide benefits and services under this subsection, the state board, or its agent, may limit such benefits and services or otherwise establish priorities for the provisions of such benefits and services. (4) INCENTIVES TO ECONOMIC SELF-SUFFICIENCY.— (a) The Legislature finds that: 1. There are former recipients of temporary cash assistance and families who are eligible for temporary assistance for needy families who are working full time but whose incomes are below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. 2. Having incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level makes such individuals particularly vulnerable to reliance on public assistance despite their best efforts to achieve or maintain economic independence through employment. 3. It is necessary to implement a performance-based program that defines economic incentives for achieving specific benchmarks toward self-sufficiency while the individual is working full time. (b) The state board, in cooperation with the department and the Department of Children and Families, shall offer performance-based incentive bonuses as a component of the Passport to Economic Progress program. The bonuses do not represent a program entitlement and are contingent on achieving specific benchmarks prescribed in the self-sufficiency plan. If the funds appropriated for this purpose are insufficient to provide this financial incentive, the state board may reduce or suspend the bonuses in order not to exceed the appropriation or may direct the local workforce development boards to use resources otherwise given to the local workforce development board to pay such bonuses if such payments comply with applicable state and federal laws. (c) To be eligible for an incentive bonus under this subsection, an individual must: 1. Be a former recipient of temporary cash assistance who last received such assistance on or after January 1, 2000, or be part of a family that is eligible for temporary assistance for needy families; 2. Be employed full time, which for the purposes of this subsection means employment averaging at least 32 hours per week, until the United States Congress enacts legislation reauthorizing the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant and, after the reauthorization, means employment complying with the employment requirements of the reauthorization; and 3. Have an average family income for the 6 months preceding the date of application for an incentive bonus which is less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level. (5) EVALUATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.—The state board, in conjunction with the department, the Department of Children and Families, and the local workforce development boards, shall conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of the program operated under this section. Evaluations and recommendations for the program shall be submitted by the state board as part of its annual report to the Legislature. (6) CONFLICTS.—If there is a conflict between the implementation procedures described in this section and federal requirements and regulations, federal requirements and regulations shall control.
