The stated assumptions must be based upon all of the relevant facts known to the professional solicitor regarding the solicitation to be conducted by the professional solicitor. (e) The effective and termination dates of the contract. (8) Within 45 days after a solicitation campaign has been completed and within 45 days after the anniversary of the commencement of a solicitation campaign lasting more than 1 year, the professional solicitor must provide to the charitable organization or sponsor and file with the department a financial report of the campaign, including the gross revenue received and an itemization of all expenses incurred.

(d) A record of all expenses incurred by the professional solicitor for the payment of which the professional solicitor is liable. (e) A record of all expenses incurred by the professional solicitor for the payment of which the charitable organization or sponsor is liable.

(g) A copy of each pitch sheet or solicitation script used during the completed solicitation campaign. (h) If a refund of a contribution has been requested, the name and street address of each person requesting the refund, and, if a refund was made, its amount and the date it was made. (11) If the professional solicitor sells tickets to any event and represents that the tickets will be donated for use by another person, the professional solicitor also must maintain for the same period as specified in subsection (10) the following records: (a) The name and street address of each contributor who purchases or donates tickets and the number of tickets purchased or donated by the contributor. (b) The name and street address of each organization that receives the donated tickets for the use of others, and the number of tickets received by the organization. (12) Any of the records described in this section must be made available to the department upon request and must be furnished within 10 days after the request. (13) Unless otherwise provided in ss. 496.401-496.424, any material change in any information filed with the department pursuant to this section must be reported in writing to the department within 7 days after the change occurs. (14) A person may not act as a professional solicitor, and a professional solicitor, or an officer, director, trustee, or employee thereof, may not, to solicit for compensation, knowingly employ an officer, trustee, director, or employee, or a person with a controlling interest therein, who has, in any state, regardless of adjudication, been convicted of, been found guilty of, or pled guilty or nolo contendere to, or has been incarcerated within the last 10 years as a result of having previously been convicted of, been found guilty of, or pled guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony within the last 10 years involving fraud, theft, larceny, embezzlement, fraudulent conversion, or misappropriation of property, or a crime arising from the conduct of a solicitation for a charitable organization or sponsor, or has been enjoined in any state from violating a law relating to a charitable solicitation. The prohibitions in this subsection also apply to a misdemeanor in another state which constitutes a disqualifying felony in this state. (15) The department may deny or revoke the registration of a professional solicitor if the professional solicitor, or any of its officers, directors, trustees, or agents, has had the right to solicit contributions revoked in any state or has been ordered by a court or governmental agency to cease soliciting contributions within any state. (16) All registration fees must be paid to the department and deposited into the General Inspection Trust Fund.

(5) Use a name, symbol, emblem, device, service mark, or statement so closely related or similar to that used by another charitable organization or sponsor that the use thereof would mislead the public.

(8) Represent that a charitable organization or sponsor will receive a fixed or estimated percentage of the gross revenue from a solicitation campaign greater than that identified in filings with the department pursuant to ss. 496.401-496.424, or that a charitable organization or sponsor will receive an actual or estimated dollar amount or percentage per unit of goods or services purchased or used in the charitable or sponsor sales promotion that is greater than that agreed to by the commercial co-venturer and the charitable organization or sponsor. (9) Use or exploit the fact of registration or the filing of any report with any governmental agency so as to lead any person to believe that such registration in any manner constitutes an endorsement or approval by the state. However, use of the statement required in s. 496.411(3) or s. 496.412(1)(c) is not a prohibited use or exploitation. (10) Make misrepresentations or misleading statements to the effect that the donation of a contribution or the display of any sticker, emblem, or insignia offered to contributors will entitle such other person to any special treatment by emergency service employees or law enforcement officers in the performance of their official duties. (11) Solicit contributions from another person or organization while wearing the uniform of an emergency service employee or law enforcement officer, or while on duty as an emergency service employee or law enforcement officer, except where the solicitation is for an organization exempt from federal income tax under s. 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code or except when soliciting contributions to benefit an emergency service employee or law enforcement officer who has been injured in the line of duty or to benefit the family or dependents of an emergency service employee or law enforcement officer who has been killed in the line of duty. (12) Solicit contributions on behalf of another person or organization using any statement that the failure to make a contribution shall result in a reduced level of law enforcement services being provided to the public or the person solicited.

(14) Notify any other person by any means, as part of an advertising scheme or plan, that the other person has won a prize, received an award, or has been selected or is eligible to receive anything of value if the other person is required to purchase goods or services, pay any money to participate in, or submit to a promotion effort.

(19) Commingle charitable contributions with noncharitable funds. (20) Solicit or accept contributions or anything of value from a foreign source of concern. (a) For a first violation of this subsection, this prohibited act is considered involuntary, and shall result in no punitive action from the department if the charitable organization satisfies all of the following requirements: 1. Provides the department with a solicitation or contribution form containing an attestation from such foreign source or country of concern in which the person, country, or entity falsely certifies that they are not a foreign country of concern as defined in s. 496.404(13) or a foreign source of concern as defined in s. 496.404(14); 2. Provides the department with a copy of a refund to the foreign source or country of concern within 30 days after notification by the department of the prohibited act; and 3.

(3) In the event of substantial noncompliance with a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum issued or caused to be issued by the department, the department may petition the circuit court of the county in which the person subpoenaed resides or has its principal place of business for an order requiring the subpoenaed person to appear and testify and to produce such books, accounts, records, and other documents as are specified in the subpoena duces tecum. The court may grant injunctive relief restraining the person or organization from collecting contributions and such other relief, including, but not limited to, the restraint by injunction or appointment of a receiver, or any transfer, pledge, assignment, or other disposition of the person’s or organization’s assets, or any concealment, alteration, destruction, or other disposition of subpoenaed books, accounts, records, or other documents and materials as the court deems appropriate, until the person or organization has fully complied with the subpoena or subpoena duces tecum and the department has completed its investigation or examination. The court may also order the person or organization to produce a financial statement that has been audited by an independent certified public accountant. The department is entitled to the summary procedure provided in s. 51.011. Costs incurred by the department to obtain an order granting, in whole or in part, a petition for enforcement of a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum shall be taxed against the subpoenaed person or organization, and failure to comply with such order shall be contempt of court. (4) The department may enter an order imposing one or more of the penalties set forth in subsection (5) if the department finds that a charitable organization, sponsor, professional fundraising consultant, or professional solicitor, or an agent, servant, or employee thereof has: (a) Violated or is operating in violation of any of the provisions of ss. 496.401-496.424 or s. 496.426 or of the rules adopted or orders issued thereunder; (b) Made a material false statement in an application, statement, or report required to be filed under ss. 496.401-496.424 or s. 496.426; (c) Refused or failed, or any of its principal officers has refused or failed, after notice, to produce any records of such organization or to disclose any information required to be disclosed under ss. 496.401-496.424 or s. 496.426 or the rules of the department; or (d) Made a material false statement in response to any request or investigation by the department, the Department of Legal Affairs, or the State Attorney. (5) Upon a finding as set forth in subsection (4), the department may enter an order doing one or more of the following: (a) Issuing a notice of noncompliance pursuant to s. 120.695; (b) Issuing a cease and desist order that directs that the person cease and desist specified fundraising activities; (c) Refusing to register or canceling or suspending a registration; (d) Placing the registrant on probation for a period of time, subject to such conditions as the department may specify; (e) Canceling an exemption granted under s. 496.406; (f) Except as provided in paragraph (g), imposing an administrative fine not to exceed $5,000 for each act or omission that constitutes a violation of ss. 496.401-496.424 or s. 496.426 or a rule or order. With respect to a s. 501(c)(3) organization, the penalty imposed pursuant to this subsection may not exceed $500 per violation for failure to register under s. 496.405 or file for an exemption under s. 496.406(2). The penalty shall be the entire amount per violation and is not a daily penalty; and (g) Imposing an administrative fine not to exceed $10,000 for a violation of this chapter that involves fraud or deception. (6) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the administrative proceedings that could result in the entry of an order imposing any of the penalties specified in subsection (5) are governed by chapter 120, except that the applicable provisions and time limits specified in s. 496.405(7), s. 496.409(6), or s. 496.410(5) apply if the department determines that a registration should be refused. (7) The department may forward an investigative report and supporting documentation of any investigation conducted pursuant to this section to the Department of Legal Affairs. The report must identify any administrative actions that are proposed or have been commenced by the department in accordance with subsection (4). (8) The department shall report any substantiated criminal violation of ss. 496.401-496.424 or s. 496.426 to the proper prosecuting authority for prompt prosecution. (9) All fines collected by the department under subsection (5) must be paid into the General Inspection Trust Fund. (10) A finding of a violation of s. 496.415(3), (5), (6), (10), (12), (13), or (14) constitutes an immediate threat to the public health, safety, and welfare and is sufficient grounds for the department to issue an immediate order to cease and desist all solicitation activities. The order shall act as an immediate final order under s. 120.569(2)(n) and shall remain in effect until the violation has been remedied pursuant to this chapter. (11) A charitable organization or sponsor whose registration is denied or revoked for submitting a false attestation required pursuant to s. 496.405(2)(d) or (e) is subject to the penalties specified in subsection (5) at the discretion of the department.

Upon a finding that a person has violated any of these sections, a court may make any necessary order or enter a judgment including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, a declaratory judgment, the appointment of a general or special magistrate or receiver, the sequestration of assets, the reimbursement of persons from whom contributions have been unlawfully solicited, the distribution of contributions pursuant to the charitable or sponsor purpose expressed in the registration statement or pursuant to the representations made to the person solicited, the reimbursement of the department for investigative costs and attorney fees and costs, and any other equitable relief the court finds appropriate. Upon a finding that a person has violated any provision of ss. 496.401-496.424 or s. 496.426 with actual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances, a court may enter an order imposing a civil fine in the Class III category pursuant to s. 570.971 for each violation. (2) The department may conduct any investigation necessary to bring a civil action under this section including, but not limited to, administering oaths and affirmations, subpoenaing witnesses or material, and collecting evidence. (3) The department may terminate an investigation or an action upon acceptance of a person’s written assurance of voluntary compliance with ss. 496.401-496.424 or s. 496.426. Acceptance of an assurance may be conditioned on commitment to reimburse donors or to take other appropriate corrective action. An assurance is not evidence of a prior violation of any of these sections. However, unless an assurance has been rescinded by agreement of the parties or voided by a court for good cause, subsequent failure to comply with the terms of an assurance is prima facie evidence of a violation of one or more of these sections. (4) All moneys, including, but not limited to, civil penalties and attorney’s fees and costs, collected pursuant to this section and s. 496.416, shall be paid into the General Inspection Trust Fund.
