(2) “Department” means the Department of Environmental Protection. (3) “Effluent limitations” means any restriction established by the department on quantities, rates, or concentrations of chemical, physical, biological, or other constituents which are discharged from sources into waters of the state. (4) “Electrical power plant” means, for purposes of this part of this chapter, any electrical generating facility that uses any process or fuel and that is owned or operated by an electric utility, as defined in s. 403.503(14), and includes any associated facility that directly supports the operation of the electrical power plant. (5) “Enhanced nutrient-reducing onsite sewage treatment and disposal system” means an onsite sewage treatment and disposal system approved by the department as capable of meeting or exceeding a 50 percent total nitrogen reduction before disposal of wastewater in the drainfield, or at least 65 percent total nitrogen reduction combined from the onsite sewage tank or tanks and drainfield. (6) “Installation” means any structure, equipment, or facility, or appurtenances thereto, or operation which may emit air or water contaminants in quantities prohibited by rules of the department. (7) “Nutrient or nutrient-related standards” means water quality standards and criteria established for total nitrogen and total phosphorus, or their organic or inorganic forms; biological variables, such as chlorophyll a, biomass, or the structure of the phytoplankton, periphyton, or vascular plant community, that respond to a nutrient load or concentration in a predictable and measurable manner; or dissolved oxygen if it is demonstrated for the waterbody that dissolved oxygen conditions result in a biological imbalance and the dissolved oxygen responds to a nutrient load or concentration in a predictable and measurable manner. (8) “Onsite sewage treatment and disposal system” means a system that contains a standard subsurface, filled, or mound drainfield system; an aerobic treatment unit; a graywater system tank; a laundry wastewater system tank; a septic tank; a grease interceptor; a pump tank; a solids or effluent pump; a waterless, incinerating, or organic waste-composting toilet; or a sanitary pit privy that is installed or proposed to be installed beyond the building sewer on land of the owner or on other land to which the owner has the legal right to install a system. The term includes any item placed within, or intended to be used as a part of or in conjunction with, the system. The term does not include package sewage treatment facilities and other treatment works regulated under this chapter. (9) “Person” means the state or any agency or institution thereof, the United States or any agency or institution thereof, or any municipality, political subdivision, public or private corporation, individual, partnership, association, or other entity and includes any officer or governing or managing body of the state, the United States, any agency, any municipality, political subdivision, or public or private corporation. (10) “Plant” is any unit operation, complex, area, or multiple of unit operations that produce, process, or cause to be processed any materials, the processing of which can, or may, cause air or water pollution. (11) “Pollution” is the presence in the outdoor atmosphere or waters of the state of any substances, contaminants, noise, or manmade or human-induced impairment of air or waters or alteration of the chemical, physical, biological, or radiological integrity of air or water in quantities or at levels which are or may be potentially harmful or injurious to human health or welfare, animal or plant life, or property or which unreasonably interfere with the enjoyment of life or property, including outdoor recreation unless authorized by applicable law. (12) “Pollution prevention” means the steps taken by a potential generator of contamination or pollution to eliminate or reduce the contamination or pollution before it is discharged into the environment. The term includes nonmandatory steps taken to use alternative forms of energy, conserve or reduce the use of energy, substitute nontoxic materials for toxic materials, conserve or reduce the use of toxic materials and raw materials, reformulate products, modify manufacturing or other processes, improve in-plant maintenance and operations, implement environmental planning before expanding a facility, and recycle toxic or other raw materials. (13) “Regulated air pollutant” means any pollutant regulated under the federal Clean Air Act. (14) “Sewerage system” means pipelines or conduits, pumping stations, and force mains and all other structures, devices, appurtenances, and facilities used for collecting or conducting wastes to an ultimate point for treatment or disposal. (15) “Source” means any and all points of origin of a contaminant, whether privately or publicly owned or operated. (16) “State water resource implementation rule” means the rule authorized by s. 373.036, which sets forth goals, objectives, and guidance for the development and review of programs, rules, and plans relating to water resources, based on statutory policies and directives. The waters of the state are among its most basic resources. Such waters should be managed to conserve and protect water resources and to realize the full beneficial use of these resources. (17) “Stormwater management program” means the institutional strategy for stormwater management, including urban, agricultural, and other stormwater. (18) “Stormwater management system” means a system designed and constructed or implemented to control discharges that are necessitated by rainfall events, incorporating methods to collect, convey, store, absorb, inhibit, treat, use, or reuse water to prevent or reduce flooding, overdrainage, environmental degradation and water pollution or otherwise affect the quantity and quality of discharges from the system. (19) “Stormwater utility” means the funding of a stormwater management program by assessing the cost of the program to the beneficiaries based on their relative contribution to its need. It is operated as a typical utility which bills services regularly, similar to water and wastewater services. (20) “Total maximum daily load” is defined as the sum of the individual wasteload allocations for point sources and the load allocations for nonpoint sources and natural background. Prior to determining individual wasteload allocations and load allocations, the maximum amount of a pollutant that a waterbody or water segment can assimilate from all sources without exceeding water quality standards must first be calculated. (21) “Treatment works” and “disposal systems” mean any plant or other works used for the purpose of treating, stabilizing, or holding wastes. (22) “Wastes” means sewage, industrial wastes, and all other liquid, gaseous, solid, radioactive, or other substances which may pollute or tend to pollute any waters of the state.

A hazardous waste generator, transporter, or facility or other air or water contaminant source; 2. A discharger, including any nondomestic discharger which introduces any pollutant into a publicly owned treatment works; 3. Any facility, as defined in s. 376.301; or 4. A resource recovery and management facility is located or is being constructed or installed or where records which are required under this chapter, ss. 376.30-376.317, or department rule are kept. (b) Any duly authorized representative may at reasonable times have access to and copy any records required under this chapter or ss. 376.30-376.317; inspect any monitoring equipment or method; sample for any pollutants as defined in s. 376.301, effluents, or wastes which the owner or operator of such source may be discharging or which may otherwise be located on or underlying the owner’s or operator’s property; and obtain any other information necessary to determine compliance with permit conditions or other requirements of this chapter, ss. 376.30-376.317, or department rules. (c) No person shall refuse reasonable entry or access to any authorized representative of the department who requests entry for purposes of inspection and who presents appropriate credentials; nor shall any person obstruct, hamper, or interfere with any such inspection. The owner or operator of the premises shall receive a report, if requested, setting forth all facts found which relate to compliance status. (2) An inspection pursuant to subsection (1) may be conducted only after: (a) Consent for the inspection is received from the owner, operator, or person in charge; or (b) The appropriate inspection warrant as provided in this section is obtained. (3)(a) An inspection warrant as authorized by this chapter may be issued by a judge of any county court or circuit court of this state which has jurisdiction of the place or thing to be searched. (b) Upon proper affidavit being made, an inspection warrant may be issued under the provisions of this chapter or ss. 376.30-376.317: 1. When it appears that the properties to be inspected may be connected with or contain evidence of the violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or ss. 376.30-376.317 or any rule properly promulgated thereunder; or 2. When the inspection sought is an integral part of a larger scheme of systematic routine inspections which are necessary to, and consistent with, the continuing efforts of the department to ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter or ss. 376.30-376.317 and any rules adopted thereunder. (c) The judge shall, before issuing the warrant, have the application for the warrant duly sworn to and subscribed by a representative of the department; and may receive further testimony from witnesses, supporting affidavits, or depositions in writing to support the application. The affidavit and further proof, if had or required, shall set forth the facts tending to establish the grounds specified in paragraph (b) or the reasons for believing that such grounds exist. (d) Upon examination of the application and proofs submitted and if satisfied that cause exists for the issuing of the inspection warrant, the judge shall thereupon issue a warrant, signed by him or her with the name of his or her office, to any department representative, which warrant will authorize the representative forthwith to inspect the property described in the warrant.

Variances and renewals thereof may be granted for any one of the following reasons: (a) There is no practicable means known or available for the adequate control of the pollution involved. (b) Compliance with the particular requirement or requirements from which a variance is sought will necessitate the taking of measures which, because of their extent or cost, must be spread over a considerable period of time. A variance granted for this reason shall prescribe a timetable for the taking of the measures required. (c) To relieve or prevent hardship of a kind other than those provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b). Variances and renewals thereof granted under authority of this paragraph shall each be limited to a period of 24 months, except that variances granted pursuant to part II may extend for the life of the permit or certification. (2) A variance may not be granted from any provision or requirement concerning discharges of waste into waters of the state or hazardous waste management which would result in the provision or requirement being less stringent than a comparable federal provision or requirement, except as provided in s. 403.70715. However, this subsection does not prohibit the issuance of moderating provisions or requirements under state law, subject to any necessary approval by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. (3) The department shall publish notice, or shall require a petitioner for a variance to publish notice, in the Florida Administrative Register and in a newspaper of general circulation in the area affected, of proposed agency action; and the department shall afford interested persons an opportunity for a hearing on each application for a variance. If no request for hearing is filed with the department within 14 days of published notice, the department may proceed to final agency action without a hearing. (4) The department may require by rule a processing fee for and may prescribe such time limits and other conditions to the granting of a variance as it deems appropriate.

      "text": "403.7032 Recycling.— (1) The Legislature finds that the failure or inability to economically recover material and energy resources from solid waste results in the unnecessary waste and depletion of our natural resources. As the state continues to grow, so will the potential amount of discarded material that must be treated and disposed of, necessitating the improvement of solid waste collection and disposal. Therefore, the maximum recycling and reuse of such resources are considered high-priority goals of the state. (2) By the year 2020, the long-term goal for the recycling efforts of state and local governmental entities, private companies and organizations, and the general public is to recycle at least 75 percent of the municipal solid waste that would otherwise be disposed of in waste management facilities, landfills, or incineration facilities. However, any solid waste used for the production of renewable energy shall count toward the long-term recycling goal as set forth in this part. (3) Each state agency, public institution of higher learning, community college, and state university, including all buildings that are occupied by municipal, county, or state employees and entities occupying buildings managed by the Department of Management Services, must, at a minimum, annually report all recycled materials to the county using the department’s designated reporting format. Private businesses, other than certified recovered materials dealers, that recycle paper, metals, glass, plastics, textiles, rubber materials, and mulch, are encouraged to report the amount of materials they recycle to the county annually beginning January 1, 2011, using the department’s designated reporting format. Using the information provided, the department shall recognize those private businesses that demonstrate outstanding recycling efforts. Notwithstanding any other provision of state or county law, private businesses, other than certified recovered materials dealers, shall not be required to report recycling rates. Cities with less than a population of 2,500 and per capita taxable value less than $48,000 and cities with a per capita taxable value less than $30,000 are exempt from the reporting requirement specified in this subsection. (4) The Department of Environmental Protection shall develop a comprehensive recycling program that is designed to achieve the percentage under subsection (2) and submit the program to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives by January 1, 2010. The program may not be implemented until approved by the Legislature. The program must be developed in coordination with input from state and local entities, private businesses, and the public. Under the program, recyclable materials shall include, but are not limited to, metals, paper, glass, plastic, textile, rubber materials, and mulch. Components of the program shall include, but are not limited to: (a) Programs to identify environmentally preferable purchasing practices to encourage the purchase of recycled, durable, and less toxic goods. The Department of Management Services shall modify its procurement system to report on green and recycled products purchased through the system by September 30, 2011. (b) Programs to educate students in grades K-12 in the benefits of, and proper techniques for, recycling. (c) Programs for statewide recognition of successful recycling efforts by schools, businesses, public groups, and private citizens. (d) Programs for municipalities and counties to develop and implement efficient recycling efforts to return valuable materials to productive use, conserve energy, and protect natural resources. (e) Programs by which the department can provide technical assistance to municipalities and counties in support of their recycling efforts. (f) Programs to educate and train the public in proper recycling efforts. (g) Evaluation of how financial assistance can best be provided to municipalities and counties in support of their recycling efforts. (h) Evaluation of why existing waste management and recycling programs in the state have not been better used. (5) The Department of Environmental Protection shall create the Recycling Business Assistance Center by December 1, 2010. In carrying out its duties under this subsection, the department shall consult with state agency personnel appointed to serve as economic development liaisons under s. 288.021 to ensure the Recycling Business Assistance Center is positioned to succeed. The purpose of the center shall be to serve as the mechanism for coordination among state agencies and the private sector in order to coordinate policy and overall strategic planning for developing new markets and expanding and enhancing existing markets for recyclable materials in this state, other states, and foreign countries. The duties of the center must include, at a minimum: (a) Identifying and developing new markets and expanding and enhancing existing markets for recyclable materials. (b) Pursuing expanded end uses for recycled materials. (c) Targeting materials for concentrated market development efforts. (d) Developing proposals for new incentives for market development, particularly focusing on targeted materials. (e) Providing guidance on issues such as permitting, finance options for recycling market development, site location, research and development, grant program criteria for recycled materials markets, recycling markets education and information, and minimum content. (f) Coordinating the efforts of various governmental entities having market development responsibilities in order to optimize supply and demand for recyclable materials. (g) Evaluating source-reduced products as they relate to state procurement policy. The evaluation shall include, but is not limited to, the environmental and economic impact of source-reduced product purchases to the state. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “source-reduced” means any method, process, product, or technology that significantly or substantially reduces the volume or weight of a product while providing, at a minimum, equivalent or generally similar performance and service to and for the users of such materials. (h) Providing evaluation of solid waste management grants, pursuant to s. 403.7095, to reduce the flow of solid waste to disposal facilities and encourage the sustainable recovery of materials from Florida’s waste stream. (i) Providing below-market financing for companies that manufacture products from recycled materials or convert recyclable materials into raw materials for use in manufacturing pursuant to the Florida Recycling Loan Program as administered by the Florida First Capital Finance Corporation. (j) Maintaining a continuously updated online directory listing the public and private entities that collect, transport, broker, process, or remanufacture recyclable materials in the state. (k) Providing information on the availability and benefits of using recycled materials to private entities and industries in the state. (l) Distributing any materials prepared in implementing this subsection to the public, private entities, industries, governmental entities, or other organizations upon request.

      "text": "403.707 Permits.— (1) A solid waste management facility may not be operated, maintained, constructed, expanded, modified, or closed without an appropriate and currently valid permit issued by the department. The department may by rule exempt specified types of facilities from the requirement for a permit under this part if it determines that construction or operation of the facility is not expected to create any significant threat to the environment or public health. For purposes of this part, and only when specified by department rule, a permit may include registrations as well as other forms of licenses as defined in s. 120.52. Solid waste construction permits issued under this section may include any permit conditions necessary to achieve compliance with the recycling requirements of this act. The department shall pursue reasonable timeframes for closure and construction requirements, considering pending federal requirements and implementation costs to the permittee. The department shall adopt a rule establishing performance standards for construction and closure of solid waste management facilities. The standards shall allow flexibility in design and consideration for site-specific characteristics. For the purpose of permitting under this chapter, the department shall allow waste-to-energy facilities to maximize acceptance and processing of nonhazardous solid and liquid waste. (2) Except as provided in s. 403.722(6), a permit under this section is not required for the following: (a) Disposal by persons of solid waste resulting from their own activities on their own property, if such waste is ordinary household waste from their residential property or is rocks, soils, trees, tree remains, and other vegetative matter that normally result from land development operations. Disposal of materials that could create a public nuisance or adversely affect the environment or public health, such as white goods; automotive materials, such as batteries and tires; petroleum products; pesticides; solvents; or hazardous substances, is not covered under this exemption. (b) Storage in containers by persons of solid waste resulting from their own activities on their property, leased or rented property, or property subject to a homeowners’ or maintenance association for which the person contributes association assessments, if the solid waste in such containers is collected at least once a week. (c) Disposal by persons of solid waste resulting from their own activities on their property, if the environmental effects of such disposal on groundwater and surface waters are: 1. Addressed or authorized by a site certification order issued under part II or a permit issued by the department under this chapter or rules adopted pursuant to this chapter; or 2. Addressed or authorized by, or exempted from the requirement to obtain, a groundwater monitoring plan approved by the department. If a facility has a permit authorizing disposal activity, new areas where solid waste is being disposed of which are monitored by an existing or modified groundwater monitoring plan are not required to be specifically authorized in a permit or other certification. (d) Disposal by persons of solid waste resulting from their own activities on their own property, if such disposal occurred prior to October 1, 1988. (e) Disposal of solid waste resulting from normal farming operations as defined by department rule. Polyethylene agricultural plastic, damaged, nonsalvageable, untreated wood pallets, and packing material that cannot be feasibly recycled, which are used in connection with agricultural operations related to the growing, harvesting, or maintenance of crops, may be disposed of by open burning if a public nuisance or any condition adversely affecting the environment or the public health is not created by the open burning and state or federal ambient air quality standards are not violated. (f) The use of clean debris as fill material in any area. However, this paragraph does not exempt any person from obtaining any other required permits, and does not affect a person’s responsibility to dispose of clean debris appropriately if it is not to be used as fill material. (g) Compost operations that produce less than 50 cubic yards of compost per year when the compost produced is used on the property where the compost operation is located. (3)(a) All applicable provisions of ss. 403.087 and 403.088, relating to permits, apply to the control of solid waste management facilities. (b) A permit, including a general permit, issued to a solid waste management facility that is designed with a leachate control system meeting department requirements shall be issued for a term of 20 years unless the applicant requests a shorter permit term. This paragraph applies to a qualifying solid waste management facility that applies for an operating or construction permit or renews an existing operating or construction permit on or after October 1, 2012. (c) A permit, including a general permit, but not including a registration, issued to a solid waste management facility that does not have a leachate control system meeting department requirements shall be renewed for a term of 10 years, unless the applicant requests a shorter permit term, if the following conditions are met: 1. The applicant has conducted the regulated activity at the same site for which the renewal is sought for at least 4 years and 6 months before the date that the permit application is received by the department; and 2. At the time of applying for the renewal permit: a. The applicant is not subject to a notice of violation, consent order, or administrative order issued by the department for violation of an applicable law or rule; b. The department has not notified the applicant that it is required to implement assessment or evaluation monitoring as a result of exceedances of applicable groundwater standards or criteria or, if applicable, the applicant is completing corrective actions in accordance with applicable department rules; and c. The applicant is in compliance with the applicable financial assurance requirements. (d) The department may adopt rules to administer this subsection. However, the department is not required to submit such rules to the Environmental Regulation Commission for approval. Notwithstanding the limitations of s. 403.087(7)(a), permit fee caps for solid waste management facilities shall be prorated to reflect the extended permit term authorized by this subsection. (4) When application for a construction permit for a Class I solid waste disposal facility is made, it is the duty of the department to provide a copy of the application, within 7 days after filing, to the water management district having jurisdiction where the area is to be located. The water management district may prepare an advisory report as to the impact on water resources. This report must contain the district’s recommendations as to the disposition of the application and shall be submitted to the department no later than 30 days prior to the deadline for final agency action by the department. However, the failure of the department or the water management district to comply with the provisions of this subsection shall not be the basis for the denial, revocation, or remand of any permit or order issued by the department. (5) The department may not issue a construction permit pursuant to this part for a new solid waste landfill within 3,000 feet of Class I surface waters. (6) The department may issue a construction permit pursuant to this part only to a solid waste management facility that provides the conditions necessary to control the safe movement of wastes or waste constituents into surface or ground waters or the atmosphere and that will be operated, maintained, and closed by qualified and properly trained personnel. Such facility must if necessary: (a) Use natural or artificial barriers that are capable of controlling lateral or vertical movement of wastes or waste constituents into surface or ground waters. (b) Have a foundation or base that is capable of providing support for structures and waste deposits and capable of preventing foundation or base failure due to settlement, compression, or uplift. (c) Provide for the most economically feasible, cost-effective, and environmentally safe control of leachate, gas, stormwater, and disease vectors and prevent the endangerment of public health and the environment. Open fires, air-curtain incinerators, or trench burning may not be used as a means of disposal at a solid waste management facility, unless permitted by the department under s. 403.087. (7) Prior to application for a construction permit, an applicant shall designate to the department temporary backup disposal areas or processes for the resource recovery facility. Failure to designate temporary backup disposal areas or processes shall result in a denial of the construction permit. (8) The department may refuse to issue a permit to an applicant who by past conduct in this state has repeatedly violated pertinent statutes, rules, or orders or permit terms or conditions relating to any solid waste management facility and who is deemed to be irresponsible as defined by department rule. For the purposes of this subsection, an applicant includes the owner or operator of the facility, or if the owner or operator is a business entity, a parent of a subsidiary corporation, a partner, a corporate officer or director, or a stockholder holding more than 50 percent of the stock of the corporation. (9) The department shall establish a separate category for solid waste management facilities that accept only construction and demolition debris for disposal or recycling. The department shall establish a reasonable schedule for existing facilities to comply with this section to avoid undue hardship to such facilities. However, a permitted solid waste disposal unit that receives a significant amount of waste prior to the compliance deadline established in this schedule shall not be required to be retrofitted with liners or leachate control systems. (a) The department shall establish reasonable construction, operation, monitoring, recordkeeping, financial assurance, and closure requirements for such facilities. The department shall take into account the nature of the waste accepted at various facilities when establishing these requirements, and may impose less stringent requirements, including a system of general permits or registration requirements, for facilities that accept only a segregated waste stream which is expected to pose a minimal risk to the environment and public health, such as clean debris. The Legislature recognizes that incidental amounts of other types of solid waste are commonly generated at construction or demolition projects. In any enforcement action taken pursuant to this section, the department shall consider the difficulty of removing these incidental amounts from the waste stream. (b) The department shall require liners and leachate collection systems at individual disposal units and lateral expansions of existing disposal units that have not received a department permit authorizing construction or operation prior to July 1, 2010, unless the owner or operator demonstrates, based upon the types of waste received, the methods for controlling types of waste disposed of, the proximity of the groundwater and surface water, and the results of the hydrogeological and geotechnical investigations, that the facility is not expected to result in violations of the groundwater standards and criteria if built without a liner. (c) The owner or operator shall provide financial assurance for closing of the facility in accordance with the requirements of s. 403.7125. The financial assurance shall cover the cost of closing the facility and 5 years of long-term care after closing, unless the department determines, based upon hydrogeologic conditions, the types of wastes received, or the groundwater monitoring results, that a different long-term care period is appropriate. However, unless the owner or operator of the facility is a local government, the escrow account described in s. 403.7125(2) may not be used as a financial assurance mechanism. (d) The department shall establish training requirements for operators of facilities, and shall work with the State University System or other providers to assure that adequate training courses are available. The department shall also assist the Florida Home Builders Association in establishing a component of its continuing education program to address proper handling of construction and demolition debris, including best management practices for reducing contamination of the construction and demolition debris waste stream. (e) The issuance of a permit under this subsection does not obviate the need to comply with all applicable zoning and land use regulations. (f) A permit is not required under this section for the disposal of construction and demolition debris on the property where it is generated, but such property must be covered, graded, and vegetated as necessary when disposal is complete. (g) By January 1, 2012, the amount of construction and demolition debris processed and recycled prior to disposal at a permitted materials recovery facility or at any other permitted disposal facility shall be reported by the county of origin to the department and to the county on an annual basis in accordance with rules adopted by the department. The rules shall establish criteria to ensure accurate and consistent reporting for purposes of determining the recycling rate in s. 403.706 and shall also require that, to the extent economically feasible, all construction and demolition debris must be processed prior to disposal, either at a permitted materials recovery facility or at a permitted disposal facility. This paragraph does not apply to recovered materials, any materials that have been source separated and offered for recycling, or materials that have been previously processed. (h) The department shall ensure that the requirements of this section are applied and interpreted consistently throughout the state. In accordance with s. 20.255, the Division of Waste Management shall direct the district offices and bureaus on matters relating to the interpretation and applicability of this section. (i) The department shall provide notice of receipt of a permit application for the initial construction of a construction and demolition debris disposal facility to the local governments having jurisdiction where the facility is to be located. (j) The Legislature recognizes that recycling, waste reduction, and resource recovery are important aspects of an integrated solid waste management program and as such are necessary to protect the public health and the environment. If necessary to promote such an integrated program, the county may determine, after providing notice and an opportunity for a hearing prior to April 30, 2008, that some or all of the material described in s. 403.703(6)(b) shall be excluded from the definition of “construction and demolition debris” in s. 403.703(6) within the jurisdiction of such county. The county may make such a determination only if it finds that, prior to June 1, 2007, the county has established an adequate method for the use or recycling of such wood material at an existing or proposed solid waste management facility that is permitted or authorized by the department on June 1, 2007. The county is not required to hold a hearing if the county represents that it previously has held a hearing for such purpose, or if the county represents that it previously has held a public meeting or hearing that authorized such method for the use or recycling of trash or other nonputrescible waste materials and that such materials include those materials described in s. 403.703(6)(b). The county shall provide written notice of its determination to the department by no later than April 30, 2008; thereafter, the materials described in s. 403.703(6) shall be excluded from the definition of “construction and demolition debris” in s. 403.703(6) within the jurisdiction of such county. The county may withdraw or revoke its determination at any time by providing written notice to the department. (k) Brazilian pepper and other invasive exotic plant species as designated by the department resulting from eradication projects may be processed at permitted construction and demolition debris recycling facilities or disposed of at permitted construction and demolition debris disposal facilities or Class III facilities. The department may adopt rules to implement this paragraph. (10) If the department and a local government independently require financial assurance for the closure of a privately owned solid waste management facility, the department and that local government shall enter into an interagency agreement that will allow the owner or operator to provide a single financial mechanism to cover the costs of closure and any required long-term care. The financial mechanism may provide for the department and local government to be cobeneficiaries or copayees, but shall not impose duplicative financial requirements on the owner or operator. These closure costs must include at least the minimum required by department rules and must also include any additional costs required by local ordinance or regulation. (11) Before or on the same day of filing with the department of an application for a permit to construct or substantially modify a solid waste management facility, the applicant shall notify the local government having jurisdiction over the facility of the filing of the application. The applicant also shall publish notice of the filing of the application in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the facility will be located. Notice shall be given and published in accordance with applicable department rules. The department shall not issue the requested permit until the applicant has provided the department with proof that the notices required by this subsection have been given. Issuance of a permit does not relieve an applicant from compliance with local zoning or land use ordinances, or with any other law, rules, or ordinances. (12) Construction and demolition debris must be separated from the solid waste stream and segregated in separate locations at a solid waste disposal facility or other permitted site. (13) A facility shall not be considered a solid waste disposal facility solely by virtue of the fact that it uses processed yard trash or clean wood or paper waste as a fuel source. (14)(a) A permit to operate a solid waste management facility may not be transferred by the permittee to any other entity without the consent of the department. If the permitted facility is sold or transferred, or if control of the facility is transferred, the permittee must submit to the department an application for transfer of permit no later than 30 days after the transfer of ownership or control. The department shall approve the transfer of a permit unless it determines that the proposed new permittee has not provided reasonable assurance that the conditions of the permit will be met. A permit may not be transferred until any proof of financial assurance required by department rule is provided by the proposed new permittee. If the existing permittee is under a continuing obligation to perform corrective actions as a result of a department enforcement action or consent order, the permit may not be transferred until the proposed new permittee agrees in writing to accept responsibility for performing such corrective actions. (b) Until the transfer is approved by the department, the existing permittee is liable for compliance with the permit, including the financial assurance requirements. When the transfer has been approved, the department shall return to the transferring permittee any means of proof of financial assurance which the permittee provided to the department and the permittee is released from obligations to comply with the transferred permit. (c) An application for the transfer of a permit must clearly state in bold letters that the permit may not be transferred without proof of compliance with financial assurance requirements. Until the permit is transferred, the new owner or operator may not operate the facility without the express consent of the permittee. (d) The department may adopt rules to administer this subsection, including procedural rules and the permit transfer form.

The Florida House of Representatives, the Florida Senate, and the Office of the Governor, the Secretary of State, and each Cabinet officer who heads a department that occupies office space in the Capitol, shall institute a recycling program for their respective offices in the House and Senate office buildings and the Capitol. Provisions shall be made to collect and sell wastepaper and empty beverage containers generated by employee activities in these offices. The collection and sale of such materials shall be reported to Leon County using the department’s designated reporting format and coordinated with Department of Management Services recycling activities to maximize the efficiency and economy of this program. The Governor, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President of the Senate, the Secretary of State, and the Cabinet officers may authorize the use of proceeds from recyclable material sales for employee benefits and other purposes, in order to provide incentives to their respective employees for participation in the recycling program. Such proceeds may also be used to offset any costs of the recycling program. As a demonstration of leading by example, the Capitol Building’s recycling rates shall be posted on the website of the Department of Management Services and shall include the details of the recycling rates for each Department of Management Services pool facility. The Department of Environmental Protection shall post recycling rates of each state-owned facility reported to the Department of Management Services. (2) Each state agency, the judicial branch of state government, and the State University System shall collect and sell, to the greatest extent practicable, recyclable materials and products used during the operation of facilities and offices and may use the proceeds of the sale of such materials and products for employee benefits and other purposes and thereby provide incentives for employees to participate in the recycling program. Such proceeds may also be used to offset any recycling program costs. (3) The department shall develop and contract for an innovative recycling pilot project for the Capitol recycling area. The project shall be designed to collect recyclable materials and create a more sustainable recycling system. Components of the project shall be designed to increase convenience, incentivize and measure participation, reduce material volume, and assist in achieving the recycling goals enumerated in s. 403.706.

      "text": "403.9326 Exemptions.— (1) The following activities are exempt from the permitting requirements of ss. 403.9321-403.9333 and any other provision of law if no herbicide or other chemical is used to remove mangrove foliage: (a) Mangrove trimming in riparian mangrove fringe areas that meet the following criteria: 1. The riparian mangrove fringe must be located on lands owned or controlled by the person who will supervise or conduct the trimming activities or on sovereign submerged lands immediately waterward and perpendicular to the lands. 2. The mangroves that are the subject of the trimming activity may not exceed 10 feet in pretrimmed height as measured from the substrate and may not be trimmed so that the overall height of any mangrove is reduced to less than 6 feet as measured from the substrate. This exemption applies to property with a shoreline of 150 feet or less. Owners of property with a shoreline of more than 150 feet may not trim, under an exemption, more than 65 percent of the mangroves along the shoreline. (b) Mangrove trimming supervised or conducted exclusively by a professional mangrove trimmer, as defined in s. 403.9325, in riparian mangrove fringe areas that meet the following criteria: 1. The riparian mangrove fringe must be located on lands owned or controlled by the professional mangrove trimmer or by the person contracting with the professional mangrove trimmer to perform the trimming activities, or on sovereign submerged lands immediately waterward and perpendicular to such lands. 2. The mangroves that are the subject of the trimming activity may not exceed 24 feet in pretrimmed height and may not be trimmed so that the overall height of any mangrove is reduced to less than 6 feet as measured from the substrate. 3. The trimming of mangroves that are 16 feet or greater in pretrimmed height must be conducted in stages so that no more than 25 percent of the foliage is removed annually. 4. A professional mangrove trimmer that is trimming red mangroves for the first time under the exemption provided by this paragraph must notify the department or delegated local government in writing at least 10 days before commencing the trimming activities. This exemption applies to property with a shoreline of 150 feet or less. Owners of property with a shoreline of more than 150 feet may not trim, under an exemption, more than 65 percent of the mangroves along the shoreline. (c) Mangrove trimming in riparian mangrove fringe areas which is designed to reestablish or maintain a previous mangrove configuration if the mangroves to be trimmed do not exceed 24 feet in pretrimmed height. The reestablishment of a previous mangrove configuration must not result in the destruction, defoliation, or removal of mangroves. Documentation of a previous mangrove configuration may be established by affidavit of a person with personal knowledge of such configuration, through current or past permits from the state or local government, or by photographs of the mangrove configuration. Trimming activities conducted under the exemption provided by this paragraph shall be conducted by a professional mangrove trimmer when the mangroves that are the subject of the trimming activity have a pretrimmed height which exceeds 10 feet as measured from the substrate. A person trimming red mangroves for the first time under the exemption provided by this paragraph must notify the department or delegated local government in writing at least 10 days before commencing the trimming activities. (d) The maintenance trimming of mangroves that have been previously trimmed in accordance with an exemption or government authorization, including those mangroves that naturally recruited into the area and any mangrove growth that has expanded from the area subsequent to the authorization, if the maintenance trimming does not exceed the height and configuration previously established. Historically established maintenance trimming is grandfathered in all respects, notwithstanding any other provisions of law. Documentation of established mangrove configuration may be verified by affidavit of a person with personal knowledge of the configuration or by photographs of the mangrove configuration. (e) The trimming of mangrove trees by a state-licensed surveyor in the performance of her or his duties, if the trimming is limited to a swath of 3 feet or less in width. (f) The trimming of mangrove trees by a duly constituted communications, water, sewerage, electrical, or other utility company, or by a federal, state, county, or municipal agency, or by an engineer or a surveyor and mapper working under a contract with such utility company or agency, when the trimming is done as a governmental function of the agency. (g) The trimming of mangrove trees by a duly constituted communications, water, sewerage, electrical, or other utility company in or adjacent to a public or private easement or right-of-way, if the trimming is limited to those areas where it is necessary for the maintenance of existing lines or facilities or for the construction of new lines or facilities in furtherance of providing utility service to its customers and if work is conducted so as to avoid any unnecessary trimming of mangrove trees. (h) The trimming of mangrove trees by a duly constituted communications, water, sewerage, or electrical utility company on the grounds of a water treatment plant, sewerage treatment plant, or electric power plant or substation in furtherance of providing utility service to its customers, if work is conducted so as to avoid any unnecessary trimming of mangrove trees. (2) Any rule, regulation, or other provision of law must be strictly construed so as not to limit directly or indirectly the exemptions provided by this section for trimming in riparian mangrove fringe areas except as provided in s. 403.9329(7)(b). Any rule or policy of the department, or local government regulation, that directly or indirectly serves as a limitation on the exemptions provided by this section for trimming in riparian mangrove fringe areas is invalid. (3) The designation of riparian mangrove fringe areas as aquatic preserves or Outstanding Florida Waters shall not affect the use of the exemptions provided by this section.
