      "text": "102.014 Poll worker recruitment and training.— (1) The supervisor of elections shall conduct training for inspectors, clerks, and deputy sheriffs prior to each primary, general, and special election for the purpose of instructing such persons in their duties and responsibilities as election officials. The Division of Elections shall develop a statewide uniform training curriculum for poll workers, and each supervisor shall use such curriculum in training poll workers. A certificate may be issued by the supervisor of elections to each person completing such training. No person shall serve as an inspector, clerk, or deputy sheriff for an election unless such person has completed the training as required. A clerk may not work at the polls unless he or she demonstrates a working knowledge of the laws and procedures relating to voter registration, voting system operation, balloting and polling place procedures, and problem-solving and conflict-resolution skills. (2) A person who has attended previous training conducted within 2 years before the election may be appointed by the supervisor to fill a vacancy on an election board. If no person with prior training is available to fill such vacancy, the supervisor of elections may fill such vacancy in accordance with the provisions of subsection (3) from among persons who have not received the training required by this section. (3) In the case of absence or refusal to act on the part of any inspector or clerk, the supervisor shall appoint a replacement who meets the qualifications prescribed in s. 102.012(2). The inspector or clerk so appointed shall be a member of the same political party as the clerk or inspector whom he or she replaces. (4) Each supervisor of elections shall be responsible for training inspectors and clerks, subject to the following minimum requirements: (a) No clerk shall be entitled to work at the polls unless he or she has had a minimum of 3 hours of training prior to each election. (b) No inspector shall work at the polls unless he or she has had a minimum of 2 hours of training prior to each election. (5) The Department of State shall create a uniform polling place procedures manual and adopt the manual by rule. Each supervisor of elections shall ensure that the manual is available in hard copy or electronic form in every polling place. The manual shall guide inspectors, clerks, and deputy sheriffs in the proper implementation of election procedures and laws. The manual shall be indexed by subject, and written in plain, clear, unambiguous language. The manual shall provide specific examples of common problems encountered at the polls and detail specific procedures for resolving those problems. The manual shall include, without limitation: (a) Regulations governing solicitation by individuals and groups at the polling place; (b) Procedures to be followed with respect to voters whose names are not on the precinct register; (c) Proper operation of the voting system; (d) Ballot handling procedures; (e) Procedures governing spoiled ballots; (f) Procedures to be followed after the polls close; (g) Rights of voters at the polls; (h) Procedures for handling emergency situations; (i) Procedures for dealing with irate voters; (j) The handling and processing of provisional ballots; and (k) Security procedures. The Department of State shall revise the manual as necessary to address new procedures in law or problems encountered by voters and poll workers at the precincts. (6) Supervisors of elections shall work with the business and local community to develop public-private programs to ensure the recruitment of skilled inspectors and clerks. (7) The Department of State shall develop a mandatory, statewide, and uniform program for training poll workers on issues of etiquette and sensitivity with respect to voters having a disability. The program must be conducted locally by each supervisor of elections, and each poll worker must complete the program before working during the current election cycle. The supervisor of elections shall contract with a recognized disability-related organization, such as a center for independent living, family network on disabilities, deaf service bureau, or other such organization, to develop and assist with training the trainers in the disability sensitivity programs. The program must include actual demonstrations of obstacles confronted by disabled persons during the voting process, including obtaining access to the polling place, traveling through the polling area, and using the voting system.

The chair of the board of county commissioners shall appoint a member of the board of county commissioners as an alternate member of the county canvassing board or, if each member of the board of county commissioners is unable to serve or is disqualified, shall appoint an alternate member who is qualified to serve as a substitute member under paragraph (d). 3. If a member of the county canvassing board is unable to participate in a meeting of the board, the chair of the county canvassing board or his or her designee must designate which alternate member will serve as a member of the board in the place of the member who is unable to participate at that meeting. 4. If not serving as one of the three members of the county canvassing board, an alternate member may be present, observe, and communicate with the three members constituting the county canvassing board, but may not vote in the board’s decisions or determinations. (2)(a) The county canvassing board shall meet in a building accessible to the public in the county where the election occurred at a time and place to be designated by the supervisor to publicly canvass the absent electors’ ballots as provided for in s. 101.68 and provisional ballots as provided by ss. 101.048, 101.049, and 101.6925. During each meeting of the county canvassing board, each political party and each candidate may have one watcher able to view directly or on a display screen ballots being examined for signature matching and other processes. Provisional ballots cast pursuant to s. 101.049 shall be canvassed in a manner that votes for candidates and issues on those ballots can be segregated from other votes. As soon as the absent electors’ ballots and the provisional ballots are canvassed, the board shall proceed to publicly canvass the vote given each candidate, nominee, constitutional amendment, or other measure submitted to the electorate of the county, as shown by the returns then on file in the office of the supervisor. (b) Public notice of the canvassing board members, alternates, time, and place at which the county canvassing board shall meet to canvass the absent electors’ ballots and provisional ballots must be given at least 48 hours prior thereto by publication on the county’s website as provided in s. 50.0311, on the supervisor’s website, or in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the county. If the applicable website becomes unavailable or there is no newspaper of general circulation in the county, the notice must be posted in at least four conspicuous places in the county. The time given in the notice as to the convening of the meeting of the county canvassing board must be specific and may not be a time period during which the board may meet. (c) If the county canvassing board suspends or recesses a meeting publicly noticed pursuant to paragraph (b) for a period lasting more than 60 minutes, the board must post on the supervisor’s website the anticipated time at which the board expects to reconvene. If the county canvassing board does not reconvene at the specified time, the board must provide at least 2 hours’ notice, which must be posted on the supervisor’s website, before reconvening. (d) During any meeting of the county canvassing board, a physical notice must be placed in a conspicuous area near the public entrance to the building in which the meeting is taking place. The physical notice must include the names of the individuals officially serving as the county canvassing board, the names of any alternate members, the time of the meeting, and a brief statement as to the anticipated activities of the county canvassing board. (3) The canvass, except the canvass of absent electors’ returns and the canvass of provisional ballots, shall be made from the returns and certificates of the inspectors as signed and filed by them with the supervisor, and the county canvassing board shall not change the number of votes cast for a candidate, nominee, constitutional amendment, or other measure submitted to the electorate of the county, respectively, in any polling place, as shown by the returns. All returns shall be made to the board on or before 2 a.m. of the day following any primary, general, or other election. If the returns from any precinct are missing, if there are any omissions on the returns from any precinct, or if there is an obvious error on any such returns, the canvassing board shall order a retabulation of the returns from such precinct. Before canvassing such returns, the canvassing board shall examine the tabulation of the ballots cast in such precinct and determine whether the returns correctly reflect the votes cast. If there is a discrepancy between the returns and the tabulation of the ballots cast, the tabulation of the ballots cast shall be presumed correct and such votes shall be canvassed accordingly. (4)(a) The supervisor of elections shall upload into the county’s election management system by 7 p.m. on the day before the election the results of all early voting and vote-by-mail ballots that have been canvassed and tabulated by the end of the early voting period. Pursuant to ss. 101.5614(8), 101.657, and 101.68(2), the tabulation of votes cast or the results of such uploads may not be made public before the close of the polls on election day. (b) The canvassing board shall report all early voting and all tabulated vote-by-mail results to the Department of State within 30 minutes after the polls close. Thereafter, the canvassing board shall report, with the exception of provisional ballot results, updated precinct election results to the department at least every 45 minutes until all results are completely reported. The supervisor of elections shall notify the department immediately of any circumstances that do not permit periodic updates as required. Results shall be submitted in a format prescribed by the department. (5) The canvassing board shall submit on forms or in formats provided by the division unofficial returns to the Department of State for each federal, statewide, state, or multicounty office or ballot measure no later than noon on the third day after any primary election and no later than noon on the fourth day after any general or other election. Such returns shall include the canvass of all ballots as required by subsection (2). (6) If the county canvassing board determines that the unofficial returns may contain a counting error in which the vote tabulation system failed to count votes that were properly marked in accordance with the instructions on the ballot, the county canvassing board shall: (a) Correct the error and retabulate the affected ballots with the vote tabulation system; or (b) Request that the Department of State verify the tabulation software. When the Department of State verifies such software, the department shall compare the software used to tabulate the votes with the software filed with the department pursuant to s. 101.5607 and check the election parameters. (7) If the unofficial returns reflect that a candidate for any office was defeated or eliminated by one-half of a percent or less of the votes cast for such office, that a candidate for retention to a judicial office was retained or not retained by one-half of a percent or less of the votes cast on the question of retention, or that a measure appearing on the ballot was approved or rejected by one-half of a percent or less of the votes cast on such measure, a recount shall be ordered of the votes cast with respect to such office or measure. The Secretary of State is responsible for ordering recounts in federal, state, and multicounty races. The county canvassing board or the local board responsible for certifying the election is responsible for ordering recounts in all other races. A recount need not be ordered with respect to the returns for any office, however, if the candidate or candidates defeated or eliminated from contention for such office by one-half of a percent or less of the votes cast for such office request in writing that a recount not be made. (a) Each canvassing board responsible for conducting a recount shall put each marksense ballot through automatic tabulating equipment and determine whether the returns correctly reflect the votes cast. If any marksense ballot is physically damaged so that it cannot be properly counted by the automatic tabulating equipment during the recount, a true duplicate shall be made of the damaged ballot pursuant to the procedures in s. 101.5614(4). Immediately before the start of the recount, a test of the tabulating equipment shall be conducted as provided in s. 101.5612. If the test indicates no error, the recount tabulation of the ballots cast shall be presumed correct and such votes shall be canvassed accordingly. If an error is detected, the cause therefor shall be ascertained and corrected and the recount repeated, as necessary. The canvassing board shall immediately report the error, along with the cause of the error and the corrective measures being taken, to the Department of State. No later than 11 days after the election, the canvassing board shall file a separate incident report with the Department of State, detailing the resolution of the matter and identifying any measures that will avoid a future recurrence of the error. If the automatic tabulating equipment used in a recount is not part of the voting system and the ballots have already been processed through such equipment, the canvassing board is not required to put each ballot through any automatic tabulating equipment again. (b) Each canvassing board responsible for conducting a recount where touchscreen ballots were used shall examine the counters on the precinct tabulators to ensure that the total of the returns on the precinct tabulators equals the overall election return. If there is a discrepancy between the overall election return and the counters of the precinct tabulators, the counters of the precinct tabulators shall be presumed correct and such votes shall be canvassed accordingly. (c) The canvassing board shall submit on forms or in formats provided by the division a second set of unofficial returns to the Department of State for each federal, statewide, state, or multicounty office or ballot measure. The returns shall be filed no later than 3 p.m. on the 5th day after any primary election and no later than 3 p.m. on the 9th day after any general election in which a recount was ordered by the Secretary of State. If the canvassing board is unable to complete the recount prescribed in this subsection by the deadline, the second set of unofficial returns submitted by the canvassing board shall be identical to the initial unofficial returns and the submission shall also include a detailed explanation of why it was unable to timely complete the recount. However, the canvassing board shall complete the recount prescribed in this subsection, along with any manual recount prescribed in s. 102.166, and certify election returns in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. (d) The Department of State shall adopt detailed rules prescribing additional recount procedures for each certified voting system, which shall be uniform to the extent practicable. (8) The canvassing board may employ such clerical help to assist with the work of the board as it deems necessary, with at least one member of the board present at all times, until the canvass of the returns is completed. The clerical help shall be paid from the same fund as inspectors and other necessary election officials. (9) Each member, substitute member, and alternate member of the county canvassing board and all clerical help must wear identification badges during any period in which the county canvassing board is canvassing votes or engaging in other official duties. The identification badges should be worn in a conspicuous and unobstructed area, and include the name of the individual and his or her official position. (10)(a) The supervisor shall file a report with the Division of Elections on the conduct of the election no later than 20 business days after the Elections Canvassing Commission certifies the election. The report must, at a minimum, describe all of the following: 1. All equipment or software malfunctions at the precinct level, at a counting location, or within computer and telecommunications networks supporting a county location, and the steps that were taken to address the malfunctions. 2. All election definition errors that were discovered after the logic and accuracy test, and the steps that were taken to address the errors. 3. All ballot printing errors, vote-by-mail ballot mailing errors, or ballot supply problems, and the steps that were taken to address the errors or problems. 4. All staffing shortages or procedural violations by employees or precinct workers which were addressed by the supervisor of elections or the county canvassing board during the conduct of the election, and the steps that were taken to correct such issues. 5. All instances where needs for staffing or equipment were insufficient to meet the needs of the voters. 6. Any additional information regarding material issues or problems associated with the conduct of the election. (b) If a supervisor discovers new or additional information on any of the items required to be included in the report pursuant to paragraph (a) after the report is filed, the supervisor must notify the division that new information has been discovered no later than the next business day after the discovery, and the supervisor must file an amended report signed by the supervisor of elections on the conduct of the election within 10 days after the discovery. (c) Such reports must be maintained on file in the Division of Elections and must be available for public inspection. (d) The division shall review the conduct of election reports to determine what problems may be likely to occur in other elections and disseminate such information, along with possible solutions and training, to the supervisors of elections. (e) The department shall submit the analysis of these reports for the general election as part of the consolidated reports required under ss. 101.591 and 101.595 to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives by February 15 of each year following a general election. (11) The supervisor shall file with the department a copy of or an export file from the results database of the county’s voting system and other statistical information as may be required by the department, the Legislature, or the Election Assistance Commission. The department shall adopt rules establishing the required content and acceptable formats for the filings and time for filings.

      "text": "102.166 Manual recounts of overvotes and undervotes.— (1) If the second set of unofficial returns pursuant to s. 102.141 indicates that a candidate for any office was defeated or eliminated by one-quarter of a percent or less of the votes cast for such office, that a candidate for retention to a judicial office was retained or not retained by one-quarter of a percent or less of the votes cast on the question of retention, or that a measure appearing on the ballot was approved or rejected by one-quarter of a percent or less of the votes cast on such measure, a manual recount of the overvotes and undervotes cast in the entire geographic jurisdiction of such office or ballot measure shall be ordered unless: (a) The candidate or candidates defeated or eliminated from contention by one-quarter of 1 percent or fewer of the votes cast for such office request in writing that a recount not be made; or (b) The number of overvotes and undervotes is fewer than the number of votes needed to change the outcome of the election. The Secretary of State is responsible for ordering a manual recount for federal, state, and multicounty races. The county canvassing board or local board responsible for certifying the election is responsible for ordering a manual recount for all other races. A manual recount consists of a recount of marksense ballots or of digital images of those ballots by a person. (2) Any hardware or software used to identify and sort overvotes and undervotes for a given race or ballot measure must be certified by the Department of State. Any such hardware or software must be capable of simultaneously identifying and sorting overvotes and undervotes in multiple races while simultaneously counting votes. Overvotes and undervotes must be identified and sorted while recounting ballots pursuant to s. 102.141. Overvotes and undervotes may be identified and sorted physically or digitally. (3) Any manual recount shall be open to the public. (4)(a) A vote for a candidate or ballot measure shall be counted if there is a clear indication on the ballot that the voter has made a definite choice. (b) The Department of State shall adopt specific rules for the federal write-in absentee ballot and for each certified voting system prescribing what constitutes a “clear indication on the ballot that the voter has made a definite choice.” The rules shall be consistent, to the extent practicable, and may not: 1. Authorize the use of any electronic or electromechanical reading device to review a hybrid voting system ballot that is produced using a voter interface device and that contains both machine-readable fields and machine-printed text of the contest titles and voter selections, unless the printed text is illegible; 2. Exclusively provide that the voter must properly mark or designate his or her choice on the ballot; or 3. Contain a catch-all provision that fails to identify specific standards, such as “any other mark or indication clearly indicating that the voter has made a definite choice.” (c) The rule for the federal write-in absentee ballot must address, at a minimum, the following issues: 1. The appropriate lines or spaces for designating a candidate choice and, for state and local races, the office or ballot measure to be voted, including the proximity of each to the other and the effect of intervening blank lines. 2. The sufficiency of designating a candidate’s first or last name when no other candidate in the race has the same or a similar name. 3. The sufficiency of designating a candidate’s first or last name when an opposing candidate has the same or a similar name, notwithstanding generational suffixes and titles such as “Jr.,” “Sr.,” or “III.” The rule should contemplate the sufficiency of additional first names and first initials, middle names and middle initials, generational suffixes and titles, nicknames, and, in general elections, the name or abbreviation of a political party. 4. Candidate designations containing both a qualified candidate’s name and a political party, including those in which the party designated is the candidate’s party, is not the candidate’s party, has an opposing candidate in the race, or does not have an opposing candidate in the race. 5. Situations where the abbreviation or name of a candidate is the same as the abbreviation or name of a political party to which the candidate does not belong, including those in which the party designated has another candidate in the race or does not have a candidate in the race. 6. The use of marks, symbols, or language, such as arrows, quotation marks, or the word “same” or “ditto,” to indicate that the same political party designation applies to all listed offices or the elector’s approval or disapproval of all listed ballot measures. 7. Situations in which an elector designates the name of a qualified candidate for an incorrect office. 8. Situations in which an elector designates an otherwise correct office name that includes an incorrect district number. (5) Procedures for a manual recount are as follows: (a) The county canvassing board shall appoint as many counting teams of at least two electors as is necessary to manually recount the ballots. A counting team must have, when possible, members of at least two political parties. A candidate involved in the race shall not be a member of the counting team. (b) Each duplicate ballot prepared pursuant to s. 101.5614(4) or s. 102.141(7) shall be compared with the original ballot to ensure the correctness of the duplicate. (c) If a counting team is unable to determine whether the ballot contains a clear indication that the voter has made a definite choice, the ballot shall be presented to the county canvassing board for a determination. (d) The Department of State shall adopt detailed rules prescribing additional recount procedures for each certified voting system which shall be uniform to the extent practicable. The rules shall address, at a minimum, the following areas: 1. Security of ballots during the recount process; 2. Time and place of recounts; 3. Public observance of recounts; 4. Objections to ballot determinations; 5. Record of recount proceedings; 6. Procedures relating to candidate and petitioner representatives; and 7. Procedures relating to the certification and the use of automatic tabulating equipment that is not part of a voting system. (6) Nothing in this section precludes a county canvassing board or local board involved in the recount from comparing a digital image of a ballot to the corresponding physical paper ballot during a manual recount.

      "text": "102.168 Contest of election.— (1) Except as provided in s. 102.171, the certification of election or nomination of any person to office, or of the adoption of a constitutional amendment or the result on any question submitted by referendum, may be contested in the circuit court by any unsuccessful candidate for such office or nomination thereto or by any voter qualified to vote in the election related to such candidacy or constitutional amendment, or by any taxpayer, respectively. (2) Such contestant shall file a complaint, together with the fees prescribed in chapter 28, with the clerk of the circuit court within 10 days after midnight of the date the last board responsible for certifying the results officially certifies the results of the election being contested. (3) The complaint must set forth the grounds on which the contestant intends to establish his or her right to such office; or set aside the result of the election on a referendum or constitutional amendment. The grounds for contesting an election or a constitutional amendment under this section are: (a) Misconduct, fraud, or corruption on the part of any election official or any member of the canvassing board sufficient to change or place in doubt the result of the election. (b) Ineligibility of the successful candidate for the nomination or office in dispute or of the proposed constitutional amendment for placement on the ballot. (c) Receipt of a number of illegal votes or rejection of a number of legal votes sufficient to change or place in doubt the result of the election. (d) Proof that any voter, election official, or canvassing board member was given or offered a bribe or reward in money, property, or any other thing of value for the purpose of procuring the successful candidate’s nomination or election or determining the result on any question by referendum or constitutional amendment. (4) The canvassing board responsible for canvassing the election is an indispensable party defendant in county and local elections. The Elections Canvassing Commission is an indispensable party defendant in federal, state, and multicounty elections; in elections for constitutional amendments; and in elections for justice of the Supreme Court, judge of a district court of appeal, and judge of a circuit court. The successful candidate is an indispensable party to any action brought to contest the election or nomination of a candidate. The sponsor of a constitutional amendment proposed by initiative petition, identified pursuant to s. 100.371, is an indispensable party to any action brought to contest such election. (5) A statement of the grounds of contest may not be rejected, nor the proceedings dismissed, by the court for any want of form if the grounds of contest provided in the statement are sufficient to clearly inform the defendant of the particular proceeding or cause for which the nomination or election is contested. (6) A copy of the complaint shall be served upon the defendant and any other person named therein in the same manner as in other civil cases under the laws of this state. Within 10 days after the complaint has been served, the defendant must file an answer admitting or denying the allegations on which the contestant relies or stating that the defendant has no knowledge or information concerning the allegations, which shall be deemed a denial of the allegations, and must state any other defenses, in law or fact, on which the defendant relies. If an answer is not filed within the time prescribed, the defendant may not be granted a hearing in court to assert any claim or objection that is required by this subsection to be stated in an answer. (7) Any candidate, qualified elector, or taxpayer presenting such a contest to a circuit judge is entitled to an immediate hearing. However, the court in its discretion may limit the time to be consumed in taking testimony, with a view therein to the circumstances of the matter and to the proximity of any succeeding election. (8) In any contest that requires a review of the canvassing board’s decision on the legality of a provisional or vote-by-mail ballot pursuant to s. 101.048 or s. 101.68 based upon a comparison of the signature of the elector in the registration records with the signature on the provisional or vote-by-mail voter’s certificate or the provisional or vote-by-mail cure affidavit, the circuit court may not review or consider any evidence other than the signature of the elector in the registration records, the signature on the respective voter’s certificate or cure affidavit, and any supporting identification that the elector submitted with the cure affidavit. The court’s review of such issue shall be to determine only if the canvassing board abused its discretion in making its decision.
