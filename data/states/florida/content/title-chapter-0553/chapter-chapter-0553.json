      "text": "(1)It is the intent of the Legislature that the Florida Building Code and the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction be interpreted by building officials, local enforcement agencies, and the commission in a manner that protects the public safety, health, and welfare at the most reasonable cost to the consumer by ensuring uniform interpretations throughout the state and by providing processes for resolving disputes regarding interpretations of the Florida Building Code and the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction which are just and expeditious.(2)Local enforcement agencies, local building officials, state agencies, and the commission shall interpret provisions of the Florida Building Code and the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction in a manner that is consistent with declaratory statements and interpretations entered by the commission, except that conflicts between the Florida Fire Prevention Code and the Florida Building Code shall be resolved in accordance with s. 553.73(11)(c) and (d).(3)The following procedures may be invoked regarding interpretations of the Florida Building Code or the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction:(a)Upon written application by any substantially affected person or state agency or by a local enforcement agency, the commission shall issue declaratory statements pursuant to s. 120.565 relating to the enforcement or administration by local governments of the Florida Building Code or the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction.(b)When requested in writing by any substantially affected person or state agency or by a local enforcement agency, the commission shall issue a declaratory statement pursuant to s. 120.565 relating to this part and ss. 515.25, 515.27, 515.29, and 515.37. Actions of the commission are subject to judicial review under s. 120.68.(c)The commission shall review decisions of local building officials and local enforcement agencies regarding interpretations of the Florida Building Code or the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction after the local board of appeals has considered the decision, if such board exists, and if such appeals process is concluded within 25 business days.1.The commission shall coordinate with the Building Officials Association of Florida, Inc., to designate a panel composed of seven members to hear requests to review decisions of local building officials. Five members must be licensed as building code administrators under part XII of chapter 468, one member must be licensed as an architect under chapter 481, and one member must be licensed as an engineer under chapter 471. Each member must have experience interpreting or enforcing provisions of the Florida Building Code and the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction.2.Requests to review a decision of a local building official interpreting provisions of the Florida Building Code or the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction may be initiated by any substantially affected person, including an owner or builder subject to a decision of a local building official or an association of owners or builders having members who are subject to a decision of a local building official. In order to initiate review, the substantially affected person must file a petition with the commission. The commission shall adopt a form for the petition, which shall be published on the Building Code Information System. The form shall, at a minimum, require the following:a.The name and address of the county or municipality in which provisions of the Florida Building Code or the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction are being interpreted.b.The name and address of the local building official who has made the interpretation being appealed.c.The name, address, and telephone number of the petitioner; the name, address, and telephone number of the petitioner’s representative, if any; and an explanation of how the petitioner’s substantial interests are being affected by the local interpretation of the Florida Building Code or the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction.d.A statement of the provisions of the Florida Building Code or the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction which are being interpreted by the local building official.e.A statement of the interpretation given to provisions of the Florida Building Code or the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction by the local building official and the manner in which the interpretation was rendered.f.A statement of the interpretation that the petitioner contends should be given to the provisions of the Florida Building Code or the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction and a statement supporting the petitioner’s interpretation.g.Space for the local building official to respond in writing. The space shall, at a minimum, require the local building official to respond by providing a statement admitting or denying the statements contained in the petition and a statement of the interpretation of the provisions of the Florida Building Code or the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction which the local jurisdiction or the local building official contends is correct, including the basis for the interpretation.3.The petitioner shall submit the petition to the local building official, who shall place the date of receipt on the petition. The local building official shall respond to the petition in accordance with the form and shall return the petition along with his or her response to the petitioner within 5 days after receipt, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. The petitioner may file the petition with the commission at any time after the local building official provides a response. If no response is provided by the local building official, the petitioner may file the petition with the commission 10 days after submission of the petition to the local building official and shall note that the local building official did not respond.4.Upon receipt of a petition that meets the requirements of subparagraph 2., the commission shall immediately provide copies of the petition to the panel, and the commission shall publish the petition, including any response submitted by the local building official, on the Building Code Information System in a manner that allows interested persons to address the issues by posting comments.5.The panel shall conduct proceedings as necessary to resolve the issues; shall give due regard to the petitions, the response, and to comments posed on the Building Code Information System; and shall issue an interpretation regarding the provisions of the Florida Building Code or the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction within 21 days after the filing of the petition. The panel shall render a determination based upon the Florida Building Code or the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction or, if the code is ambiguous, the intent of the code. The panel’s interpretation shall be provided to the commission, which shall publish the interpretation on the Building Code Information System and in the Florida Administrative Register. The interpretation shall be considered an interpretation entered by the commission, and shall be binding upon the parties and upon all jurisdictions subject to the Florida Building Code or the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction, unless it is superseded by a declaratory statement issued by the Florida Building Commission or by a final order entered after an appeal proceeding conducted in accordance with subparagraph 7.6.It is the intent of the Legislature that review proceedings be completed within 21 days after the date that a petition seeking review is filed with the commission, and the time periods set forth in this paragraph may be waived only upon consent of all parties.7.Any substantially affected person may appeal an interpretation rendered by the panel by filing a petition with the commission. Such appeals shall be initiated in accordance with chapter 120 and the uniform rules of procedure and must be filed within 30 days after publication of the interpretation on the Building Code Information System or in the Florida Administrative Register. Hearings shall be conducted pursuant to chapter 120 and the uniform rules of procedure. Decisions of the commission are subject to judicial review pursuant to s. 120.68. The final order of the commission is binding upon the parties and upon all jurisdictions subject to the Florida Building Code or the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction.8.The burden of proof in any proceeding initiated in accordance with subparagraph 7. is on the party who initiated the appeal.9.In any review proceeding initiated in accordance with this paragraph, including any proceeding initiated in accordance with subparagraph 7., the fact that an owner or builder has proceeded with construction may not be grounds for determining an issue to be moot if the issue is one that is likely to arise in the future.This paragraph provides the exclusive remedy for addressing requests to review local interpretations of the Florida Building Code or the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction and appeals from review proceedings.(d)Upon written application by any substantially affected person, contractor, or designer, or a group representing a substantially affected person, contractor, or designer, the commission shall issue or cause to be issued a formal interpretation of the Florida Building Code or the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction as prescribed by paragraph (c).(e)Local decisions declaring structures to be unsafe and subject to repair or demolition are not subject to review under this subsection and may not be appealed to the commission if the local governing body finds that there is an immediate danger to the health and safety of the public.(f)Upon written application by any substantially affected person, the commission shall issue a declaratory statement pursuant to s. 120.565 relating to an agency’s interpretation and enforcement of the specific provisions of the Florida Building Code or the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction which the agency is authorized to enforce. This subsection does not provide any powers, other than advisory, to the commission with respect to any decision of the State Fire Marshal made pursuant to chapter 633.(g)The commission may designate a commission member who has demonstrated expertise in interpreting building plans to attend each meeting of the advisory council created in s. 553.512. The commission member may vary from meeting to meeting, shall serve on the council in a nonvoting capacity, and shall receive per diem and expenses as provided in s. 553.74(3).(h)The commission shall by rule establish an informal process of rendering nonbinding interpretations of the Florida Building Code and the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction. The commission is specifically authorized to refer interpretive issues to organizations that represent those engaged in the construction industry. The commission shall immediately implement the process before completing formal rulemaking. It is the intent of the Legislature that the commission create a process to refer questions to a small, rotating group of individuals licensed under part XII of chapter 468, to which a party may pose questions regarding the interpretation of code provisions. It is the intent of the Legislature that the process provide for the expeditious resolution of the issues presented and publication of the resulting interpretation on the Building Code Information System. Such interpretations shall be advisory only and nonbinding on the parties and the commission.(4)In order to administer this section, the commission may adopt by rule and impose a fee for filing requests for declaratory statements and binding and nonbinding interpretations to recoup the cost of the proceedings which may not exceed $125 for each request for a nonbinding interpretation and $250 for each request for a binding review or interpretation. For proceedings conducted by or in coordination with a third party, the rule may provide that payment be made directly to the third party, who shall remit to the department that portion of the fee necessary to cover the costs of the department.History.—s. 9, ch. 2005-147; s. 5, ch. 2006-65; s. 8, ch. 2007-1; s. 5, ch. 2007-187; s. 14, ch. 2008-191; s. 35, ch. 2010-176; s. 49, ch. 2013-14; s. 21, ch. 2014-154; s. 18, ch. 2016-129.",

Facilities subject to the provisions of part IV of chapter 400 may have facility plans reviewed and shall have construction surveyed by the state agency authorized to do so under the requirements of part IV of chapter 400 and the certification requirements of the Federal Government.(d)Building plans approved under s. 553.77(3) and state-approved manufactured buildings, including buildings manufactured and assembled offsite and not intended for habitation, such as lawn storage buildings and storage sheds, are exempt from local code enforcing agency plan reviews except for provisions of the code relating to erection, assembly, or construction at the site. Erection, assembly, and construction at the site are subject to local permitting and inspections. Lawn storage buildings and storage sheds bearing the insignia of approval of the department are not subject to s. 553.842. Such buildings that do not exceed 400 square feet may be delivered and installed without need of a contractor’s or specialty license.(e)Construction regulations governing public schools, state universities, and Florida College System institutions shall be enforced as provided in subsection (6).(f)The Florida Building Code as it pertains to toll collection facilities under the jurisdiction of the turnpike enterprise of the Department of Transportation shall be enforced exclusively by the turnpike enterprise.(g)Construction regulations relating to secure mental health treatment facilities under the jurisdiction of the Department of Children and Families shall be enforced exclusively by the department in conjunction with the Agency for Health Care Administration’s review authority under paragraph (c).The governing bodies of local governments may provide a schedule of fees, as authorized by s. 125.56(2) or s. 166.222 and this section, for the enforcement of the provisions of this part. Such fees shall be used solely for carrying out the local government’s responsibilities in enforcing the Florida Building Code. The authority of state enforcing agencies to set fees for enforcement shall be derived from authority existing on July 1, 1998. However, nothing contained in this subsection shall operate to limit such agencies from adjusting their fee schedule in conformance with existing authority.(2)(a)Any two or more counties or municipalities, or any combination thereof, may, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 163, governing interlocal agreements, form an enforcement district for the purpose of enforcing and administering the provisions of the Florida Building Code. Each district so formed shall be registered with the department on forms to be provided for that purpose. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to supersede provisions of county charters which preempt municipal authorities respective to building codes.(b)With respect to evaluation of design professionals’ documents, if a local government finds it necessary, in order to enforce compliance with the Florida Building Code and issue a permit, to reject design documents required by the code three or more times for failure to correct a code violation specifically and continuously noted in each rejection, including, but not limited to, egress, fire protection, structural stability, energy, accessibility, lighting, ventilation, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, and gas systems, or other requirements identified by rule of the Florida Building Commission adopted pursuant to chapter 120, the local government shall impose, each time after the third such review the plans are rejected for that code violation, a fee of four times the amount of the proportion of the permit fee attributed to plans review.(c)With respect to inspections, if a local government finds it necessary, in order to enforce compliance with the Florida Building Code, to conduct any inspection after an initial inspection and one subsequent reinspection of any project or activity for the same code violation specifically and continuously noted in each rejection, including, but not limited to, egress, fire protection, structural stability, energy, accessibility, lighting, ventilation, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, and gas systems, or other requirements identified by rule of the Florida Building Commission adopted pursuant to chapter 120, the local government shall impose a fee of four times the amount of the fee imposed for the initial inspection or first reinspection, whichever is greater, for each such subsequent reinspection.(3)(a)Each enforcement district shall be governed by a board, the composition of which shall be determined by the affected localities.(b)1.At its own option, each enforcement district or local enforcement agency may adopt rules granting to the owner of a single-family residence one or more exemptions from the Florida Building Code relating to:a.Addition, alteration, or repairs performed by the property owner upon his or her own property, provided any addition or alteration shall not exceed 1,000 square feet or the square footage of the primary structure, whichever is less.b.Addition, alteration, or repairs by a nonowner within a specific cost limitation set by rule, provided the total cost shall not exceed $5,000 within any 12-month period.c.Building and inspection fees.2.However, the exemptions under subparagraph 1. do not apply to single-family residences that are located in mapped flood hazard areas, as defined in the code, unless the enforcement district or local enforcement agency has determined that the work, which is otherwise exempt, does not constitute a substantial improvement, including the repair of substantial damage, of such single-family residences.3.Each code exemption, as defined in sub-subparagraphs 1.a., b., and c., shall be certified to the local board 10 days prior to implementation and shall only be effective in the territorial jurisdiction of the enforcement district or local enforcement agency implementing it.(4)When an enforcement district has been formed as provided herein, upon its registration with the department, it shall have the same authority and responsibility with respect to building codes as provided by this part for local governing bodies.(5)State and regional agencies with special expertise in building code standards and licensing of contractors and design professionals shall provide support to local governments upon request.(6)Notwithstanding any other law, state universities, Florida College System institutions, and public school districts shall be subject to enforcement of the Florida Building Code under this part.(a)1.State universities, Florida College System institutions, or public school districts shall conduct plan review and construction inspections to enforce building code compliance for their building projects that are subject to the Florida Building Code. These entities must use personnel or contract providers appropriately certified under part XII of chapter 468 to perform the plan reviews and inspections required by the code. Under these arrangements, the entities are not subject to local government permitting requirements, plans review, and inspection fees. State universities, Florida College System institutions, and public school districts are liable and responsible for all of their buildings, structures, and facilities. This paragraph does not limit the authority of the county, municipality, or code enforcement district to ensure that buildings, structures, and facilities owned by these entities comply with the Florida Building Code or to limit the authority and responsibility of the fire official to conduct firesafety inspections under chapter 633.2.In order to enforce building code compliance independent of a county or municipality, a state university, Florida College System institution, or public school district may create a board of adjustment and appeal to which a substantially affected party may appeal an interpretation of the Florida Building Code which relates to a specific project. The decisions of this board, or, in its absence, the decision of the building code administrator, may be reviewed under s. 553.775.(b)If a state university, Florida College System institution, or public school district elects to use a local government’s code enforcement offices:1.Fees charged by counties and municipalities for enforcement of the Florida Building Code on buildings, structures, and facilities of state universities, state colleges, and public school districts may not be more than the actual labor and administrative costs incurred for plans review and inspections to ensure compliance with the code.2.Counties and municipalities shall expedite building construction permitting, building plans review, and inspections of projects of state universities, Florida College System institutions, and public schools that are subject to the Florida Building Code according to guidelines established by the Florida Building Commission.3.A party substantially affected by an interpretation of the Florida Building Code by the local government’s code enforcement offices may appeal the interpretation to the local government’s board of adjustment and appeal or to the commission under s. 553.775 if no local board exists. The decision of a local board is reviewable in accordance with s. 553.775.(c)The Florida Building Commission and code enforcement jurisdictions shall consider balancing code criteria and enforcement to unique functions, where they occur, of research institutions by application of performance criteria in lieu of prescriptive criteria.(d)School boards, Florida College System institution boards, and state universities may use annual facility maintenance permits to facilitate routine maintenance, emergency repairs, building refurbishment, and minor renovations of systems or equipment. The amount expended for maintenance projects may not exceed $200,000 per project. A facility maintenance permit is valid for 1 year. A detailed log of alterations and inspections must be maintained and annually submitted to the building official. The building official retains the right to make inspections at the facility site as he or she considers necessary. Code compliance must be provided upon notification by the building official. If a pattern of code violations is found, the building official may withhold the issuance of future annual facility maintenance permits.This part may not be construed to authorize counties, municipalities, or code enforcement districts to conduct any permitting, plans review, or inspections not covered by the Florida Building Code. Any actions by counties or municipalities not in compliance with this part may be appealed to the Florida Building Commission. The commission, upon a determination that actions not in compliance with this part have delayed permitting or construction, may suspend the authority of a county, municipality, or code enforcement district to enforce the Florida Building Code on the buildings, structures, or facilities of a state university, Florida College System institution, or public school district and provide for code enforcement at the expense of the state university, Florida College System institution, or public school district.(7)(a)The governing bodies of local governments may provide a schedule of reasonable fees, as authorized by s. 125.56(2) or s. 166.222 and this section, for enforcing this part. These fees, and any fines or investment earnings related to the fees, may only be used for carrying out the local government’s responsibilities in enforcing the Florida Building Code, including, but not limited to, any process or enforcement related to obtaining or finalizing a building permit. When providing a schedule of reasonable fees, the total estimated annual revenue derived from fees, and the fines and investment earnings related to the fees, may not exceed the total estimated annual costs of allowable activities. Any unexpended balances must be carried forward to future years for allowable activities or must be refunded at the discretion of the local government. A local government may not carry forward an amount exceeding the average of its operating budget for enforcing the Florida Building Code for the previous 4 fiscal years. For purposes of this subsection, the term “operating budget” does not include reserve amounts. Any amount exceeding this limit must be used as authorized in subparagraph 2. However, a local government that established, as of January 1, 2019, a Building Inspections Fund Advisory Board consisting of five members from the construction stakeholder community and carries an unexpended balance in excess of the average of its operating budget for the previous 4 fiscal years may continue to carry such excess funds forward upon the recommendation of the advisory board. The basis for a fee structure for allowable activities must relate to the level of service provided by the local government and must include consideration for refunding fees due to reduced services based on services provided as prescribed by s. 553.791, but not provided by the local government. Fees charged must be consistently applied.1.As used in this subsection, the phrase “enforcing the Florida Building Code” includes the direct costs and reasonable indirect costs associated with review of building plans, building inspections, reinspections, and building permit processing; building code enforcement; and fire inspections associated with new construction. The phrase may also include training costs associated with the enforcement of the Florida Building Code and enforcement action pertaining to unlicensed contractor activity to the extent not funded by other user fees.2.A local government must use any excess funds that it is prohibited from carrying forward to rebate and reduce fees, to upgrade technology hardware and software systems to enhance service delivery, to pay for the construction of a building or structure that houses a local government’s building code enforcement agency, or for training programs for building officials, inspectors, or plans examiners associated with the enforcement of the Florida Building Code. Excess funds used to construct such a building or structure must be designated for such purpose by the local government and may not be carried forward for more than 4 consecutive years. An owner or builder who has a valid building permit issued by a local government for a fee, or an association of owners or builders located in the state that has members with valid building permits issued by a local government for a fee, may bring a civil action against the local government that issued the permit for a fee to enforce this subparagraph.3.The following activities may not be funded with fees adopted for enforcing the Florida Building Code:a.Planning and zoning or other general government activities not related to obtaining a building permit.b.Inspections of public buildings for a reduced fee or no fee.c.Public information requests, community functions, boards, and any program not directly related to enforcement of the Florida Building Code.d.Enforcement and implementation of any other local ordinance, excluding validly adopted local amendments to the Florida Building Code and excluding any local ordinance directly related to enforcing the Florida Building Code as defined in subparagraph 1.4.A local government must use recognized management, accounting, and oversight practices to ensure that fees, fines, and investment earnings generated under this subsection are maintained and allocated or used solely for the purposes described in subparagraph 1.5.The local enforcement agency, independent district, or special district may not require at any time, including at the time of application for a permit, the payment of any additional fees, charges, or expenses associated with:a.Providing proof of licensure under chapter 489;b.Recording or filing a license issued under this chapter;c.Providing, recording, or filing evidence of workers’ compensation insurance coverage as required by chapter 440; ord.Charging surcharges or other similar fees not directly related to enforcing the Florida Building Code.(b)By December 31, 2020, the governing body of a local government that provides a schedule of fees shall create a building permit and inspection utilization report and post the report on its website. The information in the report shall be derived from relevant information available in the most recently completed financial audit. After December 31, 2020, the governing body of a local government that provides a schedule of fees shall update its building permit and inspection utilization report before making any adjustments to the fee schedule. The report shall include:1.Direct and indirect costs incurred by the local government to enforce the Florida Building Code, including costs related to:a.Personnel services costs, including salary and related employee benefit costs incurred by the local government to enforce the Florida Building Code.b.Operating expenditures and expenses.2.Permit and inspection utilization information, including:a.Number of building permit applications submitted.b.Number of building permits issued or approved.c.Number of building inspections and reinspections requested.d.Number of building inspections and reinspections conducted.e.Number of building inspections conducted by a private provider.f.Number of audits conducted by the local government of private provider building inspections.g.Number of personnel dedicated by the local government to enforce the Florida Building Code, issue building permits, and conduct inspections.h.Other permissible activities for enforcing the Florida Building Code as described in subparagraph (a)1.3.Revenue information, including:a.Revenue derived from fees pursuant to paragraph (a).b.Revenue derived from fines pursuant to paragraph (a).c.When applicable, investment earnings from the local government’s investment of revenue derived from fees and fines pursuant to paragraph (a).d.Balances carried forward by the local government pursuant to paragraph (a).e.Balances refunded by the local government pursuant to paragraph (a).f.Revenue derived from other sources, including local government general revenue.(c)The governing body of a local government that issues building permits may charge a person only one search fee, in an amount commensurate with the research and time costs incurred by the governing body, for identifying building permits for each unit or subunit assigned by the governing body to a particular tax parcel identification number.(8)Effective January 1, 2023, local governments located in areas designated in the Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster declarations for Hurricane Ian or Hurricane Nicole may not raise building inspection fees, as authorized by s. 125.56(2) or s. 166.222 and this section, before October 1, 2024. This subsection expires June 30, 2025.(9)The Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is not subject to local government permitting requirements, plan review, or inspection fees for agricultural structures, such as equipment storage sheds and pole barns that are not used by the public.(10)A single-family or two-family dwelling that is converted into a certified recovery residence, as defined in s. 397.311, or a recovery residence, as defined in s. 397.311, that has a charter from an entity recognized or sanctioned by Congress does not have a change of occupancy as defined in the Florida Building Code solely due to such conversion.History.—s. 11, ch. 74-167; s. 3, ch. 75-111; s. 5, ch. 77-365; s. 3, ch. 85-97; s. 805, ch. 97-103; ss. 50, 51, ch. 98-287; ss. 85, 86, ch. 2000-141; ss. 34, 35, ch. 2001-186; ss. 3, 4, ch. 2001-372; s. 87, ch. 2002-1; s. 27, ch. 2002-20; s. 12, ch. 2005-147; s. 64, ch. 2006-1; s. 15, ch. 2008-191; s. 37, ch. 2010-176; s. 127, ch. 2014-17; s. 276, ch. 2014-19; s. 23, ch. 2014-154; s. 21, ch. 2016-129; s. 10, ch. 2017-149; s. 7, ch. 2019-75; s. 3, ch. 2019-121; s. 6, ch. 2021-128; s. 5, ch. 2021-201; s. 4, ch. 2021-212; s. 6, ch. 2022-136; s. 13, ch. 2023-304; s. 6, ch. 2024-191; s. 3, ch. 2025-177.",
