      "text": "514.0115 Exemptions from supervision or regulation; variances.— (1) Private pools and water therapy facilities connected with facilities connected with hospitals, medical doctors’ offices, and licensed physical therapy establishments shall be exempt from supervision under this chapter. (2)(a) Pools serving no more than 32 condominium or cooperative units which are not operated as a public lodging establishment shall be exempt from supervision under this chapter, except for water quality. (b) Pools serving condominium or cooperative associations of more than 32 units and whose recorded documents prohibit the rental or sublease of the units for periods of less than 60 days are exempt from supervision under this chapter, except that the condominium or cooperative owner or association must file applications with the department and obtain construction plans approval and receive an initial operating permit. The department shall inspect the swimming pools at such places annually, at the fee set forth in s. 514.033(3), or upon request by a unit owner, to determine compliance with department rules relating to water quality and lifesaving equipment. The department may not require compliance with rules relating to swimming pool lifeguard standards. (3) Pools serving homeowners’ associations and other property associations which have no more than 32 units or parcels and are not operated as public lodging establishments are exempt from supervision under this chapter, except for supervision necessary to ensure water quality and compliance with s. 514.0315, and are subject to ss. 514.05 and 514.06. (4) A private pool used for instructional purposes in swimming shall not be regulated as a public pool. (5) Any pool serving a residential child care agency registered and exempt from licensure pursuant to s. 409.176 shall be exempt from supervision or regulation under this chapter related to construction standards if the pool is used exclusively by the facility’s residents and if admission may not be gained by the public. (6) A portable pool used exclusively for providing swimming lessons or related instruction in support of an established educational program sponsored or provided by a school district may not be regulated as a public pool. (7) A temporary pool may not be regulated as a public pool. (8) Until such time as the department adopts rules for the supervision and regulation of surf pools, a surf pool that is larger than 4 acres is exempt from supervision under this chapter if the surf pool is permitted by a local government pursuant to a special use permit process in which the local government asserts regulatory authority over the construction of the surf pool and, in consultation with the department, establishes through the local government’s special use permitting process the conditions for the surf pool’s operation, water quality, and necessary lifesaving equipment. This subsection does not affect the department’s or a county health department’s right of entry pursuant to s. 514.04 or its authority to seek an injunction pursuant to s. 514.06 to restrain the operation of a surf pool permitted and operated under this subsection if the surf pool presents significant risks to public health. For the purposes of this subsection, the term “surf pool” means a pool that is designed to generate waves dedicated to the activity of surfing on a surfboard or an analogous surfing device commonly used in the ocean and intended for sport, as opposed to the general play intent of wave pools, other large-scale public swimming pools, or other public bathing places. (9) The department may grant variances from any rule adopted under this chapter pursuant to procedures adopted by department rule. The department may also grant, pursuant to procedures adopted by department rule, variances from the provisions of the Florida Building Code specifically pertaining to public swimming pools and bathing places when requested by the pool owner or the pool owner’s representative to relieve hardship in cases involving deviations from the Florida Building Code provisions, when it is shown that the hardship was not caused intentionally by the action of the applicant, where no reasonable alternative exists, and the health and safety of the pool patrons is not at risk.

The department shall review and revise such rules as necessary, but not less than biennially. Sanitation and safety standards shall be limited to matters relating to source of water supply; microbiological, chemical, and physical quality of water in the pool or bathing area; method of water purification, treatment, and disinfection; lifesaving apparatus; and measures to ensure safety of bathers. (2) The department may not establish by rule any regulation governing the design, alteration, modification, or repair of public swimming pools and bathing places which has no impact on sanitation and safety of persons using public swimming pools and bathing places. Further, the department may not adopt by rule any regulation governing the construction, erection, or demolition of public swimming pools and bathing places. It is the intent of the Legislature to preempt those functions to the Florida Building Commission through adoption and maintenance of the Florida Building Code. The department shall provide technical assistance to the commission in updating the construction standards of the Florida Building Code which govern public swimming pools. This subsection does not abrogate the authority of the department to adopt and enforce appropriate sanitary regulations and requirements as authorized in subsection (1).

The purpose of the program is to increase water safety in this state by offering vouchers for swimming lessons at no cost to families with an income of no more than 200 percent of the federal poverty level who have one or more children 4 years of age or younger. (2) The department shall do all of the following to implement the program: (a) Establish a network of swimming lesson vendors that will accept the vouchers offered by the program in exchange for providing swimming lessons. To establish the network, the department may contract directly with swimming lesson vendors or contract with one or more nonprofit organizations that promote swimming safety to subcontract with and manage swimming lesson vendors in one or more counties, or both. To ensure that swimming lessons are available throughout this state, the department, either directly or through a contracted nonprofit organization, must attempt to secure at least one such vendor in each county. Any swimming lesson vendor that offers swimming lessons at a public pool that is owned or maintained by a county or municipality must, if requested by the department or by a nonprofit organization contracted by the department, participate in the program. (b) Establish a method for members of the public to apply for swimming lesson vouchers and for determining an applicant’s eligibility. The department shall establish eligibility criteria necessary for a family to receive one or more vouchers from the program, including, but not limited to, the following: 1. The age of each child for whom a voucher is being sought, who may be no more than 4 years of age. 2. The family income level, which may be up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level. 3. The family’s address of residency in this state. (c) Subject to specific appropriation, issue vouchers to eligible applicants. (3) The department may seek grants or other public or private funding for the program. (4) The department shall adopt rules to implement the program. History.—s. 1, ch. 2024-89.
