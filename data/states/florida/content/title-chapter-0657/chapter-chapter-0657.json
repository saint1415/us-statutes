      "text": "657.008 Place of doing business.— (1) A credit union authorized to transact business pursuant to the laws of this state shall have one principal place of doing business as designated in its bylaws and where legal process may be served. A credit union may change its place of business through an amendment to its bylaws. (2) Following 30 days’ prior written notification to the office or within such other time as is approved by the office, a credit union operating in a safe and sound manner may maintain branches without requiring prior office examination and approval at locations other than its main office or relocate branches previously established if the maintenance of such branches is determined by the board of directors to be reasonably necessary to furnish service to its members. (a) A credit union that requires office examination and approval before establishing or relocating a branch must submit a written application in such form and supported by such information, data, and records as the commission or office may require to make all findings necessary for approval. Upon receiving the application and a nonrefundable filing fee for the establishment of the branch, the office shall consider the following in determining whether to reject or approve the application: 1. The sufficiency of the net worth of the credit union in relation to its deposit liabilities, including the proposed branch, and the additional fixed assets, if any, which are proposed for the branch and its operations without undue risk to the credit union or its depositors; 2. The sufficiency of earnings and earnings prospects of the credit union necessary to support the anticipated expenses and operating losses of the branch during its formative or initial years; 3. The sufficiency and quality of management available to operate the branch; 4. The name of the proposed branch in order to determine if it reasonably identifies the branch as a branch of the main office and is not likely to unduly confuse the public; and 5. The substantial compliance of the applicant with the applicable law governing its operations. (b) If any branch is located outside this state, the cost of examining such branch shall be borne by the credit union. Such cost includes, but is not limited to, examiner travel expense and per diem. (3) A credit union may share office space with one or more credit unions and contract with any person or corporation to provide facilities or personnel. (4) A credit union organized under this state or federal law, the members of which are presently, or were at the time of admission into the credit union, employees of the state or a political subdivision or municipality thereof, or members of the immediate families of such employees, may apply for space in any building owned or leased by the state or respective political subdivision or municipality in the community or district in which the credit union does business. (a) The application shall be addressed to the officer charged with the allotment of space in such building. If space is available, the officer may allot space to the credit union at a reasonable charge for rent or services. (b) If the governing body having jurisdiction over the building determines that the services rendered by the credit union to the employees of the governing body are equivalent to a reasonable charge for rent or services, available space may be allotted to the credit union without charge for rent or services. (5)(a) The office may authorize foreign credit unions to establish branches in this state if all of the following criteria are met: 1. The state in which the foreign credit union’s home office is located permits Florida credit unions to do business in the state under restrictions that are no greater than those placed upon a domestic credit union doing business in that state. For this purpose, such restrictions must include any fees, bonds, or other charges levied on domestic credit unions doing business in that state. 2. The deposits of such foreign credit union and its proposed Florida branch must have insurance of accounts with the National Credit Union Administration. 3. The credit union’s field of membership is so limited as to be within that meaning of that term as defined in s. 657.002. (b) Every foreign credit union operating in this state must keep the office informed of every location at which it is operating. (c) If the office has reason to believe that a foreign credit union is operating a branch in this state in an unsafe and unsound manner, it shall have the right to examine such branch. If, upon examination, the office finds that such branch is operating in an unsafe and unsound manner, it shall require the branch office to make appropriate modifications to bring the branch operations into compliance with generally accepted credit union operation in this state. The foreign credit union shall reimburse the office for the full cost of such examination. Costs include examiner salaries, per diem, and travel expenses. (d) Any foreign credit union operating in this state shall, in any connection therewith, be subject to suit in the courts of this state by this state and by the residents of this state. (6) A credit union may provide, directly or through a contract with another company, off-premises armored car services to its members. Armored car services do not constitute a branch for the purposes of this section.

(2) Except as provided in s. 607.0304 or specific provisions of the financial institutions codes, the validity of a credit union’s action, including, but not limited to, any conveyance, transfer, or encumbrance of real or personal property to or by a credit union, may not be challenged on the ground that the credit union lacks or lacked power to act. (3) A credit union formed under this chapter shall operate as a financial institution, consistent with the provisions of chapter 655 and this chapter, and may exercise such incidental powers as are necessary or required to effectively carry out the purposes for which the credit union was organized, provided the exercise of powers is approved by rule or order of the commission or office.

(2) For credit unions that have been opened for 5 years or more, the total unsecured obligations outstanding from any member must not exceed the greater of $500 or 15 percent of the equity of the credit union. However, the total obligations outstanding from any member must not exceed the greater of $1,000 or 25 percent of the equity of the credit union. The limitations provided in this subsection do not apply to loans that are fully secured by assignment of shares or deposits in the lending credit union. (3) For credit unions that have been opened for less than 5 years, the limitation on total obligations outstanding to any member is 10 percent of the credit union’s capital. The limitations provided in this subsection do not apply to loans that are fully secured by assignment of shares or deposits in the lending credit union. (4) The credit committee or credit manager may approve in advance, upon request of a member, a line of credit, and disbursements may be granted to such member within the limit of such line of credit. When a line of credit has been approved, no additional credit applications are required as long as the aggregate obligation does not exceed the limit of such line of credit; however, no additional disbursements may be made to any member whose existing extensions of credit are in default or are subject to adverse classification without receiving current financial information. (5) Loans secured by mortgages on real property must be made in accordance with written policies of the board of directors and rules of the commission. (6) In computing a person’s total obligations outstanding, all loans endorsed or guaranteed as to repayment by that person and any related interest of such person must be included. The credit union must also include all of the person’s potential liabilities and obligations resulting from the person’s derivatives transactions, repurchase agreements, securities lending and borrowing transactions, credit default swaps, and similar contracts. (7) A loan may be made to any corporation in which the credit union holds an equity interest. (8) The loan limitations stated in this section shall not be enlarged by the provision of any other section of this chapter. (9) Any approval of extension of credit requiring approval of the board of directors shall be recorded in the minutes of the board, including the borrower’s account number or other code, the amount of the loan, the maturity of the loan, and the general type of security. (10) The commission may adopt rules to provide for minimum documentation and safe lending procedures necessary to protect the members’ funds. (11) A credit union may participate in extensions of credit jointly with other credit unions, corporations, or financial institutions. (12) A credit union may participate in guaranteed loan programs of the federal and state governments, provided the borrower is a member of the credit union. (13) If approved by the board of directors, a credit union may extend credit to other credit unions in an amount not greater than 25 percent of the capital of the lending credit union. (14) A credit union may purchase the conditional sales contracts, notes, and similar instruments of its members, provided that the credit union could have originally made the loan. (15) A credit union may issue credit cards and debit cards to allow members to obtain access to their shares, deposits, and extensions of credit, if such issuance is not inconsistent with the rules of the commission. The commission may, by rule, allow the use of devices similar to credit cards and debit cards to allow members to obtain access to their shares, deposits, and extensions of credit.

An investment decision may not be based solely on the rating of the bond or other obligation by an investment rating service. The office may require a credit union to divest itself of an investment that the office determines creates excessive risk or the associated risk exceeds the ability of the credit union to properly evaluate and manage. (c) With prior office approval, any investment permitted in this section may also be made indirectly by investment in a trust or mutual fund, the investments of which are limited as set forth in this section. The credit union must maintain a current file on each investment which contains sufficient information to determine whether the investment complies with the requirements of this section. If the investment fails to comply, the credit union must divest itself of its investment, unless otherwise approved by the office.

(2) The liquidator must be appointed by the office. The National Credit Union Administration must be given the right of first refusal. The office may appoint another entity if refused by the primary insurer. (3) Upon appointment and in accordance with the directions of the office, the liquidator shall take possession and charge of all of the assets, books, and records of the credit union and shall take charge of the affairs, business, and operations of the credit union and shall have all of the powers of the board of directors, credit committee, credit manager, and supervisory committee of the credit union. The liquidator shall continue the business operation of the credit union for a period not to exceed 180 days, subject to the direction of the office. The liquidator shall have full authority to make loans and investments and to permit deposits to or withdrawals from accounts by members, except that during the period of such operation by the liquidator, no withdrawal from any account or accounts which are not fully insured shall be permitted. Except when prohibited by federal or state law, the liquidator may, without penalty or liability, prepay any deposit accounts; terminate any contracts or agreements with employees, independent contractors, or consultants; terminate any contract or agreement with any person to provide goods, products, or services if the performance of such contract would adversely affect the safety or soundness of the credit union; and terminate or assign any lease for property. The liquidator shall proceed with a liquidation of assets by sale or transfer of assets and conversion of assets into cash or liquid investments in preparation for distribution to members on account of shares and deposits. The liquidator shall have specific authority to sell loan assets. The liquidator may enter into agreements for the sale or transfer of loans and other assets with the assumption of outstanding share and deposit accounts, which assumption constitutes full and complete distribution to members on account of shares and deposits. (4) On the completion of the liquidation and certification by the liquidator that the distribution of the assets of the credit union has been completed, the office shall cancel the certificate of authorization of the credit union. The office may designate a custodian to maintain the books and records of the liquidated credit union. (5) When the liquidating agent of the credit union has been appointed, the office may waive or deem inapplicable the fees required by this chapter and the examination required by s. 655.045(1) if the liquidating agent submits periodic reports to the office on the status of the liquidation.

      "text": "657.064 Voluntary liquidation.—A credit union may elect to dissolve voluntarily and liquidate its affairs in the following manner: (1) Before considering any resolution pertaining to voluntary liquidation by the board of directors, the credit union must inform the office and the National Credit Union Administration of the time and place of the meeting of the board of directors. The notification must be transmitted at least 10 days before the board of directors meets. (2) The board of directors, pursuant to this section, shall, by resolution, recommend to the membership that the credit union be dissolved and shall state the board’s reasons for such recommendation. (3) Within 10 days after adoption by the board of directors of the resolution proposing voluntary liquidation, a copy of the resolution shall be mailed to each member, giving notice of the time, location, and purpose of a special membership meeting, which must be held not less than 10 nor more than 20 days following the mailing of the resolution. Included in this notice shall be a mail ballot, allowing each member to vote in favor of or against the proposed voluntary liquidation. All ballots which are received by the credit union prior to the time set for the special membership meeting shall be counted together with the ballots cast at the meeting to determine whether the membership approves of the voluntary liquidation. Adequate procedures shall be established to provide that each member shall have but one vote. A majority of the votes cast by the members must be in favor of voluntary liquidation for the credit union to be voluntarily liquidated. Those casting ballots by mail or at the meeting constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at such special meeting, notwithstanding any contrary bylaw provision. (4) Upon adoption by the board of directors of a resolution recommending that the credit union be voluntarily liquidated, the office or the National Credit Union Administration may restrict control or give directions with respect to the continued business of the credit union pending consideration of the voluntary liquidation by the members. During such period, no member shall withdraw an aggregate amount in excess of the insurance or guaranty covered by the credit union. No new extensions of credit shall be funded during the period between the board of directors’ adoption of the resolution recommending the voluntary liquidation and the membership meeting called to consider the voluntary liquidation, except for loans fully secured by a pledge of shares and for the funding of outstanding loan commitments approved before the board of directors adopts the resolution. (5) The notice required by subsection (3) shall also be mailed to the office and the National Credit Union Administration within 5 days after the action of the board of directors. Within 10 days after the meeting of the membership, the board of directors shall notify the office and the National Credit Union Administration in writing of the action taken by the members. (6) If the voluntary liquidation is approved by the membership, the board of directors shall appoint a liquidator to proceed with the liquidation. All reasonable and necessary expenses of operation during the period of liquidation shall continue to be paid as authorizable by the board of directors. When all assets from which there is a reasonable expectancy of realization have been fully paid, the remaining liquidation proceeds shall be paid and distributed to the members, ratably according to the balances in the share accounts as of the close of the last business day preceding the date of the resolution of the board of directors pursuant to subsection (2). (7) The National Credit Union Administration shall have the right of first refusal to be appointed as liquidator of any liquidating credit union which it insures. The liquidator shall have all of the powers provided in s. 657.063 regarding involuntary liquidation. If the National Credit Union Administration declines to serve as liquidator, the board of directors shall appoint a reasonable person as liquidator and specify the extent of responsibilities and authority delegated to the liquidator. (8) When the liquidating agent of the credit union has been appointed, the office may waive or hold inapplicable the fees required by this chapter and the examination required by s. 655.045(1) if the liquidating agent submits periodic reports to the office on the status of the liquidation. (9) Whenever the board of directors or liquidator determines that all assets from which there is a reasonable expectancy of realization have been liquidated and distributed to the members, a certificate of dissolution on forms prescribed by the commission shall be prepared and filed with the office together with all pertinent books and records of the credit union, and thereupon the credit union shall be dissolved and its certificate of authorization canceled. The office may designate a custodian to maintain the books and records of the liquidated credit union.

      "text": "657.065 Merger.— (1) Upon the filing of an application with the office by the constituent credit unions, and upon approval by the office, credit unions may be merged with a surviving state credit union, as prescribed in this code, except that the action by a merging federal credit union must be taken in the manner prescribed by, and is subject to, any limitations or requirements imposed by federal law and regulations. The application must be accompanied by a merger plan and agreement together with a certified copy of the authorizing resolutions of the board of directors of constituent credit unions showing approval by a majority of the entire board of directors of each credit union, as provided in this section, and a nonrefundable application fee of $500. The fee may be waived by the office for a merger under subsection (6). (2) Nothing in the law of this state shall restrict the right of a state credit union to merge with a surviving federal credit union. In such case, the action to be taken by a merging state credit union, and its rights and liabilities and those of its members, shall be the same as those prescribed for merging federal credit unions at the time of the action by applicable federal law or regulations. (3) If the resulting credit union will be a state credit union, the merging credit unions shall adopt a merger plan and agreement stating the method, terms, and conditions of the merger, including all agreements concerning the merger. The board of directors of each constituent credit union must, by majority vote of the entire board, approve the merger plan and agreement, which shall contain: (a) The name and address of the merging and surviving credit unions; (b) The date, time, and place of the meeting where the merger plan and agreement was approved by the merging and the surviving credit unions’ boards of directors; (c) The name and address of the main office of the surviving credit union and each continuing branch office; (d) The names, terms, and board positions of the surviving credit union’s board of directors; (e) The name and title of each executive officer; (f) A list of any needed amendments to the surviving credit union’s bylaws, if applicable, and, attached to the agreement, copies of the amendments; (g) A statement that the merger and the merger plan and agreement are subject to approval by the office and the National Credit Union Administration; and (h) Such additional provisions not contrary to law as are agreed upon by the constituent credit unions and such other provisions as the office requires to enable it to discharge its duties with respect to the merger. (4) The office shall approve the application and the merger plan and agreement if it finds that: (a) The surviving credit union’s net worth is adequate; and (b) The merger will not impair the ongoing viability of the surviving credit union. If the office disapproves a merger plan and agreement, it shall state its objections and, chapter 120 notwithstanding, give an opportunity to the merging and surviving credit unions to amend the merger plan and agreement to eliminate such objections. (5) Approval by the office, by final order or otherwise, of the application and merger plan and agreement shall be deemed subject to approval by the membership of the merging credit union who vote on the merger at a meeting duly called for that purpose. Such approval shall be documented by the submission of a copy of: (a) The notice of intent to merge given to the surviving credit union; (b) The notice to the members of the merging credit union of the meeting duly called to consider the merger. Such notice must disclose the purpose of the meeting and the date, time, and place of the meeting; and (c) The resolution adopted by the membership confirming the vote on the merger. Unless the approval of the merging credit union has been obtained and proper evidence thereof submitted to the office within 6 months after the approval by the office, the approval by the office of the merger and merger plan and agreement shall be deemed to be revoked and terminated; however, the office on its own motion, or at the request of the merging or surviving credit unions for good cause shown, may extend the time for a period not to exceed 6 months. (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or of chapter 120, a credit union may merge without the vote of the membership when the office determines that the credit union is in danger of insolvency or that the credit union is significantly undercapitalized, as defined in s. 216, the Federal Credit Union Act, codified at 12 U.S.C. s. 1790d and the merger will enable the credit union to avoid liquidation. (7) A merger with a resulting state credit union may not take place or be effective unless approved by the National Credit Union Administration and the office issues a certificate of merger. Upon consummation of the merger, the certificate of authorization of the merged credit union shall be returned to the proper authority to be canceled. Also, at consummation, all property and property rights of, and members’ interest in, the merged credit union shall vest in the surviving credit union without deed, endorsement, or other instrument of transfer, and all debts, obligations, and liabilities of the merged credit union must be assumed by the surviving credit union under the certificate of authorization under which the merger was affected. All members of the surviving credit union have the same rights, privileges, and responsibilities after the merger is completed. The certificate of merger must be recorded in the public records of all counties in which the merging credit union owned any real property at the effective date of the merger.
