The department shall examine each applicant who the board certifies: (a) Has completed the application form and remitted a nonrefundable application fee set by the board not to exceed $100 and an examination fee set by the board not to exceed $350. (b) Is at least 18 years of age. (c) Has received a degree from a school or college of podiatric medicine or chiropody recognized and approved by the Council on Podiatry Education of the American Podiatric Medical Association. For applicants who matriculated prior to 1953, the course of study shall have been at least 3 years. For applicants who matriculated during or subsequent to 1953, the course of study shall be at least 4 years or the total hourly equivalent of a 4-year course of study. (d) Has satisfactorily completed one of the following clinical experience requirements: 1. One year of residency in a residency program approved by the board, and if it has been 4 or more years since the completion of that residency, active licensed practice of podiatric medicine in another jurisdiction for at least 2 of the immediately preceding 4 years, or successful completion of a board-approved postgraduate program or board-approved course within the year preceding the filing of the application. For the purpose of this subparagraph, “active licensed practice” means the licensed practice of podiatric medicine as defined in s. 461.003(5) by podiatric physicians, including podiatric physicians employed by any governmental entity, on the active teaching faculty of an accredited school of podiatric medicine, or practicing administrative podiatric medicine. 2.

(2)(a) The department shall issue a license to practice podiatric medicine to any applicant who successfully completes the examination in accordance with this section. (b) If an applicant fails to pass the examination in three attempts, she or he shall not be eligible for reexamination unless she or he completes additional educational requirements or training requirements prescribed by the board. An applicant who has completed the additional educational or training requirements prescribed by the board may take the examination on two more occasions. If the applicant has failed to pass the examination after five attempts, she or he is no longer eligible to take the examination. (c) The department shall not issue a license to any applicant who is under investigation by any governmental entity for an offense which would constitute a violation of this act.

If the licensee has not actively practiced podiatric medicine for at least 2 years of the immediately preceding 4 years, the board shall require that the licensee successfully complete a board-approved course prior to renewal of the license. For purposes of this subsection, “actively practiced podiatric medicine” means the licensed practice of podiatric medicine as defined in s. 461.003(5) by podiatric physicians, including podiatric physicians employed by any governmental entity, on the active teaching faculty of an accredited school of podiatric medicine, or practicing administrative podiatric medicine. An applicant for a renewed license must also submit the information required under s. 456.039 to the department on a form and under procedures specified by the department, along with payment in an amount equal to the costs incurred by the Department of Health for the statewide criminal background check of the applicant. The applicant must submit a set of fingerprints to the Department of Health on a form and under procedures specified by the department, along with payment in an amount equal to the costs incurred by the department for a national criminal background check of the applicant for the initial renewal of his or her license after January 1, 2000. If the applicant fails to submit either the information required under s. 456.039 or a set of fingerprints to the department as required by this section, the department shall issue a notice of noncompliance, and the applicant will be given 30 additional days to comply. If the applicant fails to comply within 30 days after the notice of noncompliance is issued, the department or board, as appropriate, may issue a citation to the applicant and may fine the applicant up to $50 for each day that the applicant is not in compliance with the requirements of s. 456.039. The citation must clearly state that the applicant may choose, in lieu of accepting the citation, to follow the procedure under s. 456.073. If the applicant disputes the matter in the citation, the procedures set forth in s. 456.073 must be followed. However, if the applicant does not dispute the matter in the citation with the department within 30 days after the citation is served, the citation becomes a final order and constitutes discipline. Service of a citation may be made by personal service or certified mail, restricted delivery, to the subject at the applicant’s last known address. If an applicant has submitted fingerprints to the department for a national criminal history check upon initial licensure and is renewing his or her license for the first time, then the applicant need only submit the information and fee required for a statewide criminal history check. (2) The department shall adopt rules establishing a procedure for the biennial renewal of licenses. (3) The board may by rule prescribe continuing education, not to exceed 40 hours biennially, as a condition for renewal of a license, with a minimum of 2 hours of continuing education related to the safe and effective prescribing of controlled substances. The criteria for such programs or courses shall be approved by the board.
