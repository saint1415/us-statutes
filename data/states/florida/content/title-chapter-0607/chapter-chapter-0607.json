(7) A notice or other communication may be in the form of an electronic transmission that cannot be directly reproduced in paper form by the recipient through an automated process used in conventional commercial practice only if: (a) The electronic transmission is otherwise retrievable in perceivable form; and (b) The sender and the recipient have consented in writing to the use of such form of electronic transmission. (8) Any consent under subsection (7) may be revoked by the person who consented by written or electronic notice to the person to whom the consent was delivered. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if: (a) The corporation is unable to deliver two consecutive electronic transmissions given by the corporation in accordance with such consent; and (b) Such inability becomes known to the secretary or assistant secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice or other communications; provided, however, that the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation does not invalidate any meeting or other action. (9) Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from an information processing system described in subparagraph (5)(a)4. establishes that an electronic transmission was received, but, by itself, does not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received. (10) An electronic transmission is received under this section even if no person is aware of its receipt. (11) If this chapter prescribes requirements for notices or other communications in particular circumstances, those requirements govern. If articles of incorporation or bylaws prescribe requirements for notices or other communications not less stringent than the requirements of this section or other provisions of this chapter, those requirements govern. The articles of incorporation or bylaws may authorize or require delivery of notices of meetings of directors by electronic transmission. (12) In the event that any provisions of this chapter are deemed to modify, limit, or supersede the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. s. 7001 et seq., the provisions of this chapter shall control to the maximum extent permitted by s. 102(a)(2) of that federal act.

      "text": "607.0145 Definitions.—As used in ss. 607.0145-607.0152, the term: (1) “Corporate action” means any action taken by or on behalf of a corporation, including any action taken by the incorporator, the board of directors, a committee of the board of directors, an officer or agent of the corporation, or the shareholders. (2) “Date of the defective corporate action” means the date, or, if the exact date is unknown, the approximate date, on which the defective corporate action was purported to have been taken. (3) “Defective corporate action” means: (a) Any corporate action purportedly taken which is, and at the time such corporate action was purportedly taken would have been, within the power of the corporation, but is void or voidable due to a failure of authorization; or (b) An overissue. (4) “Failure of authorization” means the failure to authorize, approve, or otherwise effect a corporate action in compliance with this chapter, the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws, a corporate resolution, or any plan or agreement to which the corporation is a party, if and to the extent such failure would render such corporate action void or voidable. (5) “Overissue” means the purported issuance of: (a) Shares of a class or series in excess of the number of shares of the class or series the corporation has the power to issue under s. 607.0601 at the time of such issuance; or (b) Shares of any class or series that is not then authorized for issuance by the corporation’s articles of incorporation. (6) “Putative shares” means the shares of any class or series, including shares issued upon exercise of rights, options, warrants, or other securities convertible into shares of the corporation, or interests with respect to such shares, that were created or issued as a result of a defective corporate action and that: (a) Would constitute valid shares but for any failure of authorization; or (b) Cannot be determined by the board of directors to be valid shares. (7) “Valid shares” means the shares of any class or series that have been duly authorized and validly issued in accordance with this chapter, including as a result of ratification or validation under ss. 607.0145-607.0152. (8)(a) “Validation effective time,” with respect to any defective corporate action ratified under ss. 607.0145-607.0152, means the later of the following: 1. The date and time at which the ratification of the defective corporate action is approved by the shareholders, or if approval of shareholders is not required, the date and time at which the notice required by s. 607.0149 becomes effective in accordance with s. 607.0141; 2. If no articles of validation are required to be filed in accordance with s. 607.0151, the date and time at which the notice required by s. 607.0149 becomes effective in accordance with s. 607.0141; or 3. If articles of validation are required to be filed in accordance with s. 607.0151, the date and time at which the articles of validation filed in accordance with s. 607.0151 become effective. (b) The validation effective time will not be affected by the filing or pendency of a judicial proceeding under s. 607.0152 or any other law unless otherwise ordered by the court.

(2)(a) A shareholder, other person entitled to vote on behalf of a shareholder pursuant to s. 607.0721, or attorney in fact for a shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the shareholder by signing an appointment form or by electronic transmission. Any type of electronic transmission appearing to have been, or containing or accompanied by such information or obtained under such procedures to reasonably ensure that the electronic transmission was, transmitted by such person is a sufficient appointment, subject to the verification requested by the corporation under s. 607.0724. (b) Without limiting the manner in which a shareholder, other person entitled to vote on behalf of a shareholder pursuant to s. 607.0721, or attorney in fact for a shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the shareholder pursuant to paragraph (a), a shareholder, other person entitled to vote on behalf of a shareholder pursuant to s. 607.0721, or attorney in fact for a shareholder may make such an appointment by: 1. Signing an appointment form, with the signature affixed, by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, facsimile or electronic signature. 2. Transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an electronic transmission to the person who will be appointed as the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization, registrar, or agent authorized by the person who will be designated as the proxy to receive such transmission. However, any electronic transmission must set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the shareholder, other person entitled to vote on behalf of a shareholder pursuant to s. 607.0721, or attorney in fact for a shareholder. If it is determined that the electronic transmission is valid, the inspectors of election or, if there are no inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall specify the information upon which they relied. (3) An appointment of a proxy is effective when a signed appointment form or an electronic transmission of the appointment is received by the inspector of election or by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to count votes. An appointment is valid for the term provided in the appointment form and, if no term is provided, is valid for 11 months unless the appointment is irrevocable under subsection (5). (4) The death or incapacity of the shareholder appointing a proxy does not affect the right of the corporation to accept the proxy’s authority unless notice of the death or incapacity is received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes before the proxy exercises his or her authority under the appointment. (5) An appointment of a proxy is revocable by the shareholder unless the appointment form or electronic transmission conspicuously states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest. Appointments coupled with an interest include the appointment of: (a) A pledgee; (b) A person who purchased or agreed to purchase the shares; (c) A creditor of the corporation who extended credit to the corporation under terms requiring the appointment; (d) An employee of the corporation whose employment contract requires the appointment; or (e) A party to a voting agreement created under s. 607.0731. (6) An appointment made irrevocable under subsection (5) becomes revocable when the interest with which it is coupled is extinguished. (7) Unless the appointment otherwise provides, an appointment made irrevocable under subsection (5) continues in effect after a transfer of the shares and a transferee takes subject to the appointment, except that a transferee for value of shares subject to an irrevocable appointment may revoke the appointment if the transferee did not know of its existence when the transferee acquired the shares and the existence of the irrevocable appointment was not noted conspicuously on the certificate representing the shares or on the information statement for shares without certificates. (8) Subject to s. 607.0724 and to any express limitation on the proxy’s authority appearing on the face of the appointment form or in the electronic transmission, a corporation is entitled to accept the proxy’s vote or other action as that of the shareholder making the appointment. (9) If an appointment form expressly provides, any proxy holder may appoint, in writing, a substitute to act in his or her place. (10) Any copy, facsimile transmission, or other reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission created under subsection (2) may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or electronic transmission for any purpose for which the original writing or electronic transmission could be used if the copy, facsimile transmission, or other reproduction is a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or electronic transmission. (11) A corporation may adopt bylaws authorizing additional means or procedures for shareholders to use in exercising rights granted by this section.

(2) Unless this chapter, the articles of incorporation, or the bylaws provide otherwise, the establishment of a board committee, the appointment of members to such committee, the dissolution of a previously created board committee, and the removal of members from a previously created board committee must be approved by a majority of all the directors in office when the action is taken. (3) Sections 607.0820-607.0824, which govern meetings, notice and waiver of notice, and quorum and voting requirements of the board of directors, apply to board committees and their members as well. (4) A board committee may exercise the powers of the board of directors under s. 607.0801, except that a board committee may not: (a) Authorize or approve the reacquisition of shares unless pursuant to a formula or method, or within limits, prescribed by the board of directors.

(c) Fill vacancies on the board of directors or on any board committee. (d) Adopt, amend, or repeal bylaws.

A director or officer is considered to be serving an employee benefit plan at the corporation’s request if the individual’s duties to the corporation or such plan also impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, the individual to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. The term includes, unless the context otherwise requires, the estate, heirs, executors, administrators, and personal representatives of a director or officer. (4) “Expenses” includes reasonable attorney fees and expenses, including those incurred in connection with any appeal.

(c) Credible, because it is developed by an entity that has access to necessary expertise to assess the overall effect of the business and uses a balanced, collaborative approach to develop the standard, including a period for public comment.
