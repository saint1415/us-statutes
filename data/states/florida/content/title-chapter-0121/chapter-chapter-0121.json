(11) “Officer or employee” means any person receiving salary payments for work performed in a regularly established position and, if employed by a municipality, a metropolitan planning organization, or a special district, employed in a covered group.

Disability resulting from drug or alcohol abuse shall not be considered in the line of duty, except when the member is expected to use alcohol in the course of his or her official work in undercover law enforcement, and such use clearly results in the member’s disability. The administrator may require such proof as he or she deems necessary as to the time, date, and cause of any such injury or illness, including evidence from any available witnesses. Workers’ compensation records under the provisions of chapter 440 may also be used. (14) “Death in line of duty” means death arising out of and in the actual performance of duty required by a member’s employment during his or her regularly scheduled working hours or irregular working hours as required by the employer.

However, in no case shall a member receive credit for more than a year’s service during any 12-month period. Service by a teacher, a nonacademic employee of a school board, or an employee of a participating employer other than a school board whose total employment is to provide services to a school board for the school year only shall be based on contract years of employment or school term years of employment, as provided in chapters 122 and 238, rather than 12-month periods of employment. (b) For purposes of the definition of “creditable service,” monthly service credit under the Florida Retirement System and existing state systems shall be awarded as follows: 1. One month of service credit shall be awarded for each month of service performed prior to July 1, 1974. 2. One month of service credit shall be awarded for each month of service performed on and after July 1, 1974, in which the member was paid a salary of $100 or more. If the member was paid less than $100 during a month of employment, the service credit for that month shall be a fraction of one month of credit, such fraction to be determined by dividing the actual salary by $100. 3. One month of service credit shall be awarded for each month of service performed on and after July 1, 1979, for which the member was paid a salary of $250 or more, including any amount which was set aside for participation in a deferred compensation plan. If the member was paid less than $250 during a month of employment, the service credit for that month shall be a fraction of one month of credit, such fraction to be determined by dividing the actual salary payment by $250. 4. On and after July 1, 1985, one month of service credit shall be awarded for each month salary is paid for service performed. (18) “Past service” of any member, as provided in s. 121.081(1), means the number of years and complete months and any fractional part of a month, recognized and credited by an employer and approved by the administrator, during which the member was in the active employ of a governmental employer and for which the employee is not entitled to a benefit before his or her date of participation. (19) “Prior service” under part I of this chapter means: (a) Service for which the member had credit under one of the existing systems and received a refund of his or her contributions upon termination of employment. Prior service also includes service for which the member had credit under the Florida Retirement System and received a refund of his or her contributions upon termination of employment. (b) Service prior to an employee’s membership in the Florida Retirement System with an employer, either before or during the employer’s participation in an existing system. The word “service” as used in this paragraph and paragraph (c) means employment service prior to December 1, 1970, which, at the time it is claimed as prior service, satisfies the requirements for a regularly established position, as defined by rules of the Florida Retirement System. (c) Service as described in paragraph (b) for which no contributions were made due to the fact that the employee made a written rejection of an existing system. If such person withdraws the rejection, the person may purchase retirement credit for all his or her service during the period of rejection. Any governmental entity may contribute up to 50 percent of the amount required to purchase any prior service under paragraph (b) and this paragraph. (d) Service which was performed in a Florida Highway Patrol recruit training school or the Florida Highway Patrol Training Academy, prior to taking the constitutional oath of office, by any Florida highway patrol officer who was hired on or after November 1, 1939, and before July 1, 1968, and for which no retirement contributions were paid. (20) “Military service” of any member means: (a) Service in the Armed Forces of the United States under the conditions set forth in s. 121.111(1); or (b) Actual “wartime service” in the Armed Forces of the United States, as defined by s. 1.01(14), or “wartime service” in the Allied Forces, not to exceed 4 years, if credit for such service has not been granted under any other federal or state system, and provided such service is not used in any other retirement system; however, this paragraph does not prohibit the use of such service as creditable service if granted and used in a pension system under chapter 67 of Title 10 of the United States Code. (21) “Future service” of any member means service subsequent to date of the member’s participation and may include authorized leaves of absence as provided in s. 121.121. (22) “Compensation” means the monthly salary paid a member by his or her employer for work performed arising from that employment. (a) Compensation shall include: 1. Overtime payments paid from a salary fund. 2. Accumulated annual leave payments. 3. Payments in addition to the employee’s base rate of pay if all the following apply: a. The payments are paid according to a formal written policy that applies to all eligible employees equally; b. The policy provides that payments shall commence no later than the 11th year of employment; c. The payments are paid for as long as the employee continues his or her employment; and d. The payments are paid at least annually. 4. Amounts withheld for tax sheltered annuities or deferred compensation programs, or any other type of salary reduction plan authorized under the Internal Revenue Code. 5. Payments made in lieu of a permanent increase in the base rate of pay, whether made annually or in 12 or 26 equal payments within a 12-month period, when the member’s base pay is at the maximum of his or her pay range. When a portion of a member’s annual increase raises his or her pay range and the excess is paid as a lump sum payment, such lump sum payment shall be compensation for retirement purposes. (b) Compensation for a member participating in the pension plan or the investment plan of the Florida Retirement System may not include: 1. Fees paid professional persons for special or particular services or salary payments made from a faculty practice plan authorized by the Board of Governors of the State University System for eligible clinical faculty at a college in a state university that has a faculty practice plan; or 2. Any bonuses or other payments prohibited from inclusion in the member’s average final compensation. (c) For all purposes under this chapter, the member’s compensation or gross compensation contributed as employee-elective salary reductions or deferrals to any salary reduction, deferred compensation, or tax-sheltered annuity program authorized under the Internal Revenue Code shall be deemed to be the compensation or gross compensation which the member would receive if he or she were not participating in such program and shall be treated as compensation for retirement purposes under this chapter. Any public funds otherwise paid by an employer into an employee’s salary reduction, deferred compensation, or tax-sheltered annuity program on or after July 1, 1990 (the date as of which all employers were notified in writing by the division to cease making contributions to the System Trust Fund based on such amounts), shall be considered a fringe benefit and shall not be treated as compensation for retirement purposes under this chapter. However, if an employer was notified in writing by the division to cease making such contributions as of a different date, that employer shall be subject to the requirements of said written notice. (d) For any person who first becomes a member on or after July 1, 1996, compensation for any plan year shall not include any amounts in excess of the s. 401(a)(17), Internal Revenue Code limitation (as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993), which limitation of $150,000 effective July 1, 1996, shall be adjusted as required by federal law for qualified government plans and shall be further adjusted for changes in the cost of living in the manner provided by s. 401(a)(17)(B), Internal Revenue Code. For any person who first became a member prior to July 1, 1996, compensation for all plan years beginning on or after July 1, 1990, shall not include any amounts in excess of the compensation limitation (originally $200,000) established by s. 401(a)(17), Internal Revenue Code prior to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which limitation shall be adjusted for changes in the cost of living since 1989, in the manner provided by s. 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1991. This limitation, which has been part of the Florida Retirement System since plan years beginning on or after July 1, 1990, shall be adjusted as required by federal law for qualified government plans. (23) “Annual compensation” means the total compensation paid a member during a year. A “year” is 12 continuous months. (24)(a) “Average final compensation” means: 1. For members initially enrolled before July 1, 2011, the average of the 5 highest fiscal years of compensation for creditable service before retirement, termination, or death. For in-line-of-duty disability benefits, if less than 5 years of creditable service have been completed, the term means the average annual compensation of the total number of years of creditable service. Each year used to calculate the average final compensation commences on July 1. 2. For members initially enrolled on or after July 1, 2011, the average of the 8 highest fiscal years of compensation for creditable service before retirement, termination, or death. For in-line-of-duty disability benefits, if less than 8 years of creditable service have been completed, the term means the average annual compensation of the total number of years of creditable service. Each year used to calculate average final compensation commences on July 1. (b) The average final compensation includes: 1. Accumulated annual leave payments, not to exceed 500 hours; and 2.

(25) “Average monthly compensation” means one-twelfth of average final compensation. (26) “Accumulated contributions” means the sum of: (a) A member’s contributions, without interest, subsequent to December 1, 1970; and (b) The single-sum amount the member would have received if he or she was covered by an existing system prior to December 1, 1970, and had terminated membership in such system on November 30, 1970, subject to reduction on account of benefit payments as provided under certain options. (27) “Pension” means monthly payments to a retiree derived as provided in this chapter.

The first day of the month following the date the member completes 25 years of creditable service in the Special Risk Class, regardless of age; or 3. The first day of the month following the date the member completes 25 years of creditable service and attains age 52, which service may include a maximum of 4 years of military service credit if such credit is not claimed under any other system and the remaining years are in the Special Risk Class. For a pension plan member, normal retirement age is attained on the normal retirement date. For an investment plan member, normal retirement age is the date a member attains his or her normal retirement date as provided in this section, or the date a member is vested under the investment plan as provided in s. 121.4501(6), whichever is later. (30) “Early retirement date” means the first day of the month following the date a member becomes vested and elects to receive retirement benefits in accordance with this chapter. Such benefits shall be based on average monthly compensation and creditable service as of the member’s early retirement date, and the benefit so computed shall be reduced by five-twelfths of 1 percent for each complete month by which the early retirement date precedes his or her normal retirement date as provided in s. 121.091(3).

Other trust funds may be established to administer the “Social Security Trust Fund.” (38) “Continuous service” means creditable service as a member, beginning with the first day of employment with an employer covered under a state-administered retirement system consolidated herein and continuing for as long as the member remains in an employer-employee relationship with an employer covered under this chapter. An absence of 1 calendar month or more from an employer’s payroll shall be considered a break in continuous service, except for periods of absence during which an employer-employee relationship continues to exist and such period of absence is creditable under this chapter or under one of the existing systems consolidated herein. However, a law enforcement officer as defined in s. 121.0515(3)(a) who was a member of a state-administered retirement system under chapter 122 or chapter 321 and who resigned and was subsequently reemployed in a law enforcement position within 12 calendar months of such resignation by an employer under such state-administered retirement system shall be deemed to have not experienced a break in service. Further, with respect to a state-employed law enforcement officer who meets the criteria specified in s. 121.0515(3)(a), if the absence from the employer’s payroll is the result of a “layoff” as defined in s. 110.107 or a resignation to run for an elected office that meets the criteria specified in s. 121.0515(3)(a), no break in continuous service shall be deemed to have occurred if the member is reemployed as a state law enforcement officer or is elected to an office which meets the criteria specified in s. 121.0515(3)(a) within 12 calendar months after the date of the layoff or resignation, notwithstanding the fact that such period of layoff or resignation is not creditable service under this chapter. A withdrawal of contributions will constitute a break in service. Continuous service also includes past service purchased under this chapter, provided such service is continuous within this definition and the rules established by the administrator. The administrator may establish administrative rules and procedures for applying this definition to creditable service authorized under this chapter. Any correctional officer, as defined in s. 943.10, whose participation in the state-administered retirement system is terminated due to the transfer of a county detention facility through a contractual agreement with a private entity pursuant to s. 951.062, shall be deemed an employee with continuous service in the Special Risk Class, provided return to employment with the former employer takes place within 3 years due to contract termination or the officer is employed by a covered employer in a special risk position within 1 year after his or her initial termination of employment by such transfer of its detention facilities to the private entity. (39)(a) “Termination” occurs, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c), when a member ceases all employment, which term includes the provision of services, with all employers, however: 1. For retirements effective before July 1, 2010, if a member is employed by any employer within the next calendar month, termination shall be deemed not to have occurred. A leave of absence constitutes a continuation of the employment relationship, except that a leave of absence without pay due to disability may constitute termination if such member makes application for and is approved for disability retirement in accordance with s. 121.091(4). 2. For retirements effective on or after July 1, 2010, if a member is employed by any employer within the next 6 calendar months, termination shall be deemed not to have occurred. A leave of absence constitutes a continuation of the employment relationship, except that a leave of absence without pay due to disability may constitute termination if such member makes application for and is approved for disability retirement in accordance with s. 121.091(4). (b) “Termination” for a member ending participation in the Deferred Retirement Option Program occurs when the program participant ceases all employment, which term includes the provision of services, with all employers in accordance with s. 121.091(13), however: 1. For termination dates occurring before July 1, 2010, if a member is employed by any employer within the next calendar month, termination shall be deemed not to have occurred, except as provided in s. 121.091(13)(b)4.c. A leave of absence constitutes a continuation of the employment relationship. 2. For termination dates occurring on or after July 1, 2010, if a member becomes employed by any employer within the next 6 calendar months, termination shall be deemed not to have occurred, except as provided in s. 121.091(13)(b)4.c. A leave of absence constitutes a continuation of the employment relationship. (c) Effective July 1, 2011, “termination” for a member receiving a refund of employee contributions occurs when a member ceases all employment, which term includes the provision of services, with all employers for 3 calendar months. A leave of absence constitutes a continuation of the employment relationship. All terminations must be a termination of employment consistent with 26 C.F.R. s. 1.409A-1(h)(1)(ii). After July 1, 2023, volunteer services do not constitute employment by, or provision of services to, an employer. The department or state board may require any evidence of termination necessary to determine compliance with this chapter or the rules adopted thereunder. (40) “Plan year” means the period of time beginning July 1 and ending on the following June 30, both dates inclusive, for all state-administered retirement systems. (41) “Effective date of retirement” means the first day of the month in which benefit payments begin to accrue pursuant to s. 121.091. (42)(a) “Local agency employer” means the board of county commissioners or other legislative governing body of a county, however styled, including that of a consolidated or metropolitan government; a clerk of the circuit court, sheriff, property appraiser, tax collector, or supervisor of elections, provided such officer is elected or has been appointed to fill a vacancy in an elective office; a community college board of trustees or district school board; or the governing body of any city, metropolitan planning organization created pursuant to s. 339.175 or any other separate legal or administrative entity created pursuant to s. 339.175, or special district of the state which participates in the system for the benefit of certain of its employees. (b) The term “local agency employer” also includes the governing body of any council, commission, authority, or other governmental entity created or authorized by general or special law, which participates in the Florida Retirement System for the benefit of its employees, and which is independent of any local agency employer as defined under paragraph (a). (43) “Phased retirement program” means a program contracted by the governing board of a university or community college participating under this chapter in which a retiree may be reemployed in a faculty position provided: (a) The member retired and met the definition of termination under this section; (b) The retired member is reemployed for not more than 780 hours during the first 12 months of his or her retirement; and (c) The retired member is reemployed with the university or community college from which he or she retired. Renewed membership for a retiree participating in a phased retirement program shall be determined in accordance with s. 121.053 or s. 121.122. (44) “DROP participant” means any member who elects to retire and participate in the Deferred Retirement Option Program as provided in s. 121.091(13). (45) “Vested” or “vesting” means the guarantee that a member is eligible to receive a future retirement benefit upon completion of the required years of creditable service for the employee’s class of membership, even though the member may have terminated covered employment before reaching normal or early retirement date. Being vested does not entitle a member to a disability benefit. Provisions governing entitlement to disability benefits are set forth under s. 121.091(4). (a) Effective July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2011, a 6-year vesting requirement shall be implemented for the Florida Retirement System Pension Plan: 1. Any member employed in a regularly established position on July 1, 2001, who completes or has completed a total of 6 years of creditable service is considered vested. 2. Any member not employed in a regularly established position on July 1, 2001, shall be deemed vested upon completion of 6 years of creditable service if such member is employed in a covered position for at least 1 work year after July 1, 2001. However, a member is not required to complete more years of creditable service than would have been required for that member to vest under retirement laws in effect before July 1, 2001. 3. Any member initially enrolled in the Florida Retirement System on July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2011, shall be deemed vested upon completion of 6 years of creditable service. (b) Any member initially enrolled in the Florida Retirement System on or after July 1, 2011, shall be vested in the pension plan upon completion of 8 years of creditable service. (46) “Beneficiary” means the joint annuitant or any other person, organization, estate, or trust fund designated by the member to receive a retirement benefit, if any, which may be payable upon the member’s death. (47) “Bonus” means a payment made in addition to an employee’s regular or overtime salary. A bonus is usually nonrecurring, does not increase the employee’s base rate of pay, and includes no commitment for payment in a subsequent year. Such payments are not considered compensation. Effective July 1, 1989, employers may not report such payments to the division as salary, and may not make retirement contributions on such payments. (a) A payment is a bonus if any of the following circumstances apply: 1. The payment is not made according to a formal written policy that applies to all eligible employees equally. 2. The payment commences later than the 11th year of employment. 3. The payment is not based on permanent eligibility. 4. The payment is made less frequently than annually. (b) Bonuses shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 1. Exit bonus or severance pay. 2. Longevity payments in conformance with the provisions of paragraph (a). 3. Salary increases granted pursuant to an employee’s agreement to retire, including increases paid over several months or years prior to retirement. 4. Payments for accumulated overtime or compensatory time, reserve time, or holiday time worked, if not made within 11 months of the month in which the work was performed. 5. Lump sum payments in recognition of employees’ accomplishments. (48) “Accumulated annual leave payment” means any payment, made either during an employee’s employment or at termination or retirement, for leave accrued during such employee’s career, which leave was intended for, but never utilized by the employee for, his or her personal use. General leave, which may be used for both sickness and vacation, is considered accumulated annual leave. When leave is initially accrued separately as annual leave or sick leave and is later combined into a consolidated leave account, only the payment for that portion of the account which represents annual leave shall be considered as compensation. If any single lump-sum annual leave payment, made at anytime during a member’s employment, exceeds 500 hours, only a maximum of 500 hours of such annual leave payment shall be considered as compensation.

(2)(a) Should any employer other than a state employer fail to make the retirement and social security contributions, both member and employer contributions, required by this chapter, then, upon request by the administrator, the Department of Revenue or the Department of Financial Services, as the case may be, shall deduct the amount owed by the employer from any funds to be distributed by it to the county, municipality, metropolitan planning organization, special district, or consolidated form of government. The amounts so deducted shall be transferred to the administrator for further distribution to the trust funds in accordance with this chapter. (b) Should any employer for whom the municipality or county tax collector collects taxes, fail to make the retirement and social security contributions required by this chapter, the tax collector, at the request of the administrator and upon receipt of a certificate from the administrator showing the amount owed by the employer, shall deduct the amount so certified from any taxes collected for the employer and remit the amount to the administrator for further distribution to the trust funds in accordance with this chapter. (c) The governing body of each county, municipality, metropolitan planning organization, special district, or consolidated form of government participating under this chapter or the administrator, acting individually or jointly, is hereby authorized to file and maintain an action in the courts of the state to require any employer to remit any retirement or social security member contributions or employer matching payments due the retirement or social security trust funds under the provisions of this chapter. (d) Should the income of any constitutional fee officer, in any year, be insufficient to make the matching payments required by this chapter, the board of county commissioners shall provide such fee officer sufficient funds to make these required payments when due. (3) The appropriations provided each state agency, beginning with the 1970-1971 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, shall include sufficient amounts to pay the matching contributions for social security and retirement as required by this chapter. No state agency, whether its funds are provided by state appropriations or otherwise, shall employ any person or maintain any person on its payroll unless it has allotted for such person sufficient funds to meet these required payments. Should a state agency fail to make such payments, the administrator shall report same to the Governor and certify the amount due the system trust funds to the Executive Office of the Governor. If arrangements cannot be made for the state agency to pay said amount due, then the amount due is hereby appropriated and shall be paid from the General Revenue Fund of the state.
