The amounts so deducted shall be transferred to the administrator for further distribution to the trust funds in accordance with this chapter.(b)Should any employer for whom the municipality or county tax collector collects taxes, fail to make the retirement and social security contributions required by this chapter, the tax collector, at the request of the administrator and upon receipt of a certificate from the administrator showing the amount owed by the employer, shall deduct the amount so certified from any taxes collected for the employer and remit the amount to the administrator for further distribution to the trust funds in accordance with this chapter.(c)The governing body of each county, municipality, metropolitan planning organization, special district, or consolidated form of government participating under this chapter or the administrator, acting individually or jointly, is hereby authorized to file and maintain an action in the courts of the state to require any employer to remit any retirement or social security member contributions or employer matching payments due the retirement or social security trust funds under the provisions of this chapter.(d)Should the income of any constitutional fee officer, in any year, be insufficient to make the matching payments required by this chapter, the board of county commissioners shall provide such fee officer sufficient funds to make these required payments when due.(3)The appropriations provided each state agency, beginning with the 1970-1971 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, shall include sufficient amounts to pay the matching contributions for social security and retirement as required by this chapter. No state agency, whether its funds are provided by state appropriations or otherwise, shall employ any person or maintain any person on its payroll unless it has allotted for such person sufficient funds to meet these required payments. Should a state agency fail to make such payments, the administrator shall report same to the Governor and certify the amount due the system trust funds to the Executive Office of the Governor. If arrangements cannot be made for the state agency to pay said amount due, then the amount due is hereby appropriated and shall be paid from the General Revenue Fund of the state.History.—s. 6, ch. 70-112; s. 1, ch. 70-439; s. 2, ch. 72-295; s. 88, ch. 79-190; s. 142, ch. 2003-261; s. 9, ch. 2007-196; s. 12, ch. 2011-68.",

Partial refunds are not permitted. The refund may not include any interest earnings on the contributions for a member of the pension plan. Employer contributions made on behalf of the member are not refundable. A member may not receive a refund of employee contributions if a pending or an approved qualified domestic relations order is filed against his or her retirement account. By obtaining a refund of contributions, a member waives all rights under the Florida Retirement System and the health insurance subsidy to the service credit represented by the refunded contributions, except the right to purchase his or her prior service credit in accordance with s. 121.081(2).(3)The employer paying the salary of a member shall contribute an amount as specified in this section or s. 121.71, as appropriate, which shall constitute the entire employer retirement contribution with respect to such member.
