      "text": "738.201 Fiduciary duties; general principles.— (1) In making an allocation or determination or exercising discretion under this chapter, a fiduciary shall do all of the following: (a) Act in good faith, based on what is a fair and reasonable fee to all beneficiaries; (b) Administer a trust or estate impartially, except to the extent that the terms of the trust manifest an intent that the fiduciary favors one or more beneficiaries; (c) Administer the trust or estate in accordance with the terms of the trust, even if there is a different provision in this chapter. (d) Administer the trust or estate in accordance with this chapter, except to the extent that the terms of the trust provide otherwise or authorize the fiduciary to determine otherwise. (2) A fiduciary’s allocation, determination, or exercise of discretion under this chapter is presumed to be fair and reasonable to all beneficiaries. A fiduciary may exercise a discretionary power of administration given to the fiduciary by the terms of the trust, and an exercise of the power that produces a result different from a result required or permitted by this chapter does not create an inference that the fiduciary abused the fiduciary’s discretion. (3) A fiduciary shall: (a) Add a receipt to principal, to the extent that the terms of the trust and this chapter do not allocate the receipt between income and principal; (b) Charge a disbursement to principal, to the extent that the terms of the trust and this chapter do not allocate the disbursement between income and principal; and (c) Within 65 days after the fiscal year ends, add any undistributed income to principal, unless otherwise provided by the terms of the trust. (4) A fiduciary may exercise the power to adjust under s. 738.203(1), convert an income trust to a unitrust under ss. 738.301-738.310, change the percentage or method used to calculate a unitrust amount under ss. 738.301-738.310, or convert a unitrust to an income trust under ss. 738.301-738.310 if the fiduciary determines the exercise of the power will assist the fiduciary to administer the trust or estate impartially. (5) The fiduciary must consider the following factors in making the determination in subsection (4), including: (a) The terms of the trust. (b) The nature, distribution standards, and expected duration of the trust. (c) The effect of the allocation rules, including specific adjustments between income and principal, under ss. 738.301-738.416. (d) The desirability of liquidity and regularity of income. (e) The desirability of the preservation and appreciation of principal. (f) The extent to which an asset is used or may be used by a beneficiary. (g) The increase or decrease in the value of principal assets, reasonably determined by the fiduciary. (h) Whether and to what extent the terms of the trust give the fiduciary power to accumulate income or invade principal or prohibit the fiduciary from accumulating income or invading principal. (i) The extent to which the fiduciary has accumulated income or invaded principal in preceding accounting periods. (j) The effect of current and reasonably expected economic conditions. (k) The reasonably expected tax consequences of the exercise of the power. (l) The identities and circumstances of the beneficiaries. (6) Except as provided in ss. 738.301-738.310, this chapter pertains to the administration of a trust and is applicable to any trust that is administered in this state or under its law. This chapter also applies to any estate that is administered in this state unless the provision is limited in application to a trustee, rather than a fiduciary.

That in administering the trust, the net income of the trust will be a unitrust amount rather than net income determined without regard to ss. 738.301-738.310; and 2. The percentage and method used to calculate the unitrust amount. (b) Change the percentage or method used to calculate a unitrust amount for a unitrust if the fiduciary adopts in a record a unitrust policy or an amendment or replacement of a unitrust policy providing charges in the percentage or method used to calculate the unitrust amount. (c) Convert a unitrust to an income trust if the fiduciary adopts in a record a determination that, in administering the trust, the net income of the trust will be net income determined without regard to ss. 738.301-738.310 rather than a unitrust amount. (2) A fiduciary may take an action under subsection (1) if all of the following apply: (a) The fiduciary determines that the action will assist the fiduciary to administer a trust impartially. (b) The fiduciary sends a notice in a record to the qualified beneficiaries determined under ss. 736.0103 and 736.0110 in the manner required by s. 738.304, describing and proposing to take the action. (c) The fiduciary sends a copy of the notice under paragraph (b) to each settlor of the trust which is: 1. If an individual, living; or 2. If not an individual, in existence. (d) At least one member of each class of the qualified beneficiaries determined under ss. 736.0103 and 736.0110, other than the Attorney General, receiving the notice under paragraph (b) is: 1. If an individual, legally competent; 2. If not an individual, in existence; or 3. Represented in the manner provided in s. 738.304(2). (e) The fiduciary does not receive, by the date specified in the notice under s. 738.304(4)(e), an objection in a record to the action proposed under paragraph (b) from a person to which the notice under paragraph (b) is sent. (3) If a fiduciary receives, not later than the date stated in the notice under s. 738.304(4)(e), an objection in a record described in s. 738.304(4)(d) to a proposed action, the fiduciary or a beneficiary may request the court to have the action taken as proposed, taken with modifications, or prevented. A person described in s. 738.304(1) may oppose the proposed action in the proceeding under this subsection regardless of whether the person: (a) Consented under s. 738.304(3); or (b) Objected under s. 738.304(4)(d). (4) If, after sending a notice under paragraph (2)(b), a fiduciary decides not to take the action proposed in the notice, the fiduciary must notify in a record each person described in s. 738.304(1) of the decision not to take the action and the reasons for the decision. (5) If a beneficiary requests in a record that a fiduciary take an action described in subsection (1) and the fiduciary declines to act or does not act within 60 days after receiving the request, the beneficiary may request the court to direct the fiduciary to take the action requested. (6) In deciding whether and how to take an action authorized in subsection (1), or whether and how to respond to a request by a beneficiary under subsection (5), a fiduciary must consider all factors relevant to the trust and beneficiaries, including the relevant factors listed in s. 738.201(5). (7) A fiduciary may release or delegate the power to convert an income trust to a unitrust under paragraph (1)(a), change the percentage or method used to calculate a unitrust amount under paragraph (1)(b), or convert a unitrust to an income trust under paragraph (1)(c), for a reason described in s. 738.203(7) and in the manner described in s. 738.203(8).

(2) The trustee of an express unitrust may determine the unitrust amount by reference to the net fair market value of the unitrust’s assets in 1 or more years. (3) Distribution of a unitrust amount is considered a distribution of all of the net income of an express unitrust and is considered to be an income interest. (4) The unitrust amount is considered to be a reasonable apportionment of the total return of an express unitrust. (5) An express unitrust that provides or allows a distribution based on a unitrust rate in excess of 5 percent per year of the net fair market value of the unitrust assets is considered a distribution of all of the income of the unitrust and a distribution of principal of the unitrust to the extent that the distribution exceeds 5 percent per year. (6) An express unitrust may provide a mechanism for changing the unitrust rate, similar to the mechanism provided under s. 738.306, based upon the factors noted in that section, and may provide for a conversion from a unitrust to an income trust or a reconversion of an income trust to a unitrust under s. 738.303. (7) If an express unitrust does not specifically or by reference to s. 738.306 prohibit a power to change the unitrust rate or to convert to an income trust under s. 738.303, the trustee must have such power. (8) The governing instrument of an express unitrust may grant the trustee discretion to adopt a consistent practice of treating capital gains as part of the unitrust amount to the extent that the unitrust amount exceeds the income determined as if the trust were not an express unitrust, or the governing instrument may specify the ordering of classes of income. (9) Unless the terms of the express unitrust specifically provide otherwise as provided in subsection (8), the distribution of a unitrust amount is considered a distribution made from the following sources, which are listed in order of priority: (a) Net accounting income determined under this chapter as if the trust were not a unitrust; (b) Ordinary income not allocable to net accounting income; (c) Net realized short-term capital gains; (d) Net realized long-term capital gains; and (e) The principal of the trust. (10) The governing instrument of an express unitrust may provide that the trustee may exclude assets used by the unitrust’s beneficiary, including, but not limited to, a residence property or tangible personal property, from the net fair market value of the unitrust’s assets for the purposes of computing the unitrust amount.

      "text": "738.401 Character of receipts from entity.— (1) For purposes of this section, the term: (a) “Capital distribution” means an entity distribution of money which is a: 1. Return of capital; or 2. Distribution in total or partial liquidation of the entity. (b) “Entity”: 1. Means a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, regulated investment company, real estate investment trust, common trust fund, or any other organization or arrangement in which a fiduciary owns or holds an interest, regardless of whether the entity is a taxpayer for federal income tax purposes; and 2. Does not include: a. A trust or estate to which s. 738.402 applies; b. A business or other activity to which s. 738.403 applies which is not conducted by an entity described in subparagraph 1.; c. An asset-backed security; or d. An instrument or arrangement to which s. 738.416 applies. (c) “Entity distribution” means a payment or transfer by an entity to a person in the person’s capacity as an owner or holder of an interest in the entity. (d) “Lookback period” means the accounting period and the preceding two accounting periods or, if less, the number of accounting periods, or portion of accounting periods, that the interest in the entity has been held by the fiduciary. (2) In this section, an attribute or action of an entity includes an attribute or action of any other entity in which the initial entity owns or holds an interest, including an interest owned or held indirectly through another entity. (3) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (4)(b)-(d), a fiduciary shall allocate to income: (a) Money received in an entity distribution; and (b) Tangible personal property of nominal value received from the entity. (4) A fiduciary shall allocate the following to principal: (a) Property received in an entity distribution which is not: 1. Money; or 2. Tangible personal property of nominal value. (b) Money received in an entity distribution in an exchange for part or all of the fiduciary’s interest in the entity to the extent that the entity distribution reduces the fiduciary’s interest in the entity relative to the interest of other persons that own or hold interests in the entity. (c) Money received in an entity distribution that is a capital distribution, to the extent not allocated to income. (d) Money received in an entity distribution from an entity that is a regulated investment company or a real estate investment trust if the money received represents short-term or long-term capital gain realized within the entity. (5) If a fiduciary elects, or continues an election made by its predecessor, to reinvest dividends in shares of stock of a distributing corporation or fund, whether evidenced by new certificates or entries on the books of the distributing entity, the new shares retain their character as income. (6) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (10) and (11), money received in an entity distribution is a capital distribution: (a) To the extent that the entity, at or near the time of the entity distribution, indicates that such money is a capital distribution; or (b) To the extent that the total amount of money and property received by the fiduciary in the entity distribution or a series of related entity distributions is or will be greater than 20 percent of the fiduciary’s pro rata share of the entity’s gross assets, as shown by the entity’s year-end financial statements immediately preceding the initial receipt. (7) In the case of a capital distribution, the amount received in an entity distribution allocated to principal must be reduced to the extent that the cumulative distributions from the entity to the fiduciary allocated to income do not exceed the greater of: (a) A cumulative annual return of 3 percent of the entity’s carrying value computed at the beginning of each accounting period, or portion of an accounting period, during the lookback period. If a fiduciary has exercised a power to adjust under s. 738.203 during the lookback period, the fiduciary, in determining the total income distributions from that entity, must take into account the extent to which the exercise of the power resulted in income to the fiduciary from that entity for that period. If the income of a fiduciary during the lookback period has been computed under ss. 738.301-738.310, the fiduciary, in determining the total income distributions from the entity for that period, must take into account the portion of the unitrust amount paid as a result of the ownership of the trust’s interest in the entity for that period; or (b) In the case of an entity treated as a partnership, subchapter S corporation, or disregarded entity under the Internal Revenue Code, the amount of income tax attributable to the fiduciary’s ownership share of the entity, based on its pro rata share of the taxable income of the entity that distributes the money, during the lookback period, calculated as if all of the tax was incurred by the fiduciary. (8) If a fiduciary receives additional information about the application of this section to an entity distribution before the fiduciary has paid part of the entity distribution to a beneficiary, the fiduciary may consider the additional information before making the payment to the beneficiary and may change a decision to make the payment to the beneficiary. (9) If a fiduciary receives additional information about the application of this section to an entity distribution after the fiduciary has paid part of the entity distribution to a beneficiary, the fiduciary is not required to change or recover the payment to the beneficiary but may consider that information in determining whether to exercise its other powers, including, but not limited to, the power to adjust under s. 738.203. (10) The following applies to money or property received by a private trustee as a distribution from an investment entity described in this subsection: (a) The trustee shall first treat as income of the trust all of the money or property received from the investment entity in the current accounting period which would be considered income under this chapter if the trustee had directly held the trust’s pro rata share of the assets of the investment entity. For this purpose, all distributions received in the current accounting period must be aggregated. (b) The trustee shall next treat as income of the trust any additional money or property received in the current accounting period which would have been considered income in the prior two accounting periods under paragraph (a) if additional money or property had been received from the investment entity in any of those prior two accounting periods. The amount to be treated as income must be reduced by any distributions of money or property made by the investment entity to the trust during the current and the prior two accounting periods which were treated as income under this paragraph. (c) The remainder of the distribution, if any, is treated as principal. (d) As used in this subsection, the term: 1. “Investment entity” means an entity, other than a business activity conducted by the trustee described in s. 738.403 or an entity that is listed on a public stock exchange, which is treated as a partnership, subchapter S corporation, or disregarded entity under the Internal Revenue Code and which normally derives 50 percent or more of its annual cumulative net income from interest, dividends, annuities, royalties, rental activity, or other passive investments, including income from the sale or exchange of such passive investments. 2. “Private trustee” means a trustee who is a natural person, but is not an independent person as set forth in s. 738.102. (11) A fiduciary shall allocate to principal any money and property the fiduciary receives in a distribution or series of related distributions from a public entity which are greater than 10 percent of the fair market value of the fiduciary’s interest in the public entity on the first day of the accounting period. The amount to be allocated to principal must be reduced to the extent that the cumulative distributions from the entity to the fiduciary allocated to income do not exceed a cumulative annual return of 3 percent of the fair market value of the interest in the entity at the beginning of each accounting period, or portion of an accounting period, during the lookback period. If a fiduciary has exercised a power to adjust under s. 738.203 during the lookback period, the fiduciary, in determining the total income distributions from that entity, must take into account the extent to which the exercise of that power resulted in income to the fiduciary from that entity for that period. If the income of the fiduciary during the lookback period has been computed under ss. 738.301-738.310, the fiduciary, in determining the total income distribution from that entity for that period, must take into account the portion of the unitrust amount paid as a result of the ownership of the trust’s interest in the entity for that period. As used in this subsection, the term “public entity” means an entity listed on a public stock exchange. (12) This section must be applied before ss. 738.506 and 738.507 and does not modify or change any of the provisions of those sections.

      "text": "738.409 Deferred compensation, annuity, or similar payment.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Internal income of the separate fund” means the amount determined under subsection (2). (b) “Marital trust” means a trust: 1. Of which the settlor’s surviving spouse is the only current income beneficiary and is entitled to a distribution of all the current net income of the trust; and 2. That qualifies for a marital deduction with respect to the settlor’s estate under the Internal Revenue Code or comparable law of any state because: a. An election to qualify for a marital deduction under s. 2056(b)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code has been made; b. The trust qualified for a marital deduction under s. 2056(b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code; or c. The trust otherwise qualifies for a marital deduction. (c) “Nonseparate fund” means an annuity, a deferred compensation plan, a pension plan, or other fund for which the value of the participant’s or account owner’s right to receive benefits can be determined only by the occurrence of a date or event as defined in the instrument governing the fund. (d) “Payment” means an amount a fiduciary may receive over a fixed number of years or during the life of one or more individuals because of services rendered or property transferred to the payor in exchange for future amounts the fiduciary may receive. The term includes an amount received in money or property from the payor’s general assets or from a separate fund created by the payor. (e) “Percent calculated” means a percent equal to the rate determined under s. 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code in effect for the month preceding the beginning of the accounting period; however, if the percent calculated exceeds 5 percent, it must be reduced to 5 percent, and if the percent calculated is less than 3 percent, it must be increased to 3 percent. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a fiduciary who is an independent person as defined in s. 738.102 may set the percent calculated at a percentage no less than 3 percent and no greater than 5 percent. (f) “Separate fund” includes a private or commercial annuity, an individual retirement account, and a pension, profit-sharing, stock-bonus, stock ownership plan, or other deferred compensation fund holding assets exclusively for the benefit of a participant or account owner. (2) For each accounting period, the following rules apply to a separate fund: (a) The fiduciary may determine the internal income of the separate fund as if the separate fund were a trust subject to this chapter. (b) Alternatively, the fiduciary may deem the internal income of the separate fund to equal the percent calculated of the value of the separate fund according to the most recent statement of value preceding the beginning of the accounting period. The fiduciary is not liable for good faith reliance upon any valuation supplied by the person or persons in possession of the fund. If the fiduciary makes or terminates an election under this paragraph, the fiduciary must make such disclosure in a trust disclosure document that satisfies the requirements of s. 736.1008(4)(c). (c) If the fiduciary cannot determine the value of the separate fund under paragraph (b), the value of the separate fund is deemed to equal the present value of the expected future payments as determined under s. 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code for the month preceding the beginning of the accounting period for which the computation is made. (d) The fiduciary may elect the method of determining the income of the fund pursuant to this subsection and may change the method of determining income of the fund for any future accounting period. (3) A fiduciary shall allocate a payment received from a separate fund during an accounting period to income, to the extent of the internal income of the separate fund during the period, and allocate the balance to principal. (4) The fiduciary of a marital trust shall: (a) Withdraw from a separate fund the amount the current income beneficiary of the trust requests the fiduciary to withdraw, not greater than the amount by which the internal income of the separate fund during the accounting period exceeds the amount the fiduciary otherwise receives from the separate fund during the period. (b) Transfer from principal to income the amount the current income beneficiary requests the fiduciary to transfer, but not greater than the amount by which the internal income of the separate fund during the period exceeds the amount the fiduciary receives from the separate fund during the period after the application of paragraph (a). (c) Distribute to the current income beneficiary as income: 1. The amount of the internal income of the separate fund received or withdrawn during the period; and 2. The amount transferred from principal to income under paragraph (b). (5) For a trust, other than a marital trust, of which one or more current income beneficiaries are entitled to a distribution of all the current net income, the fiduciary shall transfer from principal to income the amount by which the internal income of the separate fund during the accounting period exceeds the amount the fiduciary receives from the separate fund during the period. (6) The fiduciary of a nonseparate fund shall calculate internal income of the fund as the percent calculated of the present value of the right to receive the remaining payments as determined under s. 7520(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code for the month preceding the beginning of the accounting period. (7) If a fiduciary owns a separate fund or a nonseparate fund before January 1, 2025, the fiduciary may determine internal income, allocate payments, and account for unwithdrawn internal income as provided in this section or in the manner used by the fiduciary before January 1, 2025. Such fiduciary is not required to consider subsection (5). If the fiduciary acquires a separate fund or a nonseparate fund on or after January 1, 2025, the fiduciary must calculate internal income, allocate payments, and account for unwithdrawn internal income as provided in this section.

Related penalties apportioned by the decedent’s will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law to the estate or income interest that terminates. (4) If a decedent’s will or the terms of a trust provide for the payment of interest or the equivalent of interest to a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount outright, the fiduciary shall make the payment from net income determined under subsection (3) or from principal to the extent that net income is insufficient. (5) A fiduciary shall distribute net income remaining after payments required by subsection (4) in the manner described in s. 738.602 to all other beneficiaries, including a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount in trust, even if the beneficiary holds an unqualified power to withdraw assets from the trust or other presently exercisable general power of appointment over the trust. (6) A fiduciary may not reduce principal or income receipts from property described in subsection (2) because of a payment described in s. 738.501 or s. 738.502 to the extent that the decedent’s will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law requires the fiduciary to make the payment from assets other than the property or that the fiduciary recovers or expects to recover the payment from a third party. The net income and principal receipts from the property must be determined by including the amount the fiduciary receives or pays regarding the property, whether the amount accrued or became due before, on, or after the date of the decedent’s death or an income interest’s terminating event, and making a reasonable provision for an amount the estate or income interest may become obligated to pay after the property is distributed.

      "text": "738.602 Distribution to successor beneficiary.— (1) Except to the extent that ss. 738.301-738.310 apply for a beneficiary that is a trust, each beneficiary described in s. 738.601(5) is entitled to receive a share of the net income equal to the beneficiary’s fractional interest in undistributed principal assets, using carrying values as of the distribution date. If a fiduciary makes more than one distribution of assets to beneficiaries to which this section applies, each beneficiary, including a beneficiary who does not receive part of the distribution, is entitled, as of each distribution date, to a share of the net income the fiduciary received after the decedent’s death, an income interest’s other terminating event, or the preceding distribution by the fiduciary. (2) In determining a beneficiary’s share of net income under subsection (1), the following rules apply: (a) The beneficiary is entitled to receive a share of the net income equal to the beneficiary’s fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets immediately before the distribution date. (b) The beneficiary’s fractional interest under paragraph (a) must be calculated: 1. On the aggregate carrying value of the assets as of the distribution date; and 2. Reduced by: a. Any liabilities of the estate or trust; b. Property specifically given to a beneficiary under the decedent’s will or the terms of the trust; and c. Property required to pay pecuniary amounts not in trust. (c) If a disproportionate distribution of principal is made to any beneficiary, the respective fractional interests of all beneficiaries in the undistributed principal assets must be recomputed by: 1. Adjusting the carrying value of the principal assets to their fair market value before the distribution; 2. Reducing the fractional interest of the recipient of the disproportionate distribution in the remaining principal assets by the fair market value of the principal distribution; and 3. Recomputing the fractional interests of all beneficiaries in the remaining principal assets based upon the now restated carrying values. (d) The distribution date under paragraph (a) may be the date as of which the fiduciary calculates the value of the assets if that date is reasonably near the date on which the assets are distributed. All distributions to a beneficiary must be valued based on the assets’ fair market value on the date of the distribution. (3) To the extent that a fiduciary does not distribute under this section all the collected but undistributed net income to each beneficiary as of a distribution date, the fiduciary shall maintain records showing the interest of each beneficiary in the net income. (4) If this section applies to income from an asset, a fiduciary may apply the requirements in this section to net gain or loss realized from the disposition of the asset after the decedent’s date of death, an income interest’s terminating event, or the preceding distribution by the fiduciary. (5) The carrying value or fair market value of trust assets shall be determined on an asset-by-asset basis and is conclusive if reasonable and determined in good faith. Determinations of fair market value based on appraisals performed within 2 years before or after the valuation date are presumed reasonable. The values of trust assets are conclusively presumed to be reasonable and determined in good faith unless proven otherwise in a proceeding commenced by or on behalf of a person interested in the trust within the time provided in s. 736.1008.

(3) If a beneficiary has an unqualified power to withdraw more than 5 percent of the value of a trust immediately before an income interest ends: (a) The fiduciary shall allocate to principal the undistributed income from the portion of the trust which may be withdrawn; and (b) Subsection (2) applies only to the balance of the undistributed income. (4) When a fiduciary’s obligation to pay a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of assets ends, the fiduciary shall prorate the final payment as required to preserve income tax, gift tax, estate tax, or other tax benefits.
