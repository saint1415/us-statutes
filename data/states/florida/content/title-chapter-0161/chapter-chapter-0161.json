      "text": "161.54 Definitions.—In construing ss. 161.52-161.58: (1) “Coastal building zone” means the land area from the seasonal high-water line landward to a line 1,500 feet landward from the coastal construction control line as established pursuant to s. 161.053, and, for those coastal areas fronting on the Gulf of America, Atlantic Ocean, Florida Bay, or Straits of Florida and not included under s. 161.053, the land area seaward of the most landward velocity zone (V-zone) line as established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and shown on flood insurance rate maps. (2) “Coastal barrier islands” means geological features which are completely surrounded by marine waters that front upon the open waters of the Gulf of America, Atlantic Ocean, Florida Bay, or Straits of Florida and are composed of quartz sands, clays, limestone, oolites, rock, coral, coquina, sediment, or other material, including spoil disposal, which features lie above the line of mean high water. Mainland areas which were separated from the mainland by artificial channelization for the purpose of assisting marine commerce shall not be considered coastal barrier islands. (3) “Beach” means the zone of unconsolidated material that extends landward from the mean low-water line to the place where there is marked change in material or physiographic form, or to the line of permanent vegetation, usually the effective limit of storm waves. “Beach” is alternatively termed “shore.” (4) “Dune” means a mound or ridge of loose sediments, usually sand-sized sediments, lying landward of the beach and deposited by any natural or artificial mechanism. (5) “Construction” means the carrying out of any building, clearing, filling, excavation, or substantial improvement in the size or use of any structure or the appearance of any land. When appropriate to the context, “construction” refers to the act of construction or the result of construction. (6)(a) “Major structure” means houses, mobile homes, apartment buildings, condominiums, motels, hotels, restaurants, towers, other types of residential, commercial, or public buildings, and other construction having the potential for substantial impact on coastal zones. (b) “Minor structure” means pile-supported, elevated dune and beach walkover structures; beach access ramps and walkways; stairways; pile-supported, elevated viewing platforms, gazebos, and boardwalks; lifeguard support stands; public and private bathhouses; sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, shuffleboard courts, tennis courts, handball courts, racquetball courts, and other uncovered paved areas; earth retaining walls; and sand fences, privacy fences, ornamental walls, ornamental garden structures, aviaries, and other ornamental construction. It shall be a characteristic of minor structures that they are considered to be expendable under design wind, wave, and storm forces. (c) “Nonhabitable major structure” means swimming pools; parking garages; pipelines; piers; canals, lakes, ditches, drainage structures, and other water retention structures; water and sewage treatment plants; electrical power plants, and all related structures or facilities, transmission lines, distribution lines, transformer pads, vaults, and substations; roads, bridges, streets, and highways; and underground storage tanks. (d) “Coastal or shore protection structure” means shore-hardening structures, such as seawalls, bulkheads, revetments, rubble mound structures, groins, breakwaters, and aggregates of materials other than beach sand used for shoreline protection; beach and dune restoration; and other structures which are intended to prevent erosion or protect other structures from wave and hydrodynamic forces. The enumeration of types of structures in this subsection shall not be construed as excluding from the operation of ss. 161.52-161.58 any other structure which by its usage, design, dimensions, or structural configuration would require engineering consideration similar to the listed structures. (7) “Building support structure” means any structure which supports floor, wall, or column loads and transmits such loads to the foundation, and includes beams, grade beams, or joists and the lowest horizontal structural member exclusive of piles, columns, or footings. (8) “Breakaway wall” or “frangible wall” means a partition independent of supporting structural members that will withstand design wind forces, but will fail under hydrostatic, wave, and runup forces associated with the design storm surge. Under such conditions, the wall will fail in a manner such that it dissolves or breaks up into components that will not act as potentially damaging missiles. (9) “Department” means the Department of Environmental Protection. (10) “State land planning agency” means the Department of Commerce. (11) “State minimum building codes” means the Florida Building Code as identified in s. 553.73. (12) “Substantial improvement” means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or improvement of a structure when the actual cost of the improvement or repair of the structure to its pre-damage condition equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either: (a) Before the improvement or repair is started; or (b) If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. The total cost does not include nonstructural interior finishings, including, but not limited to, finish flooring and floor coverings, base molding, nonstructural substrates, drywall, plaster, paneling, wall covering, tapestries, window treatments, decorative masonry, paint, interior doors, tile, cabinets, moldings and millwork, decorative metal work, vanities, electrical receptacles, electrical switches, electrical fixtures, intercoms, communications and sound systems, security systems, HVAC grills and decorative trim, freestanding metal fireplaces, appliances, water closets, tubs and shower enclosures, lavatories, and water heaters, or roof coverings, except when determining whether the structure has been substantially improved as a result of a single improvement or repair. For the purposes of this definition, “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions or any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places. (13) When used in ss. 161.52-161.58, the terms defined in s. 177.27 have the same meanings as provided in that section.

The council shall develop an index of this information to assist researchers in accessing the information. (2) RESEARCH PLAN.—The council must complete a Florida Oceans and Coastal Scientific Research Plan which shall be used by the Legislature in making funding decisions. The plan must recommend priorities for scientific research projects. Annual updates to the plan must be submitted to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives by February 1 of each year. The research projects contained in the plan must meet at least one of the following objectives: (a) Exploring opportunities to improve coastal ecosystem functioning and health through watershed approaches to managing freshwater and improving water quality. (b) Evaluating current habitat conservation, restoring and maintaining programs, and recommending improvements in the areas of research, monitoring, and assessment. (c) Promoting marine biomedical or biotechnology research and product discovery and development to enhance Florida’s opportunity to maximize the beneficial uses of marine-derived bioproducts and reduce negative health impacts of marine organisms. (d) Creating consensus and strategies on how Florida can contribute to sustainable management of ocean wildlife and habitat. (e) Documenting through examination of existing and new research the impact of marine and coastal debris and current best practices to reduce debris. (f) Providing methods to achieve sustainable fisheries through better science, governance, stock enhancements and consideration of habitat and secondary impacts such as bycatch. (g) Documenting gaps in current protection strategies for marine mammals. (h) Promoting research and new methods to preserve and restore coral reefs and other coral communities. (i) Achieving sustainable marine aquaculture. (j) Reviewing existing and ongoing studies on preventing and responding to the spread of invasive and nonnative marine and estuarine species. (k) Exploring ocean-based renewable energy technologies and climate change-related impacts to Florida’s coastal area. (l) Enhancing science education opportunities such as virtual marine technology centers. (m) Sustaining abundant birdlife and encouraging the recreational and economic benefits associated with ocean and coastal wildlife observation and photography. (n) Developing a statewide analysis of the economic value associated with ocean and coastal resources, developing economic baseline data, methodologies, and consistent measures of oceans and coastal resource economic activity and value, and developing reports that educate Floridians, the United States Commission on Ocean Policy, local, state, and federal agencies and others on the importance of ocean and coastal resources. (3) RESOURCE ASSESSMENT.—The council shall prepare a comprehensive oceans and coastal resource assessment that shall serve as a baseline of information to be used in assisting in its research plan. The resource assessment must include: (a) Patterns of use of oceans and coastal resources; (b) Natural resource features, including, but not limited to, habitat, bathymetry, surficial geology, circulation, and tidal currents; (c) The location of current and proposed oceans and coastal research and monitoring infrastructure; (d) Industrial, commercial, coastal observing system, ships, subs, and recreational transit patterns; and (e) Socioeconomic trends of the state’s oceans and coastal resources and oceans and coastal economy.
