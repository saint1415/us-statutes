This subsection does not restrict a financial institution that claims a religious purpose from making such determinations based on the current or prospective customer’s or member’s religious beliefs, religious exercise, or religious affiliations. (2) It is an unsafe and unsound practice for a financial institution to deny, cancel, suspend, or terminate its services to a person, or to otherwise discriminate against a person in making available such services, or in the terms or conditions of such services, on the basis of: (a) The person’s political opinions, speech, or affiliations; (b) Except as provided in subsection (1), the person’s religious beliefs, religious exercise, or religious affiliations; (c) Any factor if it is not a quantitative, impartial, and risk-based standard, including any such factor related to the person’s business sector; or (d) The use of any rating, scoring, analysis, tabulation, or action that considers a social credit score based on factors including, but not limited to: 1. The person’s political opinions, speech, or affiliations. 2. The person’s religious beliefs, religious exercise, or religious affiliations. 3. The person’s lawful ownership of a firearm. 4. The person’s engagement in the lawful manufacture, distribution, sale, purchase, or use of firearms or ammunition. 5. The person’s engagement in the exploration, production, utilization, transportation, sale, or manufacture of fossil fuel-based energy, timber, mining, or agriculture. 6. The person’s support of the state or Federal Government in combating illegal immigration, drug trafficking, or human trafficking. 7. The person’s engagement with, facilitation of, employment by, support of, business relationship with, representation of, or advocacy for any person described in this paragraph. 8. The person’s failure to meet or commit to meet, or expected failure to meet, any of the following as long as such person is in compliance with applicable state or federal law: a. Environmental standards, including emissions standards, benchmarks, requirements, or disclosures; b. Social governance standards, benchmarks, or requirements, including, but not limited to, environmental or social justice; c. Corporate board or company employment composition standards, benchmarks, requirements, or disclosures based on characteristics protected under the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992; or d. Policies or procedures requiring or encouraging employee participation in social justice programming, including, but not limited to, diversity, equity, or inclusion training. (3) Beginning July 1, 2023, and by July 1 of each year thereafter, financial institutions as defined in s. 655.005 must attest, under penalty of perjury, on a form prescribed by the commission whether the entity is acting in compliance with subsections (1) and (2). (4) If a person who is a customer or member of a financial institution suspects that such financial institution has acted in violation of subsection (2), the aggrieved customer or member may submit a complaint to the office on a form prescribed by the commission within 30 days after such action. A complaint is barred if not timely submitted. The complaint must, at a minimum, contain the name and address of the customer or member, the name of the financial institution, and the facts upon which the customer or member bases his or her allegation. (5) After receipt of a customer’s or member’s complaint under subsection (4): (a) The office must notify the financial institution that a complaint has been filed. (b) Within 90 calendar days after receiving the notice from the office, the financial institution must file with the office a complaint response report containing such information as the commission requires by rule, unless precluded by law. (c) If the complaint response report indicates that the financial institution took action due to suspicious activity, as defined in s. 655.50(3), the initial investigation by the office must be handled in accordance with s. 655.50. If the office determines that the financial institution’s action was taken without any basis under s. 655.50, the office must continue to investigate the financial institution’s action and determine whether the financial institution has acted in violation of subsection (2). (d) Within 90 calendar days after receiving the complaint submitted pursuant to this subsection, the office shall begin an investigation of the alleged violation. (e) After the investigation is completed or ceases to be active, the office shall: 1. Within 30 calendar days after the completion or cessation of the investigation, create a report on the findings of the investigation. Such report, however, may not contain or must redact any information that remains confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1). If the office determines that no violation of subsection (2) has occurred, the report must only: a. Identify the complaint for which the report is made; and b. State that a determination has been made that no violation of subsection (2) has occurred. 2. Except as otherwise provided or prohibited by law, within 45 calendar days after the completion or cessation of the investigation, send such report to the customer or member who submitted the complaint pursuant to this subsection, via certified mail, return receipt requested, delivery restricted to the addressee; and to the subject financial institution. (f) Except as otherwise provided or prohibited by law, if the office determines that a violation of subsection (2) has occurred, the office must provide notice of such violation to the customer or member and to the Department of Financial Services and the enforcing authority, as defined in s. 501.203(2), and provide a copy of the report created pursuant to this subsection. (6) Engaging in a practice described in subsection (2) or failing to timely provide the attestation under subsection (3) is a failure to comply with this chapter, constitutes a violation of the financial institutions codes, and is subject to the applicable sanctions and penalties provided for in the financial institutions codes. (7) Notwithstanding ss. 501.211 and 501.212, a failure to comply with subsection (1) or engaging in a practice described in subsection (2) constitutes a violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act under part II of chapter 501. Violations must be enforced only by the enforcing authority, as defined in s. 501.203(2), and subject the violator to the sanctions and penalties provided for in that part. If such action is successful, the enforcing authority is entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs. (8) The office and the commission may not exercise authority pursuant to s. 655.061 in relation to this section. (9) The commission may adopt rules to administer this section.

(2) The complaint must contain the statement of facts and notice of opportunity for a hearing pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57. (3) If no hearing is requested within the time allowed by ss. 120.569 and 120.57, or if a hearing is held and the office finds that any of the charges are true, the office may enter an order directing the state financial institution, subsidiary, service corporation, financial institution-affiliated party, or the individual named therein to cease and desist from engaging in the conduct complained of and to take corrective action. (4) If the state financial institution, subsidiary, service corporation, financial institution-affiliated party, or the individual named in such order fails to respond to the complaint within the time allotted in ss. 120.569 and 120.57, such failure constitutes a default and justifies the entry of a cease and desist order. (5) A contested or default cease and desist order is effective when reduced to writing and served upon the state financial institution, subsidiary, service corporation, financial institution-affiliated party, or the individual named therein. An uncontested cease and desist order is effective as agreed. (6) Whenever the office finds that conduct described in subsection (1) is likely to cause insolvency, substantial dissipation of assets or earnings of the state financial institution, subsidiary, or service corporation or substantial prejudice to the depositors, members, or shareholders, it may issue an emergency cease and desist order requiring the state financial institution, subsidiary, service corporation, or financial institution-affiliated party to immediately cease and desist from engaging in the conduct complained of and to take corrective action. The emergency order is effective immediately upon service of a copy of the order upon the state financial institution, subsidiary, service corporation, or financial institution-affiliated party and remains effective for 90 days. If the office begins nonemergency cease and desist proceedings under subsection (1), the emergency order remains effective until the conclusion of the proceedings under ss. 120.569 and 120.57. Any emergency order entered under this subsection is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) until the emergency order is made permanent, unless the office finds that such confidentiality will result in substantial risk of financial loss to the public.

A person affected by this prohibition may provide written notice to the office of the proposed appointment or employment. Such notice may provide information that such concurrent service does not present a conflict of interest and that neither institution is competitively disadvantaged in the common market area.

(3) SPECIFIED RESTRICTIONS.—The following restrictions governing the conduct of financial institution-affiliated parties expressly are specified, but such specification is not to be construed in any manner as excusing such parties from the observance of any other aspect of the general fiduciary duty owed by them to the state financial institution which they serve: (a) Remuneration.—A director of a state bank, association, or trust company may not accept director fees unless the director fees have been previously approved by the board of directors and such fees represent reasonable compensation for service as a director or member of a committee. This section does not limit or preclude reasonable compensation as otherwise authorized by subsection (1) for a director who also provides goods or services to the state bank, association, or trust company. (b) Assets.—Except as provided in ss. 657.039 and 658.48, a financial institution-affiliated party may not have any interest, directly or indirectly, in the proceeds of a loan or investment or of a purchase or sale made by the state financial institution, subsidiary, or service corporation unless such loan, investment, purchase, or sale is authorized expressly by resolution of the board of directors and unless such resolution is approved by vote of at least a majority of the directors of the state financial institution with all interested parties taking no part in such vote. (c) Liabilities.—A financial institution-affiliated party may not have any interest, direct or indirect, in the purchase at less than its face value of any evidence of a savings account, deposit, or other indebtedness issued by the state financial institution, subsidiary, or service corporation. (d) Voting rights; office.—A financial institution-affiliated party acting as proxy for a stockholder of a state financial institution, subsidiary, or service corporation may not exercise, transfer, or delegate such vote or votes in any consideration of a private benefit or advantage, direct or indirect. The voting rights of stockholders and directors may not be the subject of sale, barter, exchange, or similar transaction, either directly or indirectly. Any financial institution-affiliated party who violates the provisions of this section is accountable to the state financial institution, subsidiary, or service corporation for any increment.

Such proceeding may not be initiated until after such person has been notified in writing of the nature of the violation and afforded a reasonable period of time, as set forth in the notice, to correct the violation and has failed to do so. If the office provided such notice, a fine for a violation of an office order or written agreement begins to accrue immediately upon service of the complaint and continues to accrue until the violation is corrected. (2) Such fine may not exceed $2,500 per day for each violation except as provided in this section. (a) If the office determines that such person has recklessly violated a provision of the financial institutions codes, an order of the office, or a written agreement with the office, which violation results in more than a minimal loss to a financial institution, affiliate, subsidiary, or service corporation, or in a pecuniary benefit to such person, the office may impose a fine of up to $10,000 per day for each day the violation continues. (b) If the office determines that such person has knowingly violated a provision of the financial institutions codes, an order of the office, or a written agreement with the office, which violation results in more than a minimal loss to a financial institution, affiliate, subsidiary, or service corporation, or in a pecuniary benefit to such person, the office may impose a fine of up to the lesser of $500,000 per day or 1 percent of the total assets in the case of a financial institution, or $50,000 per day in any other case for each day the violation continues. (c) The office may by complaint impose an administrative fine of up to $10,000 per day on a financial institution-affiliated party, on a state financial institution, subsidiary, service corporation, or affiliate, or on a person subject to supervision by the office pursuant to s. 655.0391 which refuses to permit an examiner to examine a state financial institution, subsidiary, or service corporation; to permit an examiner to review the books and records of an affiliate or a contracting service entity subject to supervision by the office pursuant to s. 655.0391; or to give an examiner any information required in the course of an examination or review of the books and records. (3) An administrative fine levied by the office may be enforced by the office in the circuit court of the county in which such person resides or in which the principal office of a state financial institution, affiliate, subsidiary, service corporation, or contracting service entity is located or does business in the state. In any administrative or judicial proceeding arising under this section, a party may elect to correct the violation asserted by the office and, upon doing so, any fine ceases to accrue; however, an election to correct the violation does not render an administrative or judicial proceeding moot.

The owner shall provide written notice to the office that the action was filed and the office may not release the documents pending the outcome of legal action. Failure to file an action within 30 days constitutes a waiver of any claim of confidentiality, and the office shall release the document as requested.

The plan must include a statement of: 1. The type of financial entity which would result if the application were approved and the proposed name under which it would do business. 2. The method and schedule for terminating any activities and disposing of any assets or liabilities that would not conform to the requirements of the resulting financial entity. 3. The impact of such change on the financial entity’s business plan and operations, including any effect on the availability of particular financial services in the market area served by the financial entity. 4. Such financial data as may be required to determine compliance with the capital, reserve, and liquidity requirements applicable to the resulting financial entity. 5. Such other information as the commission may by rule require. (b) Following approval by the board of directors, the conversion plan, together with a certified copy of the authorizing resolution adopted by the board, must be submitted to the office for approval before being submitted to the members or stockholders of the financial entity. The application for conversion must be in the form prescribed by the commission, contain such additional information as the commission or office reasonably requires, and be accompanied by a filing fee in accordance with s. 657.066(3) or s. 658.73. Additionally, the office is authorized to assess any financial entity, applying to convert pursuant to this section, a nonrefundable examination fee to cover the actual costs of any examination required as a part of the application process. (c) The office shall approve the plan if it finds that: 1. The resulting financial entity would have an adequate capital structure with regard to its activities and its deposit liabilities. 2. The proposed conversion would not cause a substantially adverse effect on the financial condition of the financial entity. 3. The officers and directors have sufficient experience, ability, and standing to indicate a reasonable promise for the successful operation of the resulting financial entity. 4. The schedule for termination of any nonconforming activities and disposition of any nonconforming assets and liabilities is reasonably prompt, and the plan for such termination and disposition does not include an unsafe or unsound practice. 5. The officers or directors have not been convicted of, or pled guilty or nolo contendere to, a violation of s. 655.50, relating to money laundering in financial institutions; chapter 896, relating to offenses related to financial transactions; or any similar state or federal law. 6. The resulting financial entity is able to comply with the applicable terms of any regulatory action in effect before the date of the conversion. 7. The current and resulting primary federal regulatory agencies do not object to the proposed conversion. If the office disapproves the plan, it shall state its objections and give the financial entity an opportunity to amend the plan to overcome such objections. The office may deny an application by an entity that is subject to a cease and desist order or other supervisory restriction or order imposed by a state or federal supervisory authority, insurer, or guarantor. (d) If the office approves the plan, it may be submitted to the members or stockholders at an annual meeting or at any special meeting called to consider such action. Upon a favorable vote of a majority of the total number of votes eligible to be cast or, in the case of a credit union, a majority of the members present at the meeting, the plan is adopted. Copies of the minutes of the proceedings of such meeting of the members or stockholders, verified by the affidavit of an officer, as established in the bylaws of the financial institution, must be filed with the office within 10 days after such meeting. Such verified copies of the proceedings of such meeting are presumptive evidence of the holding and action of such meeting. If the members or stockholders approve the plan of conversion, the directors shall then execute new articles of incorporation or amendments to existing articles and two copies of the new bylaws. The directors shall insert in the articles of incorporation the following: “This (bank, association, etc.) is incorporated by conversion from a (national bank, state association, etc.) .” (e) If the members or stockholders adopt the plan of conversion, the financial entity shall apply to the appropriate insurer for a commitment for insurance of accounts for the shares and deposits of the resulting financial entity. (f) The plan shall not take effect until the office has received notice that the commitment for insurance of accounts has been given by the insurer. Upon receipt of such notice, the office shall issue a new charter to the financial entity authorizing it to transact business pursuant to applicable law. (2) The commission may provide by rule for any additional procedures to be followed by any national or federal financial entity seeking to convert its charter pursuant to this section. (3) A mutual financial institution requesting approval to convert its charter may not be converted into a capital stock financial institution until it has complied with the requirements of s. 665.033(1) and (2).

(2) ADOPTION OF A PLAN.—The board of directors of the acquiring or assuming financial entity and the board of directors of the transferring financial institution must adopt, by a majority vote, a plan for such acquisition, assumption, or sale on terms that are mutually agreed upon. The plan must include: (a) The names and types of financial institutions involved. (b) A statement setting forth the material terms of the proposed acquisition, assumption, or sale, including the plan for disposition of all assets and liabilities not subject to the plan. (c) A provision for liquidation, if applicable, of the transferring financial institution upon execution of the plan, or a provision setting forth the business plan for the continued operation of each financial institution after the execution of the plan. (d) A statement that the entire transaction is subject to written approval of the office and approval of the members or stockholders of the transferring financial institution. (e) If a stock financial institution is the transferring financial institution and the proposed sale is not for cash, a clear and concise statement that dissenting stockholders of the institution are entitled to the rights set forth in s. 658.44(4) and (5). (f) The proposed effective date of the acquisition, assumption, or sale and such other information and provisions as necessary to execute the transaction or as required by the office. (3) APPROVAL OF OFFICE.—Following approval by the board of directors of each participating financial institution, the plan, together with certified copies of the authorizing resolutions adopted by the boards and a completed application with a nonrefundable filing fee, must be forwarded to the office for approval or disapproval. The office shall approve the plan of acquisition, assumption, or sale if it appears that: (a) The resulting financial entity or entities would have an adequate capital structure in relation to their activities and their deposit liabilities; (b) The plan is fair to all parties; and (c) The plan is not contrary to the public interest. If the office disapproves the plan, it shall state its objections and give the parties an opportunity to amend the plan to overcome such objections. (4) VOTE OF MEMBERS OR STOCKHOLDERS.—If the office approves the plan, it may be submitted to the members or stockholders of the transferring financial institution at an annual meeting or at a special meeting called to consider such action. Upon a majority vote of the total number of votes eligible to be cast or, in the case of a credit union, a majority vote of the members present at the meeting, the plan is adopted. (5) ADOPTED PLAN; APPROVAL CERTIFICATION; ABANDONMENT; CERTIFICATE OF ACQUISITION, ASSUMPTION, OR SALE.— (a) If the plan is adopted by the members or stockholders of the transferring financial institution, the president or vice president and the cashier, manager, or corporate secretary of such institution shall submit the adopted plan to the office, together with a certified copy of the resolution of the members or stockholders approving it. (b) Upon receipt of the certified copies and evidence that the participating financial institutions have complied with all applicable state and federal law and rules, the office shall certify, in writing, to the participants that the plan has been approved. (c) Notwithstanding approval of the members or stockholders or certification by the office, the board of directors of the transferring financial institution may abandon the transaction without further action or approval by the members or stockholders, subject to the rights of third parties under any contracts relating thereto. (d) After the acquiring financial institution completes the plan and submits a request with any evidence required by the office to confirm the transaction’s completion, the office may issue a certificate to the acquiring financial institution confirming that the acquisition, assumption, or sale transaction has been completed. (6) FEDERALLY CHARTERED OR OUT-OF-STATE INSTITUTION AS A PARTICIPANT.—If one of the participants in a transaction under this section is a federally chartered financial institution or an out-of-state financial institution, all participants must also comply with requirements imposed by federal and other state law for the acquisition, assumption, or sale and provide evidence of such compliance to the office as a condition precedent to the issuance of a certificate authorizing the transaction; however, if the purchasing or assuming financial institution is a federal or out-of-state state-chartered financial institution and the transferring state financial entity will be liquidated, approval of the office is not required. (7) STOCK INSTITUTION ACQUIRING MUTUAL INSTITUTION.—A mutual financial institution may not sell 50 percent or more of its assets to a stock financial institution until it has first converted into a capital stock financial institution in accordance with s. 665.033(1) and (2).

In lieu of causing such appraisals to be made, the office may accept any appraisal caused to be made by an appropriate state or federal regulatory agency or other insuring agency or corporation of a state financial institution.

(2) A state financial institution may not make loans based on the security of real estate unless appraisal standards and policies have been previously established by the board of directors. Such standards must be in written form and include, without limitation, information required by rules of the commission.

The designation of agents, the substitution or removal of agents, or any other change in the contractual terms or provisions governing a convenience account may be made only by the principal.

(3) Any balance standing to the credit of a convenience account shall be paid to the guardian of the property of the principal, to any person designated in a court order entered pursuant to s. 735.206, to any person designated by letter or other writing as authorized by s. 735.301, or to the personal representative of the deceased principal’s estate, upon presentation of effective written notice and, if applicable, proof of judicial appointment of such guardian or personal representative by a court of competent jurisdiction.

      "heading": "Pay-on-death accounts.",
      "text": "655.82 Pay-on-death accounts.— (1) As used in this section: (a) “Account” means a contract of deposit between a depositor and an institution, including, but not limited to, a checking account, savings account, certificate of deposit, and share account. (b) “Beneficiary” means a person named as one to whom sums on deposit in an account are payable on request after death of all parties or for whom a party is named as trustee. (c) “Devisee” means any person designated in a will to receive a testamentary disposition of real or personal property. (d) “Heirs” means those persons, including a surviving spouse, who are entitled, under the laws of this state regarding intestate succession, to the property of a decedent. (e) “Multiple-party account” means an account payable on request to one or more of two or more parties, whether or not a right of survivorship is mentioned. (f) “Party” means a person who, by the terms of an account, has a present right, subject to request, to payment from the account other than as a beneficiary. (g) “Payment” means disbursement of sums on deposit, and includes withdrawal, payment to a party or third person pursuant to check or other request, and a pledge of sums on deposit by a party, or a setoff, reduction, or other disposition of all or part of an account pursuant to a pledge. (h) “Pay-on-death designation” means the designation of: 1. A beneficiary in an account payable on request to one party during the party’s lifetime and on the party’s death to one or more beneficiaries, or to one or more parties during their lifetimes and on death of all of them to one or more beneficiaries; or 2. A beneficiary in an account in the name of one or more parties as trustee for one or more beneficiaries if the relationship is established by the terms of the account and there is no subject of the trust other than the sums on deposit in the account, whether or not payment to the beneficiary is mentioned. (i) “Personal representative” means an executor, administrator, curator, successor personal representative, special administrator, or any other person who performs substantially the same function under the law governing their status. (j) “Receive,” as it relates to notice to an institution, means receipt in the office or branch office of the institution in which the account is established, but if the terms of the account require notice at a particular place, in the place required. (k) “Request” means a request for payment complying with all terms of the account, including special requirements concerning necessary signatures and regulations of the institution; but, for purposes of this section, if terms of the account condition payment on advance notice, a request for payment is treated as immediately effective and a notice of intent to withdraw is treated as a request for payment. (l) “Successor” means any person, other than a creditor, who is entitled to property of a decedent under the decedent’s will or otherwise. (m) “Sums on deposit” means the balance payable on an account, including interest and dividends earned, whether or not included in the current balance, and any deposit of life insurance proceeds added to the account by reason of death of a party. (n) “Terms of the account” means the deposit agreement and other terms and conditions, including the form, of the contract of deposit. (2) A beneficiary in an account having a pay-on-death designation has no right to sums on deposit during the lifetime of any party. (3) In an account with a pay-on-death designation: (a) On the death of one of two or more parties, sums on deposit in the account belong to the surviving party or parties. (b) On the death of the sole party or the last survivor of two or more parties, sums on deposit belong to the surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries. If two or more beneficiaries survive, sums on deposit belong to them in equal and undivided shares, and, unless otherwise provided in a depository agreement written between December 31, 1994, and July 1, 2001, there is no right of survivorship in the event of death of a beneficiary thereafter. If no beneficiary survives, sums on deposit belong to the estate of the last surviving party. (4) A pay-on-death designation in a multiple-party account without right of survivorship is ineffective. For purposes of this section, designation of an account as a tenancy in common establishes that the account is without right of survivorship. (5) The ownership right of a surviving party or beneficiary, or of the decedent’s estate, in sums on deposit is subject to requests for payment made by a party before the party’s death, whether paid by the institution before or after death, or unpaid. The surviving party or beneficiary, or the decedent’s estate, is liable to the payee of an unpaid request for payment. The liability is limited to a proportionate share of the amount transferred under this section, to the extent necessary to discharge the request for payment. (6) An institution, on request, may pay sums on deposit in an account with a pay-on-death designation to: (a) One or more of the parties, whether or not another party is disabled, incapacitated, or deceased when the payment is requested and whether or not a party survives another party; (b) The beneficiary or beneficiaries, if proof of death is presented to the institution showing that the beneficiary or beneficiaries survived all persons named as parties; or (c) The personal representative, if any, or, if there is none, the heirs or devisees of a deceased party, if proof of death is presented to the institution showing that the deceased party was the survivor of all other persons named on the account either as a party or beneficiary. (7) Payment made pursuant to this section discharges the institution from all claims for amounts so paid, whether or not the payment is consistent with the beneficial ownership of the account as between parties, beneficiaries, or their successors. Payment may be made whether or not a party or beneficiary is disabled, incapacitated, or deceased when payment is requested, received, or made. (8) A beneficiary in an account at a credit union having a pay-on-death designation, unless the beneficiary is a member in her or his own right, may not be permitted to vote, obtain an extension of credit, or hold office or be required to pay an entrance or membership fee. (9) The following is an example of the form of a contract of deposit that may be used to select a pay-on-death account for use by one or more parties: SINGLE-PARTY ACCOUNT OR MULTIPLE-PARTY ACCOUNT WITH PAY-ON-DEATH DESIGNATION PARTIES (Name each party): OWNERSHIP (Select one and initial): SINGLE-PARTY ACCOUNT MULTIPLE-PARTY ACCOUNT RIGHTS AT DEATH (Select one and initial): SINGLE-PARTY ACCOUNT At death of the party, ownership passes as part of the party’s estate. SINGLE-PARTY ACCOUNT WITH A PAY-ON-DEATH DESIGNATION (Name one or more beneficiaries): At death of the party, ownership passes to the designated pay-on-death beneficiaries and is not part of the party’s estate. MULTIPLE-PARTY ACCOUNT WITH RIGHT OF SURVIVORSHIP At death of a party, ownership passes to the surviving party or parties. MULTIPLE-PARTY ACCOUNT WITH RIGHT OF SURVIVORSHIP AND A PAY-ON-DEATH DESIGNATION (Name one or more beneficiaries): At death of the last surviving party, ownership passes to the designated pay-on-death beneficiaries and is not part of the last surviving party’s estate.

      "text": "655.90 Closing during emergencies and other special days.— (1) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the term: (a) “Commissioner” means the director of the Office of Financial Regulation and any other person lawfully exercising such powers. (b) “Emergency” means any condition or occurrence, actual or threatened, which may interfere physically with the conduct of normal business operations of an institution or of one or more or all of the departments, sections, functions, offices, or facilities of an institution, or which poses an imminent or existing threat to the safety or security of persons or property, or both. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, an emergency may exist, arise, or be imminent as the result of any one or more, actual or threatened, of the following: fires; floods; earthquakes; tornadoes; hurricanes; wind, rain, or other storms; labor disputes and strikes; power failures; transportation failures; interruption of communication facilities; shortages of fuel, food, transportation, or labor; robberies or burglaries or attempted robberies or burglaries; actual or threatened enemy attacks; epidemics or other catastrophes; explosions; and riots, civil commotions, and other acts of lawlessness or violence, actual or threatened. (c) “Office” means any place at which an institution transacts its business or conducts operations relating to its business. However, this section does not authorize an institution to conduct its banking business at any place or places not otherwise authorized or permitted by law. (d) “Officers” means the person or persons designated by the board of directors, board of trustees, or other governing body of an institution to act for the institution in carrying out the provisions of this section or, in the absence of any such designation or in the absence of the officers so designated, the president or any other officer currently in charge of the institution or of the office or offices in question. (e) The authorizations herein provided for an institution “to close” in case of an emergency means and includes the authority not to open on any business or banking day and, if having opened, to close and suspend business. (2) POWERS OF COMMISSIONER.—Whenever the commissioner is of the opinion that an emergency exists, or is impending, in this state or in any part of this state, he or she may, by proclamation, authorize state and nationally or federally chartered institutions, if not inconsistent with, and if it does not infringe upon, paramount federal law, located in the affected area or areas to close or to close any or all the departments, sections, functions, offices, or facilities thereof. In addition, if the commissioner is of the opinion that an emergency exists, or is impending, which affects, or may affect, a particular institution or institutions, or one or more particular departments, sections, functions, offices, or facilities thereof, but not institutions located in the area generally, he or she may authorize the particular institution or institutions to close or to close one or more of the departments, sections, functions, offices, or facilities thereof. The institution or institutions affected by any such proclamation or authorization may close in accordance therewith. Such institutions and such of the departments, sections, functions, offices, or facilities thereof so closed may remain closed until the commissioner proclaims that the emergency has ended, or until such earlier time as the officers of the institution determine that the institution or any of its departments, sections, functions, offices, or facilities, theretofore closed because of the emergency, should reopen, and, in either event, for such further time thereafter as may reasonably be required to reopen. (3) POWERS OF OFFICERS.— (a) Whenever the officers of an institution are of the opinion that an emergency exists, or is impending, which affects, or may affect, the institution or one or more or all of its departments, sections, functions, offices, or facilities, they shall have the authority, in the reasonable exercise of their discretion, to close the institution or any one or more or all of the departments, sections, functions, offices, or facilities thereof on any business day or days during the continuation of such emergency, even if the commissioner has not issued and does not issue a proclamation of emergency. The office or offices so closed may remain closed until such time as the officers determine that the emergency has ended and for such further time thereafter as may reasonably be required to reopen. However, in no case may such institution or any department, section, function, office, or facility thereof remain closed pursuant to this paragraph for more than 48 consecutive hours, excluding other legal holidays, without requesting the approval of the commissioner. (b) The officers of an institution may close the institution or any one or more or all of the institution’s departments, sections, functions, offices, or facilities on any day or days designated, by proclamation of the President of the United States or the Governor of this state, as a day or days of mourning, rejoicing, or other special observance. (4) NOTICE TO BE GIVEN.— (a) An institution chartered under the laws of this state closing, or closing any of its departments, sections, functions, offices, or facilities, pursuant to the authority granted under subsection (3) shall give notice of its action to the commissioner as promptly as conditions reasonably permit and by any means reasonably available. (b) A national or federal institution closing, or closing any of its departments, sections, functions, offices, or facilities, pursuant to the authority granted by this section shall give notice of its action to the appropriate federal regulatory agency as promptly as conditions reasonably permit and by any means reasonably available. (5) EFFECT OF CLOSING AND PARTIAL CLOSING.— (a) Any day on which an institution, or any one or more of its departments, sections, functions, offices, or facilities, is closed during all or any part of its normal banking hours pursuant to the authorization granted in this section is, with respect to such institution or, if not all its departments, sections, functions, offices, or facilities are closed, then with respect to any of its departments, sections, functions, offices, or facilities which are closed, a legal holiday for all purposes with respect to any business of any kind or character of the institution, or of any of its departments, sections, functions, offices, or facilities, so closed, including, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, matters relating to the time payable, the presenting for payment or acceptance, and the protesting and giving notice of protest and notice of dishonor of bills of exchange, checks, promissory notes, and other items drawn on or payable at such institution and relating to any other banking business of any kind or character. No liability or loss of rights of any kind on the part of any institution or director, officer, or employee thereof accrues or results by virtue of any closing authorized by this section. (b) On any day which by the provisions of this section is deemed or declared to be a legal holiday with respect to any institution or institutions or office or offices thereof, the officers thereof may, in the exercise of their discretion, cause such institution or any office thereof to open its doors or facilities for the transaction or conduct of a limited business by the operation of one or more, but less than all, of its departments, sections, offices, functions, or facilities. On any day when, pursuant to the provisions of this section, less than all the departments, sections, functions, offices, or facilities are open, at the election of such institution the limited business transacted or conducted on such day is deemed for all purposes as transacted or conducted on the next following business day which is not deemed or declared as a legal holiday pursuant to the provisions of this section or of any other provision of law. (6) PROVISIONS CUMULATIVE.—The provisions of this section shall be construed and applied as being in addition to, and not in substitution for or limitation of, any other law of this state or of the United States authorizing the closing of an institution or excusing the delay by an institution in the performance of its duties and obligations because of emergencies or conditions beyond the institution’s control or otherwise.

A person who violates this subsection commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. This subsection does not prohibit the issuance or sale by a financial institution of traveler’s checks, money orders, or other instruments for the transmission or payment of money, by or through employees or agents of the financial institution off the financial institution’s premises. (2) Only a financial institution authorized to do business in this state as provided under subsection (1) may: (a) Transact or solicit business under any name or title that contains the words “bank,” “banc,” “banco,” “banque,” “banker,” “banking,” “trust company,” “savings and loan association,” “savings bank,” or “credit union,” or words of similar import, in any context or in any manner; (b) Use any name, word, trademark, service mark, trade name, Internet address, logo, sign, symbol, or device in any context or in any manner; or (c) Circulate or use any letterhead, billhead, circular, paper, electronic media, Internet website or posting, or writing of any kind or otherwise advertise or represent in any manner, which indicates or reasonably implies that the business being solicited, conducted, or advertised is the kind or character of business transacted or conducted by a financial institution or which is likely to lead any person to believe that such business is that of a financial institution; however, the words “bank,” “banc,” “banco,” “banque,” “banker,” “banking,” “trust company,” “savings and loan association,” “savings bank,” or “credit union,” or the plural of any thereof, may be used by, and in the corporate or other name or title of, any company that is or becomes a holding company of a financial institution pursuant to state or federal law; any subsidiary of such holding company which includes as a part of its name or title all or any part, or abbreviations, of the name or title of the holding company of which it is a subsidiary; any trade organization or association, whether or not incorporated, functioning for the purpose of promoting the interests of financial institutions or holding companies, the active members of which are financial institutions or holding companies; and any international development bank chartered pursuant to part II of chapter 663.

(4) A financial institution, affiliate, subsidiary, or service corporation may not do business, solicit, or advertise in this state using a name, trademark, service mark, trade name, Internet address, or logo that may mislead consumers or cause confusion as to the identification of the proper legal business entity or the nature of the financial institution’s business.

Except for a financial institution duly chartered by the office, the office may also seek an order from the circuit court for the annulment or dissolution of a corporation or any other business entity found violating any provision of this section. For the purposes of this subsection, the interests of a trade organization or association are deemed to be substantially affected if the interests of its members are so affected. The office may also issue and serve upon any person who violates any provision of this section an emergency cease and desist order or a complaint seeking a cease and desist order in accordance with s. 655.033. The office is not required to make any finding or determination that a violation of this section is likely to result in insolvency, substantial dissipation of assets or earnings, or substantial prejudice to any person in association with the issuance of an emergency cease and desist order. (6) This section does not prohibit the lawful establishment or operation of a financial institution, affiliate, subsidiary, or service corporation or prohibit any advertisement or other activity in this state by any person if such prohibition would contravene any applicable federal law that preempts the law of this state.

(2) A claim is also an adverse claim if one of several lessees claims, contrary to the terms of the lease, an exclusive right of access, or if one or more persons claim a right of access as agents or officers of a lessee to the exclusion of others as agents or officers, or if it is claimed that a lessee is the same person as one using another name.

If the rental is not paid within 30 days from the mailing of the notice, the box may be opened in the presence of an officer of the lessor and of a notary public. The contents shall be sealed in a package by a notary public who shall write on the outside the name of the lessee and the date of the opening. The notary public shall execute a certificate reciting the name of the lessee, the date of the opening of the box, and a list of its contents. The certificate shall be included in the package, and a copy of the certificate shall be sent by certified mail to the last known address of the lessee. The package shall then be placed in the general vaults of the lessor at a rental not exceeding the rental previously charged for the box. The lessor has a lien on the package and its contents to the extent of any rental due and owing plus the actual, reasonable costs of removing the contents from the safe-deposit box. (2) If the contents of the safe-deposit box have not been claimed within 1 year after the mailing of the certificate, the lessor may send a further notice to the last known address of the lessee stating that, unless the accumulated charges are paid within 30 days, the contents of the box will be sold at public auction at a specified time and place or, in the case of securities listed on a stock exchange, will be sold upon the exchange on or after a specified date and unsalable items will be destroyed. The time, place, and manner of sale shall also be posted conspicuously on the premises of the lessor and advertised once in a newspaper of general circulation in the community. If the articles are not claimed, they may then be sold in accordance with the notice. The balance of the proceeds, after deducting accumulated charges, including the expenses of advertising and conducting the sale, shall be deposited to the credit of the lessee in any account maintained by the lessee, or, if none, shall be deemed a deposit account with the financial institution operating the safe-deposit facility, and shall be identified on the books of the financial institution as arising from the sale of contents of a safe-deposit box. (3) Any documents or writings of a private nature, and having little or no apparent value, need not be offered for sale, but shall be retained, unless claimed by the owner, for the period specified for unclaimed contents, after which they may be destroyed.
