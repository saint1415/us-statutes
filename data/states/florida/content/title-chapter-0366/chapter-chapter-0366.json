As used in this subsection, the term “appliance” means a device or apparatus manufactured and designed to use energy and for which the Florida Building Code or the Florida Fire Prevention Code provides specific requirements. (3) Notwithstanding the restrictions of this section, this section does not prevent the board of a municipality or governmental entity which owns or operates and directly controls an electric or natural gas utility from passing rules, regulations, or policies governing the utility. (4) This section does not expand or alter the jurisdiction of the commission over public utilities or electric utilities. (5) Any municipality, county, board, agency, commission, or authority of any county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision, special district, community development district created pursuant to chapter 190, or political subdivision charter, resolution, ordinance, rule, code, policy, or action that is preempted by this act that existed before or on July 1, 2021, is void.

      "text": "366.04 Jurisdiction of commission.— (1) In addition to its existing functions, the commission shall have jurisdiction to regulate and supervise each public utility with respect to its rates and service; assumption by it of liabilities or obligations as guarantor, endorser, or surety; and the issuance and sale of its securities, except a security which is a note or draft maturing not more than 1 year after the date of such issuance and sale and aggregating (together with all other then-outstanding notes and drafts of a maturity of 1 year or less on which such public utility is liable) not more than 5 percent of the par value of the other securities of the public utility then outstanding. In the case of securities having no par value, the par value for the purpose of this section shall be the fair market value as of the date of issue. The commission, upon application by a public utility, may authorize the utility to issue and sell securities of one or more offerings, or of one or more types, over a period of up to 12 months; or, if the securities are notes or drafts maturing not more than 1 year after the date of issuance and sale, the commission, upon such application, may authorize the utility to issue and sell such securities over a period of up to 24 months. The commission may take final action to grant an application by a public utility to issue and sell securities or to assume liabilities or obligations after having given notice in the Florida Administrative Register published at least 7 days in advance of final agency action. In taking final action on such application, the commission may deny authorization for the issuance or sale of a security or assumption of a liability or obligation if the security, liability, or obligation is for nonutility purposes; and shall deny authorization for the issuance or sale of a security or assumption of a liability or obligation if the financial viability of the public utility is adversely affected such that the public utility’s ability to provide reasonable service at reasonable rates is jeopardized. Securities issued by a public utility or liabilities or obligations assumed by a public utility as guarantor, endorser, or surety pursuant to an order of the commission, which order is certified by the clerk of the commission and which order approves or authorizes the issuance and sale of such securities or the assumption of such liabilities or obligations, shall not be invalidated by a modification, repeal, or amendment to that order or by a supplemental order; however, the commission’s approval of the issuance of securities or the assumption of liabilities or obligations shall constitute approval only as to the legality of the issue or assumption, and in no way shall it be considered commission approval of the rates, service, accounts, valuation, estimates, or determinations of cost or any other such matter. The jurisdiction conferred upon the commission shall be exclusive and superior to that of all other boards, agencies, political subdivisions, municipalities, towns, villages, or counties, and, in case of conflict therewith, all lawful acts, orders, rules, and regulations of the commission shall in each instance prevail. (2) In the exercise of its jurisdiction, the commission shall have power over electric utilities for the following purposes: (a) To prescribe uniform systems and classifications of accounts. (b) To prescribe a rate structure for all electric utilities. (c) To require electric power conservation and reliability within a coordinated grid, for operational as well as emergency purposes. (d) To approve territorial agreements between and among rural electric cooperatives, municipal electric utilities, and other electric utilities under its jurisdiction. However, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to alter existing territorial agreements as between the parties to such agreements. (e) To resolve, upon petition of a utility or on its own motion, any territorial dispute involving service areas between and among rural electric cooperatives, municipal electric utilities, and other electric utilities under its jurisdiction. In resolving territorial disputes, the commission may consider, but not be limited to consideration of, the ability of the utilities to expand services within their own capabilities and the nature of the area involved, including population, the degree of urbanization of the area, its proximity to other urban areas, and the present and reasonably foreseeable future requirements of the area for other utility services. (f) To prescribe and require the filing of periodic reports and other data as may be reasonably available and as necessary to exercise its jurisdiction hereunder. No provision of this chapter shall be construed or applied to impede, prevent, or prohibit any municipally owned electric utility system from distributing at retail electrical energy within its corporate limits, as such corporate limits exist on July 1, 1974; however, existing territorial agreements shall not be altered or abridged hereby. (3) In the exercise of its jurisdiction, the commission shall have the authority over natural gas utilities for the following purposes: (a) To approve territorial agreements between and among natural gas utilities. However, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to alter existing territorial agreements between the parties to such agreements. (b) To resolve, upon petition of a utility or on its own motion, any territorial dispute involving service areas between and among natural gas utilities. In resolving territorial disputes, the commission may consider, but not be limited to consideration of, the ability of the utilities to expand services within their own capabilities and the nature of the area involved, including population, the degree of urbanization of the area, its proximity to other urban areas, and the present and reasonably foreseeable future requirements of the area for other utility services. (c) For purposes of this subsection, “natural gas utility” means any utility which supplies natural gas or manufactured gas or liquefied gas with air admixture, or similar gaseous substance by pipeline, to or for the public and includes gas public utilities, gas districts, and natural gas utilities or municipalities or agencies thereof. (4) Any customer shall be given an opportunity to present oral or written communications in commission proceedings to approve territorial agreements or resolve territorial disputes. If the commission proposes to consider such material, then all parties shall be given an opportunity to cross-examine or challenge or rebut it. Any substantially affected customer shall have the right to intervene in such proceedings. (5) The commission shall further have jurisdiction over the planning, development, and maintenance of a coordinated electric power grid throughout Florida to assure an adequate and reliable source of energy for operational and emergency purposes in Florida and the avoidance of further uneconomic duplication of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. (6) The commission shall further have exclusive jurisdiction to prescribe and enforce safety standards for transmission and distribution facilities of all public electric utilities, cooperatives organized under the Rural Electric Cooperative Law, and electric utilities owned and operated by municipalities. In adopting safety standards, the commission shall, at a minimum: (a) Adopt the 1984 edition of the National Electrical Safety Code (ANSI C2) as initial standards; and (b) Adopt, after review, any new edition of the National Electrical Safety Code (ANSI C2). The standards prescribed by the current 1984 edition of the National Electrical Safety Code (ANSI C2) shall constitute acceptable and adequate requirements for the protection of the safety of the public, and compliance with the minimum requirements of that code shall constitute good engineering practice by the utilities. The administrative authority referred to in the 1984 edition of the National Electrical Safety Code is the commission. However, nothing herein shall be construed as superseding, repealing, or amending the provisions of s. 403.523(1) and (10). (7)(a) As used in this subsection, the term “affected municipal electric utility” means a municipality that operates an electric utility that: 1. Serves two cities in the same county; 2. Is located in a noncharter county; 3. Has between 30,000 and 35,000 retail electric customers as of September 30, 2007; and 4. Does not have a service territory that extends beyond its home county as of September 30, 2007. (b) Each affected municipal electric utility shall conduct a referendum election of all of its retail electric customers, with each named retail electric customer having one vote, concurrent with the next regularly scheduled general election following the effective date of this act. (c) The ballot for the referendum election required under paragraph (b) shall contain the following question: “Should a separate electric utility authority be created to operate the business of the electric utility in the affected municipal electric utility?” The statement shall be followed by the word “yes” and the word “no.” (d) The provisions of the Election Code relating to notice and conduct of the election shall be followed to the extent practicable. Costs of the referendum election shall be borne by the affected municipal electric utility. (8)(a) The commission shall regulate and enforce rates, charges, terms, and conditions of pole attachments, including the types of attachments regulated under 47 U.S.C. s. 224(a)(4), attachments to streetlight fixtures, attachments to poles owned by a public utility, or attachments to poles owned by a communications services provider, to ensure that such rates, charges, terms, and conditions are just and reasonable. The commission’s authority under this subsection includes, but is not limited to, the state regulatory authority referenced in 47 U.S.C. s. 224(c). (b) In the development of rules pursuant to paragraph (g), the commission shall consider the interests of the subscribers and users of the services offered through such pole attachments, as well as the interests of the consumers of any pole owner providing such attachments. (c) It is the intent of the Legislature to encourage parties to enter into voluntary pole attachment agreements, and this subsection may not be construed to prevent parties from voluntarily entering into pole attachment agreements without commission approval. (d) A party’s right to nondiscriminatory access to a pole under this subsection is identical to the rights afforded under 47 U.S.C. s. 224(f)(1). A pole owner may deny access to its poles on a nondiscriminatory basis when there is insufficient capacity, for reasons of safety and reliability, and when required by generally applicable engineering purposes. A pole owner’s evaluation of capacity, safety, reliability, and engineering requirements must consider relevant construction and reliability standards approved by the commission. (e) The commission shall hear and resolve complaints concerning rates, charges, terms, conditions, voluntary agreements, or any denial of access relative to pole attachments. Federal Communications Commission precedent is not binding upon the commission in the exercise of its authority under this subsection. When taking action upon such complaints, the commission shall establish just and reasonable cost-based rates, terms, and conditions for pole attachments and shall apply the decisions and orders of the Federal Communications Commission and any appellate court decisions reviewing an order of the Federal Communications Commission regarding pole attachment rates, terms, or conditions in determining just and reasonable pole attachment rates, terms, and conditions unless a pole owner or attaching entity establishes by competent substantial evidence pursuant to proceedings conducted pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57 that an alternative cost-based pole attachment rate is just and reasonable and in the public interest. (f) In the administration and implementation of this subsection, the commission shall authorize any petitioning pole owner or attaching entity to participate as an intervenor with full party rights under chapter 120 in the first four formal administrative proceedings conducted to determine pole attachment rates under this section. These initial four proceedings are intended to provide commission precedent on the establishment of pole attachment rates by the commission and help guide negotiations toward voluntary pole attachment agreements. After the fourth such formal administrative proceeding is concluded by final order, parties to subsequent pole attachment rate proceedings are limited to the specific pole owner and pole attaching entities involved in and directly affected by the specific pole attachment rate. (g) The commission shall propose procedural rules to administer and implement this subsection. The rules must be proposed for adoption no later than January 1, 2022, and, upon adoption of such rules, shall provide its certification to the Federal Communications Commission pursuant to 47 U.S.C. s. 224(c)(2). (9)(a) The commission shall regulate the safety, vegetation management, repair, replacement, maintenance, relocation, emergency response, and storm restoration requirements for poles of communication services providers. This subsection does not apply to a communications services provider that owns no poles. (b) The commission shall adopt rules to administer and implement this subsection. The rules must be proposed for adoption no later than April 1, 2022, and must address at least the following: 1. Mandatory pole inspections, including repair or replacement; 2. Vegetation management requirements for poles owned by providers of communications services; and 3. Monetary penalties to be imposed upon any communications services provider that fails to comply with any such rule of the commission. Monetary penalties imposed by the commission must be consistent with s. 366.095. (c) The commission may access the books and records of communications services providers to the limited extent necessary to perform its functions and to exercise its authority under subsection (8), this subsection, and s. 366.97(4). Upon request by a communications services provider, any records that are received by the commission under this paragraph which are proprietary confidential business information under s. 364.183 or s. 366.093 shall retain their status as confidential or exempt from disclosure under s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution.

In its consideration thereof, the commission shall have authority, and it shall be the commission’s duty, to hear service complaints, if any, that may be presented by subscribers and the public during any proceedings involving such rates, charges, fares, tolls, or rentals; however, no service complaints shall be taken up or considered by the commission at any proceedings involving rates, charges, fares, tolls, or rentals unless the utility has been given at least 30 days’ written notice thereof, and any proceeding may be extended, prior to final determination, for such period; further, no order hereunder shall be made effective until a reasonable time has been given the utility involved to correct the cause of service complaints, considering the factor of growth in the community and availability of necessary equipment. (2) The power and authority herein conferred upon the commission shall not cancel or amend any existing punitive powers of the commission but shall be supplementary thereto and shall be construed liberally to further the legislative intent that adequate service be rendered by public utilities in the state in consideration for the rates, charges, fares, tolls, and rentals fixed by said commission and observed by said utilities under its jurisdiction. (3) The term “public utility” as used herein means all persons or corporations which the commission has the authority, power, and duty to regulate for the purpose of fixing rates and charges for services rendered and requiring the rendition of adequate service. (4) No electric utility may collect impact fees designed to recover capital costs in initiating new service unless the utility can demonstrate and the commission finds that such fees are fair, just, and reasonable and are collected from the ultimate utility customer of record at such time as or after permanent electric service is provided. This prohibition shall not apply to underground electric distribution lines or line extension charges collected pursuant to approved tariffs.

(b) If the commission authorizes a public utility to charge tiered rates based upon levels of usage and to vary its regular billing period, the utility may not charge a customer a higher rate because of an increase in usage attributable to an extension of the billing period; however, the regular meter reading date may not be advanced or postponed more than 5 days for routine operating reasons without prorating the billing for the period. (c) Effective January 1, 2016, a utility may not charge or receive a deposit in excess of the following amounts: 1. For an existing account, the total deposit may not exceed 2 months of average actual charges, calculated by adding the monthly charges from the 12-month period immediately before the date any change in the deposit amount is sought, dividing this total by 12, and multiplying the result by 2. If the account has less than 12 months of actual charges, the deposit shall be calculated by adding the available monthly charges, dividing this total by the number of months available, and multiplying the result by 2. 2. For a new service request, the total deposit may not exceed 2 months of projected charges, calculated by adding the 12 months of projected charges, dividing this total by 12, and multiplying the result by 2. Once a new customer has had continuous service for a 12-month period, the amount of the deposit shall be recalculated using actual data. Any difference between the projected and actual amounts must be resolved by the customer paying any additional amount that may be billed by the utility or the utility returning any overcharge. (d) If a utility has more than one rate for any customer class, it must notify each customer in that class of the available rates and explain how the rate is charged to the customer. If a customer contacts the utility seeking assistance in selecting the most advantageous rate, the utility must provide good faith assistance to the customer. The customer is responsible for charges for service provided under the selected rate. (e) New tariffs and changes to an existing tariff, other than an administrative change that does not substantially change the meaning or operation of the tariff, must be approved by majority vote of the commission, except as otherwise specifically provided by law. (2) Every public utility, as defined in s. 366.02, which in addition to the production, transmission, delivery or furnishing of heat, light, or power also sells appliances or other merchandise shall keep separate and individual accounts for the sale and profit deriving from such sales. No profit or loss shall be taken into consideration by the commission from the sale of such items in arriving at any rate to be charged for service by any public utility. (3) The commission shall provide for the examination and testing of all meters used for measuring any product or service of a public utility. (4) Any consumer or user may have any such meter tested upon payment of the fees fixed by the commission. (5) The commission shall establish reasonable fees to be paid for testing such meters on the request of the consumers or users, the fee to be paid by the consumer or user at the time of his or her request, but to be paid by the public utility and repaid to the consumer or user if the meter is found defective or incorrect to the disadvantage of the consumer or user, in excess of the degree or amount of tolerance customarily allowed for such meters, or as may be provided for in rules and regulations of the commission. (6) The commission may purchase materials, apparatus, and standard measuring instruments for such examination and tests. (7) The commission shall have the power to require reports from all electric utilities to assure the development of adequate and reliable energy grids. (8) If the commission determines that there is probable cause to believe that inadequacies exist with respect to the energy grids developed by the electric utility industry, including inadequacies in fuel diversity or fuel supply reliability, it shall have the power, after proceedings as provided by law, and after a finding that mutual benefits will accrue to the electric utilities involved, to require installation or repair of necessary facilities, including generating plants and transmission facilities, with the costs to be distributed in proportion to the benefits received, and to take all necessary steps to ensure compliance. The electric utilities involved in any action taken or orders issued pursuant to this subsection shall have full power and authority, notwithstanding any general or special laws to the contrary, to jointly plan, finance, build, operate, or lease generating and transmission facilities and shall be further authorized to exercise the powers granted to corporations in chapter 361. This subsection shall not supersede or control any provision of the Florida Electrical Power Plant Siting Act, ss. 403.501-403.518. (9) The commission may require the filing of reports and other data by a public utility or its affiliated companies, including its parent company, regarding transactions, or allocations of common costs, among the utility and such affiliated companies. The commission may also require such reports or other data necessary to ensure that a utility’s ratepayers do not subsidize nonutility activities. (10) The Legislature finds that violations of commission orders or rules, in connection with the impairment of a public utility’s operations or service, constitute irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law. The commission is authorized to seek relief in circuit court including temporary and permanent injunctions, restraining orders, or any other appropriate order. Such remedies shall be in addition to and supplementary to any other remedies available for enforcement of agency action under s. 120.69 or the provisions of this chapter. The commission shall establish procedures implementing this section by rule. (11) The commission has the authority to assess a public utility for reasonable travel costs associated with reviewing the records of the public utility and its affiliates when such records are kept out of state. The public utility may bring the records back into the state for review.

(b) Any utility which provides a portion of those transmission facilities involved in the transfer of energy from a producing utility to a recipient utility or utilities shall be entitled to receive an appropriate reimbursement commensurate with the transmission facilities and services provided. However, no utility shall be required to sell purchased power to a recipient utility or utilities at a rate lower than the rate at which the power is purchased from a producing utility. (3) To assure efficient and reliable operation of a state energy grid, the commission shall have the power to require any electric utility to transmit electrical energy over its transmission lines from one utility to another or as a part of the total energy supply of the entire grid, subject to the provisions hereof.

Such interim rates may be based upon a test period different from the test period used in the request for permanent rate relief. To establish a prima facie entitlement for interim relief, the commission, the petitioning party, or the public utility shall demonstrate that the public utility is earning outside the range of reasonableness on rate of return calculated in accordance with subsection (5). (2)(a) In a proceeding for an interim increase in rates, the commission shall authorize, within 60 days of the filing for such relief, the collection of rates sufficient to earn the minimum of the range of rate of return calculated in accordance with subparagraph (5)(b)2. The difference between the interim rates and the previously authorized rates shall be collected under bond or corporate undertaking subject to refund with interest at a rate ordered by the commission. (b) In a proceeding for an interim decrease in rates, the commission shall authorize, within 60 days of the filing for such relief, the continued collection of the previously authorized rates; however, revenues collected under those rates sufficient to reduce the achieved rate of return to the maximum of the range of rate of return calculated in accordance with subparagraph (5)(b)2. shall be placed under bond or corporate undertaking subject to refund with interest at a rate ordered by the commission. (c) The commission shall determine whether a corporate undertaking may be filed in lieu of the bond. (3) In granting such relief, the commission may, in an expedited hearing but within 60 days of the commencement of the proceeding, upon petition or upon its own motion, preclude the recovery of any extraordinary or imprudently incurred expenditures or, for good cause shown, increase the amount of the bond or corporate undertaking. (4) Any refund ordered by the commission shall be calculated to reduce the rate of return of the public utility during the pendency of the proceeding to the same level within the range of the newly authorized rate of return which is found fair and reasonable on a prospective basis, but the refund shall not be in excess of the amount of the revenues collected subject to refund and in accordance with paragraph (2)(b). In addition, the commission may require interest on the refund at a rate established by the commission. (5)(a) In setting interim rates or setting revenues subject to refund, the commission shall determine the revenue deficiency or excess by calculating the difference between the achieved rate of return of a public utility and its required rate of return applied to an average investment rate base or an end-of-period investment rate base. (b) For purposes of this subsection: 1. “Achieved rate of return” means the rate of return earned by the public utility for the most recent 12-month period. The achieved rate of return shall be calculated by applying appropriate adjustments consistent with those which were used in the most recent individual rate proceeding of the public utility and annualizing any rate changes occurring during such period. 2. “Required rate of return” shall be calculated as the weighted average cost of capital for the most recent 12-month period, using the last authorized rate of return on equity of the public utility, the current embedded cost of fixed-rate capital, the actual cost of short-term debt, the actual cost of variable-cost debt, and the actual cost of other sources of capital which were used in the last individual rate proceeding of the public utility. 3. In a proceeding for an interim increase, the term “last authorized rate of return on equity” used in subparagraph 2. means the minimum of the range of the last authorized rate of return on equity established in the most recent individual rate proceeding of the public utility. In a proceeding for an interim decrease, the term “last authorized rate of return on equity” used in subparagraph 2. means the maximum of the range of the last authorized rate of return on equity established in the most recent individual rate proceeding of the public utility. The last authorized return on equity for purposes of this subsection shall be established only: in the most recent rate case of the utility; in a limited scope proceeding for the individual utility; or by voluntary stipulation of the utility approved by the commission.

Upon request of the public utility or other person, any records received by the commission which are shown and found by the commission to be proprietary confidential business information shall be kept confidential and shall be exempt from s. 119.07(1). (2) Discovery in any docket or proceeding before the commission shall be in the manner provided for in Rule 1.280 of the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. Information which affects a utility’s rates or cost of service shall be considered relevant for purposes of discovery in any docket or proceeding where the utility’s rates or cost of service are at issue. The commission shall determine whether information requested in discovery affects a utility’s rates or cost of service. Upon a showing by a utility or other person and a finding by the commission that discovery will require the disclosure of proprietary confidential business information, the commission shall issue appropriate protective orders designating the manner for handling such information during the course of the proceeding and for protecting such information from disclosure outside the proceeding. Such proprietary confidential business information shall be exempt from s. 119.07(1). Any records provided pursuant to a discovery request for which proprietary confidential business information status is requested shall be treated by the commission and the office of the Public Counsel and any other party subject to the public records law as confidential and shall be exempt from s. 119.07(1), pending a formal ruling on such request by the commission or the return of the records to the person providing the records. Any record which has been determined to be proprietary confidential business information and is not entered into the official record of the proceeding must be returned to the person providing the record within 60 days after the final order, unless the final order is appealed. If the final order is appealed, any such record must be returned within 30 days after the decision on appeal. The commission shall adopt the necessary rules to implement this provision. (3) Proprietary confidential business information means information, regardless of form or characteristics, which is owned or controlled by the person or company, is intended to be and is treated by the person or company as private in that the disclosure of the information would cause harm to the ratepayers or the person’s or company’s business operations, and has not been disclosed unless disclosed pursuant to a statutory provision, an order of a court or administrative body, or private agreement that provides that the information will not be released to the public. Proprietary confidential business information includes, but is not limited to: (a) Trade secrets. (b) Internal auditing controls and reports of internal auditors. (c) Security measures, systems, or procedures. (d) Information concerning bids or other contractual data, the disclosure of which would impair the efforts of the public utility or its affiliates to contract for goods or services on favorable terms. (e) Information relating to competitive interests, the disclosure of which would impair the competitive business of the provider of the information. (f) Employee personnel information unrelated to compensation, duties, qualifications, or responsibilities. (4) Any finding by the commission that records contain proprietary confidential business information is effective for a period set by the commission not to exceed 18 months, unless the commission finds, for good cause, that the protection from disclosure shall be for a specified longer period. The commission shall order the return of records containing proprietary confidential business information when such records are no longer necessary for the commission to conduct its business. At that time, the commission shall order any other person holding such records to return them to the person providing the records. Records containing proprietary confidential business information which have not been returned at the conclusion of the period set pursuant to this subsection shall no longer be exempt from s. 119.07(1) unless the public utility or affected person shows, and the commission finds, that the records continue to contain proprietary confidential business information. Upon such finding, the commission may extend the period for confidential treatment for a period not to exceed 18 months unless the commission finds, for good cause, that the protection from disclosure shall be for a specified longer period. During commission consideration of an extension, the records in question will remain exempt from s. 119.07(1). The commission shall adopt rules to implement this provision which shall include notice to the public utility or affected person regarding the expiration of confidential treatment.

(2) Each public utility shall designate employees who are authorized to direct an ordered continuation or restoration of medically essential electric service. A public utility shall not impose upon any customer any additional deposit to continue or restore medically essential electric service. (3)(a) Each public utility shall annually provide a written explanation of the certification process for medically essential electric service to each utility customer. Certification of a customer’s electricity needs as medically essential requires the customer to complete forms supplied by the public utility and to submit a form completed by a physician licensed in this state pursuant to chapter 458 or chapter 459 which states in medical and nonmedical terms why the electric service is medically essential. False certification of medically essential service by a physician is a violation of s. 458.331(1)(h) or s. 459.015(1)(i). (b) Medically essential service shall be recertified once every 12 months. The public utility shall send the certified customer by regular mail a package of recertification materials, including recertification forms, at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the customer’s certification. The materials shall advise the certified customer that he or she must complete and submit the recertification forms within 30 days after the expiration of customer’s existing certification. If the recertification forms are not received within this 30-day period, the public utility may terminate the customer’s certification. (4) Each public utility shall certify a customer’s electric service as medically essential if the customer completes the requirements of subsection (3). (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a public utility may disconnect service to a residence whenever an emergency may threaten the health or safety of a person, the surrounding area, or the public utility’s distribution system. The public utility shall act promptly to restore service as soon as feasible. (6) No later than 24 hours before any scheduled disconnection of service for nonpayment of bills to a customer who requires medically essential service, a public utility shall attempt to contact the customer by telephone in order to provide notice of the scheduled disconnection. If the customer does not have a telephone number listed on the account or if the public utility cannot reach the customer or other adult resident of the premises by telephone by the specified time, the public utility shall send a representative to the customer’s residence to attempt to contact the customer, no later than 4 p.m. of the day before scheduled disconnection. If contact is not made, however, the public utility may leave written notification at the residence advising the customer of the scheduled disconnection. Thereafter, the public utility may disconnect service on the specified date. (7) Each public utility customer who requires medically essential service is responsible for making satisfactory arrangements with the public utility to ensure payment for such service, and such arrangements must be consistent with the requirements of the utility’s tariff. (8) Each public utility customer who requires medically essential service is solely responsible for any backup equipment or power supply and a planned course of action in the event of a power outage or interruption of service. (9) Each public utility that provides electric service to any customer who requires medically essential service shall call, contact, or otherwise advise such customer of scheduled service interruptions. (10)(a) Each public utility shall provide information on sources of state or local agency funding which may provide financial assistance to the public utility’s customers who require medically essential service and who notify the public utility of their need for financial assistance. (b)1. Each public utility that operates a program to receive voluntary financial contributions from the public utility’s customers to provide assistance to persons who are unable to pay for the public utility’s services shall maintain a list of all agencies to which the public utility distributes such funds for such purposes and shall make the list available to any such person who requests the list. 2. Each public utility that operates such a program shall: a. Maintain a system of accounting for the specific amounts distributed to each such agency, and the public utility and such agencies shall maintain a system of accounting for the specific amounts distributed to persons under such respective programs. b. Train its customer service representatives to assist any person who possesses a medically essential certification as provided in this section in identifying such agencies and programs. (11) Nothing in this act shall form the basis for any cause of action against a public utility. Failure to comply with any obligation created by this act does not constitute evidence of negligence on the part of the public utility. History.—ss. 1, 2, ch. 2001-49.

The Legislature directs the commission to develop and adopt overall goals and authorizes the commission to require each utility to develop plans and implement programs for increasing energy efficiency and conservation and demand-side renewable energy systems within its service area, subject to the approval of the commission. Since solutions to our energy problems are complex, the Legislature intends that the use of solar energy, renewable energy sources, highly efficient systems, cogeneration, and load-control systems be encouraged. Accordingly, in exercising its jurisdiction, the commission shall not approve any rate or rate structure which discriminates against any class of customers on account of the use of such facilities, systems, or devices. This expression of legislative intent shall not be construed to preclude experimental rates, rate structures, or programs. The Legislature further finds and declares that ss. 366.80-366.83 and 403.519 are to be liberally construed in order to meet the complex problems of reducing and controlling the growth rates of electric consumption and reducing the growth rates of weather-sensitive peak demand; increasing the overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness of electricity and natural gas production and use; encouraging further development of demand-side renewable energy systems; and conserving expensive resources, particularly petroleum fuels.

(2) Each public utility which owns or operates at least one electric generating unit affected by s. 404 or s. 405 of the Clean Air Act may submit, for commission approval, a plan to bring generating units into compliance with the Clean Air Act. A plan to implement compliance submitted by public utilities must include, at a minimum: (a) The number and identity of affected generating units; (b) A description of the proposed action, and alternative actions considered by the public utility, to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions to levels required by the Clean Air Act at each affected unit; (c) A description of the proposed action, and alternative actions considered by the public utility, to comply with nitrogen oxide emission rates required by the Clean Air Act at each affected unit; (d) Estimated effects of the public utility’s proposed plan on the following: 1. Requirements for construction and operation of proposed or alternative facilities; 2. Achievable emissions reductions and methods for monitoring emissions; 3. The public utility’s proposed schedule for implements of compliance activities; 4. The estimated cost of implementation of the public utility’s compliance plan to the utility’s customers; 5. The public utility’s present and potential future sources of fuel; and 6. A statement of why the public utility’s proposed compliance plan is reasonable and in the public interest. (e) A description of the proposed actions to comply with federal, state, and local requirements to implement the Clean Air Act. (3) The commission shall review a plan to implement the Clean Air Act compliance submitted by public utilities pursuant to this section in order to determine whether such plans, the costs necessarily incurred in implementing such plans, and any effect on rates resulting from such implementation are in the public interest. The commission shall by order approve or disapprove plans to implement compliance submitted by public utilities within 8 months after the date of filing. Approval of a plan submitted by a public utility shall establish that the utility’s plan to implement compliance is prudent and the commission shall retain jurisdiction to determine in a subsequent proceeding that the actual costs of implementing the compliance plan are reasonable; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to interfere with the authority of the Department of Environmental Protection to determine whether a public utility is in compliance with ss. 403.087 and 403.0872 or the State Air Implementation Plan for the Clean Air Act.

(b) “Commission” means the Florida Public Service Commission. (c) “Environmental laws or regulations” includes all federal, state, or local statutes, administrative regulations, orders, ordinances, resolutions, or other requirements that apply to electric utilities and are designed to protect the environment. (d) “Environmental compliance costs” includes all costs or expenses incurred by an electric utility in complying with environmental laws or regulations, including, but not limited to: 1. Inservice capital investments, including the electric utility’s last authorized rate of return on equity thereon. 2. Operation and maintenance expenses. 3. Fuel procurement costs. 4. Purchased power costs. 5. Emission allowance costs. 6. Direct taxes on environmental equipment. 7. Costs or expenses prudently incurred by an electric utility pursuant to an agreement entered into on or after the effective date of this act and prior to October 1, 2002, between the electric utility and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection or the United States Environmental Protection Agency for the exclusive purpose of ensuring compliance with ozone ambient air quality standards by an electrical generating facility owned by the electric utility. 8. Costs or expenses prudently incurred for scientific research and geological assessments of carbon capture and storage conducted in this state for the purpose of reducing an electric utility’s greenhouse gas emissions when such costs or expenses are incurred in joint research projects with Florida state government agencies and Florida state universities. 9. Costs or expenses prudently incurred by an electric utility after July 1, 2021, pursuant to an agreement between the electric utility and a governmental wastewater utility for the exclusive purpose of the electric utility constructing and operating a wastewater reuse system where operation of the system will serve to further compliance with environmental laws or regulations that apply to the electric utility and where the system fully or partially satisfies a local government’s reclaimed water reuse requirements under s. 403.064 or s. 403.086. At least 50 percent of the reclaimed water the system produces must be used in conjunction with the water requirements of an electrical generating facility or facilities owned by the electric utility to offset all or part of the electric utility’s water use authorized by permit. (2) An electric utility may submit to the commission a petition describing the utility’s proposed environmental compliance activities and projected environmental compliance costs in addition to any Clean Air Act compliance activities and costs shown in a utility’s filing under s. 366.825. If approved, the commission shall allow recovery of the utility’s prudently incurred environmental compliance costs, including the costs incurred in compliance with the Clean Air Act, and any amendments thereto or any change in the application or enforcement thereof, through an environmental compliance cost-recovery factor that is separate and apart from the utility’s base rates. An adjustment for the level of costs currently being recovered through base rates or other rate-adjustment clauses must be included in the filing. (3) The environmental compliance cost-recovery factor must be set periodically, but at least annually, based on projections of the utility’s environmental compliance costs during the forthcoming recovery period, and must be adjusted for variations in line losses. The environmental compliance cost-recovery factor must provide for periodic true-up of the utility’s actual environmental compliance costs with the projections on which past factors have been set, and must further require that any refund or collection made as part of the true-up process include interest. (4) Environmental compliance costs recovered through the environmental cost-recovery factor shall be allocated to the customer classes using the criteria set out in s. 366.06(1), taking into account the manner in which similar types of investment or expense were allocated in the company’s last rate case. (5) Recovery of environmental compliance costs under this section does not preclude inclusion of such costs in base rates in subsequent rate proceedings, if that inclusion is necessary and appropriate; however, any costs recovered in base rates may not also be recovered in the environmental cost-recovery clause.

For each petition, the electric utility shall: 1. Describe the storm-recovery activities that the electric utility has undertaken or proposes to undertake and describe the reasons for undertaking the activities. 2. Set forth the known storm-recovery costs and estimate the costs of any storm-recovery activities that are not completed, or for which the costs are not yet known, as identified and requested by the electric utility. 3. Set forth the level of the storm-recovery reserve that the utility proposes to establish or replenish and has determined would be appropriate to recover through storm-recovery bonds and is seeking to so recover and such level that the utility is funding or will seek to fund through other means, together with a description of the factors and calculations used in determining the amounts and methods of recovery. 4. Indicate whether the electric utility proposes to finance all or a portion of the storm-recovery costs and storm-recovery reserve using storm-recovery bonds. If the electric utility proposes to finance a portion of such costs, the electric utility shall identify that portion in the petition. 5. Estimate the financing costs related to the storm-recovery bonds. 6. Estimate the storm-recovery charges necessary to recover the storm-recovery costs, storm-recovery reserve, and financing costs and the period for recovery of such costs. 7. Estimate any cost savings or demonstrate how it would avoid or significantly mitigate rate impacts to customers resulting from financing storm-recovery costs with storm-recovery bonds as opposed to the traditional method of recovering such costs from customers and through alternative financing methods available to the electric utility. 8. File with the petition direct testimony supporting the petition. (b)1. Proceedings on a petition submitted pursuant to paragraph (a) shall begin with a petition by an electric utility and shall be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of chapter 120 and applicable rules, except that the provisions of this section, to the extent applicable, shall control. a. Within 7 days after the filing of a petition, the commission shall publish a case schedule, which schedule shall place the matter before the commission on an agenda that will permit a commission decision no later than 120 days after the date the petition is filed. b. No later than 135 days after the date the petition is filed, the commission shall issue a financing order or an order rejecting the petition. A party to the commission proceeding may petition the commission for reconsideration of the financing order within 5 days after the date of its issuance. The commission shall issue a financing order authorizing financing of reasonable and prudent storm-recovery costs, the storm-recovery reserve amount determined appropriate by the commission, and financing costs if the commission finds that the issuance of the storm-recovery bonds and the imposition of storm-recovery charges authorized by the order are reasonably expected to result in lower overall costs or would avoid or significantly mitigate rate impacts to customers as compared with alternative methods of financing or recovering storm-recovery costs and storm-recovery reserve. Any determination of whether storm-recovery costs are reasonable and prudent shall be made with reference to the general public interest in, and the scope of effort required to provide, the safe and expeditious restoration of electric service. 2. In a financing order issued to an electric utility, the commission shall: a. Except as provided in sub-subparagraph f. and in subparagraph 4., specify the amount of storm-recovery costs and the level of storm-recovery reserves, taking into consideration, to the extent the commission deems appropriate, any other methods used to recover these costs, and describe and estimate the amount of financing costs which may be recovered through storm-recovery charges; and specify the period over which such costs may be recovered. b. Determine that the proposed structuring, expected pricing, and financing costs of the storm-recovery bonds are reasonably expected to result in lower overall costs or would avoid or significantly mitigate rate impacts to customers as compared with alternative methods of financing or recovering storm-recovery costs. c. Provide that, for the period specified pursuant to sub-subparagraph a., the imposition and collection of storm-recovery charges authorized in the financing order shall be paid by all customers receiving transmission or distribution service from the electric utility or its successors or assignees under commission-approved rate schedules or under special contracts, even if the customer elects to purchase electricity from an alternative electric supplier following a fundamental change in regulation of public utilities in the state. d. Determine what portion, if any, of the storm-recovery reserves must be held in a funded reserve and any limitations on how the reserve may be held, accessed, or used. e. Include a formula-based mechanism for making expeditious periodic adjustments in the storm-recovery charges that customers are required to pay under the financing order and for making any adjustments that are necessary to correct for any overcollection or undercollection of the charges or to otherwise ensure the timely payment of storm-recovery bonds and financing costs and other required amounts and charges payable in connection with the storm-recovery bonds. f. Specify the storm-recovery property that is, or shall be, created in favor of an electric utility or its successors or assignees and that shall be used to pay or secure storm-recovery bonds and financing costs. g. Specify the degree of flexibility to be afforded to the electric utility in establishing the terms and conditions of the storm-recovery bonds, including, but not limited to, repayment schedules, interest rates, and other financing costs. h. Provide that storm-recovery charges be allocated to the customer classes using the criteria set out in s. 366.06(1), in the manner in which these costs or their equivalent were allocated in the cost-of-service study approved in connection with the electric utility’s last rate case. If the electric utility’s last rate case was resolved by a settlement agreement, the cost-of-service methodology filed by the electric utility in that case shall be used. i. Provide that, after the final terms of an issuance of storm-recovery bonds have been established and prior to the issuance of storm-recovery bonds, the electric utility shall determine the resulting initial storm-recovery charge in accordance with the financing order and such initial storm-recovery charge shall be final and effective upon the issuance of such storm-recovery bonds without further commission action. j. Include any other conditions that the commission considers appropriate and that are not otherwise inconsistent with this section. In performing the responsibilities of this subparagraph and subparagraph 5., the commission may engage outside consultants or counsel. Any expenses associated with such services shall be included as part of financing costs and included in storm-recovery charges. 3. A financing order issued to an electric utility may provide that creation of the electric utility’s storm-recovery property pursuant to sub-subparagraph 2.f. is conditioned upon, and shall be simultaneous with, the sale or other transfer of the storm-recovery property to an assignee and the pledge of the storm-recovery property to secure storm-recovery bonds. 4. If the commission issues a financing order, the electric utility shall file with the commission at least biannually a petition or a letter applying the formula-based mechanism pursuant to sub-subparagraph 2.e. and, based on estimates of consumption for each rate class and other mathematical factors, requesting administrative approval to make the adjustments described in sub-subparagraph 2.e. The review of such a request shall be limited to determining whether there is any mathematical error in the application of the formula-based mechanism relating to the appropriate amount of any overcollection or undercollection of storm-recovery charges and the amount of an adjustment. Such adjustments shall ensure the recovery of revenues sufficient to provide for the payment of principal, interest, acquisition, defeasance, financing costs, or redemption premium and other fees, costs, and charges in respect of storm-recovery bonds approved under the financing order. Within 60 days after receiving an electric utility’s request pursuant to this paragraph, the commission shall either approve the request or inform the electric utility of any mathematical errors in its calculation. If the commission informs the utility of mathematical errors in its calculation, the utility may correct its error and refile its request. The timeframes previously described in this paragraph shall apply to a refiled request. 5. Within 120 days after the issuance of storm-recovery bonds, the electric utility shall file with the commission information on the actual costs of the storm-recovery bond issuance. The commission shall review such information to determine if such costs incurred in the issuance of the bonds resulted in the lowest overall costs that were reasonably consistent with market conditions at the time of the issuance and the terms of the financing order. The commission may disallow any incremental issuance costs in excess of the lowest overall costs by requiring the utility to make a contribution to the storm reserve in an amount equal to the excess of actual issuance costs incurred, and paid for out of storm-recovery bond proceeds, and the lowest overall issuance costs as determined by the commission. The commission may not make adjustments to the storm-recovery charges for any such excess issuance costs. 6. Subsequent to the earlier of the transfer of storm-recovery property to an assignee or the issuance of storm-recovery bonds authorized thereby, a financing order is irrevocable and, except as provided in subparagraph 4. and paragraph (c), the commission may not amend, modify, or terminate the financing order by any subsequent action or reduce, impair, postpone, terminate, or otherwise adjust storm-recovery charges approved in the financing order. After the issuance of a financing order, the electric utility retains sole discretion regarding whether to assign, sell, or otherwise transfer storm-recovery property or to cause the storm-recovery bonds to be issued, including the right to defer or postpone such assignment, sale, transfer, or issuance. (c) At the request of an electric utility, the commission may commence a proceeding and issue a subsequent financing order that provides for retiring and refunding storm-recovery bonds issued pursuant to the original financing order if the commission finds that the subsequent financing order satisfies all of the criteria specified in paragraph (b). Effective on retirement of the refunded storm-recovery bonds and the issuance of new storm-recovery bonds, the commission shall adjust the related storm-recovery charges accordingly. (d) Within 30 days after the commission issues an order pursuant to paragraph (b) or a decision denying a request for reconsideration or, if the request for reconsideration is granted, within 30 days after the commission issues its decision on reconsideration, an adversely affected party may petition for judicial review in the Florida Supreme Court. The petition for review shall be served upon the executive director of the commission personally or by service at the office of the commission. Review on appeal shall be based solely on the record before the commission and briefs to the court and shall be limited to determining whether the order issued pursuant to paragraph (b), or the order on reconsideration, conforms to the constitution and laws of this state and the United States and is within the authority of the commission under this section. Inasmuch as delay in the determination of the appeal of a financing order will delay the issuance of storm-recovery bonds, thereby diminishing savings to customers which might be achieved if such bonds were issued as contemplated by a financing order, the Supreme Court shall proceed to hear and determine the action as expeditiously as practicable and give the action precedence over other matters not accorded similar precedence by law. (e)1. A financing order remains in effect until the storm-recovery bonds issued pursuant to the order have been paid in full and the commission-approved financing costs of such bonds have been recovered in full. 2. A financing order issued to an electric utility shall remain in effect and unabated notwithstanding the reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency proceedings of the electric utility or its successors or assignees. (3) EXCEPTIONS TO COMMISSION JURISDICTION.— (a) If the commission issues a financing order to an electric utility pursuant to this section, the commission may not, in exercising its powers and carrying out its duties regarding any matter within its authority pursuant to this chapter, consider the storm-recovery bonds issued pursuant to the order to be the debt of the electric utility other than for federal income tax purposes, consider the storm-recovery charges paid under the order to be the revenue of the electric utility for any purpose, or consider the storm-recovery costs or financing costs specified in the order to be the costs of the electric utility, nor may the commission determine any action taken by an electric utility which is consistent with the order to be unjust or unreasonable. (b) The commission may not order or otherwise directly or indirectly require an electric utility to use storm-recovery bonds to finance any project, addition, plant, facility, extension, capital improvement, equipment, or any other expenditure, unless the electric utility has filed a petition under paragraph (2)(a) to finance such expenditure using storm-recovery bonds. The commission may not refuse to allow an electric utility to recover costs for storm-recovery activities in an otherwise permissible fashion, or refuse or condition authorization or approval pursuant to s. 366.04 of the issuance and sale by an electric utility of securities or the assumption by it of liabilities or obligations, solely because of the potential availability of storm-recovery financing. (4) ELECTRIC UTILITY DUTIES.— (a) The electric bills of an electric utility that has obtained a financing order and issued storm-recovery bonds must explicitly reflect that a portion of the charges on such bill represents storm-recovery charges approved in a financing order issued to the electric utility and, if the storm-recovery property has been transferred to an assignee, must include a statement to the effect that the assignee is the owner of the rights to storm-recovery charges and that the electric utility or any other entity, if applicable, is acting as a collection agent or servicer for the assignee. The tariff applicable to customers must indicate the storm-recovery charge and the ownership of that charge. The commission shall determine whether to require electric utilities to include such information or amounts owed with respect to the storm-recovery property as a separate line item on individual electric bills. (b) The failure of an electric utility to comply with this subsection shall not invalidate, impair, or affect any financing order, storm-recovery property, storm-recovery charge, or storm-recovery bonds but shall subject the electric utility to penalties under s. 366.095. (5) STORM-RECOVERY PROPERTY.— (a)1. All storm-recovery property that is specified in a financing order shall constitute an existing, present property right or interest therein, notwithstanding that the imposition and collection of storm-recovery charges depends on the electric utility to which the order is issued performing its servicing functions relating to the collection of storm-recovery charges and on future electricity consumption. Such property shall exist whether or not the revenues or proceeds arising from the property have been billed, have accrued, or have been collected and notwithstanding the fact that the value or amount of the property is dependent on the future provision of service to customers by the electric utility or its successors or assignees. 2. Storm-recovery property specified in a financing order shall continue to exist until the storm-recovery bonds issued pursuant to the order are paid in full and all financing costs and other costs of the bonds have been recovered in full. 3. All or any portion of storm-recovery property specified in a financing order issued to an electric utility may be transferred, sold, conveyed, or assigned to a successor or assignee, including an affiliate or affiliates of the electric utility created for the limited purpose of acquiring, owning, or administering storm-recovery property or issuing storm-recovery bonds under the financing order. All or any portion of storm-recovery property may be pledged to secure storm-recovery bonds issued pursuant to the order, amounts payable to financing parties and to counterparties under any ancillary agreements, and other financing costs. Each such transfer, sale, conveyance, assignment, or pledge by an electric utility or affiliate of an electric utility is considered to be a transaction in the ordinary course of business. 4. If an electric utility defaults on any required payment of charges arising from storm-recovery property specified in a financing order, a court, upon application by an interested party, and without limiting any other remedies available to the applying party, shall order the sequestration and payment of the revenues arising from the storm-recovery property to the financing parties. Any such order shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the electric utility or its successors or assignees. 5. The interest of a transferee, purchaser, acquirer, assignee, or pledgee in storm-recovery property specified in a financing order issued to an electric utility, and in the revenue and collections arising from that property, is not subject to setoff, counterclaim, surcharge, or defense by the electric utility or any other person or in connection with the reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency of the electric utility or any other entity. 6. Any successor to an electric utility, whether pursuant to any reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency proceeding or whether pursuant to any merger or acquisition, sale, or other business combination, or transfer by operation of law, as a result of electric utility restructuring or otherwise, shall perform and satisfy all obligations of, and have the same rights under a financing order as, the electric utility under the financing order in the same manner and to the same extent as the electric utility, including collecting and paying to the person entitled to receive the revenues, collections, payments, or proceeds of the storm-recovery property. (b)1. Except as specified in this section, the Uniform Commercial Code does not apply to storm-recovery property or any right, title, or interest of a utility or assignee described in subparagraph (1)(o)1., whether before or after the issuance of the financing order. In addition, such right, title, or interest pertaining to a financing order, including, but not limited to, the associated storm-recovery property and any revenues, collections, claims, rights to payment, payments, money, or proceeds of or arising from storm-recovery charges pursuant to such order, shall not be deemed proceeds of any right or interest other than in the financing order and the storm-recovery property arising from the order. 2. The creation, attachment, granting, perfection, priority, and enforcement of liens and security interests in storm-recovery property to secure storm-recovery bonds is governed solely by this section and not by the Uniform Commercial Code. 3. A valid, enforceable, and attached lien and security interest in storm-recovery property may be created only upon the later of: a. The issuance of a financing order; b. The execution and delivery of a security agreement with a financing party in connection with the issuance of storm-recovery bonds; or c. The receipt of value for the storm-recovery bonds. A valid, enforceable, and attached security interest shall be perfected against third parties as of the date of filing of a financing statement in the Florida Secured Transaction Registry, as such registry is defined in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, in accordance with subparagraph 4., and shall thereafter be a continuously perfected lien; and such security interest in the storm-recovery property and all proceeds of such storm-recovery property, whether or not billed, accrued, or collected, and whether or not deposited into a deposit account and however evidenced, shall have priority in accordance with subparagraph 8. and take precedence over any subsequent judicial or other lien creditor. No continuation statement need be filed to maintain such perfection. 4. Financing statements required to be filed pursuant to this section shall be filed, maintained, and indexed in the same manner and in the same system of records maintained for the filing of financing statements in the Florida Secured Transaction Registry under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. The filing of such a financing statement shall be the only method of perfecting a lien or security interest on storm-recovery property. 5. The priority of a lien and security interest perfected under this paragraph is not impaired by any later modification of the financing order or storm-recovery property or by the commingling of funds arising from storm-recovery property with other funds, and any other security interest that may apply to those funds shall be terminated as to all funds transferred to a segregated account for the benefit of an assignee or a financing party or to an assignee or financing party directly. 6. If a default or termination occurs under the terms of the storm-recovery bonds, the financing parties or their representatives may foreclose on or otherwise enforce their lien and security interest in any storm-recovery property as if they were a secured party under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code; and a court may order that amounts arising from storm-recovery property be transferred to a separate account for the financing parties’ benefit, to which their lien and security interest shall apply. On application by or on behalf of the financing parties to a circuit court of this state, such court shall order the sequestration and payment to the financing parties of revenues arising from the storm-recovery property. 7. The interest of a pledgee of an interest or any rights in any storm-recovery property is not perfected until filing as provided in subparagraph 4. 8. The priority of the conflicting interests of pledgees in the same interest or rights in any storm-recovery property is determined as follows: a. Conflicting perfected interests or rights of pledgees rank according to priority in time of perfection. Priority dates from the time a filing covering the interest or right is made in accordance with this paragraph. b. A perfected interest or right of a pledgee has priority over a conflicting unperfected interest or right of a pledgee. c. A perfected interest or right of a pledgee has priority over a person who becomes a lien creditor after the perfection of such pledgee’s interest or right. (c) The sale, assignment, or transfer of storm-recovery property is governed by this paragraph. All of the following apply to a sale, assignment, or transfer under this paragraph: 1. The sale, conveyance, assignment, or other transfer of storm-recovery property by an electric utility to an assignee that the parties have in the governing documentation expressly stated to be a sale or other absolute transfer is an absolute transfer and true sale of, and not a pledge of or secured transaction relating to, the transferor’s right, title, and interest in, to, and under the storm-recovery property, other than for federal and state income and franchise tax purposes. After such a transaction, the storm-recovery property is not subject to any claims of the transferor or the transferor’s creditors, other than creditors holding a prior security interest in the storm-recovery property perfected under paragraph (b). 2. The characterization of the sale, conveyance, assignment, or other transfer as a true sale or other absolute transfer under subparagraph 1. and the corresponding characterization of the transferee’s property interest is not affected by: a. Commingling of amounts arising with respect to the storm-recovery property with other amounts. b. The retention by the transferor of a partial or residual interest, including an equity interest, in the storm-recovery property, whether direct or indirect, or whether subordinate or otherwise. c. Any recourse that the transferee may have against the transferor other than any such recourse created, contingent upon, or otherwise occurring or resulting from one or more of the transferor’s customers’ inability to timely pay all or a portion of the storm-recovery charge. d. Any indemnifications, obligations, or repurchase rights made or provided by the transferor, other than indemnity or repurchase rights based solely upon a transferor’s customers’ inability to timely pay all or a portion of the storm-recovery charge. e. The responsibility of the transferor to collect storm-recovery charges. f. The treatment of the sale, conveyance, assignment, or other transfer for tax, financial reporting, or other purposes. g. Granting or providing to holders of the storm-recovery bonds a preferred right to the storm-recovery property or credit enhancement by the electric utility or its affiliates with respect to the storm-recovery bonds. 3. Any right that an electric utility has in the storm-recovery property prior to its pledge, sale, or transfer or any other right created under this section or created in the financing order and assignable under this section or assignable pursuant to a financing order shall be property in the form of a contract right. Transfer of an interest in storm-recovery property to an assignee is enforceable only upon the later of the issuance of a financing order, the execution and delivery of transfer documents to the assignee in connection with the issuance of storm-recovery bonds, and the receipt of value. An enforceable transfer of an interest in storm-recovery property to an assignee shall be perfected against all third parties, including subsequent judicial or other lien creditors, when a notice of that transfer has been given by the filing of a financing statement in accordance with subparagraph 4. The transfer shall be perfected against third parties as of the date of filing. 4. Financing statements required to be filed under this section shall be maintained and indexed in the same manner and in the same system of records maintained for the filing of financing statements in the Florida Secured Transaction Registry under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. The filing of such a financing statement shall be the only method of perfecting a transfer of storm-recovery property. 5. The priority of a transfer perfected under this section is not impaired by any later modification of the financing order or storm-recovery property or by the commingling of funds arising from storm-recovery property with other funds, and any other security interest that may apply to those funds shall be terminated when they are transferred to a segregated account for the assignee or a financing party. If storm-recovery property has been transferred to an assignee or financing party, any proceeds of that property shall be held in trust for the assignee or financing party. 6. The priority of the conflicting interests of assignees in the same interest or rights in any storm-recovery property is determined as follows: a. Conflicting perfected interests or rights of assignees rank according to priority in time of perfection. Priority dates from the time a filing covering the transfer is made in accordance with subparagraph 4. b. A perfected interest or right of an assignee has priority over a conflicting unperfected interest or right of an assignee. c. A perfected interest or right of an assignee has priority over a person who becomes a lien creditor after the perfection of such assignee’s interest or right. (6) DESCRIPTION OR INDICATION OF PROPERTY.—The description of storm-recovery property being transferred to an assignee in any sale agreement, purchase agreement, or other transfer agreement, granted or pledged to a pledgee in any security agreement, pledge agreement, or other security document, or indicated in any financing statement is only sufficient if such description or indication describes the financing order that created the storm-recovery property and states that such agreement or financing statement covers all or part of such property described in such financing order. This subsection applies to all purported transfers of, and all purported grants or liens or security interests in, storm-recovery property, regardless of whether the related sale agreement, purchase agreement, other transfer agreement, security agreement, pledge agreement, or other security document was entered into, or any financing statement was filed, before or after the effective date of this section. (7) FINANCING STATEMENTS.—All financing statements referenced in this section shall be subject to Part 5 of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code except that the requirement as to continuation statements shall not apply. (8) CHOICE OF LAW.—The law governing the validity, enforceability, attachment, perfection, priority, and exercise of remedies with respect to the transfer of an interest or right or the pledge or creation of a security interest in any storm-recovery property shall be the laws of this state, and exclusively, the laws of this section. (9) STORM-RECOVERY BONDS NOT PUBLIC DEBT.—The state or its political subdivisions are not liable on any storm-recovery bonds, and the bonds are not a debt or a general obligation of the state or any of its political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities. An issue of storm-recovery bonds does not, directly or indirectly or contingently, obligate the state or any agency, political subdivision, or instrumentality of the state to levy any tax or make any appropriation for payment of the bonds, other than in their capacity as consumers of electricity. This subsection shall in no way preclude bond guarantees or enhancements pursuant to this section. All bonds must contain on the face thereof a statement to the following effect: “Neither the full faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of Florida is pledged to the payment of the principal of, or interest on, this bond.” (10) STORM-RECOVERY BONDS AS LEGAL INVESTMENTS WITH RESPECT TO INVESTORS THAT REQUIRE STATUTORY AUTHORITY REGARDING LEGAL INVESTMENT.—The following entities may legally invest any sinking funds, moneys, or other funds belonging to them or under their control in storm-recovery bonds: (a) The state, the investment board, municipal corporations, political subdivisions, public bodies, and public officers except for members of the commission. (b) Banks and bankers, savings and loan associations, credit unions, trust companies, savings banks and institutions, investment companies, insurance companies, insurance associations, and other persons carrying on a banking or insurance business. (c) Personal representatives, guardians, trustees, and other fiduciaries. (d) All other persons whatsoever who are now or may hereafter be authorized to invest in bonds or other obligations of a similar nature. (11) STATE PLEDGE.— (a) For purposes of this subsection, the term “bondholder” means a person who holds a storm-recovery bond. (b) The state pledges to and agrees with bondholders, the owners of the storm-recovery property, and other financing parties that the state will not: 1. Alter the provisions of this section which make the storm-recovery charges imposed by a financing order irrevocable, binding, and nonbypassable charges; 2. Take or permit any action that impairs or would impair the value of storm-recovery property; or 3. Except as allowed under this section, reduce, alter, or impair storm-recovery charges that are to be imposed, collected, and remitted for the benefit of the bondholders and other financing parties until any and all principal, interest, premium, financing costs and other fees, expenses, or charges incurred, and any contracts to be performed, in connection with the related storm-recovery bonds have been paid and performed in full. Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude limitation or alteration if full compensation is made by law for the full protection of the storm-recovery charges collected pursuant to a financing order and of the holders of storm-recovery bonds and any assignee or financing party entering into a contract with the electric utility. (c) Any person or entity that issues storm-recovery bonds may include the pledge specified in paragraph (b) in the bonds and related documentation. (12) NOT AN ELECTRIC UTILITY.—An assignee or financing party shall not be considered an electric utility or person providing electric service by virtue of engaging in the transactions described in this section. (13) CONFLICTS.—In the event of conflict between this section and any other law regarding the attachment, assignment, or perfection, or the effect of perfection, or priority of, assignment or transfer of, or security interest in storm-recovery property, this section shall govern to the extent of the conflict. (14) EFFECT OF INVALIDITY ON ACTIONS.—Effective on the date that storm-recovery bonds are first issued under this section, if any provision of this section is held to be invalid or is invalidated, superseded, replaced, repealed, or expires for any reason, that occurrence shall not affect the validity of any action allowed under this section which is taken by an electric utility, an assignee, a financing party, a collection agent, or a party to an ancillary agreement; and any such action shall remain in full force and effect with respect to all storm-recovery bonds issued or authorized in a financing order to be issued under this section prior to the date that such provision is held to be invalid or is invalidated, superseded, replaced, or repealed, or that expires for any reason. (15) PENALTIES.—A violation of this section or of a financing order issued under this section subjects the utility that obtained the order to penalties under s. 366.095 and to any other penalties or remedies that the commission determines are necessary to achieve the intent of this section and the intent and terms of the financing order and to prevent any increase in financial impact to the utility’s ratepayers above that set forth in the financing order. If the commission orders a penalty or a remedy for a violation, the monetary penalty or remedy and the costs of defending against the proposed penalty or remedy may not be recovered from the ratepayers. The commission may not make adjustments to storm-recovery charges for any such penalties or remedies. History.—s. 1, ch. 2005-107.

      "text": "366.91 Renewable energy.— (1) The Legislature finds that it is in the public interest to promote the development of renewable energy resources in this state. Renewable energy resources have the potential to help diversify fuel types to meet Florida’s growing dependency on natural gas for electric production, minimize the volatility of fuel costs, encourage investment within the state, improve environmental conditions, and make Florida a leader in new and innovative technologies. (2) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Biogas” means a mixture of gases produced by the biological decomposition of organic materials which is largely comprised of carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons, and methane gas. (b) “Biomass” means a power source that is comprised of, but not limited to, combustible residues or gases from forest products manufacturing, waste, byproducts, or products from agricultural and orchard crops, waste or coproducts from livestock and poultry operations, waste or byproducts from food processing, urban wood waste, municipal solid waste, municipal liquid waste treatment operations, and landfill gas. (c) “Customer-owned renewable generation” means an electric generating system located on a customer’s premises that is primarily intended to offset part or all of the customer’s electricity requirements with renewable energy. (d) “Net metering” means a metering and billing methodology whereby customer-owned renewable generation is allowed to offset the customer’s electricity consumption on site. (e) “Renewable energy” means electrical energy produced from a method that uses one or more of the following fuels or energy sources: hydrogen produced or resulting from sources other than fossil fuels, biomass, solar energy, geothermal energy, wind energy, ocean energy, and hydroelectric power. The term includes the alternative energy resource, waste heat, from sulfuric acid manufacturing operations and electrical energy produced using pipeline-quality synthetic gas produced from waste petroleum coke with carbon capture and sequestration. (f) “Renewable natural gas” means anaerobically generated biogas, landfill gas, or wastewater treatment gas refined to a methane content of 90 percent or greater which may be used as a transportation fuel or for electric generation or is of a quality capable of being injected into a natural gas pipeline. (3) On or before January 1, 2006, each public utility must continuously offer a purchase contract to producers of renewable energy. The commission shall establish requirements relating to the purchase of capacity and energy by public utilities from renewable energy producers and may adopt rules to administer this section. The contract shall contain payment provisions for energy and capacity which are based upon the utility’s full avoided costs, as defined in s. 366.051; however, capacity payments are not required if, due to the operational characteristics of the renewable energy generator or the anticipated peak and off-peak availability and capacity factor of the utility’s avoided unit, the producer is unlikely to provide any capacity value to the utility or the electric grid during the contract term. Each contract must provide a contract term of at least 10 years. Prudent and reasonable costs associated with a renewable energy contract shall be recovered from the ratepayers of the contracting utility, without differentiation among customer classes, through the appropriate cost-recovery clause mechanism administered by the commission. (4) On or before January 1, 2006, each municipal electric utility and rural electric cooperative whose annual sales, as of July 1, 1993, to retail customers were greater than 2,000 gigawatt hours must continuously offer a purchase contract to producers of renewable energy containing payment provisions for energy and capacity which are based upon the utility’s or cooperative’s full avoided costs, as determined by the governing body of the municipal utility or cooperative; however, capacity payments are not required if, due to the operational characteristics of the renewable energy generator or the anticipated peak and off-peak availability and capacity factor of the utility’s avoided unit, the producer is unlikely to provide any capacity value to the utility or the electric grid during the contract term. Each contract must provide a contract term of at least 10 years. (5) On or before January 1, 2009, each public utility shall develop a standardized interconnection agreement and net metering program for customer-owned renewable generation. The commission shall establish requirements relating to the expedited interconnection and net metering of customer-owned renewable generation by public utilities and may adopt rules to administer this section. (6) On or before July 1, 2009, each municipal electric utility and each rural electric cooperative that sells electricity at retail shall develop a standardized interconnection agreement and net metering program for customer-owned renewable generation. Each governing authority shall establish requirements relating to the expedited interconnection and net metering of customer-owned generation. By April 1 of each year, each municipal electric utility and rural electric cooperative utility serving retail customers shall file a report with the commission detailing customer participation in the interconnection and net metering program, including, but not limited to, the number and total capacity of interconnected generating systems and the total energy net metered in the previous year. (7) Under the provisions of subsections (5) and (6), when a utility purchases power generated from biogas produced by the anaerobic digestion of agricultural waste, including food waste or other agricultural byproducts, net metering shall be available at a single metering point or as a part of conjunctive billing of multiple points for a customer at a single location, so long as the provision of such service and its associated charges, terms, and other conditions are not reasonably projected to result in higher cost electric service to the utility’s general body of ratepayers or adversely affect the adequacy or reliability of electric service to all customers, as determined by the commission for public utilities, or as determined by the governing authority of the municipal electric utility or rural electric cooperative that serves at retail. (8) A contracting producer of renewable energy must pay the actual costs of its interconnection with the transmission grid or distribution system. (9) The commission may approve cost recovery by a gas public utility for contracts for the purchase of renewable natural gas in which the pricing provisions exceed the current market price of natural gas, but which are otherwise deemed reasonable and prudent by the commission.

The department may impose one or more of the following penalties against a person who violates this subsection or any rule adopted under this subsection: 1. Issuance of a warning letter. 2. Imposition of an administrative fine in the Class II category pursuant to s. 570.971 for each violation. (f) If the department determines that an electric vehicle charging station or any associated equipment presents a threat to the public health, safety, or welfare, the department may issue an immediate final order prohibiting the use of the electric vehicle charging station or any portion thereof. (g) In addition to the remedies provided in this subsection, and notwithstanding the existence of any adequate remedy at law, the department may bring an action to enjoin a violation of this subsection or rules adopted under this subsection in the circuit court of the county in which the violation occurs or is about to occur. Upon demonstration of competent and substantial evidence by the department to the court of the violation or threatened violation, the court shall immediately issue the temporary or permanent injunction sought by the department. The injunction must be issued without bond. (4)(a) It is unlawful for a person to stop, stand, or park a vehicle that is not capable of using an electrical recharging station within any parking space specifically designated for charging an electric vehicle. (b) If a law enforcement officer finds a motor vehicle in violation of this subsection, the officer or specialist shall charge the operator or other person in charge of the vehicle in violation with a noncriminal traffic infraction, punishable as provided in s. 316.008(4) or s. 318.18. (5) Upon petition of a public utility, the commission may approve voluntary electric vehicle charging programs to become effective on or after January 1, 2025, to include, but not be limited to, residential, fleet, and public electric vehicle charging, upon a determination by the commission that the utility’s general body of ratepayers, as a whole, will not pay to support recovery of its electric vehicle charging investment by the end of the useful life of the assets dedicated to the electric vehicle charging service. This provision does not preclude cost recovery for electric vehicle charging programs approved by the commission before January 1, 2024.

      "text": "366.96 Storm protection plan cost recovery.— (1) The Legislature finds that: (a) During extreme weather conditions, high winds can cause vegetation and debris to blow into and damage electrical transmission and distribution facilities, resulting in power outages. (b) A majority of the power outages that occur during extreme weather conditions in the state are caused by vegetation blown by the wind. (c) It is in the state’s interest to strengthen electric utility infrastructure to withstand extreme weather conditions by promoting the overhead hardening of electrical transmission and distribution facilities, the undergrounding of certain electrical distribution lines, and vegetation management. (d) Protecting and strengthening transmission and distribution electric utility infrastructure from extreme weather conditions can effectively reduce restoration costs and outage times to customers and improve overall service reliability for customers. (e) It is in the state’s interest for each utility to mitigate restoration costs and outage times to utility customers when developing transmission and distribution storm protection plans. (f) All customers benefit from the reduced costs of storm restoration. (2) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Public utility” or “utility” has the same meaning as set forth in s. 366.02(8), except that it does not include a gas utility. (b) “Transmission and distribution storm protection plan” or “plan” means a plan for the overhead hardening and increased resilience of electric transmission and distribution facilities, undergrounding of electric distribution facilities, and vegetation management. (c) “Transmission and distribution storm protection plan costs” means the reasonable and prudent costs to implement an approved transmission and distribution storm protection plan. (d) “Vegetation management” means the actions a public utility takes to prevent or curtail vegetation from interfering with public utility infrastructure. The term includes, but is not limited to, the mowing of vegetation, application of herbicides, tree trimming, and removal of trees or brush near and around electric transmission and distribution facilities. (3) Each public utility shall file, pursuant to commission rule, a transmission and distribution storm protection plan that covers the immediate 10-year planning period. Each plan must explain the systematic approach the utility will follow to achieve the objectives of reducing restoration costs and outage times associated with extreme weather events and enhancing reliability. The commission shall adopt rules to specify the elements that must be included in a utility’s filing for review of transmission and distribution storm protection plans. (4) In its review of each transmission and distribution storm protection plan filed pursuant to this section, the commission shall consider: (a) The extent to which the plan is expected to reduce restoration costs and outage times associated with extreme weather events and enhance reliability, including whether the plan prioritizes areas of lower reliability performance. (b) The extent to which storm protection of transmission and distribution infrastructure is feasible, reasonable, or practical in certain areas of the utility’s service territory, including, but not limited to, flood zones and rural areas. (c) The estimated costs and benefits to the utility and its customers of making the improvements proposed in the plan. (d) The estimated annual rate impact resulting from implementation of the plan during the first 3 years addressed in the plan. (5) No later than 180 days after a utility files a transmission and distribution storm protection plan that contains all of the elements required by commission rule, the commission shall determine whether it is in the public interest to approve, approve with modification, or deny the plan. (6) At least every 3 years after approval of a utility’s transmission and distribution storm protection plan, the utility must file for commission review an updated transmission and distribution storm protection plan that addresses each element specified by commission rule. The commission shall approve, modify, or deny each updated plan pursuant to the criteria used to review the initial plan. (7) After a utility’s transmission and distribution storm protection plan has been approved, proceeding with actions to implement the plan shall not constitute or be evidence of imprudence. The commission shall conduct an annual proceeding to determine the utility’s prudently incurred transmission and distribution storm protection plan costs and allow the utility to recover such costs through a charge separate and apart from its base rates, to be referred to as the storm protection plan cost recovery clause. If the commission determines that costs were prudently incurred, those costs will not be subject to disallowance or further prudence review except for fraud, perjury, or intentional withholding of key information by the public utility. (8) The annual transmission and distribution storm protection plan costs may not include costs recovered through the public utility’s base rates and must be allocated to customer classes pursuant to the rate design most recently approved by the commission. (9) If a capital expenditure is recoverable as a transmission and distribution storm protection plan cost, the public utility may recover the annual depreciation on the cost, calculated at the public utility’s current approved depreciation rates, and a return on the undepreciated balance of the costs calculated at the public utility’s weighted average cost of capital using the last approved return on equity. (10) Beginning December 1 of the year after the first full year of implementation of a transmission and distribution storm protection plan and annually thereafter, the commission shall submit to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives a report on the status of utilities’ storm protection activities. The report shall include, but is not limited to, identification of all storm protection activities completed or planned for completion, the actual costs and rate impacts associated with completed activities as compared to the estimated costs and rate impacts for those activities, and the estimated costs and rate impacts associated with activities planned for completion. (11) The commission shall adopt rules to implement and administer this section and shall propose a rule for adoption as soon as practicable after the effective date of this act, but not later than October 31, 2019.

The field meeting must occur no sooner than 15 calendar days after the date of the notice and no later than 60 calendar days after the notice and, at a minimum, must include sufficient information to enable the attaching entity to locate the affected poles and identify the owner of any facilities attached to the poles. (2)(a) An attaching entity must remove its pole attachments from a redundant pole within 180 calendar days after receipt of an electronic or a written notice from the pole owner requesting such removal. A pole owner may use a joint use notification software program to accomplish such written or electronic removal notice. (b) If an attaching entity fails to remove a pole attachment pursuant to paragraph (a), except to the extent excused by an event of force majeure or other good cause as agreed to by the parties or as determined by the commission or its designee within 30 calendar days after the 180 calendar-day period under paragraph (a), the pole owner or its agent may transfer or relocate the pole attachment to the new pole at the noncompliant attaching entity’s expense. This subsection does not apply to an electric utility’s pole attachments. An attaching entity shall submit payment to the pole owner within 60 days after receipt of the pole owner’s invoice for transfer or relocation of the pole attachments. A pole owner may seek to enforce its right to payment under this paragraph in circuit court and, if it prevails, is entitled to prejudgment interest at the prevailing statutory rate and reasonable attorney fees and court costs. Upon receipt by the pole owner of written notice, the attaching entity that fails to comply with this subsection shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the pole owner and its directors, officers, agents, and employees from and against all liability, except to the extent of any finding of negligence or willful misconduct, including attorney fees and litigation costs, arising in connection with the transfer of the pole attachment from a redundant pole to a new pole by the pole owner. (c) If a pole attachment is abandoned by an attaching entity that fails to remove or transfer its attachments in accordance with this section, the pole owner or its agent may remove the pole attachment at the noncompliant attaching entity’s expense and may sell or dispose of the pole attachment, except to the extent the attaching entity’s noncompliance is excused by an event of force majeure or other good cause as determined by the commission. An attaching entity shall submit payment to the pole owner within 60 days after receipt of the pole owner’s invoice. A pole owner may seek to enforce its right to payment under this paragraph in circuit court and, if it prevails, is entitled to prejudgment interest at the prevailing statutory rate and reasonable attorney fees and court costs. Upon receipt by the pole owner of written notice, the noncompliant attaching entity shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the pole owner and its directors, officers, agents, and employees from and against all liability, except to the extent of any finding of negligence or willful misconduct, including attorney fees and litigation costs, arising in connection with the removal, transfer, sale, or disposal of the pole attachments from a redundant pole by the pole owner. (3) Upon petition by a pole owner or an attaching entity, the commission may issue orders enforcing this section which do not expressly relate to circuit court jurisdiction. (4) This section may not be construed to do any of the following: (a) Prevent a party at any time from entering into a voluntary agreement authorizing a pole owner to remove an attaching entity’s pole attachment. It is the intent of the Legislature to encourage parties to enter into such voluntary agreements without commission approval. (b) Impair the contract rights of a party to a valid pole attachment agreement in existence before June 29, 2021. History.—ss. 4, 5, ch. 2021-191.

If the account has less than 12 months of actual charges, the deposit shall be calculated by adding the available monthly charges, dividing this total by the number of months available, and multiplying the result by 2.2.For a new service request, the total deposit may not exceed 2 months of projected charges, calculated by adding the 12 months of projected charges, dividing this total by 12, and multiplying the result by 2. Once a new customer has had continuous service for a 12-month period, the amount of the deposit shall be recalculated using actual data. Any difference between the projected and actual amounts must be resolved by the customer paying any additional amount that may be billed by the utility or the utility returning any overcharge.(d)If a utility has more than one rate for any customer class, it must notify each customer in that class of the available rates and explain how the rate is charged to the customer. If a customer contacts the utility seeking assistance in selecting the most advantageous rate, the utility must provide good faith assistance to the customer. The customer is responsible for charges for service provided under the selected rate.(e)New tariffs and changes to an existing tariff, other than an administrative change that does not substantially change the meaning or operation of the tariff, must be approved by majority vote of the commission, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.(2)Every public utility, as defined in s. 366.02, which in addition to the production, transmission, delivery or furnishing of heat, light, or power also sells appliances or other merchandise shall keep separate and individual accounts for the sale and profit deriving from such sales. No profit or loss shall be taken into consideration by the commission from the sale of such items in arriving at any rate to be charged for service by any public utility.(3)The commission shall provide for the examination and testing of all meters used for measuring any product or service of a public utility.(4)Any consumer or user may have any such meter tested upon payment of the fees fixed by the commission.(5)The commission shall establish reasonable fees to be paid for testing such meters on the request of the consumers or users, the fee to be paid by the consumer or user at the time of his or her request, but to be paid by the public utility and repaid to the consumer or user if the meter is found defective or incorrect to the disadvantage of the consumer or user, in excess of the degree or amount of tolerance customarily allowed for such meters, or as may be provided for in rules and regulations of the commission.(6)The commission may purchase materials, apparatus, and standard measuring instruments for such examination and tests.(7)The commission shall have the power to require reports from all electric utilities to assure the development of adequate and reliable energy grids.(8)If the commission determines that there is probable cause to believe that inadequacies exist with respect to the energy grids developed by the electric utility industry, including inadequacies in fuel diversity or fuel supply reliability, it shall have the power, after proceedings as provided by law, and after a finding that mutual benefits will accrue to the electric utilities involved, to require installation or repair of necessary facilities, including generating plants and transmission facilities, with the costs to be distributed in proportion to the benefits received, and to take all necessary steps to ensure compliance. The electric utilities involved in any action taken or orders issued pursuant to this subsection shall have full power and authority, notwithstanding any general or special laws to the contrary, to jointly plan, finance, build, operate, or lease generating and transmission facilities and shall be further authorized to exercise the powers granted to corporations in chapter 361. This subsection shall not supersede or control any provision of the Florida Electrical Power Plant Siting Act, ss. 403.501-403.518.(9)The commission may require the filing of reports and other data by a public utility or its affiliated companies, including its parent company, regarding transactions, or allocations of common costs, among the utility and such affiliated companies. The commission may also require such reports or other data necessary to ensure that a utility’s ratepayers do not subsidize nonutility activities.(10)The Legislature finds that violations of commission orders or rules, in connection with the impairment of a public utility’s operations or service, constitute irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law. The commission is authorized to seek relief in circuit court including temporary and permanent injunctions, restraining orders, or any other appropriate order. Such remedies shall be in addition to and supplementary to any other remedies available for enforcement of agency action under s. 120.69 or the provisions of this chapter. The commission shall establish procedures implementing this section by rule.(11)The commission has the authority to assess a public utility for reasonable travel costs associated with reviewing the records of the public utility and its affiliates when such records are kept out of state.
