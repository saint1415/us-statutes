      "text": "465.014 Pharmacy technician.— (1) A person other than a licensed pharmacist or pharmacy intern may not engage in the practice of the profession of pharmacy, except that a licensed pharmacist may delegate to pharmacy technicians who are registered pursuant to this section those duties, tasks, and functions that do not fall within the purview of s. 465.003. All such delegated acts must be performed under the direct supervision of a licensed pharmacist who is responsible for all such acts performed by persons under his or her supervision. A registered pharmacy technician, under the supervision of a pharmacist, may initiate or receive communications with a practitioner or his or her agent, on behalf of a patient, regarding refill authorization requests. A licensed pharmacist may not supervise more than one registered pharmacy technician unless otherwise permitted by the guidelines adopted by the board. The board shall establish guidelines to be followed by licensees or permittees in determining the circumstances under which a licensed pharmacist may supervise more than one pharmacy technician. (2) Any person who wishes to work as a pharmacy technician in this state must register by filing an application with the board on a form adopted by rule of the board. The board shall register each applicant who has remitted a registration fee set by the board, not to exceed $50 biennially; has completed the application form and remitted a nonrefundable application fee set by the board, not to exceed $50; is at least 17 years of age; and has completed a pharmacy technician training program approved by the Board of Pharmacy. Notwithstanding any requirements in this subsection, any registered pharmacy technician registered pursuant to this section before January 1, 2011, who has worked as a pharmacy technician for a minimum of 1,500 hours under the supervision of a licensed pharmacist or received certification as a pharmacy technician by certification program accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies is exempt from the requirement to complete an initial training program for purposes of registration as required by this subsection. (3) A person whose license to practice pharmacy has been denied, suspended, or restricted for disciplinary purposes is not eligible to register as a pharmacy technician. (4) Notwithstanding the requirements of this section or any other provision of law, a pharmacy technician student who is enrolled in a pharmacy technician training program that is approved by the board may be placed in a pharmacy for the purpose of obtaining practical training. A pharmacy technician student shall wear identification that indicates his or her student status when performing the functions of a pharmacy technician, and registration under this section is not required. (5) Notwithstanding the requirements of this section or any other provision of law, a person who is licensed by the state as a pharmacy intern may be employed as a registered pharmacy technician without paying a registration fee or filing an application with the board to register as a pharmacy technician. (6) As a condition of registration renewal, a registered pharmacy technician shall complete 20 hours biennially of continuing education courses approved by the board or the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education, of which 4 hours must be via live presentation and 2 hours must be related to the prevention of medication errors and pharmacy law. (7) A registered pharmacy technician seeking to administer vaccines under s. 465.189 must be certified to administer such vaccines pursuant to a certification program approved by the board in consultation with the Board of Medicine and the Board of Osteopathic Medicine. The certification program must have at least 6 hours of immunization-related training approved by the board that shall, at a minimum, have a curriculum of instruction concerning the safe and effective administration of such vaccines, including, but not limited to, potential allergic reactions to such vaccines. As a condition of registration renewal, a registered pharmacy technician seeking to administer vaccines under s. 465.189 must have at least 2 hours of continuing education approved by the board in addition to the biennial continuing education required in subsection (6). (8) The board shall adopt rules that require each registration issued by the board under this section to be displayed in such a manner as to make it available to the public and to facilitate inspection by the department. The board may adopt other rules as necessary to administer this section. (9) If the board finds that an applicant for registration as a pharmacy technician or that a registered pharmacy technician has committed an act that constitutes grounds for discipline as set forth in s. 456.072(1) or has committed an act that constitutes grounds for denial of a license or disciplinary action as set forth in this chapter, including an act that constitutes a substantial violation of s. 456.072(1) or a violation of this chapter which occurred before the applicant or registrant was registered as a pharmacy technician, the board may enter an order imposing any of the penalties specified in s. 456.072(2) against the applicant or registrant.

(2)(a) Before dispensing a controlled substance to a person not known to the pharmacist, the pharmacist must require the person purchasing, receiving, or otherwise acquiring the controlled substance to present valid photographic identification or other verification of his or her identity. If the person does not have proper identification, the pharmacist may verify the validity of the prescription and the identity of the patient with the prescriber or his or her authorized agent. Verification of health plan eligibility through a real-time inquiry or adjudication system is considered to be proper identification. (b) This subsection does not apply in an institutional setting or to a long-term care facility, including, but not limited to, an assisted living facility or a hospital to which patients are admitted.

The board may require an applicant to provide any information it deems reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. (4) An applicant shall submit the following to the board to obtain an initial permit, or to the department to renew a permit: (a) Proof of an active and unencumbered license or permit to operate the pharmacy in compliance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the dispensing facility is located and from which the prescription drugs will be exported.

(b) “Class II institutional pharmacies” are those institutional pharmacies which employ the services of a registered pharmacist or pharmacists who, in practicing institutional pharmacy, shall provide dispensing and consulting services on the premises to patients of that institution, for use on the premises of that institution. However, an institutional pharmacy located in an area or county included in an emergency order or proclamation of a state of emergency declared by the Governor may provide dispensing and consulting services to individuals who are not patients of the institution. However, a single dose of a medicinal drug may be obtained and administered to a patient on a valid physician’s drug order under the supervision of a physician or charge nurse, consistent with good institutional practice procedures. The obtaining and administering of such single dose of a medicinal drug shall be pursuant to drug-handling procedures established by a consultant pharmacist. Medicinal drugs may be dispensed in a Class II institutional pharmacy, but only in accordance with the provisions of this section. (c) “Modified Class II institutional pharmacies” are those institutional pharmacies in short-term, primary care treatment centers that meet all the requirements for a Class II permit, except space and equipment requirements. (d)1. “Class III institutional pharmacies” are those institutional pharmacies, including central distribution facilities, affiliated with a hospital which provide the same services that are authorized by a Class II institutional pharmacy permit. Class III institutional pharmacies may also: a. Dispense, distribute, compound, and fill prescriptions for medicinal drugs for inpatient treatment or for patients receiving acute and postacute hospital care at home. b. Prepare prepackaged drug products. c. Conduct other pharmaceutical services for the affiliated hospital and for entities under common control that are each permitted under this chapter to possess medicinal drugs. d. Provide the services in sub-subparagraphs a.-c. to an entity under common control which holds an active health care clinic establishment permit as required under s. 499.01(2)(r). 2. A Class III institutional pharmacy shall maintain policies and procedures addressing: a. The consultant pharmacist responsible for pharmaceutical services. b. Safe practices for the preparation, dispensing, prepackaging, distribution, and transportation of medicinal drugs and prepackaged drug products. c. Recordkeeping to monitor the movement, distribution, and transportation of medicinal drugs and prepackaged drug products. d. Recordkeeping of pharmacy staff responsible for each step in the preparation, dispensing, prepackaging, transportation, and distribution of medicinal drugs and prepackaged drug products. e. Medicinal drugs and prepackaged drug products that may not be safely distributed among Class III institutional pharmacies. (3) Medicinal drugs shall be stocked, stored, compounded, dispensed, or administered in any health care institution only when that institution has secured an institutional pharmacy permit from the department. (4)(a) Medicinal drugs shall be dispensed by an institutional pharmacy to outpatients only when that institution has secured a community pharmacy permit from the department. However, medicinal drugs may be dispensed by a hospital that operates a Class II or Class III institutional pharmacy to a patient of the hospital’s emergency department or a hospital inpatient upon discharge if a prescriber, as defined in s. 465.025(1), treating the patient in such hospital determines that the medicinal drug is warranted and that community pharmacy services are not readily accessible, geographically or otherwise, to the patient. Such prescribing and dispensing must be for a supply of the drug that will last for the greater of the following: 1. Up to 48 hours; or 2. Through the end of the next business day. (b) Notwithstanding subparagraph (a)1., if a state of emergency has been declared and is in effect for an area of this state pursuant to s. 252.36, a supply of a medicinal drug which will last up to 72 hours may be prescribed and dispensed under paragraph (a) in that area. (c) A prescriber as defined in s. 465.025(1) who prescribes medicinal drugs under this subsection may provide the patient with a prescription for such drug for use beyond the initial prescription period if the prescriber determines that such use is warranted. Any prescribing or dispensing of a controlled substance under this subsection must comply with the applicable requirements of ss. 456.44 and 465.0276. (d) The board may adopt rules to implement this subsection. (5) All institutional pharmacies shall be under the professional supervision of a consultant pharmacist, and the compounding and dispensing of medicinal drugs shall be done only by a licensed pharmacist. Every institutional pharmacy that employs or otherwise uses registered pharmacy technicians shall have a written policy and procedures manual specifying those duties, tasks, and functions that a registered pharmacy technician is allowed to perform. (6) In a Class II or Class III institutional pharmacy, an institutional formulary system may be adopted with approval of the medical staff for the purpose of identifying those medicinal drugs, proprietary preparations, biologics, biosimilars, and biosimilar interchangeables that may be dispensed by the pharmacists employed in such institution. A facility with a Class II or Class III institutional pharmacy permit which is operating under the formulary system shall establish policies and procedures for the development of the system in accordance with the joint standards of the American Hospital Association and American Society of Hospital Pharmacists for the utilization of a hospital formulary system, which formulary shall be approved by the medical staff.

(6) The Board of Pharmacy and the Board of Medicine shall establish by rule a formulary of generic drug type and brand name drug products which are determined by the boards to demonstrate clinically significant biological or therapeutic inequivalence and which, if substituted, would pose a threat to the health and safety of patients receiving prescription medication. (a) The formulary may be added to or deleted from as the Board of Pharmacy and the Board of Medicine deem appropriate. Any person who requests any inclusion, addition, or deletion of a generic drug type or brand name drug product to the formulary shall have the burden of proof to show cause why such inclusion, addition, or deletion should be made. (b) Upon adoption of the formulary required by this subsection, and upon each addition, deletion, or modification to the formulary, the Board of Pharmacy shall mail a copy to each manager of the prescription department of each community pharmacy licensed by the state, each nonresident pharmacy registered in the state, and each board regulating practitioners licensed by the laws of the state to prescribe drugs shall incorporate such formulary into its rules. No pharmacist shall substitute a generically equivalent drug product for a prescribed brand name drug product if the brand name drug product or the generic drug type drug product is included in the said formulary. (7) Every community pharmacy shall display in a prominent place that is in clear and unobstructed public view, at or near the place where prescriptions are dispensed, a sign in block letters not less than 1 inch in height which shall read: “CONSULT YOUR PHARMACIST CONCERNING THE AVAILABILITY OF A LESS EXPENSIVE GENERICALLY EQUIVALENT DRUG AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF FLORIDA LAW.” (8) The standard of care to be applied to the acts of any pharmacist performing professional services in compliance with this section when a substitution is made by said pharmacist shall be that which would apply to the performance of professional services in the dispensing of a prescription order prescribing a drug by generic name. In no event when a pharmacist substitutes a drug shall the prescriber be liable in any action for loss, damage, injury, or death to any person occasioned by or arising from the use or nonuse of the substituted drug, unless the original drug was incorrectly prescribed. (9) A pharmacist may therapeutically substitute medicinal drugs in accordance with an institutional formulary established under s. 400.143 for the resident of a nursing home facility if the prescriber has agreed to the use of such institutional formulary for the patient. The pharmacist may not therapeutically substitute a medicinal drug pursuant to the facility’s institutional formulary if the prescriber indicates on the prescription “NO THERAPEUTIC SUBSTITUTION” or overtly indicates that therapeutic substitution is prohibited as authorized under s. 400.143(5)(c).

(4) In the case of a prescription to be transferred from or to a pharmacy located in another state, it shall be the responsibility of the pharmacist or pharmacy located in the State of Florida to verify, whether by electronic means or otherwise, that the person or entity involved in the transfer is a licensed pharmacist or pharmacy in the other state. (5) Electronic transfers of prescriptions are permitted regardless of whether the transferor or transferee pharmacy is open for business. (6) The transfer of a prescription for medicinal drugs listed in Schedules III, IV, and V appearing in chapter 893 for the purpose of refill dispensing is permissible, subject to the requirements of this section and federal law.

(c) Before dispensing any drug, give the patient a written prescription and orally or in writing advise the patient that the prescription may be filled in the practitioner’s office or at any pharmacy. (d)1.

If the person does not have proper identification, the dispenser may verify the validity of the prescription and the identity of the patient with the prescriber or his or her authorized agent. Verification of health plan eligibility through a real-time inquiry or adjudication system is considered to be proper identification. 2. This paragraph does not apply in an institutional setting or to a long-term care facility, including, but not limited to, an assisted living facility or a hospital to which patients are admitted. 3. As used in this paragraph, the term “proper identification” means an identification that is issued by a state or the Federal Government containing the person’s photograph, printed name, and signature or a document considered acceptable under 8 C.F.R. s. 274a.2(b)(1)(v)(A) and (B).

(4) A practitioner who confines her or his activities to the dispensing of complimentary packages of medicinal drugs to the practitioner’s own patients in the regular course of her or his practice, without the payment of fee or remuneration of any kind, whether direct or indirect, and who herself or himself dispenses such drugs is not required to register pursuant to this section. The practitioner must dispense such drugs in the manufacturer’s labeled package with the practitioner’s name, patient’s name, and date dispensed, or, if such drugs are not dispensed in the manufacturer’s labeled package, they must be dispensed in a container which bears the following information: (a) Practitioner’s name; (b) Patient’s name; (c) Date dispensed; (d) Name and strength of drug; and (e) Directions for use. (5) This chapter and the rules adopted thereunder do not prohibit a veterinarian licensed under chapter 474 from administering a compounded drug to a patient, as defined in s. 474.202, or dispensing a compounded drug to the patient’s owner or caretaker. This subsection does not affect the regulation of the practice of pharmacy as set forth in this chapter.
