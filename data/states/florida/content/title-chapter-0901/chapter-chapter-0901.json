(2) The court may issue a warrant for the defendant’s arrest when all of the following circumstances apply: (a) A complaint has been filed charging the commission of a misdemeanor only. (b) The summons issued to the defendant has been returned unserved. (c) The conditions of subsection (1) are met. (3) A judge may electronically sign an arrest warrant if the requirements of subsection (1) or subsection (2) are met and the judge, based on an examination of the complaint and proofs submitted, determines that the complaint: (a) Bears the affiant’s signature, or electronic signature if the complaint was submitted electronically. (b) Is supported by an oath or affirmation administered by the judge or other person authorized by law to administer oaths. (c) If submitted electronically, is submitted by reliable electronic means. (4) An arrest warrant shall be deemed to be issued by a judge at the time the judge affixes the judge’s signature or electronic signature to the warrant.

An arrest for the commission of a misdemeanor or the violation of a municipal or county ordinance shall be made immediately or in fresh pursuit. (2) A felony has been committed and he or she reasonably believes that the person committed it. (3) He or she reasonably believes that a felony has been or is being committed and that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing it. (4) A warrant for the arrest has been issued and is held by another peace officer for execution. (5) A violation of chapter 316 has been committed in the presence of the officer. Such an arrest may be made immediately or in fresh pursuit. Any law enforcement officer, upon receiving information relayed to him or her from a fellow officer stationed on the ground or in the air that a driver of a vehicle has violated chapter 316, may arrest the driver for violation of those laws when reasonable and proper identification of the vehicle and the violation has been communicated to the arresting officer. (6) There is probable cause to believe that the person has committed a criminal act according to s. 790.233 or according to s. 741.31, s. 784.047, or s. 825.1036 which violates an injunction for protection entered pursuant to s. 741.30, s. 784.046, or s. 825.1035 or a foreign protection order accorded full faith and credit pursuant to s. 741.315, over the objection of the petitioner, if necessary. (7) There is probable cause to believe that the person has committed an act of domestic violence, as defined in s. 741.28, or dating violence, as provided in s. 784.046. The decision to arrest shall not require consent of the victim or consideration of the relationship of the parties. It is the public policy of this state to strongly discourage arrest and charges of both parties for domestic violence or dating violence on each other and to encourage training of law enforcement and prosecutors in these areas. A law enforcement officer who acts in good faith and exercises due care in making an arrest under this subsection, under s. 741.31(4) or s. 784.047, or pursuant to a foreign order of protection accorded full faith and credit pursuant to s. 741.315, is immune from civil liability that otherwise might result by reason of his or her action. (8) There is probable cause to believe that the person has committed child abuse, as defined in s. 827.03, or has violated s. 787.025, relating to luring or enticing a child for unlawful purposes. The decision to arrest does not require consent of the victim or consideration of the relationship of the parties. It is the public policy of this state to protect abused children by strongly encouraging the arrest and prosecution of persons who commit child abuse. A law enforcement officer who acts in good faith and exercises due care in making an arrest under this subsection is immune from civil liability that otherwise might result by reason of his or her action. (9) There is probable cause to believe that the person has committed: (a) Any battery upon another person, as defined in s. 784.03. (b) An act of criminal mischief or a graffiti-related offense as described in s. 806.13. (c) A violation of a safety zone, security zone, regulated navigation area, or naval vessel protection zone as described in s. 327.461. (d) A racing, street takeover, or stunt driving violation as described in s. 316.191(2). (e) An exposure of sexual organs in violation of s. 800.03. (f) Possession of a firearm by a minor in violation of s. 790.22(3). (g) Trespass upon school grounds or facilities, including school buses as defined in s. 810.097(5)(b), in violation of that section. (10) The officer has determined that he or she has probable cause to believe that a misdemeanor has been committed, based upon a signed affidavit provided to the officer by a law enforcement officer of the United States Government, recognized as such by United States statute, or a United States military law enforcement officer, recognized as such by the Uniform Code of Military Justice or the United States Department of Defense Regulations, when the misdemeanor was committed in the presence of the United States law enforcement officer or the United States military law enforcement officer on federal military property over which the state has maintained exclusive jurisdiction for such a misdemeanor. (11)(a) A law enforcement officer of the Florida National Guard, recognized as such by the Uniform Code of Military Justice or the United States Department of Defense Regulations, has probable cause to believe a felony was committed on state military property or when a felony or misdemeanor was committed in his or her presence on such property. (b) All law enforcement officers of the Florida National Guard shall promptly surrender all persons arrested and charged with a felony to the sheriff of the county within which the state military property is located, and all persons arrested and charged with misdemeanors shall be surrendered to the applicable authority as may be provided by law, but otherwise to the sheriff of the county in which the state military property is located. The Florida National Guard shall promptly notify the applicable law enforcement agency of an arrest and the location of the prisoner. (c) The Adjutant General, in consultation with the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission, shall prescribe minimum training standards for such law enforcement officers of the Florida National Guard. (12) He or she is employed by the State of Florida as a law enforcement officer as defined in s. 943.10(1) or part-time law enforcement officer as defined in s. 943.10(6), and: (a) He or she reasonably believes that a felony involving violence has been or is being committed and that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing the felony; (b) While engaged in the exercise of his or her state law enforcement duties, the officer reasonably believes that a felony has been or is being committed; or (c) A felony warrant for the arrest has been issued and is being held for execution by another peace officer. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the authority of an officer pursuant to this subsection is statewide. This subsection does not limit the arrest authority conferred on such officer by any other provision of law. (13) There is probable cause to believe that the person has committed an act that violates a condition of pretrial release provided in s. 903.047 when the original arrest was for an act of domestic violence as defined in s. 741.28, or when the original arrest was for an act of dating violence as defined in s. 784.046. (14) There is probable cause to believe that the person has committed trespass in a secure area of an airport when signs are posted in conspicuous areas of the airport which notify that unauthorized entry into such areas constitutes a trespass and specify the methods for gaining authorized access to such areas. An arrest under this subsection may be made on or off airport premises. A law enforcement officer who acts in good faith and exercises due care in making an arrest under this subsection is immune from civil liability that otherwise might result by reason of the law enforcement officer’s action.

(2) Every federal law enforcement officer has the following authority: (a) To make a warrantless arrest of any person who has committed a felony or misdemeanor as defined by state statute, which felony or misdemeanor involves violence, in the presence of the officer while the officer is engaged in the exercise of her or his federal law enforcement duties. If the officer reasonably believes that such a felony or misdemeanor as defined by state statute has been committed in her or his presence, the officer may make a warrantless arrest of any person whom she or he reasonably believes to have committed such felony or misdemeanor. (b) To use any force which the officer reasonably believes to be necessary to defend herself or himself or another from bodily harm while making the arrest or any force necessarily committed in arresting any felon fleeing from justice when the officer reasonably believes either that the fleeing felon poses a threat of death or serious physical harm to the officer or others or that the fleeing felon has committed a crime involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical harm to another person. (c) To conduct a warrantless search incident to the arrest, as provided in s. 901.21, and to conduct any other constitutionally permissible search pursuant to the officer’s lawful duties. (d) To possess firearms; and to seize weapons in order to protect herself or himself from attack, prevent the escape of an arrested person, or assure the subsequent lawful custody of the fruits of a crime or the articles used in the commission of a crime, as provided in s. 901.21.

(3) No person shall be temporarily detained under the provisions of subsection (2) longer than is reasonably necessary to effect the purposes of that subsection. Such temporary detention shall not extend beyond the place where it was first effected or the immediate vicinity thereof. (4) If at any time after the onset of the temporary detention authorized by subsection (2), probable cause for arrest of person shall appear, the person shall be arrested. If, after an inquiry into the circumstances which prompted the temporary detention, no probable cause for the arrest of the person shall appear, the person shall be released. (5) Whenever any law enforcement officer authorized to detain temporarily any person under the provisions of subsection (2) has probable cause to believe that any person whom the officer has temporarily detained, or is about to detain temporarily, is armed with a dangerous weapon and therefore offers a threat to the safety of the officer or any other person, the officer may search such person so temporarily detained only to the extent necessary to disclose, and for the purpose of disclosing, the presence of such weapon. If such a search discloses such a weapon or any evidence of a criminal offense it may be seized. (6) No evidence seized by a law enforcement officer in any search under this section shall be admissible against any person in any court of this state or political subdivision thereof unless the search which disclosed its existence was authorized by and conducted in compliance with the provisions of subsections (2)-(5).

It shall also include the pursuit of a person suspected of having committed a supposed felony, though no felony has actually been committed, if there is reasonable ground for believing that a felony has been committed. It shall also include the pursuit of a person who has violated a county or municipal ordinance or chapter 316 or has committed a misdemeanor. (2) Any duly authorized state, county, or municipal arresting officer is authorized to arrest a person outside the officer’s jurisdiction when in fresh pursuit. Such officer shall have the same authority to arrest and hold such person in custody outside his or her jurisdiction, subject to the limitations hereafter set forth, as has any authorized arresting state, county, or municipal officer of this state to arrest and hold in custody a person not arrested in fresh pursuit. (3) If an arrest is made in this state by an officer outside the county within which his or her jurisdiction lies, the officer shall immediately notify the officer in charge of the jurisdiction in which the arrest is made. Such officer in charge of the jurisdiction shall, along with the officer making the arrest, take the person so arrested before a trial court judge of the county in which the arrest was made without unnecessary delay. (4) The employing agency of the state, county, or municipal officer making an arrest on fresh pursuit shall be liable for all actions of said officer in the same fashion that it is liable for the officer’s acts made while making an arrest within his or her jurisdiction. (5) The officer making an arrest on fresh pursuit shall be fully protected with respect to pension, retirement, workers’ compensation, and other such benefits just as if the officer had made an arrest in his or her own jurisdiction.

      "text": "901.41 Prearrest diversion programs.— (1) LEGISLATIVE INTENT.—The Legislature encourages local communities and public or private educational institutions to implement prearrest diversion programs that afford certain adults who fulfill specified intervention and community service obligations the opportunity to avoid an arrest record. The Legislature does not mandate that a particular prearrest diversion program for adults be adopted, but finds that the adoption of the model program provided in this section would allow certain adults to avoid an arrest record while ensuring that they receive appropriate services and fulfill their community service obligations. If a prearrest diversion program is implemented, the program is encouraged to share information with other prearrest diversion programs. (2) MODEL PREARREST DIVERSION PROGRAM.—Local communities and public or private educational institutions may adopt a prearrest diversion program in which: (a) Law enforcement officers, at their sole discretion, may issue a civil citation or similar prearrest diversion program notice to certain adults who commit a qualifying misdemeanor offense, as determined by the representatives that develop the program under subsection (3). A civil citation or similar prearrest diversion program notice may be issued if the adult who commits the offense: 1. Admits that he or she committed the offense or does not contest the offense; and 2. Has not previously been arrested and has not received an adult civil citation or similar prearrest diversion program notice, unless the terms of the local adult prearrest diversion program allow otherwise. The local adult prearrest diversion program shall establish a limit on the number of times an eligible adult may participate in the program. (b) An adult who receives a civil citation or similar prearrest diversion program notice shall report for intake as required by the local prearrest diversion program and must be provided appropriate assessment, intervention, education, and behavioral health care services by the program. While in the local prearrest diversion program, the adult shall perform community service hours as specified by the program. The adult shall pay restitution due to the victim as a program requirement. If the adult does not successfully complete the prearrest diversion program, the law enforcement officer must determine if there is good cause to arrest the adult for the original misdemeanor offense and, if so, refer the case to the state attorney to determine whether prosecution is appropriate or, in the absence of a finding of good cause, allow the adult to continue in the program. (3) PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT; IMPLEMENTATION; OPERATION.— (a) Representatives of participating law enforcement agencies, a representative of the program services provider, the public defender, the state attorney, and the clerk of the circuit court shall create the prearrest diversion program and develop its policies and procedures, including, but not limited to, eligibility criteria, program implementation and operation, and the determination of the fee, if any, to be paid by adults participating in the program. In developing the program’s policies and procedures, which must include the designation of the misdemeanor offenses that qualify adults for participation in the program, the representatives must solicit input from other interested stakeholders. The program may be operated by an entity such as a law enforcement agency or a county or municipality, or other entity selected by the county or municipality. (b) Upon intake of an adult participating in the prearrest diversion program, the program operator shall electronically provide the participant’s personal identifying information to the clerk of the circuit court for the county in which the program provides services. Such information is not a court record, and the clerk of the circuit court shall maintain the confidentiality of the participant’s personal identifying information as provided in 1 subsection (5). The clerk of the circuit court shall maintain such information in a statewide database, which must provide a single point of access for all such statewide information. If the program imposes a participation fee, the clerk of the circuit court must receive a reasonable portion, to be determined by the stakeholders creating the program, for receipt and maintenance of the required information. The fee shall be deposited by the clerk of the circuit court into the fine and forfeiture fund established under s. 142.01. (4) APPLICABILITY.—This section does not preempt a county or municipality from enacting noncriminal sanctions for a violation of an ordinance or other violation, and it does not preempt a county, a municipality, or a public or private educational institution from creating its own model for a prearrest diversion program for adults. (5) ELIGIBILITY.—A violent misdemeanor, a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, as defined in s. 741.28, or a misdemeanor under s. 741.29, s. 741.31, s. 784.046, s. 784.047, s. 784.048, s. 784.0487, or s. 784.049 does not qualify for a civil citation or prearrest diversion program. History.—s. 3, ch. 2018-127; s. 3, ch. 2019-53; s. 89, ch. 2019-167. 1 Note.—Subsection (5) references eligibility for the program, not confidential information. Senate Bill 1394 and House Bill 1199, 2018 Regular Session, provided for amendment of s. 901.41 to add an exemption from public records requirements for the personal identifying information of program participants, but neither bill passed.

(2) A person whose arrest booking photograph is published or otherwise disseminated, or his or her legal representative, may make a request, in writing, for the removal of an arrest booking photograph to the registered agent of the person or entity who published or otherwise disseminated the photograph. The written request for removal of the arrest booking photograph must be sent by registered mail and include sufficient proof of identification of the person whose arrest booking photograph was published or otherwise disseminated and specific information identifying the arrest booking photograph that the written request is seeking to remove. Within 10 calendar days after receipt of the written request for removal of the arrest booking photograph, the person or entity who published or otherwise disseminated the photograph shall remove the arrest booking photograph without charge and may not republish or otherwise redisseminate such photograph. (3)(a) The person whose arrest booking photograph was published or otherwise disseminated in the publication or electronic medium may bring a civil action to enjoin the continued publication or dissemination of the photograph if the photograph is not removed within 10 calendar days after receipt of the written request for removal. The court may impose a civil penalty of $1,000 per day for noncompliance with an injunction and shall award reasonable attorney fees and court costs related to the issuance and enforcement of the injunction. Moneys recovered for civil penalties under this paragraph shall be deposited into the General Revenue Fund. (b) If a person or an entity was required to remove an arrest booking photograph under this section and later republishes or otherwise redisseminates the photograph in the publication or electronic medium, the person whose photograph is republished or redisseminated may bring a civil action to enjoin the continued publication or dissemination of the photograph. The court may impose a civil penalty of $5,000 per day for noncompliance with an injunction and shall award reasonable attorney fees and court costs related to the issuance and enforcement of the injunction. Moneys recovered for civil penalties under this paragraph shall be deposited into the General Revenue Fund. (4) Refusal to remove an arrest booking photograph after written request has been made or republishing or otherwise redisseminating an arrest booking photograph after a written request to remove such photograph has been made constitutes an unfair or deceptive trade practice in accordance with part II of chapter 501. (5) This section does not apply to any person or entity that publishes or disseminates information relating to arrest booking photographs unless: (a) The person or entity solicits or accepts payment to remove the photographs; or (b) The person’s or entity’s primary business model is the publishing and disseminating of arrest booking photographs for a commercial purpose or pecuniary gain.
