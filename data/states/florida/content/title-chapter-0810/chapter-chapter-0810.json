      "text": "810.015 Legislative findings and intent; burglary.— (1) The Legislature finds that the case of Delgado v. State, 776 So. 2d 233 (Fla. 2000), was decided contrary to legislative intent and the case law of this state relating to burglary prior to Delgado v. State. The Legislature finds that in order for a burglary to occur, it is not necessary for the licensed or invited person to remain in the dwelling, structure, or conveyance surreptitiously. (2) It is the intent of the Legislature that the holding in Delgado v. State, 776 So. 2d 233 (Fla. 2000) be nullified. It is further the intent of the Legislature that s. 810.02(1)(a) be construed in conformity with Raleigh v. State, 705 So. 2d 1324 (Fla. 1997); Jimenez v. State, 703 So. 2d 437 (Fla. 1997); Robertson v. State, 699 So. 2d 1343 (Fla. 1997); Routly v. State, 440 So. 2d 1257 (Fla. 1983); and Ray v. State, 522 So. 2d 963 (Fla. 3rd DCA, 1988). This subsection shall operate retroactively to February 1, 2000. (3) It is further the intent of the Legislature that consent remain an affirmative defense to burglary and that the lack of consent may be proven by circumstantial evidence. (4) The Legislature finds that the cases of Floyd v. State, 850 So. 2d 383 (Fla. 2002); Fitzpatrick v. State, 859 So. 2d 486 (Fla. 2003); and State v. Ruiz/State v. Braggs, Slip Opinion Nos. SC02-389/SC02-524 were decided contrary to the Legislative intent expressed in this section. The Legislature finds that these cases were decided in such a manner as to give subsection (1) no effect. The February 1, 2000, date reflected in subsection (2) does not refer to an arbitrary date relating to the date offenses were committed, but to a date before which the law relating to burglary was untainted by Delgado v. State, 776 So. 2d 233 (Fla. 2000). (5) The Legislature provides the following special rules of construction to apply to this section: (a) All subsections in this section shall be construed to give effect to subsection (1); (b) Notwithstanding s. 775.021(1), this section shall be construed to give the interpretation of the burglary statute announced in Delgado v. State, 776 So. 2d 233 (Fla. 2000), and its progeny, no effect; and (c) If language in this section is susceptible to differing constructions, it shall be construed in such manner as to approximate the law relating to burglary as if Delgado v. State, 776 So. 2d 233 (Fla. 2000) was never issued. (6) This section shall apply retroactively. History.—s. 1, ch. 2001-58; s. 1, ch. 2004-93.

      "heading": "Burglary",
      "text": "810.02 Burglary.— (1)(a) For offenses committed on or before July 1, 2001, “burglary” means entering or remaining in a dwelling, a structure, or a conveyance with the intent to commit an offense therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the defendant is licensed or invited to enter or remain. (b) For offenses committed after July 1, 2001, “burglary” means: 1. Entering a dwelling, a structure, or a conveyance with the intent to commit an offense therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the defendant is licensed or invited to enter; or 2. Notwithstanding a licensed or invited entry, remaining in a dwelling, structure, or conveyance: a. Surreptitiously, with the intent to commit an offense therein; b. After permission to remain therein has been withdrawn, with the intent to commit an offense therein; or c. To commit or attempt to commit a forcible felony, as defined in s. 776.08. (2) Burglary is a felony of the first degree, punishable by imprisonment for a term of years not exceeding life imprisonment or as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if, in the course of committing the offense, the offender: (a) Makes an assault or battery upon any person; or (b) Is or becomes armed within the dwelling, structure, or conveyance, with explosives or a dangerous weapon; or (c) Enters an occupied or unoccupied dwelling or structure, and: 1. Uses a motor vehicle as an instrumentality, other than merely as a getaway vehicle, to assist in committing the offense, and thereby damages the dwelling or structure; or 2. Causes damage to the dwelling or structure, or to property within the dwelling or structure in excess of $1,000. (3) Burglary is a felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if, in the course of committing the offense, the offender does not make an assault or battery and is not and does not become armed with a dangerous weapon or explosive, and the offender enters or remains in a: (a) Dwelling, and there is another person in the dwelling at the time the offender enters or remains; (b) Dwelling, and there is not another person in the dwelling at the time the offender enters or remains; (c) Structure, and there is another person in the structure at the time the offender enters or remains; (d) Conveyance, and there is another person in the conveyance at the time the offender enters or remains; (e) Authorized emergency vehicle, as defined in s. 316.003; or (f) Structure or conveyance when the offense intended to be committed therein is theft of a controlled substance as defined in s. 893.02. Notwithstanding any other law, separate judgments and sentences for burglary with the intent to commit theft of a controlled substance under this paragraph and for any applicable possession of controlled substance offense under s. 893.13 or trafficking in controlled substance offense under s. 893.135 may be imposed when all such offenses involve the same amount or amounts of a controlled substance. However, if the burglary is committed during a riot or an aggravated riot prohibited under s. 870.01 and the perpetration of the burglary is facilitated by conditions arising from the riot; or within a county that is subject to a state of emergency declared by the Governor under chapter 252 after the declaration of emergency is made and the perpetration of the burglary is facilitated by conditions arising from the emergency, the burglary is a felony of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. As used in this subsection, the term “conditions arising from the riot” means civil unrest, power outages, curfews, or a reduction in the presence of or response time for first responders or homeland security personnel and the term “conditions arising from the emergency” means civil unrest, power outages, curfews, voluntary or mandatory evacuations, or a reduction in the presence of or response time for first responders or homeland security personnel. A person arrested for committing a burglary during a riot or an aggravated riot or within a county that is subject to such a state of emergency may not be released until the person appears before a committing magistrate at a first appearance hearing. For purposes of sentencing under chapter 921, a felony offense that is reclassified under this subsection is ranked one level above the ranking under s. 921.0022 or s. 921.0023 of the offense committed. (4) Burglary is a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if, in the course of committing the offense, the offender does not make an assault or battery and is not and does not become armed with a dangerous weapon or explosive, and the offender enters or remains in a: (a) Structure, and there is not another person in the structure at the time the offender enters or remains; or (b) Conveyance, and there is not another person in the conveyance at the time the offender enters or remains. However, if the burglary is committed during a riot or an aggravated riot prohibited under s. 870.01 and the perpetration of the burglary is facilitated by conditions arising from the riot; or within a county that is subject to a state of emergency declared by the Governor under chapter 252 after the declaration of emergency is made and the perpetration of the burglary is facilitated by conditions arising from the emergency, the burglary is a felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. As used in this subsection, the terms “conditions arising from the riot” and “conditions arising from the emergency” have the same meanings as provided in subsection (3). A person arrested for committing a burglary during a riot or an aggravated riot or within a county that is subject to such a state of emergency may not be released until the person appears before a committing magistrate at a first appearance hearing. For purposes of sentencing under chapter 921, a felony offense that is reclassified under this subsection is ranked one level above the ranking under s. 921.0022 or s. 921.0023 of the offense committed.

Entering a dwelling, a structure, or a conveyance with the intent to commit an offense therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the defendant is licensed or invited to enter; or 2. Notwithstanding a licensed or invited entry, remaining in a dwelling, structure, or conveyance: a. Surreptitiously, with the intent to commit an offense therein; b. After permission to remain therein has been withdrawn, with the intent to commit an offense therein; or c. To commit or attempt to commit a forcible felony, as defined in s. 776.08. (2) Burglary is a felony of the first degree, punishable by imprisonment for a term of years not exceeding life imprisonment or as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if, in the course of committing the offense, the offender: (a) Makes an assault or battery upon any person; or (b) Is or becomes armed within the dwelling, structure, or conveyance, with explosives or a dangerous weapon; or (c) Enters an occupied or unoccupied dwelling or structure, and: 1.

However, if the burglary is committed during a riot or an aggravated riot prohibited under s. 870.01 and the perpetration of the burglary is facilitated by conditions arising from the riot; or within a county that is subject to a state of emergency declared by the Governor under chapter 252 after the declaration of emergency is made and the perpetration of the burglary is facilitated by conditions arising from the emergency, the burglary is a felony of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.

However, if the burglary is committed during a riot or an aggravated riot prohibited under s. 870.01 and the perpetration of the burglary is facilitated by conditions arising from the riot; or within a county that is subject to a state of emergency declared by the Governor under chapter 252 after the declaration of emergency is made and the perpetration of the burglary is facilitated by conditions arising from the emergency, the burglary is a felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. As used in this subsection, the terms “conditions arising from the riot” and “conditions arising from the emergency” have the same meanings as provided in subsection (3). A person arrested for committing a burglary during a riot or an aggravated riot or within a county that is subject to such a state of emergency may not be released until the person appears before a committing magistrate at a first appearance hearing. For purposes of sentencing under chapter 921, a felony offense that is reclassified under this subsection is ranked one level above the ranking under s. 921.0022 or s. 921.0023 of the offense committed.
