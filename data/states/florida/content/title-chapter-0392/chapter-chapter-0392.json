(2) The department shall adopt rules specifying the information that must be included in a report of tuberculosis, the time within which the report must be filed, and where the report must be filed. The department shall consider the need for information, protection of the privacy and confidentiality of the patient, and the practical ability of persons and laboratories to report in a reasonable fashion. Rules adopted by the department may provide for telephonic, electronic, and written reporting and may establish different time periods and content for each method of reporting. (3) A person who reports to the department the name of a person who has tuberculosis is not liable for damages caused by such report, unless the report is made with knowledge that it is false or with reckless disregard of the truthfulness of the report. (4) A person who violates this section or the rules adopted under this section may be fined by the department, in the manner prescribed in s. 392.67. The department shall report each violation of this section to the regulatory agency that is responsible for licensing the person or laboratory that commits the violation.

When a person has been diagnosed as having active tuberculosis, he or she shall continue with the prescribed treatment on an outpatient basis, which includes the use of directly observed therapy, until such time as the disease is determined to be cured. (3) A person may not be apprehended or examined on an outpatient basis for active tuberculosis without consent, except upon the presentation of a warrant duly authorized by a circuit court. In requesting the issuance of such a warrant, the department must show by a preponderance of evidence that a threat to the public health would exist unless such a warrant is issued and must show that all other reasonable means of obtaining compliance have been exhausted and that no other less restrictive alternative is available. (4) A warrant requiring a person to be apprehended or examined on an outpatient basis may not be issued unless: (a) A hearing has been held with respect to which the person has received at least 72 hours’ prior written notification and has received a list of the proposed actions to be taken and the reasons for each such action. However, with the consent of the person or the person’s counsel, a hearing may be held within less than 72 hours. (b) The person has the right to attend the hearing, to cross-examine witnesses, and to present evidence. After review and consultation by the court, counsel for the person may waive the client’s presence or allow the client to appear by television monitor where available. (c) The court advises the person of the right to have legal counsel present. If the person is insolvent and unable to employ counsel, the court shall appoint legal counsel for the person pursuant to the indigence criteria in s. 27.52. (5) The circuit court, legal counsel, and local law enforcement officials, as appropriate, shall consult with the department concerning any necessary infection control procedures to be taken during any court hearing or detention.

Each treatment plan must be implemented through a case management approach designed to advance the individual needs of the person who has active tuberculosis. The person’s progress in achieving the objectives of the treatment plan must be periodically reviewed and revised as necessary, in consultation with the person. (2) The department may petition a circuit court under s. 392.55, s. 392.56, or s. 392.57, as it deems appropriate, to require adherence to treatment plans prescribed under subsection (1).
