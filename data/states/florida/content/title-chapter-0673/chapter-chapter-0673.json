      "text": "673.1031 Definitions.— (1) In this chapter, the term: (a) “Acceptor” means a drawee who has accepted a draft. (b) “Drawee” means a person ordered in a draft to make payment. (c) “Drawer” means a person who signs or is identified in a draft as a person ordering payment. (d) “Good faith” means honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. (e) “Maker” means a person who signs or is identified in a note as a person undertaking to pay. (f) “Order” means a written instruction to pay money signed by the person giving the instruction. The instruction may be addressed to any person, including the person giving the instruction, or to one or more persons jointly or in the alternative but not in succession. An authorization to pay is not an order unless the person authorized to pay is also instructed to pay. (g) “Ordinary care,” in the case of a person engaged in business, means observance of reasonable commercial standards, prevailing in the area in which the person is located, with respect to the business in which the person is engaged. In the case of a bank that takes an instrument for processing for collection or payment by automated means, reasonable commercial standards do not require the bank to examine the instrument if the failure to examine does not violate the bank’s prescribed procedures and the bank’s procedures do not vary unreasonably from general banking usage not disapproved by this chapter or chapter 674. (h) “Party” means a party to an instrument. (i) “Promise” means a written undertaking to pay money signed by the person undertaking to pay. An acknowledgment of an obligation by the obligor is not a promise unless the obligor also undertakes to pay the obligation. (j) “Prove,” with respect to a fact, means to meet the burden of establishing the fact (s. 671.201(8)). (k) “Remitter” means a person who purchases an instrument from its issuer if the instrument is payable to an identified person other than the purchaser.

If an instrument provides for interest, but the amount of interest payable cannot be ascertained from the description, interest is payable at the judgment rate in effect at the place of payment of the instrument and at the time interest first accrues.

(b) If the note is not payable on demand and is payable at or through a bank or the terms of the note require presentment, the note is dishonored if presentment is duly made and the note is not paid on the day it becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever is later. (c) If the note is not payable on demand and paragraph (b) does not apply, the note is dishonored if it is not paid on the day it becomes payable. (2) Dishonor of an unaccepted draft other than a documentary draft is governed by the following rules: (a) If a check is duly presented for payment to the payor bank otherwise than for immediate payment over the counter, the check is dishonored if the payor bank: 1. Makes timely return of the check or sends timely notice of dishonor or nonpayment under s. 674.301 or s. 674.302; or 2. Becomes accountable for the amount of the check under s. 674.302. (b) If a draft is payable on demand and paragraph (a) does not apply, the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made to the drawee and the draft is not paid on the day of presentment. (c) If a draft is payable on a date stated in the draft, the draft is dishonored if: 1. Presentment for payment is duly made to the drawee and payment is not made on the day the draft becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever is later; or 2. Presentment for acceptance is duly made before the day the draft becomes payable and the draft is not accepted on the day of presentment. (d) If a draft is payable on elapse of a period of time after sight or acceptance, the draft is dishonored if presentment for acceptance is duly made and the draft is not accepted on the day of presentment. (3) Dishonor of an unaccepted documentary draft occurs according to the rules stated in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of subsection (2), except that payment or acceptance may be delayed without dishonor until no later than the close of the third business day of the drawee following the day on which payment or acceptance is required by those paragraphs. (4) Dishonor of an accepted draft is governed by the following rules: (a) If the draft is payable on demand, the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made to the acceptor and the draft is not paid on the day of presentment. (b) If the draft is not payable on demand, the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made to the acceptor and payment is not made on the day it becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever is later. (5) In any case in which presentment is otherwise required for dishonor under this section and presentment is excused under s. 673.5041, dishonor occurs without presentment if the instrument is not duly accepted or paid. (6) If a draft is dishonored because timely acceptance of the draft was not made and the person entitled to demand acceptance consents to a late acceptance, from the time of acceptance the draft is treated as never having been dishonored.

To the extent of the payment, the obligation of the party obliged to pay the instrument is discharged even though payment is made with knowledge of a claim to the instrument under s. 673.3061 by another person. (2) The obligation of a party to pay the instrument is not discharged under subsection (1) if: (a) A claim to the instrument under s. 673.3061 is enforceable against the party receiving payment and: 1. Payment is made with knowledge by the payor that payment is prohibited by injunction or similar process of a court of competent jurisdiction; or 2. In the case of an instrument other than a cashier’s check, teller’s check, or certified check, the party making payment accepted, from the person having a claim to the instrument, indemnity against loss resulting from refusal to pay the person entitled to enforce the instrument; or (b) The person making payment knows that the instrument is a stolen instrument and pays a person it knows is in wrongful possession of the instrument.
