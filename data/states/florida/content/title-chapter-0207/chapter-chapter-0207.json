However, any surplus resulting from such sale after all payments of costs, penalties, and delinquent taxes have been made shall be returned to the defaulting person. (2) The sheriff to whom any such warrant is directed shall proceed upon the same in the same manner as prescribed by law in respect to executions issued against goods and chattels upon judgment by the several circuit courts, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. (3) In the event there is a contest or claim of any kind with reference to the property levied upon or the amount of taxes, costs, or penalties due, such contest or claim shall be tried in the circuit court in and for the county in which the warrant was executed, as nearly as may be in the same manner and means as such contest or claim would have been tried in such court had the warrant originally issued upon a judgment rendered by such court. The warrant issued as provided in this section shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amount of taxes, interest, and penalties due to the state by the motor carrier; and the burden of proof shall be upon the motor carrier, retail dealer, or distributor of diesel fuel or motor fuel to show that the amounts or penalties were incorrect.
