      "text": "1 290.002 Legislative findings.—It is hereby found and declared that: (1) Within the communities of this state, there exist areas that chronically display extreme and unacceptable levels of unemployment, physical deterioration, and economic disinvestment. (2) Each such area is a blight on the community as a whole, tarnishes the image and reputation of the community in the eyes of its residents, and reduces the desirability of the community as a place to visit and live. (3) Such severely distressed areas have high crime rates and provide environments detrimental to the physical and emotional health of their residents. (4) The revitalization and redevelopment of each such area for the ultimate benefit of its residents and the community as a whole is of critical importance to the individual community and to this state. (5) The resources of all levels of government are insufficient, and often inappropriate, to undertake successfully the massive task of restoring the social and economic productivity of such areas. (6) The ultimate revitalization of such areas can occur only if the private sector can be induced to invest its own resources in productive enterprises that rebuild the industrial and commercial viability of the areas and provide jobs for residents of the areas. (7) In order to provide the private sector with the necessary incentives to invest in such distressed areas, governments at all levels should seek ways to relax or eliminate fiscal and regulatory constraints and should seek to identify supportive actions that facilitate business investment in such distressed areas and overcome business objections to distressed area site locations.

In achieving this objective, the state will seek to provide appropriate investments, tax benefits, and regulatory relief of sufficient importance to encourage the business community to commit its financial participation. The purpose of ss. 290.001-290.016 is to establish a process that clearly identifies such severely distressed areas and provides incentives by both the state and local government to induce private investment in such areas. The Legislature, therefore, declares the revitalization of enterprise zones, through the concerted efforts of government and the private sector, to be a public purpose.

      "text": "1 290.0056 Enterprise zone development agency.— (1) Upon adoption of the resolution as provided in s. 290.0055(1)(a), the county or municipality shall create a public body corporate and politic to be known as an “enterprise zone development agency.” For an area nominated by a county and one or more municipalities jointly, the county shall create the agency. Each such agency shall be constituted as a public instrumentality, and the exercise by an enterprise zone development agency of the powers conferred by this act shall be deemed and held to be the performance of an essential public function. The enterprise zone development agency of a county has the power to function within the corporate limits of a municipality only if the governing body of the municipality has by resolution concurred in the enterprise zone development plan prepared pursuant to s. 290.0057. (2) When the governing body creates an enterprise zone development agency, that body shall appoint a board of commissioners of the agency, which shall consist of not fewer than 8 or more than 13 commissioners. The governing body may appoint at least one representative from each of the following: the local chamber of commerce; local financial or insurance entities; local businesses and, where possible, businesses operating within the nominated area; the residents residing within the nominated area; nonprofit community-based organizations operating within the nominated area; the local workforce development board; the local code enforcement agency; and the local law enforcement agency. The terms of office of the commissioners shall be for 4 years, except that, in making the initial appointments, the governing body shall appoint two members for terms of 3 years, two members for terms of 2 years, and one member for a term of 1 year; the remaining initial members shall serve for terms of 4 years. A vacancy occurring during a term shall be filled for the unexpired term. The importance of including individuals from the nominated area shall be considered in making appointments. Further, the importance of minority representation on the agency shall be considered in making appointments so that the agency generally reflects the gender and ethnic composition of the community as a whole. (3) A commissioner shall receive no compensation for his or her services, but is entitled to the necessary expenses, including travel expenses, incurred in the discharge of his or her duties. Each commissioner shall hold office until a successor has been appointed and has qualified. A certificate of the appointment or reappointment of any commissioner is conclusive evidence of the due and proper appointment of the commissioner. (4) The powers of an enterprise zone development agency shall be exercised by the commissioners. A majority of the commissioners constitutes a quorum for the purpose of conducting business and exercising the powers of the agency and for all other purposes. Action may be taken by the agency upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present, unless in any case the bylaws require a larger number. (5) The governing body shall designate a chair and vice chair from among the commissioners. An agency may employ an executive director, technical experts, and such other agents and employees, permanent and temporary, as it requires, and determine their qualifications, duties, and compensation. For such legal service as it requires, an agency may employ or retain its own counsel and legal staff. An agency authorized to transact business and exercise powers under this act shall file with the governing body, on or before March 31 of each year, a report of its activities for the preceding fiscal year, which report shall include a complete financial statement setting forth its assets, liabilities, income, and operating expenses as of the end of such fiscal year. The agency shall make the report available for inspection during business hours in the office of the agency. (6) At any time after the creation of an enterprise zone development agency, the governing body of the county or municipality may appropriate to the agency such amounts as the governing body deems necessary for the administrative expenses and overhead of the agency. (7) The governing body may remove a commissioner for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or misconduct in office only after a hearing and only if the commissioner has been given a copy of the charges at least 10 days prior to the hearing and has had an opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel. (8) The enterprise zone development agency shall have the following powers and responsibilities: (a) To assist in the development, implementation, and annual review and update of the strategic plan or measurable goals. (b) To oversee and monitor the implementation of the strategic plan or measurable goals. The agency shall make quarterly reports to the governing body of the municipality or county, or the governing bodies of the county and one or more municipalities, evaluating the progress in implementing the strategic plan or measurable goals. (c) To identify and recommend to the governing body of the municipality or county, or the governing bodies of the county and one or more municipalities, ways to remove regulatory barriers. (d) To identify to the local government or governments the financial needs of, and local resources or assistance available to, eligible businesses in the zone. (e) To assist in promoting the enterprise zone incentives to residents and businesses within the enterprise zone. (f) To recommend boundary changes, as appropriate, in the enterprise zone to the governing body. (g) To work with organizations affiliated with Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, the University of Florida, and the University of South Florida, a group of universities unofficially named the “University Partnership for Community Development,” or similar organizations that have combined their resources to provide development consulting on a nonprofit basis. (h) To work with the department to ensure that the enterprise zone coordinator receives training on an annual basis. (9) The following powers and responsibilities shall be performed by the governing body creating the enterprise zone development agency acting as the managing agent of the enterprise zone development agency, or, contingent upon approval by such governing body, such powers and responsibilities shall be performed by the enterprise zone development agency: (a) To review, process, and certify applications for state enterprise zone tax incentives pursuant to ss. 212.08(5)(g), (h), and (15); 212.096; 220.181; and 220.182. (b) To provide assistance to businesses and residents within the enterprise zone. (c) To promote the development of the enterprise zone, including preparing, purchasing, and distributing by mail or other means of advertising, literature and other material concerning the enterprise zone and enterprise zone incentives. (d) To borrow money and apply for and accept advances, loans, grants, contributions, and any other form of financial assistance from the Federal Government or the state, county, or other public body or from any sources, public or private, for the purposes of this act, and to give such security as may be required and to enter into and carry out contracts or agreements in connection therewith; and to include in any contract for financial assistance with the Federal Government for or with respect to the development of the enterprise zone and related activities such conditions imposed pursuant to federal laws as the governing body deems reasonable and appropriate which are not inconsistent with the purposes of this section. (e) To appropriate such funds and make such expenditures as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this act. (f) To make and execute contracts and other instruments necessary or convenient to the exercise of its powers under this section. (g) To procure insurance or require bond against any loss in connection with its property in such amounts and from such insurers as may be necessary or desirable. (h) To invest any funds held in reserves or sinking funds, or any funds not required for immediate disbursement, in such investments as may be authorized by this act. (i) To purchase, sell, or hold stock, evidences of indebtedness, and other capital participation instruments. (10) Contingent upon approval by the governing body, the agency may invest in community investment corporations which conduct, or agree to conduct, loan guarantee programs assisting minority business enterprises located in the enterprise zone. In making such investments, the agency shall first attempt to invest in existing community investment corporations providing services in the enterprise zone. Such investments shall be made under conditions required by law and as the agency may require, including, but not limited to: (a) The funds invested by the agency shall be used to provide loan guarantees to individuals for minority business enterprises located in the enterprise zone. (b) The community investment corporation may not approve any application for a loan guarantee unless the person applying for the loan guarantee shows that he or she has applied for the loan or loan guarantee through normal banking channels and that the loan or loan guarantee has been refused by at least one bank or other financial institution. (11) Before October 1 of each year, the agency shall submit to the department for inclusion in the annual report required under s. 20.60 a complete and detailed written report setting forth: (a) Its operations and accomplishments during the fiscal year. (b) The accomplishments and progress concerning the implementation of the strategic plan or measurable goals, and any updates to the strategic plan or measurable goals. (c) The number and type of businesses assisted by the agency during the fiscal year. (d) The number of jobs created within the enterprise zone during the fiscal year. (e) The usage and revenue impact of state and local incentives granted during the calendar year. (f) Any other information required by the department. (12) In the event that the nominated area selected by the governing body is not designated a state enterprise zone, the governing body may dissolve the agency after receiving notification from the department that the area was not designated as an enterprise zone.

(2) If, pursuant to subsection (4), the department does not redesignate an enterprise zone, a governing body of a county or municipality or the governing bodies of a county and one or more municipalities jointly, pursuant to s. 290.0055, may apply for designation of an enterprise zone to take the place of the enterprise zone not redesignated and request designation of an enterprise zone. The department shall determine which areas nominated by such governing bodies meet the criteria outlined in s. 290.0055 and are the most appropriate for designation as state enterprise zones. Each application made pursuant to s. 290.0055 shall be ranked competitively based on the pervasive poverty, unemployment, and general distress of the area; the strategic plan, including local fiscal and regulatory incentives, prepared pursuant to s. 290.0057; and the prospects for new investment and economic development in the area. Pervasive poverty, unemployment, and general distress shall be weighted 35 percent; strategic plan and local fiscal and regulatory incentives shall be weighted 40 percent; and prospects for new investment and economic development in the area shall be weighted 25 percent. (3) Any area authorized to be an enterprise zone by both a county and a municipality shall be placed in the appropriate category established under s. 290.0055(4)(b) in which an application by the municipality would have been considered if the municipality had acted alone, if at least 60 percent of the population of the area authorized to be an enterprise zone resides within the municipality. An area authorized to be an enterprise zone by a county and one or more municipalities shall be placed in the category in which an application by the municipality with the highest percentage of residents in such area would have been considered if such municipality had authorized the area to be an enterprise zone. (4)(a) Notwithstanding s. 290.0055, the department may redesignate any state enterprise zone having an effective date on or before January 1, 2005, as a state enterprise zone upon completion and submittal to the department by the governing body for an enterprise zone of the following: 1. An updated zone profile for the enterprise zone based on the most recent census data that complies with s. 290.0055, except that pervasive poverty criteria may be set aside for rural enterprise zones. 2. A resolution passed by the governing body for that enterprise zone requesting redesignation and explaining the reasons the conditions of the zone merit redesignation. 3. Measurable goals for the enterprise zone developed by the enterprise zone development agency, which may be the goals established in the enterprise zone’s strategic plan. The governing body may also submit a request for a boundary change in an enterprise zone in the same application to the department as long as the new area complies with the requirements of s. 290.0055, except that pervasive poverty criteria may be set aside for rural enterprise zones. (b) The department shall, based on the enterprise zone profile and the grounds for redesignation expressed in the resolution, determine whether the enterprise zone merits redesignation. The department may also examine and consider the following: 1. Progress made, if any, in the enterprise zone’s strategic plan. 2. Use of enterprise zone incentives during the life of the enterprise zone. If the department determines that the enterprise zone merits redesignation, the department shall notify the governing body in writing of its approval of redesignation. (c) If the enterprise zone is redesignated, the department shall determine if the measurable goals submitted are reasonable. If the department determines that the goals are reasonable, it shall notify the governing body in writing that the goals have been approved. (d) If the department denies redesignation of an enterprise zone, it shall notify the governing body in writing of the denial. Any county or municipality having jurisdiction over an area denied redesignation as a state enterprise zone pursuant to this subsection may not apply for designation of that area for 1 year following the date of denial. (5) Notwithstanding s. 290.0055, an area designated as a federal empowerment zone or enterprise community pursuant to Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, or the 1999 Agricultural Appropriations Act shall be designated a state enterprise zone as follows: (a) An area designated as an urban empowerment zone or urban enterprise community pursuant to Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, or the 2000 Community Renewal Tax Relief Act shall be redesignated a state enterprise zone by the department upon completion of the requirements set out in paragraph (d), except in the case of a county as defined in s. 125.011(1) which, notwithstanding s. 290.0055, may incorporate and include such designated urban empowerment zone or urban enterprise community areas within the boundaries of its state enterprise zones without any limitation as to size. (b) An area designated as a rural empowerment zone or rural enterprise community pursuant to Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 or the 1999 Agricultural Appropriations Act shall be redesignated a state rural enterprise zone by the department upon completion of the requirements set out in paragraph (d) and may incorporate and include such designated rural empowerment zone or rural enterprise community within the boundaries of its state enterprise zones without any limitation as to size. (c) Any county or municipality having jurisdiction over an area redesignated as a state enterprise zone pursuant to this subsection, other than a county defined in s. 125.011(1), may not apply for designation of another area. (d) Before redesignating such areas as state enterprise zones, the department shall ensure that the governing body having jurisdiction over the zone submits the information required under paragraph (4)(a) for redesignation to the department. (6)(a) The department may develop guidelines necessary for the approval of areas under this section by the Secretary of Commerce. (b) Such guidelines shall provide for the measurement of pervasive poverty, unemployment, and general distress using the criteria outlined by s. 290.0058. (c) Such guidelines shall provide for the evaluation of the strategic plan or measurable goals and local fiscal and regulatory incentives for effectiveness, including how the following key principles will be implemented by the governing body or bodies: 1. Economic opportunity, including job creation within the community and throughout the region, as well as entrepreneurial initiatives, small business expansion, and training for jobs that offer upward mobility. 2. Sustainable community development that advances the creation of livable and vibrant communities through comprehensive approaches that coordinate economic, physical, community, and human development. 3. Community-based partnerships involving the participation of all segments of the community. 4. Strategic vision for change that identifies how the community will be revitalized. This vision should include methods for building on community assets and coordinate a response to community needs in a comprehensive fashion. This vision should provide goals and performance benchmarks for measuring progress and establish a framework for evaluating and adjusting the strategic plan or measurable goals. 5. Local fiscal and regulatory incentives enacted pursuant to s. 290.0057(1)(e). These incentives should induce economic revitalization, including job creation and small business expansion. (d) Such guidelines may provide methods for evaluating the prospects for new investment and economic development in the area, including a review and evaluation of any previous state enterprise zones located in the area. (7) Upon approval by the department of a resolution authorizing an area to be an enterprise zone pursuant to this section, the department shall assign a unique identifying number to that resolution. The department shall provide the Department of Revenue with a copy of each resolution approved, together with its identifying number.

      "text": "290.046 Applications for grants; procedures; requirements.— (1) In applying for a grant under a specific program category, an applicant shall propose eligible activities that directly address the objectives of that program category. (2)(a) The department shall establish minimum criteria pertaining to the number of jobs created for persons of low or moderate income, the degree of private sector financial commitment, and the economic feasibility of the proposed project and shall establish any other criteria the department deems appropriate. Assistance to a private, for-profit business may not be provided from a grant award unless sufficient evidence exists to demonstrate that without such public assistance the creation or retention of such jobs would not occur. (b) A local government with an open housing rehabilitation, neighborhood revitalization, or commercial revitalization contract is not eligible to apply for another housing rehabilitation, neighborhood revitalization, or commercial revitalization grant until administrative closeout of its existing contract. The department shall notify a local government of administrative closeout or of any outstanding closeout issues within 45 days after receipt of a closeout package from the local government. A local government with an open housing rehabilitation, neighborhood revitalization, or commercial revitalization community development block grant contract whose activities are on schedule in accordance with the expenditure rates and accomplishments described in the contract may apply for an economic development grant. (c) A local government with an open economic development community development block grant contract whose activities are on schedule in accordance with the expenditure rates and accomplishments described in the contract may apply for a housing rehabilitation, neighborhood revitalization, or commercial revitalization community development block grant. A local government with an open economic development contract whose activities are on schedule in accordance with the expenditure rates and accomplishments described in the contract may receive more than one additional economic development grant in each fiscal year. (d) The department may not award a grant until it has conducted a site visit to verify the information contained in the local government’s application. (3)(a) The department shall rank each application received during the application cycle according to criteria established by rule. The ranking system shall include a procedure to eliminate or reduce any population-related bias that places exceptionally small communities at a disadvantage in the competition for funds. (b) Funds shall be distributed according to the rankings established in each application cycle. If economic development funds remain available after the application cycle closes, the remaining funds shall be awarded to eligible projects. (c) The application’s program impact score, equal employment opportunity and fair housing score, and communitywide needs score may take into consideration scoring factors, including, but not limited to, unemployment, poverty levels, low-income and moderate-income populations, benefits to low-income and moderate-income residents, use of minority-owned and woman-owned business enterprises in previous grants, health and safety issues, and the condition of physical structures. (4) In order to provide citizens with information concerning an applicant’s proposed project, the applicant shall make available to the public information concerning the amounts of funds available for various activities and the range of activities that may be undertaken. In addition, the applicant shall hold a minimum of two public hearings in the local jurisdiction within which the project is to be implemented to obtain the views of citizens before submitting the final application to the department. The applicant shall conduct the initial hearing to solicit public input concerning community needs, inform the public about funding opportunities available to address community needs, and discuss activities that may be undertaken. Before a second public hearing is held, the applicant must publish a summary of the proposed application that provides citizens with an opportunity to examine the contents of the application and to submit comments. The applicant shall conduct a second hearing to obtain comments from citizens concerning the proposed application and to modify the proposed application if appropriate. (5) The local government may establish a citizen advisory task force composed of citizens in the jurisdiction in which the proposed project is to be implemented to provide input relative to all phases of the project process. (6) The department shall, before approving an application for a grant, determine that the applicant has the administrative capacity to carry out the proposed activities and has performed satisfactorily in carrying out past activities funded by community development block grants. The evaluation of past performance shall take into account procedural aspects of previous grants as well as substantive results. If the department determines that any applicant has failed to accomplish substantially the results it proposed in previously funded applications, it may prohibit the applicant from receiving a grant or may penalize the applicant in the rating of the current application. An application for grant funds may not be denied solely upon the basis of the past performance of the eligible applicant.

(b) “Federal Empowerment Zone Program” means the empowerment zone program established in 26 U.S.C. ss. 1391 et seq. (c) “Nominated area” means an area nominated for participation in the Federal Empowerment Zone Program. (d) “Sponsoring designee” means the lead entity that applied for and received the empowerment zone designation, but does not include other entities that joined in the application. (3) LEGISLATIVE INTENT.—The Legislature recognizes that it is in the public interest that the state create economic opportunity in poverty-stricken areas and rebuild such areas by empowering the people and communities within these areas to create jobs and opportunities. The United States Congress in 1997 provided that an additional 20 areas may be designated as federal empowerment zones by January 1, 1999, and, as such, be eligible for federal funding under the Federal Empowerment Zone Program. The Legislature seeks to promote local governments in submitting the strongest possible proposals under the Federal Empowerment Zone Program by establishing a companion state empowerment zone program. (4) EMPOWERMENT ZONE PROGRAM.—There is created an economic development program to be known as the Florida Empowerment Zone Program. The program shall exist for 10 years and, except as otherwise provided by law, be operated by the Department of Commerce in conjunction with the Federal Empowerment Zone Program.

      "text": "290.053 Response to economic emergencies in small communities.— (1) The Legislature finds that attracting, retaining, and providing favorable conditions for businesses which contribute to the economic health of small communities through the generation of business and employment opportunities is in the public interest. The Legislature recognizes that conditions may exist where criteria for existing economic development programs prevent some businesses from participating and that existing criteria should be waived in order to allow businesses which are significant employers in these small communities to participate in these programs in order to improve the economic health of these communities. The Legislature further recognizes that the loss of an industry or the inability of a significant employer to open or reopen a business in a small community creates a state of economic emergency within that community. (2) A community is in a state of economic emergency when any of the following conditions occur: (a) Closure of a business which is a significant employer of workers in the community. (b) Closure of a business which significantly affects the operations of other businesses which are significant employers of workers in the community. (c) A business which would be a significant employer of workers in the community is unable to open or reopen due to a lack of economic incentives or a business environment which is not favorable to the opening or reopening of that business. (d) The community experiences substantial unemployment due to the closure of a major industry. (3) A local government entity shall notify the Governor and the Department of Commerce when one or more of the conditions specified in subsection (2) have occurred or will occur if action is not taken to assist the local governmental entity or the affected community. (4) Upon notification that one or more of the conditions described in subsection (2) exist, the Governor or his or her designee shall contact the local governmental entity to determine what actions have been taken by the local governmental entity or the affected community to resolve the economic emergency. The Governor may waive the eligibility criteria of any program or activity administered by the Department of Commerce to provide economic relief to the affected community by granting participation in such programs or activities. The Governor shall consult with the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives and shall take other action, as necessary, to resolve the economic emergency in the most expedient manner possible. All actions taken pursuant to this section shall be within current appropriations and shall have no annualized impact beyond normal growth.
