(2) On the failure of such officer, employee, or person to adjust and settle such account, or to yield up such property, funds, moneys, or other thing of value, the Chief Financial Officer shall direct the attorney for the board of county commissioners, the district school board, or the district, as the case may be, entitled to such account, property, funds, moneys, or other thing of value to represent such county or district in enforcing settlement, payment, or delivery of such account, property, funds, moneys, or other thing of value.

(3) Should the attorney for the county or district aforesaid be disqualified or unable to act, and no other attorney be furnished by the county or district, or should the Chief Financial Officer otherwise deem it advisable, such account or claim may be certified to the Department of Legal Affairs by the Chief Financial Officer, to be prosecuted by the Department of Legal Affairs at county or district expense, as the case may be, including necessary per diem and travel expense in accordance with s. 112.061, as now or hereafter amended. Such expenses, when approved by the Chief Financial Officer, shall be paid forthwith by such county or district. (4) If it appears to the Chief Financial Officer that any criminal statute of this state has or may have been violated by such defaulting officer, employee, or person, such information, evidence, documents, and other things tending to show such a violation, whether in the hands of the Chief Financial Officer, the Auditor General, the county, or the district, shall be forthwith turned over to the proper state attorney for inspection, study, and such action as may be deemed proper, or the same may be brought to the attention of the proper grand jury. (5) No such account or claim, after it has been certified to the Chief Financial Officer, may be settled for less than the amount due according to law without the written consent of the Chief Financial Officer, and any attempt to make settlement in violation of this subsection shall be deemed null and void. A county or district board desiring to make such a settlement shall incorporate the proposed settlement into a resolution, stating that the proposed settlement is contingent upon the Chief Financial Officer’s approval, and shall submit two copies of the resolution to the department. The Chief Financial Officer shall return one copy with his or her action endorsed thereon. (6) No settlement of account of any such officer, employee, or person, with the county or district, or any of their officers or agents, made in an amount or manner other than as authorized by law or for other than a lawful county or district purpose, shall be binding upon such county or district unless and until approved by the Chief Financial Officer, or unless more than 4 years shall have elapsed from the date of such settlement. (7) Nothing in this section shall supersede the continuing duty of the proper county and district officers to require any officer, employee, or person to render full accounts of and to yield up according to law to the officer or authority entitled by law to receive the same, any property, funds, moneys, or other thing of value as to which such officer, employee, or person is in anywise indebted to or accountable to such county or district. The provisions of this section provide for collections and recoveries which the proper county or district officers have failed to make, and for correction of settlements made in an amount or manner other than as authorized by law.

Direct deposit of funds shall be by any electronic or other transfer medium approved by the Chief Financial Officer for such purpose. (3) The Chief Financial Officer may contract with an authorized financial institution for the services necessary to operate the program. In order to implement the provisions of this section, the Chief Financial Officer may deposit with that financial institution the funds payable to the beneficiaries, in lump sum, by Chief Financial Officer’s warrant to make the authorized direct deposits. (4) The written authorization of a beneficiary shall be filed with the department or its designee. Such authorization shall remain in effect until withdrawn in writing by the beneficiary or dishonored by the designated financial institution. (5) All direct deposit records made prior to October 1, 1986, are exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1). With respect to direct deposit records made on or after October 1, 1986, the names of the authorized financial institutions and the account numbers of the beneficiaries are confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. Notwithstanding this exemption and the provisions of s. 119.071(5)(b), the department may provide a state university, upon request, with that university’s employee or vendor direct deposit authorization information on file with the department in order to accommodate the transition to the university accounting system. The state university shall maintain the confidentiality of all such information provided by the department. (6) To cover the department’s actual costs for processing the direct deposit of funds other than salary or retirement benefits, the department may charge the beneficiary of the direct deposit a reasonable fee. The department may collect the fee by direct receipt from the beneficiary or by subtracting the amount of the fee from the funds due the beneficiary. Such fees collected by the department shall be deposited into the Department of Financial Services Administrative Trust Fund. (7) All new recipients of retirement benefits from this state shall be paid by direct deposit of funds. A retiree may request from the department an exemption from the provisions of this subsection when such retiree can demonstrate a hardship.

The charges are evidence of indebtedness of a state attorney against whom any charge is made for the full amount of the claim, until the charges have been collected and paid into the treasury of the state or of the county or special district or the legal remedies of the state have been exhausted, or until the state attorney demonstrates to the Chief Financial Officer that the failure to collect the charges is not due to negligence and the Chief Financial Officer has made a proper entry of satisfaction of the charge against the state attorney. (2) The Chief Financial Officer may assign the collection of any claim to a collection agent or agents who are registered and in good standing pursuant to chapter 559, if the Chief Financial Officer determines the assignation to be cost-effective. The Chief Financial Officer may authorize the agent or agents to add a fee to the amount to be collected. (3) Each agency shall be responsible for exercising due diligence in securing full payment of all accounts receivable and other claims due the state. (a) No later than 120 days after the date on which the account or other claim was due and payable, unless another period is approved by the Chief Financial Officer, and after exhausting other lawful measures available to the agency, each agency shall report the delinquent accounts receivable as directed by the Chief Financial Officer to the appropriate collection agent for further action, excluding those agencies that collect delinquent accounts pursuant to independent statutory authority. (b) An agency that has delinquent accounts receivable, which the agency considers to be of a nature that assignment to a collection agency would be inappropriate, may request in writing for an exemption for those accounts. The request shall fully explain the nature of the delinquent accounts receivable and the reasons the agency believes such accounts would be precluded from being assigned to a collection agency. The Chief Financial Officer shall disapprove the request in writing unless the agency shows that a demonstrative harm to the state will occur as a result of assignment to a collection agency. (c) Agencies that have delinquent accounts receivable, which accounts are of such a nature that it would not be appropriate to transfer collection of those delinquent accounts to the Chief Financial Officer within 120 days after the date they are due and payable, may request in writing a different period of time for transfer of collection of such accounts. The request shall fully explain the nature of the delinquent accounts receivable and include a recommendation as to an appropriate period. (4) Each October 1, each agency shall submit a report to the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Chief Financial Officer which includes: (a) A detailed list and total of all accounts that were referred for collection and the status of such accounts, including the date referred, any amounts collected, and the total that remains uncollected. (b) A list and total of all delinquent accounts that were not referred to a collection agency, the reasons for not referring those accounts, and the actions taken by the agency to collect. (c) A list of all accounts or claims, including a description and the total amount of each account or claim, which were written off or waived by the agency for any reason during the prior fiscal year, the reason for being written off, and whether any of those accounts continue to be pursued by a collection agent. (5) Each December 1, the Chief Financial Officer shall provide to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives a report that details the following information for any contracted collection agent: (a) The amount of claims referred for collection by each agency, cumulatively and annually. (b) The number of accounts by age and amount. (c) A listing of those agencies that failed to report known claims to the Chief Financial Officer in a timely manner as prescribed in subsection (3). (d) The total amount of claims collected, cumulatively and annually. (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any contract providing for the location or collection of unclaimed property, the Chief Financial Officer may authorize the contractor to deduct its fees and expenses for services provided under the contract from the unclaimed property that the contractor has recovered or collected under the contract. The Chief Financial Officer shall annually report to the Governor, President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives the total amount collected or recovered by each contractor during the previous fiscal year and the total fees and expenses deducted by each contractor.

If the warrant so canceled was issued against a fund that is no longer operative, the amount of the warrant shall be credited to the General Revenue Fund. The Chief Financial Officer shall not honor any state warrant after it has been canceled. (2) The funds represented by a warrant canceled under subsection (1) are presumed abandoned by the payee or person entitled to the warrant and shall be reported and remitted as unclaimed property under s. 717.117, except that written notice to the apparent owner of the unclaimed property is not required before filing of the report. An action may not be commenced thereafter for recovery of funds represented by the warrant, except as provided by chapter 717. This subsection applies to all warrants issued on or after July 1, 1992. (3) When a warrant canceled under subsection (1) represents funds that are in whole or in part derived from federal contributions and disposition of the funds under chapter 717 would cause a loss of the federal contributions, the Governor shall certify to the Chief Financial Officer that funds represented by such warrants are for that reason exempt from treatment as unclaimed property. Obligations represented by warrants are unenforceable after 1 year from the last day of the month in which the warrant was originally issued. An action may not be commenced thereafter on the obligation unless authorized by the federal program from which the original warrant was funded and unless payment of the obligation is authorized to be made from the current federal funding. When a payee or person entitled to a warrant subject to this subsection requests payment, and payment from current federal funding is authorized by the federal program from which the original warrant was funded, the Chief Financial Officer may, upon investigation, issue a new warrant to be paid out of the proper fund in the State Treasury, provided the payee or other person executes under oath the statement required by s. 17.13 or surrenders the canceled warrant. (4) If a valid obligation of the state is due, owing, and unpaid and it becomes unenforceable for any reason because of the provisions and limitations contained in this section, the person entitled to payment on the obligation may present a claim for relief to the Legislature, provided the claim is made within the time limitations presently provided by law. (5) This section does not extend any applicable statute of limitations or revive any barred claim with respect to any state obligation outstanding and unpaid on July 1, 1995.

(c) Notwithstanding any other law except for s. 215.472, when deciding whether to invest and when investing, the Chief Financial Officer, or other party authorized to invest on his or her behalf, must make decisions based solely on pecuniary factors and may not subordinate the interests of the people of this state to other objectives, including sacrificing investment return or undertaking additional investment risk to promote any nonpecuniary factor.

(i) Corporate obligations or corporate master notes of any corporation within the United States, if the long-term obligations of such corporation are rated by at least two nationally recognized rating services in any one of the four highest classifications. However, if such obligations are rated by only one nationally recognized rating service, then the obligations shall be rated in any one of the two highest classifications. (j) Obligations of the Student Loan Marketing Association. (k) Obligations of the Resolution Funding Corporation. (l) Mortgage-backed securities of the highest credit quality. (m) Asset-backed securities rated by at least two nationally recognized rating services in any one of the three highest classifications.

(u) Convertible debt obligations of any corporation domiciled within the United States, if the convertible debt issue is rated by at least two nationally recognized rating services in any one of the four highest classifications. However, if such obligations are rated by only one nationally recognized rating service, then the obligations shall be rated in any one of the two highest classifications.

However, not more than 3 percent of the funds under the control of the Chief Financial Officer shall be invested in securities described in this paragraph. (w) Derivatives of investment instruments authorized in paragraphs (a)-(v).

However, prior to investment of such funds, the Florida Public Service Commission shall develop a plan which must be approved by the Legislature before implementation. (4) All earnings on any investments made pursuant to this section are hereby appropriated to the General Revenue Fund, except that earnings attributable to moneys made available pursuant to s. 17.61(3)(a) and (b) shall be credited pro rata to the funds from which such moneys were made available. (5) The fact that a municipal officer or a state officer, including an officer of any municipal or state agency, board, bureau, commission, institution, or department, is a stockholder or an officer or director of a bank or savings and loan association will not bar such bank or savings and loan association from being a depository of funds coming under the jurisdiction of any such municipal officer or state officer if it shall appear in the records of the municipal or state office that the governing body of such municipality or state agency has investigated and determined that such municipal or state officer is not favoring such banks or savings and loan associations over other qualified banks or savings and loan associations. (6) The Chief Financial Officer is designated the cash management officer for the state and is charged with the coordination and supervision of procedures providing for the efficient handling of financial assets under the control of the State Treasury and each of the various state agencies, and of the judicial branch, as defined in s. 216.011.
