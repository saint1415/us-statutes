Whenever the market value of the securities deposited with the department is less than 95 percent of the amount of the deposit required, the insurer shall deposit additional securities or otherwise increase the deposit to the amount required. The initial deposit for a corporation shall be in the amount of $50,000 for at least the first full year of operation. The amount of the initial deposit shall be adjusted annually thereafter on October 1 as follows: (a) Each corporation having in force $300,000 or less of gross written premiums shall deposit with the department an amount equal to $30,000. (b) Each corporation having in force more than $300,000 of gross written premiums, but less than $750,000, shall deposit with the department an amount equal to $75,000. (c) Each corporation having in force more than $750,000 of gross written premiums shall deposit with the department an amount equal to $100,000. (2) In lieu of any deposit of securities required under subsection (1) and subject to the approval of the office, a legal service insurance corporation may file with the office a surety bond issued by an authorized surety insurer. The bond shall be for the same purpose as the deposit in lieu of which it is filed. The office may not approve any bond under the terms of which the protection afforded against insolvency is not equivalent to the protection afforded by those securities provided for in subsection (1). (3) Securities or bonds deposited pursuant to this section shall be for the benefit of, and subject to, action thereon by any person sustaining an actionable injury due to the failure of the corporation to faithfully perform its obligations to its insureds in the event of insolvency or impairment of any legal expense insurance corporation. (4) The state shall be responsible for the safekeeping of all securities deposited with the department under ss. 642.011-642.049. Such securities are not, on account of being in this state, subject to taxation, but shall be held exclusively and solely to guarantee the performance by the legal expense insurance corporation of its obligations to its insureds. (5) Such deposit or bond shall be maintained unimpaired as long as the legal expense insurance corporation continues to do business in this state. Whenever the corporation ceases to do business in this state and furnishes proof satisfactory to the office that it has discharged or otherwise adequately provided for all its obligations to its insureds in this state, the office and department shall release the deposited securities to the parties entitled thereto, on presentation of the receipts of the department for such securities, or shall release the bond filed with it in lieu of such deposit. (6) The office, upon written request of the legal expense insurance corporation, may reduce the amount of deposit or bond required under subsection (1) if it finds that the policyholders and certificateholders of the corporation are adequately protected by: (a) The terms and number of existing contracts with subscribers; (b) Financial guarantees of financially sound public or private organizations or agencies; (c) Other reliable financial guarantees; or (d) Plan attorney agreements that provide for full plan benefits to subscribers without additional payments by the subscribers if the plan terminates. (7) The office may at any time enter an order modifying the amount of the deposit or bond specified under subsection (1) or subsection (2) if it finds that there has been a substantial change in the facts on which the determination was based.

(g) Policies shall contain a statement that the individual beneficiary has the right to retain, at his or her own expense, except when the policy provides otherwise, any attorney authorized to practice law in this state.

(b) Is in an unsound financial condition which would render its further transaction of business in this state hazardous or injurious to its policyholders, its certificateholders, or the public. (c) Is using such methods or practices in the conduct of its business so as to render its further transaction of business in this state hazardous or injurious to its policyholders, its certificateholders, or the public. (d) Has refused to be examined or to produce its accounts, records, or files for examination, or if any of its officers have refused to give information with respect to its affairs or have refused to perform any other legal obligation as to such examination, when required by the office. (e) Has failed to pay any final judgment rendered against it in this state within 60 days after the judgment became final. (f) Without just cause has refused to pay proper claims or perform services arising under its policies or contracts; without just cause has compelled policyholders or certificateholders to accept less than the amount due them; or has employed attorneys, or has brought suit against the association, to secure full payment or settlement of such claims. (g) Is affiliated with, and under the same general management or interlocking directorate or ownership as, another insurer which transacts business in this state without having a certificate of authority. (2) The office may, pursuant to s. 120.60, in its discretion and without advance notice or hearing thereon, immediately suspend the certificate of any insurer, whether such certificate was issued pursuant to this chapter or the insurance code, if it finds that one or more of the following circumstances exist: (a) The insurer is insolvent or impaired. (b) The deposit required by s. 642.023 is not being maintained. (c) Proceedings for receivership, conservatorship, or rehabilitation or other delinquency proceedings regarding the insurer have been commenced in any state. (d) The financial condition or business practices of the insurer otherwise pose an imminent threat to the public health, safety, or welfare of the residents of this state.

(2) With respect to any nonwillful violation, such fine shall not exceed $1,000 per violation. In no event shall such fine exceed an aggregate amount of $5,000 for all nonwillful violations arising out of the same action. When an insurer discovers a nonwillful violation, the insurer shall correct the violation and, if restitution is due, make restitution to all affected persons. Such restitution shall include interest at 12 percent per year from either the date of the violation or the date of inception of the affected person’s policy, at the insurer’s option. The restitution may be a credit against future premiums due provided that the interest on the restitution will accumulate until the premiums are due. If the amount of restitution due to any person is $50 or more and the insurer wishes to credit it against future premiums, the insurer shall notify such person that it wishes to do so but that the person may receive a check instead of a credit. If the credit is on a policy which is not renewed, the insurer shall pay the restitution to the person to whom it is due. (3) With respect to any knowing and willful violation of an order or rule of the office or commission or a provision of this chapter, the office may impose a fine upon the insurer in an amount not to exceed $5,000 for each such violation. In no event shall such fine exceed an aggregate amount of $25,000 for all knowing and willful violations arising out of the same action. In addition to such fines, such insurer shall make restitution when due in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2). (4) The failure of an insurer to make restitution when due as required under this section constitutes a willful violation of this chapter. However, if an insurer in good faith is uncertain as to whether any restitution is due or as to the amount of such restitution, it shall promptly notify the office of the circumstances, and the failure to make restitution pending a determination thereof will not constitute a violation of this chapter.
