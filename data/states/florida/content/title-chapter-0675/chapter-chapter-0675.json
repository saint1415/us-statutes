      "text": "675.102 Scope.— (1) This chapter applies to letters of credit and to certain rights and obligations arising out of transactions involving letters of credit. (2) The statement of a rule in this chapter does not by itself require, imply, or negate application of the same or a different rule to a situation not provided for, or to a person not specified, in this chapter. (3) With the exception of this subsection, subsections (1) and (4), ss. 675.103(1)(i) and (j), 675.106(4), and 675.114(4), and except to the extent prohibited in ss. 671.102(2) and 675.117(4), the effect of this chapter may be varied by agreement or by a provision stated or incorporated by reference in an undertaking. A term in an agreement or undertaking generally excusing liability or generally limiting remedies for failure to perform obligations is not sufficient to vary obligations prescribed by this chapter. (4) Rights and obligations of an issuer to a beneficiary or a nominated person under a letter of credit are independent of the existence, performance, or nonperformance of a contract or arrangement out of which the letter of credit arises or which underlies it, including contracts or arrangements between the issuer and the applicant and between the applicant and the beneficiary.

Unless the letter of credit otherwise provides, “honor” occurs: 1. Upon payment; 2. If the letter of credit provides for acceptance, upon acceptance of a draft and paying the draft at maturity; or 3. If the letter of credit provides for incurring a deferred obligation, upon incurring the obligation and performing the obligation at maturity. (i) “Issuer” means a bank or other person that issues a letter of credit, but does not include an individual who makes an engagement for personal, family, or household purposes. (j) “Letter of credit” means a definite undertaking that satisfies the requirements of s. 675.104 by an issuer to a beneficiary at the request or for the account of an applicant or, in the case of a financial institution, to itself or for its own account, to honor a documentary presentation by payment or delivery of an item of value. (k) “Nominated person” means a person whom the issuer designates or authorizes to pay, accept, negotiate, or otherwise give value under a letter of credit and undertakes by agreement or custom and practice to reimburse. (l) “Presentation” means delivery of a document to an issuer or nominated person for honor or giving of value under a letter of credit. (m) “Presenter” means a person making a presentation as or on behalf of a beneficiary or nominated person. (n) “Record” means information that is inscribed on a tangible medium or that is stored in an electronic or other medium and is retrievable in perceivable form.

A nominated person who has given value in good faith and without notice of forgery or material fraud; 2. A confirmer who has honored its confirmation in good faith; 3. A holder in due course of a draft drawn under the letter of credit which was taken after acceptance by the issuer or nominated person; or 4. An assignee of the issuer’s or nominated person’s deferred obligation that was taken for value and without notice of forgery or material fraud after the obligation was incurred by the issuer or nominated person. (b) The issuer, acting in good faith, may honor or dishonor the presentation in any other case. (2) If an applicant claims that a required document is forged or materially fraudulent or that honor of the presentation would facilitate a material fraud by the beneficiary on the issuer or applicant, a court of competent jurisdiction may temporarily or permanently enjoin the issuer from honoring a presentation or grant similar relief against the issuer or other persons only if the court finds that: (a) The relief is not prohibited under the law applicable to an accepted draft or deferred obligation incurred by the issuer; (b) A beneficiary, issuer, or nominated person who may be adversely affected is adequately protected against loss that it may suffer because the relief is granted; (c) All of the conditions to entitle a person to the relief under the laws of this state have been met; and (d) On the basis of the information submitted to the court, the applicant is more likely than not to succeed under its claim of forgery or material fraud and the person demanding honor does not qualify for protection under paragraph (1)(a).

If the issuer’s obligation under the letter of credit is not for the payment of money, the claimant may obtain specific performance or, at the claimant’s election, recover an amount equal to the value of performance from the issuer. In either case, the claimant may also recover incidental but not consequential damages. The claimant is not obligated to take action to avoid damages that might be due from the issuer under this subsection. If, although not obligated to do so, the claimant avoids damages, the claimant’s recovery from the issuer must be reduced by the amount of damages avoided. The issuer has the burden of proving the amount of damages avoided. In the case of repudiation the claimant need not present any document. (2) If an issuer wrongfully dishonors a draft or demand presented under a letter of credit or honors a draft or demand in breach of its obligation to the applicant, the applicant may recover damages resulting from the breach, including incidental but not consequential damages, less any amount saved as a result of the breach. (3) If an adviser or nominated person other than a confirmer breaches an obligation under this chapter or an issuer breaches an obligation not covered in subsection (1) or subsection (2), a person to whom the obligation is owed may recover damages resulting from the breach, including incidental but not consequential damages, less any amount saved as a result of the breach. To the extent of the confirmation, a confirmer has the liability of an issuer specified in this subsection and subsections (1) and (2). (4) An issuer, nominated person, or adviser who is found liable under subsection (1), subsection (2), or subsection (3) shall pay interest on the amount owed thereunder from the date of wrongful dishonor or other appropriate date. (5) Reasonable attorney’s fees and other expenses of litigation must be awarded to the prevailing party in an action in which a remedy is sought under this chapter. (6) Damages that would otherwise be payable by a party for breach of an obligation under this chapter may be liquidated by agreement or undertaking, but only in an amount or by a formula that is reasonable in light of the harm anticipated.

(3) An issuer is not obliged to determine whether a purported successor is a successor of a beneficiary or whether the signature of a purported successor is genuine or authorized. (4) Honor of a purported successor’s apparently complying presentation under subsection (1) or subsection (2) has the consequences specified in s. 675.108(9) even if the purported successor is not the successor of a beneficiary.

      "text": "675.114 Assignment of proceeds.— (1) For purposes of this section, the term “proceeds of a letter of credit” means the cash, check, accepted draft, or other item of value paid or delivered upon honor or giving of value by the issuer or any nominated person under the letter of credit. The term does not include a beneficiary’s drawing rights or documents presented by the beneficiary. (2) A beneficiary may assign its right to part or all of the proceeds of a letter of credit. The beneficiary may do so before presentation as a present assignment of its right to receive proceeds contingent upon its compliance with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit. (3) An issuer or nominated person need not recognize an assignment of proceeds of a letter of credit until it consents to the assignment. (4) An issuer or nominated person has no obligation to give or withhold its consent to an assignment of proceeds of a letter of credit, but consent may not be unreasonably withheld if the assignee possesses and exhibits the letter of credit and presentation of the letter of credit is a condition to honor. (5) Rights of a transferee beneficiary or nominated person are independent of the beneficiary’s assignment of the proceeds of a letter of credit and are superior to the assignee’s right to the proceeds. (6) Neither the rights recognized by this section between an assignee and an issuer, transferee beneficiary, or nominated person nor the issuer’s or nominated person’s payment of proceeds to an assignee or a third person affect the rights between the assignee and any person other than the issuer, transferee beneficiary, or nominated person. The mode of creating and perfecting a security interest in or granting an assignment of a beneficiary’s rights to proceeds is governed by chapter 679 or other law.

The jurisdiction whose law is chosen need not bear any relation to the transaction.

If more than one address is indicated, the person is considered to be located at the address from which the person’s undertaking was issued. (a) For the purpose of jurisdiction, choice of law, and recognition of interbranch letters of credit, but not enforcement of a judgment, all branches of a bank are considered separate juridical entities and a bank is considered to be located at the place where its relevant branch is considered to be located under paragraph (b). (b) A bank branch is considered to be located at the address indicated in the branch’s undertaking. If more than one address is indicated, the branch is considered to be located at the address from which the undertaking was issued. (c) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser is governed by any rules of custom or practice, such as the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, to which the letter of credit, confirmation, or other undertaking is expressly made subject. If this chapter governs the liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser under subsection (1) or this subsection, the relevant undertaking incorporates rules of custom or practice, and there is conflict between this chapter and such rules as applied to that undertaking, such rules govern except to the extent of any conflict with the nonvariable provisions specified in s. 675.102(3). (3) This chapter governs to the extent of any conflict between this chapter and chapter 670, chapter 673, chapter 674, or chapter 679.

If the issuer’s obligation under the letter of credit is not for the payment of money, the claimant may obtain specific performance or, at the claimant’s election, recover an amount equal to the value of performance from the issuer. In either case, the claimant may also recover incidental but not consequential damages. The claimant is not obligated to take action to avoid damages that might be due from the issuer under this subsection. If, although not obligated to do so, the claimant avoids damages, the claimant’s recovery from the issuer must be reduced by the amount of damages avoided. The issuer has the burden of proving the amount of damages avoided. In the case of repudiation the claimant need not present any document. (2) If an issuer wrongfully dishonors a draft or demand presented under a letter of credit or honors a draft or demand in breach of its obligation to the applicant, the applicant may recover damages resulting from the breach, including incidental but not consequential damages, less any amount saved as a result of the breach. (3) If an adviser or nominated person other than a confirmer breaches an obligation under this chapter or an issuer breaches an obligation not covered in subsection (1) or subsection (2), a person to whom the obligation is owed may recover damages resulting from the breach, including incidental but not consequential damages, less any amount saved as a result of the breach. To the extent of the confirmation, a confirmer has the liability of an issuer specified in this subsection and subsections (1) and (2). (4) An issuer, nominated person, or adviser who is found liable under subsection (1), subsection (2), or subsection (3) shall pay interest on the amount owed thereunder from the date of wrongful dishonor or other appropriate date. (5) Reasonable attorney’s fees and other expenses of litigation must be awarded to the prevailing party in an action in which a remedy is sought under this chapter. (6) Damages that would otherwise be payable by a party for breach of an obligation under this chapter may be liquidated by agreement or undertaking, but only in an amount or by a formula that is reasonable in light of the harm anticipated.
