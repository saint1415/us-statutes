      "text": "349.04 Purposes and powers.— (1)(a) The authority created and established by the provisions of this chapter is hereby granted and shall have the right to acquire, hold, construct, improve, maintain, operate, own, and lease in the capacity of lessor the Jacksonville Expressway System (hereinafter referred to as “system”), heretofore partially constructed or acquired by the Florida State Improvement Commission in the Jacksonville, Duval County, metropolitan area, as more specifically described in the proceedings of the commission which authorized the issuance of $28 million in bonds of the commission for such purpose, and as hereafter completed or improved or extended as authorized by this chapter, and all appurtenant facilities, including all approaches, streets, roads, bicycle paths, bridges, and avenues of access for the Jacksonville Expressway System, and to construct or acquire extensions, additions, and improvements to the system and to complete the construction and acquisition of the system. (b) The authority may, in addition, acquire, hold, construct, improve, operate, maintain, and lease in the capacity of lessor a mass transit system employing motor cars or buses; street railway systems beneath the surface, on the surface, or above the surface; or any other means determined useful to the rapid transfer of large numbers of people among the locations of residence, commerce, industry, and education in Duval County. (c) The authority may further plan, coordinate, and recommend to appropriate officers and agencies of federal, state, and local governments methods and facilities for the parking of vehicles, the movement of pedestrians, and vehicular traffic (including bicycles), public and private, in Duval County to accomplish a coordinated transportation system for the greater Jacksonville area. The authority may construct and operate passenger terminals for the parking of automobiles and movement by public conveyance of persons and construct and operate all other facilities necessary to a complete and coordinated transportation system in the Jacksonville area. (d) It is the express intention of this chapter that the authority, in completing the construction of the Jacksonville Expressway System, is not limited to the description thereof contained in the proceedings of the commission which authorized the issuance of $28 million in bonds to finance part of the cost thereof, but it is authorized to finance and construct any additional extensions, additions, or improvements to the system, or appurtenant facilities, including all necessary approaches, roads, bicycle ways, bridges, and avenues of access, with such changes, modifications, or revisions of the project as are deemed desirable and proper. It is the intent of this chapter, and to effect its purposes the Legislature determines, that bonds issued under this chapter be deemed to be state capital improvement bonds to finance or refinance the cost of state capital projects pursuant to s. 11(d), Art. VII of the State Constitution. However, the provisions of s. 316.091(2), relating to bicycles, do not apply to this system. (e) In addition to the other powers set forth in this chapter, the authority has the right to plan, develop, finance, construct, own, lease, purchase, operate, maintain, relocate, equip, repair, and manage those public transportation projects, such as express bus services; bus rapid transit services; light rail, commuter rail, heavy rail, or other transit services; ferry services; transit stations; park-and-ride lots; transit-oriented development nodes; or feeder roads, reliever roads, connector roads, bypasses, or appurtenant facilities, that are intended to address critical transportation needs or concerns in the Jacksonville, Duval County, metropolitan area. These projects may also include all necessary approaches, roads, bridges, and avenues of access that are desirable and proper with the concurrence of the department, as applicable, if the project is to be part of the State Highway System. (f) The authority, in addition to the other powers and duties provided, shall have the power and responsibility to formulate and implement a plan for a mass transit system that will serve Duval County and the greater Jacksonville area. (2) The authority is hereby granted, and shall have and may exercise all powers necessary, appurtenant, convenient, or incidental to the carrying out of the aforesaid purposes, including, but without being limited to, the right and power: (a) To sue and be sued, implead and be impleaded, and complain and defend in all courts. (b) To adopt, use, and alter at will a corporate seal. (c) To acquire, purchase, construct, hold, lease as lessee or lessor, and use any franchise or any property, real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible, or any interest therein, necessary or desirable for carrying out the purposes of the authority and to sell, lease as lessor, transfer, and dispose of any property or interest therein at any time acquired by it, including, without limitation, land, buildings, and other facilities located within or comprising transit-oriented developments which enhance the use or utility of transportation facilities owned or constructed by the authority and administrative and other buildings for the use of the authority in carrying out its powers and obligations granted in this chapter. (d) To enter into and make leases for terms not exceeding 99 years, as either lessee or lessor, in order to carry out the right to lease as set forth in this chapter. (e) To fix, alter, charge, establish, and collect rates, fees, rentals, and other charges for the services and facilities of the Jacksonville Expressway System and any other transportation facilities of the authority, which rates, fees, rentals, and other charges shall always be sufficient to comply with any covenants made with the holders of any bonds issued pursuant to this chapter; this right and power may be assigned or delegated by the authority to the department. (f)1. To borrow money and make and issue negotiable notes, bonds, refunding bonds, and other evidences of indebtedness or obligations, either in temporary or definitive form (hereinafter in this chapter sometimes called “bonds”), of the authority, for the purpose of funding or refunding, at or prior to maturity, any bonds theretofore issued by the authority, or by the Florida State Improvement Commission to finance part of the cost of the Jacksonville Expressway System, and purposes related thereto, and for the purpose of financing or refinancing all or part of the costs of completion, improvement, or extension of the Jacksonville Expressway System, and appurtenant facilities, including all approaches, streets, roads, bridges, and avenues of access for the Jacksonville Expressway System and for any other purpose authorized by this chapter, such bonds to mature in not exceeding 40 years from the date of the issuance thereof; to secure the payment of such bonds or any part thereof by a pledge of any or all of its revenues, rates, fees, rentals, or other charges, including all or any portion of the Duval County gasoline tax funds received by the authority; and in general to provide for the security of such bonds and the rights and remedies of the holders thereof. 2. In the event that the authority determines to fund or refund any bonds theretofore issued by the authority, or by the commission as aforesaid, prior to the maturity thereof, the proceeds of such funding or refunding bonds shall, pending the prior redemption of the bonds to be funded or refunded, be invested in direct obligations of the United States; and it is the express intention of this chapter that such outstanding bonds may be funded or refunded by the issuance of bonds pursuant to this chapter notwithstanding that part of such outstanding bonds will not mature or become redeemable until 6 years after the date of issuance of bonds pursuant to this chapter to fund or refund such outstanding bonds. (g) To make contracts of every name and nature and to execute all instruments necessary or convenient for the carrying on of its business.

(l) To invest and to borrow money and make and issue negotiable notes, bonds, refunding bonds, and other evidences of indebtedness or obligations, either in temporary or definitive form, of the authority for the purpose of financing or refinancing all or a part of the cost of the acquisition or improvement of transportation facilities and for any other purposes authorized by this chapter, such bonds to mature in not exceeding 40 years from the date of the issuance thereof; to secure the payment of such bonds or any part thereof by a pledge of any or all of its revenues, rates, fees, rentals, or other charges, including, without limitation, all or any portion of local option taxes or county gasoline tax funds received by the authority; and in general to provide for the security of such bonds and the rights and remedies of the holders thereof. (m) To adopt rules to carry out the powers and obligations herein granted, which set forth a purpose, necessary definitions, forms, general conditions and procedures, and fines and penalties, including, without limitation, suspension or debarment, and charges for nonperformance, with respect to any aspect of the work or function of the authority for the permitting, planning, funding, design, acquisition, construction, equipping, operation, and maintenance of transportation facilities, transit and highway, within the state, provided or operated by the authority or others in cooperation with or at the direction of the authority, and for carrying out all other purposes of the authority set forth or authorized in this chapter. (n) To establish and fund reserve accounts with respect to its operations and functions, make withdrawals therefrom, and replenish such accounts, as the governing body may reasonably determine. (o) To adopt and approve an annual budget, and to utilize purchasing schedules and master purchasing contracts of the state, any municipality, or any federal agency, to the extent permitted by law.

(t) To create and operate an employees’ benefit fund for employees of the authority or public benefit corporations controlled by it. The proceeds of vending machines located on the premises of the authority or such corporations shall be paid into the fund and used for such benefits and purposes as the authority may determine. (3) The authority shall have no power at any time or in any manner to pledge the credit or taxing power of the state or any political subdivision or agency thereof; nor shall any of the obligations of the authority be deemed to be obligations of the state or of any political subdivision or agency thereof; nor shall the state or any political subdivision or agency thereof, except the authority, be liable for the payment of the principal of, or interest on, such obligations. However, this provision is not applicable to the type or manner of financing authorized by s. 9(c)(5), Art. XII of the State Constitution, as amended, and laws enacted pursuant thereto. (4) By a resolution of its governing body, the authority may expand its service area and enter into a partnership with any county that is contiguous to the then-current service area of the authority.

The authority shall also have the power to condemn any material and property necessary for such purposes. Property already devoted to a public use may be acquired in like manner, provided that no real property belonging to the state or any political subdivision thereof may be acquired without the state’s or affected political subdivision’s consent. The right of eminent domain conferred in this section shall be exercised by the authority in the manner provided by law. Notwithstanding that the authority is an agency of the state, the authority shall not exercise its powers of condemnation granted in this section with respect to any property or property rights of any county or municipality, including, without limitation, the City of Jacksonville. (2) The authority may acquire such rights, title, interest, or easements in such lands as it may deem necessary for any of the purposes of this chapter. (3) In connection with the acquisition of property or property rights as herein provided, the authority may in its discretion acquire an entire lot, block, or tract of land, if by so doing the interests of the public will be best served, even though said entire lot, block, or tract is not immediately needed for the right-of-way proper. (4) When the authority acquires property for a transportation facility or in a transportation corridor, it is not subject to any liability imposed by chapter 376 or chapter 403 for preexisting soil or groundwater contamination due solely to its ownership. This section does not affect the rights or liabilities of any past or future owners of the acquired property, nor does it affect the liability of any governmental entity for the results of its actions that create or exacerbate a pollution source. The authority and the Department of Environmental Protection may enter into interagency agreements for the performance, funding, and reimbursement for the costs of the investigative and remedial acts necessary for property acquired by the authority.

Before approval, the authority must determine that a proposed project: (a) Is in the public’s best interest. (b) Would not require state funds to be used unless the project is on or provides increased mobility on the State Highway System. (c) Would have adequate safeguards to ensure that additional costs or unreasonable service disruptions would not be realized by the traveling public and citizens of the state in the event of default or cancellation of the agreement by the authority. (2) The authority shall ensure that all reasonable costs to the state related to transportation facilities that are not part of the State Highway System are borne by the private entity that develops or operates the facilities. The authority shall also ensure that all reasonable costs to the state and substantially affected local governments and utilities related to the private transportation facility are borne by the private entity for transportation facilities that are owned by private entities. For projects on the State Highway System or that provide increased mobility on the State Highway System, the department may use state resources to participate in funding and financing the project as provided for under the department’s enabling legislation. (3) The authority may request proposals and receive unsolicited proposals for public-private transportation projects and, upon receipt of any unsolicited proposal or determination to issue a request for proposals, must publish a notice in the Florida Administrative Register and a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the proposed project is located at least once a week for 2 weeks requesting proposals or, if an unsolicited proposal was received, stating that it has received the proposal and will accept, for 60 days after the initial date of publication, other proposals for the same project purpose. A copy of the notice must be mailed to each local government in the affected areas. After the public notification period has expired, the authority shall rank the proposals in order of preference. In ranking the proposals, the authority shall consider professional qualifications, general business terms, innovative engineering or cost-reduction terms, finance plans, and the need for state funds to deliver the proposal. If the authority is not satisfied with the results of the negotiations, it may, at its sole discretion, terminate negotiations with the proposer. If these negotiations are unsuccessful, the authority may go to the second and lower-ranked firms, in order, using the same procedure. If only one proposal is received, the authority may negotiate in good faith and, if it is not satisfied with the results, may, at its sole discretion, terminate negotiations with the proposer. Notwithstanding this subsection, the authority may, at its discretion, reject all proposals at any point in the process up to completion of a contract with the proposer. Any person submitting an unsolicited proposal shall submit with the proposal the sum of $25,000 to the authority to be applied by the authority to its costs of review and analysis of the proposal, and such person shall remain liable for any additional costs and expenses of the authority incurred for the review and analysis. (4) Agreements entered into pursuant to this section may authorize the authority or the private project owner, lessee, or operator to impose, collect, and enforce tolls or fares for the use of the transportation facility. However, the amount and use of toll or fare revenues shall be regulated by the authority to avoid unreasonable costs to users of the facility. (5) Each public-private transportation facility constructed pursuant to this section shall comply with all requirements of federal, state, and local laws; state, regional, and local comprehensive plans; the authority’s rules, policies, procedures, and standards for transportation facilities; and any other conditions that the authority determines to be in the public’s best interest. (6) The authority may exercise any of its powers, including eminent domain, to facilitate the development and construction of transportation projects pursuant to this section. The authority may pay all or part of the cost of operating and maintaining the facility or may provide services to the private entity, for which services it shall receive full or partial reimbursement. (7) Except as provided in this section, this section is not intended to amend existing law by granting additional powers to or imposing further restrictions on the governmental entities with regard to regulating and entering into cooperative arrangements with the private sector for the planning, construction, and operation of transportation facilities.
