I of the State Constitution and shall only be available pursuant to specific written consent of the enrollee, or as otherwise provided by law. With respect to any information pertaining to the diagnosis, treatment, or health of any enrollee or applicant, a prepaid limited health service organization is entitled to claim any statutory privileges against disclosure which the provider who furnished such information to the prepaid limited health service organization is entitled to claim. (2) Any proprietary financial information contained in contracts entered into with providers by prepaid limited health service organizations is confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art.

For purposes of this subsection, an investigation is considered “active” while such investigation is being conducted by the department or office with a reasonable, good faith belief that it may lead to the filing of administrative, civil, or criminal proceedings. An investigation does not cease to be active if the department or office is proceeding with reasonable dispatch and there is a good faith belief that action may be initiated by the department or office or other administrative or law enforcement agency.
