The term also includes a member of the victim’s or witness’s immediate family. (b) “Serious felony offense” means one of the following offenses, including an attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy to commit one of the following offenses: murder, manslaughter, sexual battery, aggravated stalking, aggravated battery, carjacking, home invasion robbery, burglary, arson, robbery, kidnapping, racketeering, or trafficking in a controlled substance. (2) A law enforcement agency is hereby authorized to provide protective services, including temporary relocation services, to a victim or witness at risk of harm. Protective and temporary relocation services, as deemed appropriate, shall be provided pursuant to the provisions of this section. (3)(a) The statewide prosecutor, any state attorney, or any law enforcement officer may identify a victim or witness as a victim or witness at risk of harm. Upon such identification, the statewide prosecutor, the state attorney, or the law enforcement officer must notify either the statewide prosecutor or the state attorney who has jurisdiction over the criminal investigation or prosecution, if necessary. (b) The statewide prosecutor or the state attorney, as appropriate, may determine whether an identified victim or witness at risk of harm is critical to a criminal investigation or prosecution. If the victim or witness at risk of harm is deemed critical, the statewide prosecutor or the state attorney may: 1. Certify that the victim or witness receive protective services; or 2. If the statewide prosecutor or the state attorney finds a compelling need to temporarily relocate the victim or witness, certify that the victim or witness receive protective services, including temporary relocation services. (4)(a) When a victim or witness is certified as provided in subsection (3), a law enforcement agency, in consultation with the certifying state attorney or the statewide prosecutor, may provide appropriate protective services. If a victim or witness needs to be temporarily relocated, the statewide prosecutor or the state attorney must notify the Department of Law Enforcement. The Department of Law Enforcement, in consultation with the statewide prosecutor or the state attorney, and any other law enforcement agency involved in the criminal investigation or prosecution, shall coordinate the temporary relocation of the victim or witness. (b) Protective services, including temporary relocation services, may initially be provided for up to 1 year or until the risk giving rise to the certification has diminished, whichever occurs sooner. The statewide prosecutor or the state attorney may, at the end of the certification year, recertify a victim or witness at risk of harm for an additional period of up to 1 year or until the risk giving rise to the certification has diminished, whichever occurs first. A victim or witness at risk of harm may be certified and recertified annually as provided in this section to provide a maximum of 4 years of eligibility for protective services. (5) This section does not prevent any law enforcement agency from providing protective services at the agency’s expense beyond the 4-year maximum period established in this section. Any such additional expenditures for protective services are not eligible for the reimbursement provided in this section. (6) The statewide prosecutor, any state attorney, or any law enforcement officer, acting in good faith in determining eligibility for victim and witness protective services, including temporary relocation services, or in providing such services, is immune from civil liability.

(2) If a victim or witness is identified for protective services under s. 914.25 and is later denied certification, the identity and location information exempt pursuant to paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) becomes public information, unless otherwise provided by law. (3) If a victim or witness is certified for protective services, information made confidential and exempt from public disclosure under paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) becomes public information, unless otherwise provided by law, at the time such certification expires, unless the state attorney or statewide prosecutor making such certification complies with the provisions of subsection (4). (4) The certifying state attorney or statewide prosecutor may state in writing that even though certification for participation in the victim or witness protective services program is about to expire, disclosure of information made confidential and exempt by paragraph (1)(a) or paragraph (1)(b) continues to constitute an unwarranted risk to, or jeopardizes the safety of, victims, witnesses, or family members of such victims or witnesses. The confidential and exempt status of such information shall continue until the certifying state attorney or statewide prosecutor determines that disclosure of such information would not constitute an unwarranted risk to, or jeopardize the safety of, such persons. (5) For the purposes of effectively implementing s. 914.25, any state or local law enforcement agency, state attorney, or the statewide prosecutor may provide written notification to an agency as defined in s. 119.011 or to a business entity operating under contract with, licensed by, or having any other business relationship with an agency, or providing services pursuant to s. 914.25, that information described in subsection (1) held by that agency or business is confidential and exempt from public disclosure. The state or local law enforcement agency, state attorney, or the statewide prosecutor providing such written notification shall also provide written notification to the agency or business as to when, in accordance with this section, identity and location information exempted pursuant to paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) can be made publicly available.

Make a controlled buy or controlled sale of contraband, controlled substances, or other items that are material to a criminal investigation; b. Supply regular or constant information about suspected or actual criminal activities to a law enforcement agency; or c. Otherwise provide information important to ongoing criminal intelligence gathering or criminal investigative efforts.

(3) A law enforcement agency that uses confidential informants shall: (a) Inform each person who is requested to serve as a confidential informant that the agency cannot promise inducements such as a grant of immunity, dropped or reduced charges, or reduced sentences or placement on probation in exchange for serving as a confidential informant. (b) Inform each person who is requested to serve as a confidential informant that the value of his or her assistance as a confidential informant and any effect that assistance may have on pending criminal matters can be determined only by the appropriate legal authority. (c) Provide a person who is requested to serve as a confidential informant with an opportunity to consult with legal counsel upon request before the person agrees to perform any activities as a confidential informant. However, this section does not create a right to publicly funded legal counsel.
