(8) PUBLIC SAFETY EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS FEE.— (a) Each voice communications services provider shall collect the fee described in this subsection, except that the fee for prepaid wireless service shall be collected in the manner set forth in subsection (9). Each provider, as part of its monthly billing process, shall bill the fee as follows. The fee may not be assessed on any pay telephone in the state. 1. Each voice communications service provider other than a wireless provider shall bill the fee to a subscriber based on the number of access lines having access to the 911 system, on a service-identifier basis, up to a maximum of 25 access lines per account bill rendered. 2. Each voice communications service provider other than a wireless provider shall bill the fee to a subscriber on a basis of five service-identified access lines for each digital transmission link, including primary rate interface service or equivalent Digital-Signal-1-level service, which can be channelized and split into 23 or 24 voice-grade or data-grade channels for communications, up to a maximum of 25 access lines per account bill rendered. 3. Except in the case of prepaid wireless service, each wireless provider shall bill the fee to a subscriber on a per-service-identifier basis for service identifiers whose primary place of use is within this state. The fee may not be assessed on or collected from a provider with respect to an end user’s service if that end user’s service is a prepaid wireless service sold before January 1, 2015. 4. Except in the case of prepaid wireless service, each voice communications services provider not addressed under subparagraphs 1., 2., and 3. shall bill the fee on a per-service-identifier basis for service identifiers whose primary place of use is within the state up to a maximum of 25 service identifiers for each account bill rendered. The provider may list the fee as a separate entry on each bill, in which case the fee must be identified as a fee for 911 services. A provider shall remit the fee to the board only if the fee is paid by the subscriber. If a provider receives a partial payment for a monthly bill from a subscriber, the amount received shall first be applied to the payment due the provider for providing voice communications service. (b) A provider is not obligated to take any legal action to enforce collection of the fees for which any subscriber is billed. A county subscribing to 911 service remains liable to the provider delivering the 911 service or equipment for any 911 service, equipment, operation, or maintenance charge owed by the county to the provider. (c) For purposes of this subsection, the state and local governments are not subscribers. (d) Each provider may retain 1 percent of the amount of the fees collected as reimbursement for the administrative costs incurred by the provider to bill, collect, and remit the fee. The remainder shall be delivered to the board and deposited by the board into the fund. The board shall distribute the remainder pursuant to s. 365.173. (e) Voice communications services providers billing the fee to subscribers shall deliver revenues from the fee to the board within 60 days after the end of the month in which the fee was billed, together with a monthly report of the number of service identifiers in each county. Each wireless provider and other applicable provider identified in subparagraph (a)4. shall report the number of service identifiers for subscribers whose place of primary use is in each county. All provider subscriber information provided to the board is subject to s. 365.174. If a provider chooses to remit any fee amounts to the board before they are paid by the subscribers, a provider may apply to the board for a refund of, or may take a credit for, any such fees remitted to the board which are not collected by the provider within 6 months following the month in which the fees are charged off for federal income tax purposes as bad debt. (f) The rate of the fee may not exceed 50 cents per month for each service identifier. Effective January 1, 2015, the fee shall be 40 cents per month for each service identifier. The fee shall apply uniformly and be imposed throughout the state. (g) The board may adjust the allocation percentages for distribution of the fund as provided in s. 365.173. Any adjustment in the rate must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the total number of board members. When setting the percentages or contemplating any adjustments to the fee, the board shall consider the following: 1. The appropriate level of funding needed to fund the rural grant program provided for in s. 365.173(2)(f); and 2. The need to fund statewide, regional, and county grants in accordance with sub-subparagraph (6)(a)3.b. and s. 365.173(2)(g). (h) The board may adjust the allocation percentages or adjust the amount of the fee as provided in paragraph (g) if necessary to ensure full cost recovery or prevent over recovery of costs incurred in the provision of 911 service, including costs incurred or projected to be incurred. Any new allocation percentages or reduced or increased fee may not be adjusted for 1 year. In no event shall the fee exceed 50 cents per month for each service identifier. The fee, and any board adjustment of the fee, shall be uniform throughout the state. No less than 90 days before the effective date of any adjustment to the fee, the board shall provide written notice of the adjusted fee amount and effective date to each voice communications services provider from which the board is then receiving the fee. (i) It is the intent of the Legislature that all revenue from the fee be used as specified in s. 365.173(2)(a)-(h). (j) State and local taxes do not apply to the fee. The amount of the fee collected by a provider may not be included in the base for imposition of any tax, fee, surcharge, or other charge imposed by this state, any political subdivision of this state, or any intergovernmental agency. (k) A local government may not levy the fee or any additional fee on providers or subscribers for the provision of 911 service. (l) For purposes of this section, the definitions contained in s. 202.11 and the provisions of s. 202.155 apply in the same manner and to the same extent as the definitions and provisions apply to the taxes levied under chapter 202 on mobile communications services. (9) PREPAID WIRELESS PUBLIC SAFETY EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS FEE.— (a) Effective January 1, 2015, a prepaid wireless fee is imposed per retail transaction at the rate established in paragraph (8)(f). In order to allow sellers of all sizes and technological capabilities adequate time to comply with this subsection, a seller of prepaid wireless service operating in this state before the prepaid wireless fee is imposed shall retain 100 percent of the fee collected under this paragraph for the first 2 months to offset the cost of setup. (b) Effective March 1, 2015, the prepaid wireless fee imposed under paragraph (a) shall be subject to remittance in accordance with paragraph (g). In no event shall the fee exceed 50 cents for each retail transaction. At least 90 days before the effective date of any adjustment to the fee under paragraph (8)(g), the Department of Revenue shall provide written notice of the adjusted fee amount and its effective date to each seller from which the department is then receiving the fee. At least 120 days before the effective date of any adjustment to the fee imposed under this subsection, the board shall provide notice to the Department of Revenue of the adjusted fee amount and effective date of the adjustment. (c) The prepaid wireless fee shall be collected by the seller from the consumer with respect to each retail transaction occurring in this state. The amount of the prepaid wireless fee shall be separately stated on an invoice, receipt, or other similar document that is provided to the consumer by the seller or otherwise disclosed to the consumer. (d) For purposes of paragraph (c), a retail transaction that takes place in person by a consumer at a business location of the seller shall be treated as occurring in this state if that business location is in this state. Such transaction is deemed to have occurred in the county of the business location. When a retail transaction does not take place at the seller’s business location, the transaction shall be treated as taking place at the consumer’s shipping address or, if no item is shipped, at the consumer’s address or the location associated with the consumer’s mobile telephone number. Such transaction is deemed to have occurred in the county of the consumer’s shipping address when items are shipped to the consumer or, when no items are shipped, the county of the consumer’s address or the location associated with the consumer’s mobile telephone number. A transaction for which the specific Florida county cannot be determined shall be treated as nonspecific. (e) If a prepaid wireless device is sold for a single, nonitemized price with a prepaid wireless service of 10 minutes or less or $5 or less, the seller may elect not to apply the prepaid wireless fee to the transaction. (f) The amount of the prepaid wireless fee that is collected by a seller from a consumer and that is separately stated on an invoice, receipt, or similar document provided to the consumer by the seller, may not be included in the base for imposition of any tax, fee, surcharge, or other charge that is imposed by this state, any political subdivision of this state, or any intergovernmental agency. (g) Beginning April 1, 2015, each seller shall file a return and remit the prepaid wireless fees collected in the previous month to the Department of Revenue on or before the 20th day of the month. If the 20th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, payments accompanied by returns are due on the next succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday observed by federal or state agencies as defined in chapter 683 and s. 7503 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. A seller may remit the prepaid wireless fee by electronic funds transfer and file a fee return with the Department of Revenue that is initiated through an electronic data interchange. 1. When a seller is authorized by the Department of Revenue pursuant to s. 212.11(1)(c) or (d) to file a sales and use tax return on a quarterly, semiannual, or annual reporting basis, the seller may file a return and remit the prepaid wireless fees on or before the 20th day of the month following the authorized reporting period for sales and use tax. 2. A seller collecting less than $50 per month of prepaid wireless fees may file a quarterly return for the calendar quarters ending in March, June, September, and December. The seller must file a return and remit the prepaid wireless fees collected during each calendar quarter on or before the 20th day of the month following that calendar quarter. 3. A seller must provide the following information on each prepaid wireless fee return filed with the Department of Revenue: a. The seller’s name, federal identification number, taxpayer identification number issued by the Department of Revenue, business location address and mailing address, and county of the business location in accordance with paragraph (d); b. The reporting period; c. The number of prepaid wireless services sold during the reporting period; d. The amount of prepaid wireless fees collected and the amount of any adjustments to the fees collected; e. The amount of any retailer collection allowance deducted from the amount of prepaid wireless fees collected; and f. The amount to be remitted to the Department of Revenue. 4. A seller who operates two or more business locations for which returns are required to be filed with the Department of Revenue may file a consolidated return reporting and remitting the prepaid wireless fee for all business locations. Such sellers must report the prepaid wireless fees collected in each county, in accordance with paragraph (d), on a reporting schedule filed with the fee return. 5. A return is not required for a reporting period when no prepaid wireless fee is to be remitted for that period. 6. Except as provided in this section, the Department of Revenue shall administer, collect, and enforce the fee under this subsection pursuant to the same procedures used in the administration, collection, and enforcement of the general state sales tax imposed under chapter 212. The provisions of chapter 212 regarding authority to audit and make assessments, keeping of books and records, and interest and penalties on delinquent fees shall apply. The provisions of estimated tax liability in s. 212.11(1)(a) do not apply to the prepaid wireless fee. (h) A seller of prepaid wireless services in this state must register with the Department of Revenue for each place of business as required by s. 212.18(3) and the Department of Revenue’s administrative rule regarding registration as a sales and use tax dealer. A separate application is required for each place of business. A valid certificate of registration issued by the Department of Revenue to a seller for sales and use tax purposes is sufficient for purposes of the registration requirement of this subsection. There is no fee for registration for remittance of the prepaid wireless fee. (i) The Department of Revenue shall deposit the funds remitted under this subsection into the Audit and Warrant Clearing Trust Fund established in s. 215.199 and retain up to 3.2 percent of the funds remitted under this subsection to reimburse its direct costs of administering the collection and remittance of prepaid wireless fees. Thereafter, the Department of Revenue shall transfer all remaining funds remitted under this subsection to the Emergency Communications Trust Fund monthly for use as provided in s. 365.173. (j) Beginning March 1, 2015, a seller may retain 5 percent of the prepaid wireless fees that are collected by the seller from consumers as a retailer collection allowance. (k) A provider or seller of prepaid wireless service is not liable for damages to any person resulting from or incurred in connection with providing or failing to provide emergency communications and 911 service or for identifying or failing to identify the telephone number, address, location, or name associated with any person or device that is accessing or attempting to access emergency communications and 911 service. (l) A provider or seller of prepaid wireless service is not liable for damages to any person resulting from or incurred in connection with providing any lawful assistance to any investigative or law enforcement officer of the United States, any state, or any political subdivision of any state in connection with any lawful investigation or other law enforcement activity by such law enforcement officer. (m) The limitations of liability under this subsection for providers and sellers are in addition to any other limitation of liability provided for under this section. (n) A local government may not levy the fee or any additional fee on providers or sellers of prepaid wireless service for the provision of 911 service. (o) For purposes of this section, the state and local governments are not consumers. (p) For purposes of this subsection, the term: 1. “Consumer” means a person who purchases prepaid wireless service in a retail sale. 2. “Prepaid wireless fee” means the fee that is required to be collected by a seller from a consumer as provided in this subsection. 3. “Provider” means a person that provides prepaid wireless service pursuant to a license issued by the Federal Communications Commission. 4. “Retail transaction” means the purchase by a consumer from a seller of prepaid wireless service that may be applied to a single service identifier for use by the consumer. If a consumer makes a purchase of multiple prepaid wireless services in a single transaction, each individual prepaid wireless service shall be considered a separate retail transaction for purposes of calculating the prepaid wireless fee. 5. “Seller” means a person who makes retail sales of prepaid wireless services to a consumer. (10) AUTHORIZED EXPENDITURES OF PUBLIC SAFETY EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS FEE.— (a) For purposes of this section, emergency communications and 911 service includes the functions relating to the receipt and transfer of requests for emergency assistance, database management, call taking, and location verification. Department of Health certification and recertification and training costs for public safety telecommunications, including dispatching, are functions of public safety emergency communications services. (b) All costs directly attributable to the establishment or provision of emergency communications equipment and services related to a primary or secondary public safety answering point are eligible for expenditure of moneys derived from imposition of the fee authorized by subsections (8) and (9). These costs include the acquisition, implementation, and maintenance of Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) equipment and 911 service features, as defined in the providers’ published schedules or the acquisition, installation, and maintenance of other equipment, including: circuits; call answering equipment; call transfer equipment; ANI or ALI controllers; ANI or ALI displays; station instruments; NG911 telecommunications systems; Emergency Services IP Networks (ESInets); visual call information and storage devices; recording equipment; telephone devices and other equipment for the hearing impaired used in the 911 system; PSAP backup power systems; consoles; automatic call distributors; interfaces, including hardware and software, for computer-aided dispatch (CAD) systems, public safety Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems and radio consoles that provide two-way radio communication with responders, and in-building coverage; GIS system and software equipment and information displays; network clocks; cybersecurity, including hardware, software, and services; salary and associated expenses for 911 call takers and emergency dispatchers, salary, and associated expenses for a county to employ a full-time equivalent 911 coordinator position and a full-time equivalent mapping or geographical data position, and technical system maintenance, database, and administration personnel for the portion of their time spent administrating the emergency communications system; emergency medical, fire, and law enforcement prearrival instruction software; charts and training costs; training costs for PSAP call takers, dispatchers, supervisors, and managers in the proper methods and techniques used in taking and transferring 911 calls; costs to train and educate PSAP employees and the public regarding 911 and radio service or NG911 equipment, including fees collected by the Department of Health for the certification and recertification of 911 public safety telecommunicators as required under s. 401.465; and expenses required to develop and maintain all information, including ALI and ANI databases, call-takers access to smart city technology data, emergency communications broadband network information, and other information directly relevant to the processing of a request for emergency assistance. Changes, modifications, or upgrades to the emergency communications systems or services must be made in cooperation and coordination with the head of each public safety agency, or their designee, served by the primary PSAP in each county. (c) The moneys may not be used to pay for any item not listed in this subsection, including, but not limited to, any capital or operational costs related to responders dispatched to the emergency, and costs for utilities, constructing, leasing, maintaining, or renovating buildings, except for those building modifications necessary to maintain the security and environmental integrity of the PSAP and emergency communications equipment rooms. (11) LIABILITY OF COUNTIES.—A county subscribing to 911 service remains liable to the local exchange carrier for any 911 service, equipment, operation, or maintenance charge owed by the county to the local exchange carrier. As used in this subsection, the term “local exchange carrier” means a local exchange telecommunications service provider of 911 service or equipment to any county within its certificated area. (12) INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.—A local government may indemnify local exchange carriers against liability in accordance with the published schedules of the company. Notwithstanding an indemnification agreement, a local exchange carrier, voice communications services provider, or other service provider that provides 911, E911, or NG911 service on a retail or wholesale basis is not liable for damages resulting from or in connection with 911, E911, or NG911 service, or for identification of the telephone number, or address, or name associated with any person accessing 911, E911, or NG911 service, unless the carrier or provider acted with malicious purpose or in a manner exhibiting wanton and willful disregard of the rights, safety, or property of a person when providing such services. A carrier or provider is not liable for damages to any person resulting from or in connection with the carrier’s or provider’s provision of any lawful assistance to any investigative or law enforcement officer of the United States, this state, or a political subdivision thereof, or of any other state or political subdivision thereof, in connection with any lawful investigation or other law enforcement activity by such law enforcement officer. For purposes of this subsection, the term “911, E911, or NG911 service” means a telecommunications service, voice or nonvoice communications service, or other wireline or wireless service, including, but not limited to, a service using Internet protocol, which provides, in whole or in part, any of the following functions: providing members of the public with the ability to reach an answering point by using the digits 9-1-1; directing 911 calls to answering points by selective routing; providing for automatic number identification and automatic location-identification features; or providing wireless E911 services as defined in the order. (13) FACILITATING EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE IMPLEMENTATION.—To balance the public need for reliable emergency communications services through reliable wireless systems and the public interest served by governmental zoning and land development regulations and notwithstanding any other law or local ordinance to the contrary, the following standards shall apply to a local government’s actions, as a regulatory body, in the regulation of the placement, construction, or modification of a wireless communications facility. This subsection may not, however, be construed to waive or alter the provisions of s. 286.011 or s. 286.0115. For the purposes of this subsection only, “local government” shall mean any municipality or county and any agency of a municipality or county only. The term “local government” does not, however, include any airport, as defined in s. 330.27, even if it is owned or controlled by or through a municipality, county, or agency of a municipality or county. Further, notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, this subsection does not apply to or control a local government’s actions as a property or structure owner in the use of any property or structure owned by such entity for the placement, construction, or modification of wireless communications facilities. In the use of property or structures owned by the local government, however, a local government may not use its regulatory authority so as to avoid compliance with, or in a manner that does not advance, the provisions of this subsection. (a) Colocation among wireless providers is encouraged by the state. 1.a. Colocations on towers, including nonconforming towers, that meet the requirements in sub-sub-subparagraphs (I), (II), and (III), are subject to only building permit review, which may include a review for compliance with this subparagraph. Such colocations are not subject to any design or placement requirements of the local government’s land development regulations in effect at the time of the colocation that are more restrictive than those in effect at the time of the initial antennas placement approval, to any other portion of the land development regulations, or to public hearing review. This sub-subparagraph may not preclude a public hearing for any appeal of the decision on the colocation application. (I) The colocation does not increase the height of the tower to which the antennas are to be attached, measured to the highest point of any part of the tower or any existing antenna attached to the tower; (II) The colocation does not increase the ground space area, commonly known as the compound, approved in the site plan for equipment enclosures and ancillary facilities; and (III) The colocation consists of antennas, equipment enclosures, and ancillary facilities that are of a design and configuration consistent with all applicable regulations, restrictions, or conditions, if any, applied to the initial antennas placed on the tower and to its accompanying equipment enclosures and ancillary facilities and, if applicable, applied to the tower supporting the antennas. Such regulations may include the design and aesthetic requirements, but not procedural requirements, other than those authorized by this section, of the local government’s land development regulations in effect at the time the initial antennas placement was approved. b. Except for a historic building, structure, site, object, or district, or a tower included in sub-subparagraph a., colocations on all other existing structures that meet the requirements in sub-sub-subparagraphs (I)-(IV) shall be subject to no more than building permit review, and an administrative review for compliance with this subparagraph. Such colocations are not subject to any portion of the local government’s land development regulations not addressed herein, or to public hearing review. This sub-subparagraph may not preclude a public hearing for any appeal of the decision on the colocation application. (I) The colocation does not increase the height of the existing structure to which the antennas are to be attached, measured to the highest point of any part of the structure or any existing antenna attached to the structure; (II) The colocation does not increase the ground space area, otherwise known as the compound, if any, approved in the site plan for equipment enclosures and ancillary facilities; (III) The colocation consists of antennas, equipment enclosures, and ancillary facilities that are of a design and configuration consistent with any applicable structural or aesthetic design requirements and any requirements for location on the structure, but not prohibitions or restrictions on the placement of additional colocations on the existing structure or procedural requirements, other than those authorized by this section, of the local government’s land development regulations in effect at the time of the colocation application; and (IV) The colocation consists of antennas, equipment enclosures, and ancillary facilities that are of a design and configuration consistent with all applicable restrictions or conditions, if any, that do not conflict with sub-sub-subparagraph (III) and were applied to the initial antennas placed on the structure and to its accompanying equipment enclosures and ancillary facilities and, if applicable, applied to the structure supporting the antennas. c. Regulations, restrictions, conditions, or permits of the local government, acting in its regulatory capacity, that limit the number of colocations or require review processes inconsistent with this subsection do not apply to colocations addressed in this subparagraph. d. If only a portion of the colocation does not meet the requirements of this subparagraph, such as an increase in the height of the proposed antennas over the existing structure height or a proposal to expand the ground space approved in the site plan for the equipment enclosure, where all other portions of the colocation meet the requirements of this subparagraph, that portion of the colocation only may be reviewed under the local government’s regulations applicable to an initial placement of that portion of the facility, including, but not limited to, its land development regulations, and within the review timeframes of subparagraph (d)2., and the rest of the colocation shall be reviewed in accordance with this subparagraph. A colocation proposal under this subparagraph that increases the ground space area, otherwise known as the compound, approved in the original site plan for equipment enclosures and ancillary facilities by no more than a cumulative amount of 400 square feet or 50 percent of the original compound size, whichever is greater, shall, however, require no more than administrative review for compliance with the local government’s regulations, including, but not limited to, land development regulations review, and building permit review, with no public hearing review. This sub-subparagraph does not preclude a public hearing for any appeal of the decision on the colocation application. 2. If a colocation does not meet the requirements of subparagraph 1., the local government may review the application under the local government’s regulations, including, but not limited to, land development regulations, applicable to the placement of initial antennas and their accompanying equipment enclosure and ancillary facilities. 3. If a colocation meets the requirements of subparagraph 1., the colocation may not be considered a modification to an existing structure or an impermissible modification of a nonconforming structure. 4. The owner of the existing tower on which the proposed antennas are to be colocated shall remain responsible for compliance with any applicable condition or requirement of a permit or agreement, or any applicable condition or requirement of the land development regulations to which the existing tower had to comply at the time the tower was permitted, including any aesthetic requirements, provided the condition or requirement is not inconsistent with this paragraph. 5. An existing tower, including a nonconforming tower, may be structurally modified in order to permit colocation or may be replaced through no more than administrative review and building permit review, and is not subject to public hearing review, if the overall height of the tower is not increased and, if a replacement, the replacement tower is a monopole tower or, if the existing tower is a camouflaged tower, the replacement tower is a like-camouflaged tower. This subparagraph may not preclude a public hearing for any appeal of the decision on the application. (b)1. A local government’s land development and construction regulations for wireless communications facilities and the local government’s review of an application for the placement, construction, or modification of a wireless communications facility shall only address land development or zoning issues. In such local government regulations or review, the local government may not require information on or evaluate a wireless provider’s business decisions about its service, customer demand for its service, or quality of its service to or from a particular area or site, unless the wireless provider voluntarily offers this information to the local government. In such local government regulations or review, a local government may not require information on or evaluate the wireless provider’s designed service unless the information or materials are directly related to an identified land development or zoning issue or unless the wireless provider voluntarily offers the information. Information or materials directly related to an identified land development or zoning issue may include, but are not limited to, evidence that no existing structure can reasonably be used for the antennas placement instead of the construction of a new tower, that residential areas cannot be served from outside the residential area, as addressed in subparagraph 3., or that the proposed height of a new tower or initial antennas placement or a proposed height increase of a modified tower, replacement tower, or colocation is necessary to provide the provider’s designed service. Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the local government from reviewing any applicable land development or zoning issue addressed in its adopted regulations that does not conflict with this section, including, but not limited to, aesthetics, landscaping, land use-based location priorities, structural design, and setbacks. 2. Any setback or distance separation required of a tower may not exceed the minimum distance necessary, as determined by the local government, to satisfy the structural safety or aesthetic concerns that are to be protected by the setback or distance separation. 3. A local government may exclude the placement of wireless communications facilities in a residential area or residential zoning district but only in a manner that does not constitute an actual or effective prohibition of the provider’s service in that residential area or zoning district. If a wireless provider demonstrates to the satisfaction of the local government that the provider cannot reasonably provide its service to the residential area or zone from outside the residential area or zone, the municipality or county and provider shall cooperate to determine an appropriate location for a wireless communications facility of an appropriate design within the residential area or zone. The local government may require that the wireless provider reimburse the reasonable costs incurred by the local government for this cooperative determination. An application for such cooperative determination may not be considered an application under paragraph (d). 4. A local government may impose a reasonable fee on applications to place, construct, or modify a wireless communications facility only if a similar fee is imposed on applicants seeking other similar types of zoning, land use, or building permit review. A local government may impose fees for the review of applications for wireless communications facilities by consultants or experts who conduct code compliance review for the local government but any fee is limited to specifically identified reasonable expenses incurred in the review. A local government may impose reasonable surety requirements to ensure the removal of wireless communications facilities that are no longer being used. 5. A local government may impose design requirements, such as requirements for designing towers to support colocation or aesthetic requirements, except as otherwise limited in this section, but may not impose or require information on compliance with building code type standards for the construction or modification of wireless communications facilities beyond those adopted by the local government under chapter 553 and that apply to all similar types of construction. (c) Local governments may not require wireless providers to provide evidence of a wireless communications facility’s compliance with federal regulations, except evidence of compliance with applicable Federal Aviation Administration requirements under 14 C.F.R. part 77, as amended, and evidence of proper Federal Communications Commission licensure, or other evidence of Federal Communications Commission authorized spectrum use, but may request the Federal Communications Commission to provide information as to a wireless provider’s compliance with federal regulations, as authorized by federal law. (d)1. A local government shall grant or deny each properly completed application for a colocation under subparagraph (a)1. based on the application’s compliance with the local government’s applicable regulations, as provided for in subparagraph (a)1. and consistent with this subsection, and within the normal timeframe for a similar building permit review but in no case later than 45 business days after the date the application is determined to be properly completed in accordance with this paragraph. 2. A local government shall grant or deny each properly completed application for any other wireless communications facility based on the application’s compliance with the local government’s applicable regulations, including but not limited to land development regulations, consistent with this subsection and within the normal timeframe for a similar type review but in no case later than 90 business days after the date the application is determined to be properly completed in accordance with this paragraph. 3.a. An application is deemed submitted or resubmitted on the date the application is received by the local government. If the local government does not notify the applicant in writing that the application is not completed in compliance with the local government’s regulations within 20 business days after the date the application is initially submitted or additional information resubmitted, the application is deemed, for administrative purposes only, to be properly completed and properly submitted. However, the determination may not be deemed as an approval of the application. If the application is not completed in compliance with the local government’s regulations, the local government shall so notify the applicant in writing and the notification must indicate with specificity any deficiencies in the required documents or deficiencies in the content of the required documents which, if cured, make the application properly completed. Upon resubmission of information to cure the stated deficiencies, the local government shall notify the applicant, in writing, within the normal timeframes of review, but in no case longer than 20 business days after the additional information is submitted, of any remaining deficiencies that must be cured. Deficiencies in document type or content not specified by the local government do not make the application incomplete. Notwithstanding this sub-subparagraph, if a specified deficiency is not properly cured when the applicant resubmits its application to comply with the notice of deficiencies, the local government may continue to request the information until such time as the specified deficiency is cured. The local government may establish reasonable timeframes within which the required information to cure the application deficiency is to be provided or the application will be considered withdrawn or closed. b. If the local government fails to grant or deny a properly completed application for a wireless communications facility within the timeframes set forth in this paragraph, the application shall be deemed automatically approved and the applicant may proceed with placement of the facilities without interference or penalty. The timeframes specified in subparagraph 2. may be extended only to the extent that the application has not been granted or denied because the local government’s procedures generally applicable to all other similar types of applications require action by the governing body and such action has not taken place within the timeframes specified in subparagraph 2. Under such circumstances, the local government must act to either grant or deny the application at its next regularly scheduled meeting or, otherwise, the application is deemed to be automatically approved. c. To be effective, a waiver of the timeframes set forth in this paragraph must be voluntarily agreed to by the applicant and the local government. A local government may request, but not require, a waiver of the timeframes by the applicant, except that, with respect to a specific application, a one-time waiver may be required in the case of a declared local, state, or federal emergency that directly affects the administration of all permitting activities of the local government. (e) The replacement of or modification to a wireless communications facility, except a tower, that results in a wireless communications facility not readily discernibly different in size, type, and appearance when viewed from ground level from surrounding properties, and the replacement or modification of equipment that is not visible from surrounding properties, all as reasonably determined by the local government, are subject to no more than applicable building permit review. (f) Any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, the Department of Management Services shall negotiate, in the name of the state, leases for wireless communications facilities that provide access to state government-owned property not acquired for transportation purposes, and the Department of Transportation shall negotiate, in the name of the state, leases for wireless communications facilities that provide access to property acquired for state rights-of-way. On property acquired for transportation purposes, leases shall be granted in accordance with s. 337.251. On other state government-owned property, leases shall be granted on a space available, first-come, first-served basis. Payments required by state government under a lease must be reasonable and must reflect the market rate for the use of the state government-owned property. The Department of Management Services and the Department of Transportation are authorized to adopt rules for the terms and conditions and granting of any such leases. (g) If any person adversely affected by any action, or failure to act, or regulation, or requirement of a local government in the review or regulation of the wireless communication facilities files an appeal or brings an appropriate action in a court or venue of competent jurisdiction, following the exhaustion of all administrative remedies, the matter shall be considered on an expedited basis. (14) MISUSE OF 911, E911, OR NG911 SYSTEM; PENALTY.—911, E911, and NG911 service must be used solely for emergency communications by the public. (a) A person who does any of the following commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083: 1. Accesses or causes another party to access the number 911 for the purpose of making a false alarm or complaint or reporting false information that could result in the emergency response of any public safety agency. 2. Knowingly uses or attempts to use such service for a purpose other than obtaining public safety assistance. 3. Knowingly uses or attempts to use such service in an effort to avoid any charge for service. (b) If a person violates subparagraph (a)1. and the subsequent emergency response by a public safety agency results in: 1. Great bodily harm, permanent disfigurement, or permanent disability to any person as a proximate result of lawful conduct arising out of the emergency response, the person commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. 2. Death to any person as a proximate result of lawful conduct arising out of the emergency response, the person commits a felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. (c) After having two or more convictions of unauthorized use of emergency communications services, a person who continues to engage in such unauthorized use commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. As used in this paragraph, the term “conviction” means a determination of guilt that is the result of a plea agreement or a trial, regardless of whether adjudication is withheld or a plea of nolo contendere is entered. (d) A court shall order any person convicted of violating this subsection to pay: 1. The costs of prosecution and investigation under s. 938.27. 2. Restitution to a responding public safety agency and any other victim who suffers damage or injury as a proximate result of lawful conduct arising out of an emergency response. The restitution must include the full payment of any cost incurred by a responding public safety agency. (15) TEXT-TO-911 SERVICE.—Each county shall develop a countywide implementation plan addressing text-to-911 services and, by January 1, 2022, enact a system to allow text-to-911 services. (16) STATE LAW NOT PREEMPTED.—This section and ss. 365.173 and 365.174 do not alter any state law that otherwise regulates voice communications services providers.

      "text": "365.173 Emergency Communications Trust Fund.— (1) REVENUES.— (a) Revenues derived from the fee levied on subscribers under s. 365.172(8) must be paid by the board into the State Treasury on or before the 15th day of each month. Such moneys must be accounted for in a special fund to be designated as the Emergency Communications Trust Fund, a fund created in the Division of Telecommunications, or other office as designated by the Secretary of Management Services. (b) Revenues derived from the fee levied on prepaid wireless service under s. 365.172(9), less the costs of administering collection of the fee, must be transferred by the Department of Revenue to the Emergency Communications Trust Fund on or before the 25th day of each month following the month of receipt. (c) For accounting purposes, the Emergency Communications Trust Fund must be segregated into three separate categories: 1. The wireless category; 2. The nonwireless category; and 3. The prepaid wireless category. (d) All moneys must be invested by the Chief Financial Officer pursuant to s. 17.61. All moneys in such fund are to be expended by the office for the purposes provided in this section and s. 365.172. These funds are not subject to s. 215.20. (2) DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF FUNDS.—As determined by the board pursuant to s. 365.172(8)(f), and subject to any modifications approved by the board pursuant to s. 365.172(6)(a)3. or (8)(g), the moneys in the fund shall be distributed and used only as follows: (a) Ninety-five percent of the moneys in the wireless category shall be distributed each month to counties, based on the total number of service identifiers in each county, to be used exclusively for payment of authorized expenditures, as specified in s. 365.172(10). (b) Ninety-six percent of the moneys in the nonwireless category shall be distributed each month to counties based on the total number of service identifiers in each county and shall be used exclusively for payment of authorized expenditures, as specified in s. 365.172(10). (c) Sixty-one percent of the moneys in the prepaid wireless category shall be distributed each month to counties based on the total amount of fees reported and paid in each county and shall be used exclusively for payment of authorized expenditures, as specified in s. 365.172(10). The moneys from prepaid wireless fees identified as nonspecific in accordance with s. 365.172(9) shall be distributed as determined by the Emergency Communications Board. (d) Any county that receives funds under paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) shall establish a fund to be used exclusively for the receipt and expenditure of the revenues collected under paragraphs (a), (b), and (c). All fees placed in the fund and any interest accrued shall be used solely for costs described in paragraph (a) and may not be reduced, withheld, or allocated for other purposes. The money collected and interest earned in this fund shall be appropriated for these purposes by the county commissioners and incorporated into the annual county budget. The fund shall be included within the financial audit performed in accordance with s. 218.39. The financial audit shall assure that all emergency communications fee revenues, interest, and emergency communications grant funding are used for payment of authorized expenditures, as specified in s. 365.172(10) and as specified in the Emergency Communications Board grant and special disbursement programs. The board may, in accordance with board rules, withhold future distribution of grant funds or request a return of all or a portion of funds previously awarded based on findings from the financial audit. The county is responsible for all expenditures of revenues distributed from the county emergency communications fund and shall submit the financial audit reports to the board for review. A county may carry forward up to 30 percent of the total funds disbursed to the county by the board during a county fiscal year for expenditures for capital outlay, capital improvements, equipment replacement, or implementation of a hosted system if such expenditures are made for the purposes specified in paragraph (a); however, the 30-percent limitation does not apply to funds disbursed to a county under s. 365.172(6)(a)3., and a county may carry forward any percentage of the funds, except that any grant provided shall continue to be subject to any condition imposed by the board. In order to prevent an excess recovery of costs incurred in providing emergency communications service, a county that receives funds greater than the permissible emergency communications costs described in s. 365.172(10), including the 30-percent carryforward allowance, must return the excess funds to the board to be allocated under s. 365.172(6)(a). (e) One percent of the moneys in each category of the fund shall be retained by the board to be applied to costs and expenses incurred for the purposes of managing, administering, and overseeing the receipts and disbursements from the fund and other activities as defined in s. 365.172(6). Any funds retained for such purposes in a calendar year which are not applied to such costs and expenses by March 31 of the following year shall be redistributed as determined by the board. (f) Three percent of the moneys in each category of the fund and an additional 1 percent of the moneys collected in the wireless category shall be used to make monthly distributions to rural counties for the purpose of providing facilities and network and service enhancements and assistance for the emergency communications systems operated by rural counties and for the provision of grants by the office to rural counties for upgrading and replacing emergency communications systems. (g) Thirty-five percent of the moneys in the prepaid wireless category shall be retained by the board to provide state emergency communications grants to be awarded in accordance with the following order of priority: 1. For all large, medium, and rural counties to upgrade or replace emergency communications systems. 2. For all large, medium, and rural counties to develop and maintain statewide 911 routing, geographic, and management information systems. 3. For all large, medium, and rural counties to develop and maintain next-generation 911 services and equipment. (h) If the wireless category has funds remaining in it on December 31 after disbursements have been made during the calendar year immediately prior to December 31, the board may disburse the excess funds in the wireless category in accordance with s. 365.172(6)(a)3.b. (3) The Legislature recognizes that the fee authorized under s. 365.172 may not necessarily provide the total funding required for establishing or providing the emergency communications service. It is the intent of the Legislature that all revenue from the fee be used as specified in subsection (2).

(b) “Pooling administrator” means the Thousands-Block Pooling Administrator as identified in 47 C.F.R. s. 52.20. (c) “Provider” means a telecommunications company that provides voice communications services to customers in this state. (3) Consistent with authorization provided by federal law and rules of the Federal Communications Commission or its successors, providers operating in this state may block calls in the following manner: (a) Providers may block a voice call when the subscriber to which the originating number is assigned has requested that calls purporting to originate from that number be blocked because the number is used for inbound calls only. (b) Providers may block calls originating from the following numbers: 1. A number that is not a valid North American Numbering Plan number; 2. A valid North American Numbering Plan number that is not allocated to a provider by the North American Numbering Plan Administrator or the pooling administrator; and 3. A valid North American Numbering Plan number that is allocated to a provider by the North American Numbering Plan Administrator or pooling administrator, but is unused, so long as the provider blocking the calls is the allocatee of the number and confirms that the number is unused or has obtained verification from the allocatee that the number is unused at the time of the blocking. Providers may not block a voice call pursuant to subparagraph 1. or subparagraph 2. if the call is an emergency call placed to 911. (4) For purposes of blocking calls from certain originating numbers as authorized in this section, a provider may rely on caller identification service information to determine the originating number.

Such transfer should include voice, text message, image, video, caller identification information, location information, and additional standards-based 911 call information. The plan must prioritize the upgrade of PSAPs based on the population served by each PSAP, the capability of a jurisdiction or region to modernize PSAPs beyond legacy 911 infrastructure, and the ability of a jurisdiction or region to address interoperability between PSAPs. The plan must identify and address the projected costs of providing these transfer capabilities and project the ability of each county to meet operational costs based on disbursement of funds under s. 365.173(2)(a), (b), and (c). (2) In developing the plan, the office shall: (a) Coordinate with public agencies to identify and resolve any technological or logistical issues.
