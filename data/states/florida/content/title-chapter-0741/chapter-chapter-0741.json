(2) A county court judge or clerk of the circuit court may not issue a license to marry until the parties to the marriage file with the county court judge or clerk of the court a written and signed affidavit, made and subscribed before a person authorized by law to administer an oath, which provides: (a) The social security number or any other available identification number for each person. (b) The respective ages of the parties. (3) The submission of social security numbers as provided in this section is intended to support the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. The state has a compelling interest in promoting not only marriage, but also responsible parenting, which may include the payment of child support. Any person who has been issued a social security number shall provide that number in satisfying the requirement in subsection (2). Social security numbers or other identification numbers obtained under this section may be used only for the purposes of administration in Title IV-D child support enforcement cases. (a) Any person who is not a citizen of the United States may provide either a social security number or an alien registration number issued by the United States Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services. (b) Any person who is not a citizen of the United States and who has not been issued a social security number or an alien registration number is encouraged to provide another form of identification. This subsection does not prohibit a county court judge or clerk of the circuit court from issuing a marriage license to individuals who are not citizens of the United States if one or both of them are unable to provide a social security number, an alien registration number, or another identification number. (4) A county court judge or clerk of the circuit court may not issue a license for the marriage of any person unless the county court judge or clerk of the circuit court is first presented with both of the following: (a) A written statement, signed by both parties, which specifies whether the parties, individually or together, have completed a premarital preparation course. (b) A written statement that verifies that both parties have obtained and read or otherwise accessed the information contained in the handbook or other electronic media presentation of the rights and responsibilities of parties to a marriage specified in s. 741.0306. (5) If a couple does not submit to the clerk of the circuit court valid certificates of completion of a premarital preparation course, the clerk shall delay the effective date of the marriage license by 3 days from the date of application, and the effective date must be printed on the marriage license in bold type. If a couple submits valid certificates of completion of a premarital preparation course, the effective date of the marriage license may not be delayed. The clerk shall grant exceptions to the delayed effective date requirement to non-Florida residents and to couples asserting hardship. Marriage license fee waivers are available to all eligible couples. A county court judge issuing a marriage license may waive the delayed effective date requirement for Florida residents who demonstrate good cause.

(b) “Employee” has the same meaning as in s. 440.02(18). (c) “Employer” has the same meaning as in s. 440.02(19). (d) “Family or household member” has the same meaning as in s. 741.28. (e) “Sexual violence” means sexual violence, as defined in s. 784.046, or any crime the underlying factual basis of which has been found by a court to include an act of sexual violence. (f) “Victim” means an individual who has been subjected to domestic violence or sexual violence. (2)(a) An employer shall permit an employee to request and take up to 3 working days of leave from work in any 12-month period if the employee or a family or household member of an employee is the victim of domestic violence or sexual violence. This leave may be with or without pay, at the discretion of the employer. (b) This section applies if an employee uses the leave from work to: 1. Seek an injunction for protection against domestic violence or an injunction for protection in cases of repeat violence, dating violence, or sexual violence; 2. Obtain medical care or mental health counseling, or both, for the employee or a family or household member to address physical or psychological injuries resulting from the act of domestic violence or sexual violence; 3. Obtain services from a victim services organization, including, but not limited to, a domestic violence shelter or program or a rape crisis center as a result of the act of domestic violence or sexual violence; 4. Make the employee’s home secure from the perpetrator of the domestic violence or sexual violence or to seek new housing to escape the perpetrator; or 5. Seek legal assistance in addressing issues arising from the act of domestic violence or sexual violence or to attend and prepare for court-related proceedings arising from the act of domestic violence or sexual violence. (3) This section applies to an employer who employs 50 or more employees and to an employee who has been employed by the employer for 3 or more months. (4)(a) Except in cases of imminent danger to the health or safety of the employee, or to the health or safety of a family or household member, an employee seeking leave from work under this section must provide to his or her employer appropriate advance notice of the leave as required by the employer’s policy along with sufficient documentation of the act of domestic violence or sexual violence as required by the employer. (b) An employee seeking leave under this section must, before receiving the leave, exhaust all annual or vacation leave, personal leave, and sick leave, if applicable, that is available to the employee, unless the employer waives this requirement. (c)1. A private employer must keep all information relating to the employee’s leave under this section confidential. 2. An agency, as defined in s. 119.011, must keep information relating to the employee’s leave under this section confidential and exempt from disclosure to the extent authorized by subsection (7). (5)(a) An employer may not interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or any attempt by an employee to exercise any right provided under this section. (b) An employer may not discharge, demote, suspend, retaliate, or in any other manner discriminate against an employee for exercising his or her rights under this section. (c) An employee has no greater rights to continued employment or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if the employee was not entitled to leave under this section. This section does not limit the employer’s right to discipline or terminate any employee for any reason, including, but not limited to, reductions in work force or termination for cause or for no reason at all, other than exercising his or her rights under this section. (6) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the sole remedy for any person claiming to be aggrieved by a violation of this section is to bring a civil suit for damages or equitable relief, or both, in circuit court. The person may claim as damages all wages and benefits that would have been due the person up to and including the date of the judgment had the act violating this section not occurred, but the person may not claim wages or benefits for a period of leave granted without pay as provided in paragraph (2)(a). However, this section does not relieve the person from the obligation to mitigate his or her damages. (7)(a) Personal identifying information that is contained in records documenting an act of domestic violence or sexual violence submitted by an agency employee to an agency, as defined in chapter 119, under the requirements of this section is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. (b) A written request for leave that is submitted by an agency employee under the requirements of this section and any agency time sheet that reflects such a request are confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution until 1 year after the leave has been taken.

(3) Notwithstanding s. 55.505 or any other provision to the contrary, neither residence in this state nor registration of foreign injunctions for protection shall be required for enforcement of this order by this state and failure to register the foreign order shall not be an impediment to its enforcement. The following registration procedure shall be available to protected persons who hold orders from a court of a foreign state. (a) A protected person shall present a certified copy of a foreign order of protection to any sheriff in this state and request that the same be registered in the injunction registry. However, nothing in this section shall operate to preclude the enforcement of any order of protection determined by the law enforcement officer to be valid even if the protected person does not have a certified copy of the foreign protection order. It is not necessary that the protected person register the foreign order in the protected person’s county of residence. Venue is proper throughout the state. The protected person must swear by affidavit, that to the best of the protected person’s knowledge and belief, the attached certified copy of the foreign order, docket number , issued in the state of on is currently in effect as written and has not been superseded by any other order and that the respondent has been given a copy of it. (b) The sheriff shall examine the certified copy of the foreign order and register the order in the injunction registry, noting that it is a foreign order of protection. If not apparent from the face of the certified copy of the foreign order, the sheriff shall use best efforts to ascertain whether the order was served on the respondent. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement shall develop a special notation for foreign orders of protection. The sheriff shall assign a case number and give the protected person a receipt showing registration of the foreign order in this state. There shall be no fee for registration of a foreign order. (c) The foreign order may also be registered by local law enforcement agencies upon receipt of the foreign order and any accompanying affidavits in the same manner described in paragraphs (a) and (b). (4)(a) Law enforcement officers shall enforce foreign orders of protection as if they were entered by a court of this state. Upon presentation of a foreign protection order by a protected person, a law enforcement officer shall assist in enforcement of all of its terms, pursuant to federal law, except matters related to child custody, visitation, and support. As to those provisions only, enforcement may be obtained upon domestication of the foreign order pursuant to ss. 55.501-55.509 unless the foreign order is a “pickup order” or “order of bodily attachment” requiring the immediate return of a child. (b) Before enforcing a foreign protection order, a law enforcement officer should confirm the identity of the parties present and review the order to determine that, on its face, it has not expired. Presentation of a certified or true copy of the protection order shall not be required as a condition of enforcement, provided that a conflicting certified copy is not presented by the respondent or the individual against whom enforcement is sought. (c) A law enforcement officer shall use reasonable efforts to verify service of process. (d) Service may be verified as follows: 1. By petitioner: Petitioner may state under oath that to the best of petitioner’s knowledge, respondent was served with the order of protection because petitioner was present at time of service; respondent told petitioner he or she was served; another named person told petitioner respondent was served; or respondent told petitioner he or she knows of the content of the order and date of the return hearing. 2. By respondent: Respondent states under oath that he or she was or was not served with the order. (e) Enforcement and arrest for violation of a foreign protection order shall be consistent with the enforcement of orders issued in this state. (f) A law enforcement officer acting in good faith under this section and the officer’s employing agency shall be immune from all liability, civil or criminal, that might otherwise be incurred or imposed by reason of the officer’s or agency’s actions in carrying out the provisions of this section. (g) Law enforcement shall not require petitioner to sign a registration affidavit as a condition of enforcement. (h) A foreign order of protection shall remain in effect until the date of expiration on its face; or, if there is no expiration date on its face, a foreign order of protection shall remain in effect until expiration. If the order of protection states on its face that it is a permanent order, then there is no date of expiration. (5) Any person who acts under this section and intentionally provides a law enforcement officer with a copy of an order of protection known by that person to be false or invalid, or who denies having been served with an order of protection when that person has been served with such order, commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (6) In the event 18 U.S.C. s. 2265 is held to be unconstitutional, this section shall be null and void. History.—s. 7, ch. 97-155; s. 1, ch. 2012-153; s. 5, ch. 2016-187.

(b) The batterer shall be held accountable for acts of domestic violence. (c) The program shall be at least 29 weeks in length and include 24 weekly sessions, plus appropriate intake, assessment, and orientation programming. (d) The program content shall be based on a cognitive behavioral therapy model or psychoeducational model that addresses tactics of power and control by one person over another. (e) The program shall be funded by user fees paid by the batterers who attend the program, which allows them to take responsibility for their acts of violence. An exception shall be made for local, state, or federal programs that fund batterers’ intervention programs in whole or in part. (2) The requirements of this section apply only to programs that address the perpetration of violence between intimate partners, spouses, ex-spouses, or those who share a child in common or who are cohabitants in intimate relationships for the purpose of exercising power and control by one over the other. It will endanger victims if courts and other referral agencies refer family and household members who are not perpetrators of the type of domestic violence encompassed by these requirements. Accordingly, the court and others who make referrals should refer perpetrators only to programming that appropriately addresses the violence committed.
