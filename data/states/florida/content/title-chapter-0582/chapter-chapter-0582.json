(2) The Legislature finds that the farm, forest, and grazing lands; green spaces; recreational areas; and natural areas of the state are among the basic assets of the state and the conservation of these lands is necessary to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of its people and is in the public interest. (3) The Legislature further finds that to ensure the conservation of the state’s farm, forest, and grazing lands; green spaces; recreational areas; and natural areas, and to conserve, protect, and use soil and water resources, it is necessary that appropriate land and water resources protection practices be implemented. (4) The purpose of the soil and water conservation districts is to provide assistance, guidance, and education to landowners, land occupiers, the agricultural industry, and the general public in implementing land and water resource protection practices. The Legislature intends for soil and water conservation districts to work in conjunction with federal, state, and local agencies in all matters that implement the provisions of this chapter.

All owners and occupiers of land within the limits of the territory described in the petition, and of lands within any territory considered for addition to such described territory, and all other interested parties, shall have the right to attend such hearings and to be heard. If it shall appear upon the hearing that it may be desirable to include within the proposed district territory outside of the area within which due notice of the hearing has been given, the hearing shall be adjourned and due notice of further hearing shall be given throughout the entire area considered for inclusion in the district and such further hearing held. After such hearing, if the department shall determine, upon the facts presented at such hearing and upon such other relevant facts and information as may be available that there is need, in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare, for a soil and water conservation district to function in the territory considered at the hearing, it shall make and record such determination, and shall define, by metes and bounds or by legal subdivisions, the boundaries of such district. In making such determination and in defining such boundaries, the department shall give due weight and consideration to the topography of the area considered and of the state, the composition of soils therein, the distribution of erosion, the prevailing land use practices, the desirability and necessity of including within the boundaries the particular lands under consideration and the benefits such lands may receive from being included within such boundaries, the relation of the proposed area to existing watersheds and agricultural regions, and to other soil and water conservation districts already organized or proposed for organization under the provisions of this chapter, and such other physical, geographical, and economic factors as are relevant, having due regard to the legislative determinations set forth in this chapter. The territory to be included within such boundaries need not be contiguous. If the department shall determine after such hearing, after due consideration of the said relevant facts, that there is no need for a soil and water conservation district to function in the territory considered at the hearing, it shall make and record such determination and shall deny the petition. After 6 months shall have expired from the date of the denial of any such petition, subsequent petitions covering the same or substantially the same territory may be filed as aforesaid and new hearings held and determinations made thereon.

The application shall be accompanied by a statement by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, which shall certify (and such statement need contain no detail other than the mere recitals) that a petition was filed, notice issued, and hearing held as aforesaid; that the department did duly determine that there is need, in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare, for a soil and water conservation district to function in the proposed territory and did define the boundaries thereof, that notice was given and a referendum held on the question of the creation of such district, and that the result of such referendum showed a majority of the votes cast in such referendum to be in favor of the creation of the district; that thereafter the department did duly determine that the operation of the proposed district is administratively practicable and feasible. The said statement shall set forth the boundaries of the district as they have been defined by the department. (2) The Department of State shall examine the application and statement and, if it finds that the name proposed for the district is not identical with that of any other soil and water conservation district of this state or so nearly similar as to lead to confusion or uncertainty, it shall receive and file them and shall record them in an appropriate book of record in its office. If the Department of State shall find that the name proposed for the district is identical with that of any other soil and water conservation district of this state, or so nearly similar as to lead to confusion and uncertainty, it shall certify such fact to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and to the five petitioners and the petitioners shall thereupon submit to the Department of State a new name for the said district not subject to such defects. Upon receipt of such new name, free of such defects, the Department of State shall record the application and statement, with the name so modified, in an appropriate book of record in its office. The Department of State shall make and issue a certificate under the seal of the state, of the due organization of the said district, and shall record such certificate with the application and statement. The boundaries of such district shall include the territory as determined by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. (3) After 6 months shall have expired from the date of entry of a determination by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services that operation of a proposed district is not administratively practicable and feasible, and denial of a petition pursuant to such determination, subsequent petitions may be filed as aforesaid, and action taken thereon in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. (4) After the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has determined that operation of a proposed district is administratively practicable and feasible and that the district boundaries are wholly located in one county, the district must be subdivided into five numbered subdivisions that match, as practicable, the boundaries of either the five county commission districts or five school board districts within the county. When neither the county commission nor the school board is subdivided into five districts, or when the district is comprised of multiple counties, the department shall subdivide the district into five numbered subdivisions as nearly equal in area as practicable to ensure geographical representation within that soil and water conservation district’s governing body.
