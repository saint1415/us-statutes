(2) The agreement must include provisions for the following: (a) Program staff who supervise visits or other contact must have specific training in child sexual abuse provided through the Clearinghouse on Supervised Visitation documented in personnel files. (b) The program must have protocols for obtaining background material on the family prior to the initiation of services. (c) The program must accept only those child sexual abuse referrals for which staff have the requisite background material, training, and security in place to safely monitor contact. (d) The program must decline referrals of child sexual abuse cases when staff lack necessary training or education, when background material has not been received, or when lack of security may allow revictimization of the child. (e) The program must suspend visits in cases when the child appears to be traumatized by the visits or when the individual visiting or having other contact engages in inappropriate behavior or violates program rules.
