(a) The department has authority to adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 to implement the provisions of this chapter conferring powers or duties upon it. (b) The department may employ and discharge such employees, examiners, counsel, and other assistants as shall be deemed necessary, and it shall prescribe their duties; their compensation shall be the same as other state employees receive for similar services. (2) The department shall adopt a seal by which its proceedings are authenticated. Any written instrument purporting to be a copy of any action, proceeding, or finding of fact by the department, or any record of the department authenticated by the seal, shall be accepted by all the courts of this state as prima facie evidence of the contents thereof. (3) The papers, documents, reports, or any other investigatory records of the department are confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) until such investigation is completed or ceases to be active, unless the department or office files a formal administrative complaint, emergency order, or consent order against the individual or entity. For the purpose of this section, an investigation is considered active while the investigation is being conducted by the department with a reasonable, good faith belief that it may lead to the filing of administrative, civil, or criminal proceedings. An investigation does not cease to be active if the department is proceeding with reasonable dispatch and there is good faith belief that action may be initiated by the department or other administrative or law enforcement agency. This subsection does not prevent the department or office from disclosing the content of a complaint or such information as it deems necessary to conduct the investigation, to update the complainant as to the status and outcome of the complaint, to review the details of the investigation with the subject or the subject’s representative, or to share such information with any law enforcement agency or other regulatory body.

A firm, partnership, association, or corporation, as such, may not be licensed. (2) For the protection of the people of this state, the department may not issue, renew, or permit to exist any license or appointment except in compliance with this chapter. The department may not issue, renew, or permit to exist a license or appointment for any individual found to be untrustworthy or incompetent who has had his or her eligibility to hold a license or appointment revoked, or who has not established to the satisfaction of the department that he or she is qualified therefor in accordance with this chapter. (3) The department may propound any reasonable interrogatories to an applicant for a license or appointment under this chapter or on any renewal thereof, relating to his or her qualifications, residence, prospective place of business, and any other matters which are deemed necessary or expedient in order to protect the public and ascertain the qualifications of the applicant. The department may also conduct any reasonable inquiry or investigation it sees fit, relative to the determination of the applicant’s fitness to be licensed or appointed or to continue to be licensed or appointed. Upon the request of the department, a law enforcement agency shall inform the department of any specific criminal charge filed against any applicant and the final disposition of such charge. (4) If upon the basis of the completed application for a license or appointment and such further inquiry or investigation the department deems the applicant to be unfit as to character and background or lacking in one or more of the required qualifications for the license or appointment, the department shall disapprove the application. (5) The license of a bail bond agent shall continue in force, without further examination unless deemed necessary by the department, until suspended, revoked, or otherwise terminated. (6) The original license issued to a licensee under this chapter shall remain outstanding and in effect for so long as the license represented thereby continues in force as provided in this section. The department may at any time require the licensee to produce his or her department-issued photo identification. (7) Any person who represents a surety company, whose duties are restricted to bail bonds, and who comes under the definition of “service representative” as provided in s. 626.015 shall be licensed and appointed as a bail bond agent. (8) An individual who is appointed as a managing general agent to supervise or manage bail bond business written in this state must also be licensed as a bail bond agent. In the case of an entity, at least one owner, officer, or director at each office location must be licensed as a bail bond agent. (9) If, upon application for an appointment and such investigation as the department may make, it appears to the department that an individual has been actively engaged or is currently actively engaged in bail bond activities without being appointed as required, the department may, if it finds that such failure to be appointed is an error on the part of the insurer or employer so represented, issue or authorize the issuance of the appointment as applied for, but subject to the condition that, before the appointment is issued, all fees and taxes which would have been due had the applicant been so appointed during such current and prior periods, together with a continuation fee for such current and prior terms of appointment, shall be paid to the department. Failure to notify the department within the required time period shall result in the appointing entity being assessed a delinquent fee of $250. Delinquent fees shall be paid by the appointing entity and shall not be charged to the appointee.

The application must include the applicant’s full name; date of birth; social security number; residence, business, and mailing addresses; contact telephone numbers, including a business telephone number; and e-mail address. (2) To qualify as a bail bond agent, it must affirmatively appear at the time of application and throughout the period of licensure that the applicant: (a) Is a natural person who has reached the age of 18 years and holds a high school diploma or its equivalent. (b) Is a United States citizen or legal alien who possesses work authorization from the United States Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services and is a resident of this state. An individual who is a resident of this state shall be deemed to meet the residence requirement of this paragraph, notwithstanding the existence, at the time of application for license, of a license in the applicant’s name on the records of another state as a resident licensee of such other state, if the applicant furnishes a letter of clearance satisfactory to the department that his or her resident licenses have been canceled or changed to a nonresident basis and that he or she is in good standing. (c) Will maintain his or her place of business in this state and in the county where the applicant will maintain his or her records and be actively engaged in the bail bond business and work with a licensed agency accessible to the public which is open for reasonable business hours. (d) Is vouched for and recommended upon sworn statements filed with the department by at least three reputable citizens who are residents of the same counties in which the applicant proposes to engage in the bail bond business. (e) Is a person of high character and approved integrity and has not been convicted of or pleaded guilty or no contest to a felony, a crime involving moral turpitude, or a crime punishable by imprisonment of 1 year or more under the law of any state, territory, or country, whether or not a judgment or conviction has been entered. (f) Within 2 years immediately before applying for the license, has successfully completed a basic certification course in the criminal justice system which consists of at least 120 hours of classroom instruction with a passing grade of 80 percent or higher and has successfully completed a correspondence course for bail bond agents approved by the department. (g) Has passed any required examination. (3) The department may collect a fee necessary to cover the cost of a character and credit report made by an established and reputable independent reporting service. The fee shall be deposited to the credit of the Insurance Regulatory Trust Fund. Any information so furnished is confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1). (4) The applicant shall furnish, with his or her application, a complete set of his or her fingerprints in accordance with s. 626.171(4) and a recent credential-sized, fullface photograph of the applicant. The department shall not authorize an applicant to take the required examination until the department has received a report from the Department of Law Enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Investigation relative to the existence or nonexistence of a criminal history report based on the applicant’s fingerprints. (5) The department shall conduct a comprehensive investigation of each applicant, including a background check. The investigation of the applicant’s qualifications, character, experience, background, and fitness shall include submission of the applicant’s fingerprints to the Department of Law Enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Investigation and consideration of any state criminal records, federal criminal records, or local criminal records obtained from these agencies or from local law enforcement agencies. (6) The requirements for completion and submission of fingerprints under this chapter are deemed to be met when an individual currently licensed under this chapter seeks additional licensure and has previously submitted fingerprints to the department in support of an application for licensure under this chapter within the past 48 months. However, the department may require the individual to file fingerprints if it has reason to believe that an applicant or licensee has been found guilty of, or pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony or a crime related to the business of insurance in this or any other state or jurisdiction. (7) The provisions of s. 112.011 do not apply to bail bond agents or to applicants for licensure as bail bond agents.

The designation of the bail bond agent in charge may be changed if the department is notified immediately.

A person may be designated as the bail bond agent in charge for only one agency and location. (3) The department may suspend or revoke the license of the owner, bail bond agent in charge, and bail bond agency if the bail bond agency employs, contracts with, or uses the services of a person who has had a license denied or whose license is currently suspended or revoked. However, a person who has been denied a license for failure to pass a required examination may be employed to perform clerical or administrative functions for which licensure is not required. (4) An owner, a bail bond agent in charge, or a bail bond agency may not employ, contract with, or use the services of any person in a bail bond agency who has been charged with, found guilty of, or pled guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or a crime punishable by imprisonment of 1 year or more under the law of any jurisdiction, without regard to whether judgment was entered or withheld by the court. (5) A bail bond agency location may not conduct surety business unless a bail bond agent in charge is designated by, and provides services to, the bail bond agency at all times. If the bail bond agent in charge designated with the department ends his or her affiliation with the bail bond agency for any reason and if the bail bond agency fails to designate another bail bond agent in charge within the 10-day period under subsection (1) and such failure continues for 90 days, the bail bond agency license automatically expires on the 91st day after the date the designated bail bond agent in charge ended his or her affiliation with the agency.

Such collateral security or other indemnity required by the bail bond agent must be reasonable in relation to the amount of the bond. Collateral security may not be used by the bail bond agent for personal benefit or gain and must be returned in the same condition as received. A bail bond agent may accept collateral security in excess of $50,000 cash per bond, provided any amount over $50,000 cash is payable to the insurer in the form of a cashier’s check, United States postal money order, certificates of deposit, or wire transfer and is remitted to and held by the insurer. A copy of IRS Form 8300 must be retained as part of the defendant’s file if it is otherwise required. A quitclaim deed for property may not be taken as collateral. Other acceptable forms of security or indemnity may consist of the following: (a) A promissory note; (b) An indemnity agreement; (c) A real property mortgage in the name of the insurer; (d) Any Uniform Commercial Code filing; or (e) Any other type of security approved by the department. The department may approve other security only if, after considering the liquidity and other characteristics of the security, it determines that the security is of a type which increases the probability that the defendant will in fact appear in court or increases the probability that the defendant will be subsequently apprehended by the bail bond agent. (2) When a bail bond agent accepts collateral, a written, numbered receipt shall be given, and this receipt shall give in detail a full account of the collateral received. The bail bond agent shall also give copies of documents rendered under subsection (1) to the indemnitor. (3) Collateral security shall be received and held in the insurer’s name by the bail bond agent in a fiduciary capacity and, prior to any forfeiture of bail, shall be kept separate and apart from any other funds or assets of such bail bond agent. When collateral security in excess of $5,000 cash or its equivalent is received by a bail bond agent, the entire amount shall be immediately forwarded to the insurer. Such collateral security may be placed in an interest-bearing account to accrue to the benefit of the person giving the collateral security, and the bail bond agent, insurer, or managing general agent may not make any pecuniary gain on the collateral security deposited. Any such account shall be in a depository office of a financial institution located in this state. The insurer shall be liable for all collateral received. If the bail bond agent or managing general agent fails to return the collateral to the indemnitor upon final termination of liability on the bond, the surety shall be liable for the collateral and shall return the actual collateral to the indemnitor or, in the event that the surety cannot locate the collateral, the surety shall pay the indemnitor pursuant to the provisions of this section. (4) When the obligation of the surety on the bond or bonds has been released in writing by the court, the collateral shall be returned to the rightful owner named in the collateral receipt unless another disposition is provided for by legal assignment of the right to receive the collateral to another person. (5) If a forfeiture occurs, the agent or insurer shall give 10 days’ written notice of intent to convert the collateral deposit into cash to satisfy the forfeiture to the indemnitor and principal. Notice shall be sent by certified mail to the last known address of the indemnitor and principal. (6) The bail bond agent or insurer must convert the collateral to cash within a reasonable period of time and return that which is in excess of the face value of the bond minus the actual and reasonable expenses of converting the collateral to cash. In no event shall these expenses exceed 20 percent of the face value of the bond. However, upon motion and proof that the actual, reasonable expenses exceed 20 percent, the court may allow recovery of the full amount of such actual, reasonable expenses. If there is a remission of a forfeiture, which had required the surety to pay the bond to the court, the surety shall pay to the indemnitor the value of any collateral received for the bond, minus any actual expenses and costs permitted herein. (7) No bail bond agent or insurer shall solicit or accept a waiver of any of the provisions of this section or enter into any agreement as to the value of the collateral. (8) Prior to the appointment of a bail bond agent who is currently or was previously appointed by another insurer, the bail bond agent must file with the department a sworn and notarized affidavit, on a form prescribed by the department, stating that: (a) There has been no loss, misappropriation, conversion, or theft of any collateral being held by the agent in trust for any insurer by which the agent is currently or was previously appointed; and (b) All collateral being held in trust by the agent and all records for any insurer by which the agent is currently or was previously appointed are available for immediate audit and inspection by the department, the insurer, or the managing general agent, and will upon demand of the department or insurer be transmitted to the insurer for whom the collateral is being held in trust. (9) The department shall establish by rule the form of the affidavit and the statement identifying the amount and source of the security as specified in s. 903.14. (10) An indemnity agreement may not be entered into between a principal and either a surety or any agent of the surety, and an application may not be accepted either by a bail bond agent engaged in the bail bond business or by a surety company for a bail bond in which an indemnity agreement is required between a principal and either a surety or any agent of such surety, unless the indemnity agreement reads as follows: “For good and valuable consideration, the undersigned principal agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the surety company or its agent for all losses not otherwise prohibited by law or by rules of the Department of Financial Services.” (11) Any person who violates this section is guilty of a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.

The department shall also investigate a licensee if the department is made aware that a possible violation of this chapter, or a rule adopted pursuant thereto, has occurred. If the department determines that a violation of this chapter or a violation of a rule adopted pursuant to this chapter has occurred, the department may file a formal complaint against the licensee and prosecute under chapter 120. (2) Any proceeding for the purpose of summary suspension of a license pursuant to s. 120.60(6) shall be conducted by the department, which shall issue the final summary order. (3) The complaint and all information obtained pursuant to the investigation of the department are confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) until such investigation is completed or ceases to be active. For the purpose of this section, an investigation is considered “active” while the investigation is being conducted by the department with a reasonable, good faith belief that it may lead to the filing of administrative, civil, or criminal proceedings. An investigation does not cease to be active if the department is proceeding with reasonable dispatch and there is good faith belief that action may be initiated by the department or other administrative or law enforcement agency. This subsection does not prevent the department or office from disclosing the complaint or such information as it deems necessary to conduct the investigation, to update the complainant as to the status and outcome of the complaint, or to share such information with any law enforcement agency or other regulatory body. (4) The expiration, nonrenewal, or surrender of licensure under this chapter does not eliminate the jurisdiction of the department or office to investigate and prosecute for a violation committed by a licensee while licensed under this chapter. The prosecution of any matter may be initiated or continued notwithstanding the withdrawal of a complaint.

In each case involving suspension, the department has the discretion to require the former licensee to successfully complete a basic certification course in the criminal justice system, consisting of not less than 80 hours approved by the department.

A copy of the written request for discharge must be given to the indemnitor or the person making the request for the collateral, and a copy must be maintained in the agent’s file. If a discharge is provided to the surety or the surety’s agent pursuant to chapter 903, the collateral shall be returned to the indemnitor within 21 days after the discharge is provided. (2) Upon demand, following the written request for discharge and upon diligent inquiry by the surety or surety’s agent to determine whether the bond has been discharged, the failure of the court to provide a written discharge to the surety or surety’s agent pursuant to chapter 903 within 7 days automatically cancels the bond, and the collateral shall be returned to the indemnitor within 21 days after the written request for discharge. (3)(a) Fees or charges other than those provided in this chapter or by rule of the department or commission may not be deducted from the collateral due. (b)1. The bail bond agent may charge the credit card fee imposed in connection with the use of the credit card for payment of collateral if the fee is clearly shown on the collateral receipt and is acknowledged by the person tendering the credit card. 2. The prevailing schedule of credit card fees must be conspicuously posted in the lobby of the bail bond agency, and a copy must be provided to the person tendering the credit card. (c) Allowable expenses incurred in apprehending a defendant because of a bond forfeiture or judgment under s. 903.29 may be deducted if such expenses are accounted for. The failure to return collateral under these terms is punishable as follows: 1. If the collateral is of a value less than $100, as provided in s. 775.082(4)(a). 2. If the collateral is of a value of $100 or more, as provided in s. 775.082(3)(e). 3. If the collateral is of a value of $1,500 or more, as provided in s. 775.082(3)(d). 4. If the collateral is of a value of $10,000 or more, as provided in s. 775.082(3)(b).

(2) “Bail bond agency” means: (a) The building where a licensee maintains an office and where all records required by ss. 648.34 and 648.36 are maintained; or (b) An entity that: 1. Charges a fee or premium to release an accused defendant or detainee from jail; or 2. Engages in or employs others to engage in any activity that may be performed only by a licensed and appointed bail bond agent. (3) “Bail bond agent” means a limited surety agent or a professional bail bond agent as hereafter defined. (4) “Bail bond agent in charge” means a licensed bail bond agent who is responsible for the overall operation and management of a bail bond agency location and whose responsibilities include hiring and supervising all individuals within that location. A bail bond agent may be designated as the bail bond agent in charge for only one bail bond agency location. (5) “Insurer” means any domestic, foreign, or alien surety company which has been authorized to transact surety business in this state. (6) “Limited surety agent” means any individual appointed by an insurer by power of attorney to execute or countersign bail bonds in connection with judicial proceedings who receives or is promised money or other things of value therefor. (7) “Managing general agent” means any individual, partnership, association, or corporation appointed or employed by an insurer to supervise or manage the bail bond business written in this state by limited surety agents appointed by the insurer. (8) “Professional bail bond agent” means any person who pledges United States currency, United States postal money orders, or cashier’s checks as security for a bail bond in connection with a judicial proceeding and receives or is promised therefor money or other things of value. (9) “Referring bail bond agent” means the limited surety agent who is requesting the transfer bond. The referring bail bond agent is the agent held liable for the transfer bond, along with the issuing surety company. (10) “Temporary bail bond agent” means a person licensed before January 1, 2024, who is employed by a bail bond agent or agency, insurer, or managing general agent, and such licensee has the same authority as a licensed bail bond agent, including presenting defendants in court; apprehending, arresting, and surrendering defendants to the proper authorities, while accompanied by a supervising bail bond agent or an agent from the same agency; and keeping defendants under necessary surveillance. However, a temporary licensee may not execute or sign bonds, handle collateral receipts, or deliver bonds to appropriate authorities. A temporary licensee may not operate an agency or branch agency separate from the location of the supervising bail bond agent, managing general agent, or insurer by whom the licensee is employed. This does not affect the right of a bail bond agent or insurer to hire counsel or to obtain the assistance of law enforcement officers. A temporary bail bond agent license expires 18 months after issuance and is no longer valid on or after June 30, 2025. (11) “Transfer bond” means the appearance bond and power of attorney form posted by a limited surety agent who is registered in the county where the defendant is being held in custody.
