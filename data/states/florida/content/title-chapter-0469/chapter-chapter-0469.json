      "text": "469.006 Licensure of business organizations; qualifying agents.— (1) If an individual proposes to engage in consulting or contracting in that individual’s own name, the license may be issued only to that individual. (2)(a) If the applicant proposes to engage in consulting or contracting as a partnership, corporation, business trust, or other legal entity, or in any name other than the applicant’s legal name, the legal entity must apply for licensure through a qualifying agent or the individual applicant must apply for licensure under the fictitious name. (b) The application must state the name of the partnership and of each of its partners, the name of the corporation and of each of its officers and directors and the name of each of its stockholders who is also an officer or director, the name of the business trust and of each of its trustees, or the name of such other legal entity and of each of its members. 1. The application for primary qualifying agent must include an affidavit on a form provided by the department attesting that the applicant’s signature is required on all checks, drafts, or payments, regardless of the form of payment, made by the entity, and that the applicant has final approval authority for all construction work performed by the entity. 2. The application for financially responsible officer must include an affidavit on a form provided by the department attesting that the applicant’s signature is required on all checks, drafts, or payments, regardless of the form of payment, made by the entity, and that the applicant has authority to act for the business organization in all financial matters. 3. The application for secondary qualifying agent must include an affidavit on a form provided by the department attesting that the applicant has authority to supervise all construction work performed by the entity as provided in s. 489.1195(2). (c) As a prerequisite to the issuance of a license under this section, the applicant shall submit the following: 1. An affidavit on a form provided by the department attesting that the applicant has obtained workers’ compensation insurance as required by chapter 440, public liability insurance, and property damage insurance, in amounts determined by department rule. The department shall establish by rule a procedure to verify the accuracy of such affidavits based upon a random sample method. 2. Evidence of financial responsibility. The department shall adopt rules to determine financial responsibility which must specify grounds on which the department may deny licensure. Such criteria must include, but are not limited to, credit history. (d) A joint venture, including a joint venture composed of qualified business organizations, is itself a separate and distinct organization that must be qualified in accordance with department rules. (e) The license, when issued upon application of a business organization, must be in the name of the business organization, and the name of the qualifying agent must be noted thereon. If there is a change in any information that is required to be stated on the application, the business organization shall, within 45 days after such change occurs, mail the correct information to the department. (f) The applicant must furnish evidence of statutory compliance if a fictitious name is used, the provisions of s. 865.09(7) notwithstanding. (3) The qualifying agent shall be licensed under this chapter in order for the business organization to be licensed in the category of the business conducted for which the qualifying agent is licensed. If any qualifying agent ceases to be affiliated with such business organization, the agent shall so inform the department. In addition, if such qualifying agent is the only licensed individual affiliated with the business organization, the business organization shall notify the department of the termination of the qualifying agent and shall have 60 days from the termination of the qualifying agent’s affiliation with the business organization in which to employ another qualifying agent. The business organization may not engage in consulting or contracting until a qualifying agent is employed, unless the department has granted a temporary nonrenewable license to the financially responsible officer, the president, the sole proprietor, a partner, or, in the case of a limited partnership, the general partner, who assumes all responsibilities of a primary qualifying agent for the entity. This temporary license shall only allow the entity to proceed with incomplete contracts. (4)(a) The qualifying agent shall inform the department in writing if the agent proposes to engage in consulting or contracting in the agent’s own name or in affiliation with another business organization, and the agent or the new business organization shall supply the same information to the department as is required of initial applicants under this chapter. (b) Upon a favorable determination by the department, after investigation of the financial responsibility, credit, and business reputation of the qualifying agent and the new business organization, the department shall issue, without any examination, a new license in the business organization’s name, and the name of the qualifying agent shall be noted thereon. (5)(a) Each asbestos consultant or contractor shall affix the consultant’s or contractor’s signature and license number to each construction document, plan, or any other document prepared or approved for use by the licensee which is related to any asbestos abatement project and filed for public record with any governmental agency, and to any offer, bid, or contract submitted to a client. (b) The license number of each consultant or contractor shall appear in any printed matter or any newspaper, airwave transmission, phone directory, or other advertising medium offering or related to asbestos consulting or contracting, as provided by department rule. (6) Each qualifying agent shall pay the department an amount equal to the original fee for licensure of a new business organization. If the qualifying agent for a business organization desires to qualify additional business organizations, the department shall require the agent to present evidence of supervisory ability and financial responsibility of each such organization. Allowing a licensee to qualify more than one business organization shall be conditioned upon the licensee showing that the licensee has both the capacity and intent to adequately supervise each business organization. The department shall not limit the number of business organizations which the licensee may qualify except upon the licensee’s failure to provide such information as is required under this subsection or upon a finding that such information or evidence as is supplied is incomplete or unpersuasive in showing the licensee’s capacity and intent to comply with the requirements of this subsection. A qualification for an additional business organization may be revoked or suspended upon a finding by the department that the licensee has failed in the licensee’s responsibility to adequately supervise the operations of the business organization. Failure to adequately supervise the operations of a business organization shall be grounds for denial to qualify additional business organizations. (7) If a business organization or any of its partners, officers, directors, trustees, or members is disciplined, other than by citation, for violating s. 469.009(2), the department may, on that basis alone, deny issuance, or issue with conditions, a license to a business organization, financially responsible officer, or qualifying agent.

(a) All primary qualifying agents for a business organization are jointly and equally responsible for supervision of all operations of the business organization, for all field work at all sites, and for financial matters, both for the organization in general and for each specific job. (b) Upon approval by the department, a business entity may designate a financially responsible officer for purposes of licensure. A financially responsible officer shall assume personal responsibility for all financial aspects of the business organization and shall not be designated as the primary qualifying agent. (c) Where a business organization has a licensed financially responsible officer, the primary qualifying agent shall be responsible for all construction or consulting activities of the business organization, both in general and for each specific job. (2)(a) One of the qualifying agents for a business organization that has more than one qualifying agent may be designated as the sole primary qualifying agent for the business organization by a joint agreement that is executed, on a form provided by the department, by all qualifying agents for the business organization. (b) The joint agreement must be submitted to the department for approval. If the department determines that the joint agreement is in good order, it shall approve the designation and immediately notify the qualifying agents of such approval. The designation made by the joint agreement is effective upon receipt of the notice by the qualifying agents. (c) The qualifying agent designated for a business organization by a joint agreement is the sole primary qualifying agent for the business organization, and all other qualifying agents for the business organization are secondary qualifying agents. (d) A designated sole primary qualifying agent has all the responsibilities and duties of a primary qualifying agent, notwithstanding that there are secondary qualifying agents for specified jobs. The designated sole primary qualifying agent is jointly and equally responsible with secondary qualifying agents for field work supervision. (e) A secondary qualifying agent is responsible only for: 1. The supervision of field work at sites where that agent’s license was used to obtain the building permit. 2. Any other work for which that agent accepts responsibility. A secondary qualifying agent is not responsible for supervision of financial matters. (3)(a) A qualifying agent who has been designated by a joint agreement as the sole primary qualifying agent for a business organization may terminate that status by giving actual notice to the business organization, to the department, and to all secondary qualifying agents of the agent’s intention to terminate that status. Notice to the department must include proof satisfactory to the department that the agent has given the notice required in this paragraph. (b) The status of the qualifying agent shall cease upon the designation of a new primary qualifying agent or 60 days after satisfactory notice of termination has been provided to the department, whichever first occurs. (c) If no new primary qualifying agent has been designated within 60 days, all secondary qualifying agents for the business organization shall become primary qualifying agents unless the joint agreement specifies that one or more of them shall become sole qualifying agents under such circumstances, in which case only they shall become sole qualifying agents. (d) Any change in the status of a qualifying agent is prospective only. A qualifying agent is not responsible for any predecessor’s actions but is responsible, even after a change in status, for all matters that were the agent’s own responsibility while in a particular status.
