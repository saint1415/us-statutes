The board shall award any funds specifically appropriated for the program to reimburse expenses or issue bonus payments as provided in this section. (2) A local law enforcement agency may apply to the State Board of Immigration Enforcement for reimbursement of expenses incurred in its cooperation and coordination with federal immigration agencies in the enforcement of federal immigration laws. Reimbursements may be requested for the following eligible expenses: (a) Subletting detention beds to the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The local law enforcement agency may apply for a bonus of up to $1,000 for each local law enforcement officer employed within that agency. The local law enforcement agency must certify to the board that the local law enforcement officer participated in one or more operations and provide any information required by the board. Eligible participation does not include operations occurring solely at state correctional facilities or county detention facilities. (b) The bonus payment shall be adjusted to include 7.65 percent for the officers’ share of Federal Insurance Contribution Act tax on the bonus. (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), and for the 2025-2026 fiscal year, a local law enforcement agency may apply to the State Board of Immigration Enforcement to provide bonus payments for the agency’s certified correctional officers under s. 943.10(2), who are a warrant service officer under s. 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. s. 1357 or an immigration officer under the jail enforcement model under s. 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. s. 1357.

Eligible participation does not include operations occurring solely at state correctional facilities. This paragraph expires July 1, 2026. (4)(a) Grants shall be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis based on the date the State Board of Immigration Enforcement received each completed application. The board shall establish application procedures and eligibility requirements to request reimbursement of eligible expenses or to provide bonus payments, after considering recommendations of the State Immigration Enforcement Council related to funding criteria.

Upon approval, the board must provide notification in writing to the chair and vice chair of the Legislative Budget Commission at least 14 days before a grant may be issued to a local law enforcement agency under the program. Notwithstanding s. 216.177(2)(b), the chair or vice chair of the Legislative Budget Commission may timely object in writing, which shall void such action until the Legislative Budget Commission or the Legislature addresses the issue. (5) The total amount of grants awarded may not exceed funding appropriated for the grant program. In order to efficiently and effectively disburse the funds, the State Board of Immigration Enforcement may not duplicate benefits and grants may not be awarded to pay for any activity for which the agency has received or expects to receive federal or other funding. (6) Local law enforcement agencies shall assist the State Board of Immigration Enforcement with the collection of any data necessary to determine bonus payment amounts and to distribute the bonus payments and shall otherwise provide the board with any information or assistance needed to fulfill the requirements of this section.

This subsection applies to an official, representative, agent, or employee of the entity or agency only when he or she is acting within the scope of his or her official duties or within the scope of his or her employment. (2) Except as otherwise expressly prohibited by federal law, a state entity, local governmental entity, or law enforcement agency, or an employee, an agent, or a representative of the entity or agency, may not prohibit or in any way restrict a law enforcement agency from taking any of the following actions with respect to information regarding a person’s immigration status: (a) Sending the information to or requesting, receiving, or reviewing the information from a federal immigration agency for purposes of this chapter.

(3) A state entity, local governmental entity, or law enforcement agency may not prohibit or in any way restrict a law enforcement officer from executing or assisting in the execution of a lawful judicial warrant. (4)(a) For purposes of this subsection, the term “applicable criminal case” means a criminal case in which: 1. The judgment requires the defendant to be confined in a secure correctional facility; and 2. The judge: a. Indicates in the record under s. 908.105 that the defendant is subject to an immigration detainer; or b. Otherwise indicates in the record that the defendant is subject to a transfer into federal custody. (b) In an applicable criminal case, when the judge sentences a defendant who is the subject of an immigration detainer to confinement, the judge shall issue an order requiring the secure correctional facility in which the defendant is to be confined to reduce the defendant’s sentence by a period of not more than 12 days on the facility’s determination that the reduction in sentence will facilitate the seamless transfer of the defendant into federal custody. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “secure correctional facility” means a state correctional institution as defined in s. 944.02 or a county detention facility or a municipal detention facility as defined in s. 951.23. (c) If the information specified in sub-subparagraph (a)2.a. or sub-subparagraph (a)2.b. is not available at the time the sentence is pronounced in the case, but is received by a law enforcement agency afterwards, the law enforcement agency shall notify the judge who shall issue the order described by paragraph (b) as soon as the information becomes available. (5) When a county correctional facility or the Department of Corrections receives verification from a federal immigration agency that a person subject to an immigration detainer is in the law enforcement agency’s custody, the agency may securely transport the person to a federal facility in this state or to another point of transfer to federal custody outside the jurisdiction of the law enforcement agency. The law enforcement agency may transfer a person who is subject to an immigration detainer and is confined in a secure correctional facility to the custody of a federal immigration agency not earlier than 12 days before his or her release date. A law enforcement agency shall obtain judicial authorization before securely transporting an alien to a point of transfer outside of this state. (6) Upon request from a federal immigration agency, a sheriff or chief correctional officer operating a county detention facility must provide the requesting federal immigration agency a list of all inmates booked into a county detention facility and any information regarding each inmate’s immigration status. (7) This section does not require a state entity, local governmental entity, or law enforcement agency to provide a federal immigration agency with information related to a victim of or a witness to a criminal offense if: (a) The victim or witness is necessary to the investigation or prosecution of a crime, and such crime occurred in the United States; and (b) The victim or witness timely and in good faith responds to the entity’s or agency’s request for information and cooperates in the investigation or prosecution of such offense. (8) A state entity, local governmental entity, or law enforcement agency that, pursuant to subsection (7), withholds information regarding the immigration information of a victim of or witness to a criminal offense shall document the victim’s or witness’s cooperation in the entity’s or agency’s investigative records related to the offense and shall retain the records for at least 10 years for the purpose of audit, verification, or inspection by the Auditor General. (9) This section does not authorize a law enforcement agency to detain an alien unlawfully present in the United States pursuant to an immigration detainer solely because the alien witnessed or reported a crime or was a victim of a criminal offense. (10) This section does not apply to any alien unlawfully present in the United States if he or she is or has been a necessary witness or victim of a crime of domestic violence, rape, sexual exploitation, sexual assault, murder, manslaughter, assault, battery, human trafficking, kidnapping, false imprisonment, involuntary servitude, fraud in foreign labor contracting, blackmail, extortion, or witness tampering, provided that such crime was committed in the United States. Documentation, including, but not limited to, police reports, testimony, sworn statements, or a victim impact statement, must be relied upon to verify that the person was a necessary witness or victim to the crime.

(3) A judge who receives notice that a person is subject to an immigration detainer shall cause the fact to be recorded in the court record, regardless of whether the notice is received before or after a judgment in the case. (4)(a) If any county, district, authority, municipality, or other local government adopts an ordinance, a regulation, a rule, or a policy refusing to comply with or otherwise directing local officials, employees, or others to refuse to comply with an immigration detainer issued by a federal immigration agency, the Attorney General must initiate judicial proceedings in the name of the state in order to enforce compliance. The court, upon finding noncompliance with this subsection, shall declare invalid the improper ordinance, regulation, rule, or policy and issue a permanent injunction against the local government prohibiting it from enforcing such ordinance, regulation, rule, or policy. It is not a defense that in enacting the ordinance, regulation, rule, or policy the local government was acting in good faith or upon advice of counsel. (b) If the court determines that a violation was knowing and willful, the court must assess a civil fine of up to $5,000 against the elected or appointed local government official or officials or administrative agency head under whose jurisdiction the violation occurred.
