Any request for additional information must be made by the office within 30 days after initial receipt of the written notice. Additional information must be submitted within 60 days after a request has been made by the office. Failure to respond to such request within 60 days after the date of the request is a ground for denial of the qualification. A notice is not deemed complete until all requested information has been submitted to the office. Upon deeming the notice complete, the office has 120 days to qualify the proposed qualified limited service affiliate or issue a denial. An order denying a qualification must contain notice of opportunity for a hearing pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57. (3) A qualification under this part must be summarily suspended by the office if the qualified limited service affiliate made a material false statement in the written notice. The summary suspension must remain in effect until a final order is entered by the office. For purposes of s. 120.60(6), a material false statement made in the qualified limited service affiliate’s written notice constitutes an immediate and serious danger to the public health, safety, and welfare. If a qualified limited service affiliate made a material false statement in the written notice, the office must enter a final order revoking the qualification and may issue a fine as prescribed by s. 655.041 or issue an order of suspension, removal, or prohibition under s. 655.037 to a financial institution-affiliated party of the qualified limited service affiliate. (4) The qualified limited service affiliate shall suspend the permissible activities provided in s. 663.531 relating to a specific jurisdiction if the qualified limited service affiliate becomes aware that the jurisdiction of an international trust entity served by the qualified limited service affiliate is included on the Financial Action Task Force’s list of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action or list of Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring. Suspensions under this subsection must remain in effect until the jurisdiction is removed from the Financial Action Task Force’s list of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action or list of Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring. (5) Upon the filing of a completed qualification notice under this section, the office shall make an investigation of the character, reputation, business experience, and business qualifications of the proposed qualified limited service affiliate’s proposed directors, executive officers, principal shareholder, managers, managing members, or equivalent positions. The office shall approve the qualification only if it has determined that such persons are qualified by reason of their ability, reputation, and integrity and have sufficient experience to manage and direct the affairs of the qualified limited service affiliate in a lawful manner and in accordance with the requirements for obtaining and maintaining a qualification under this part. When evaluating a qualification notice, the office may consider factors reasonably related to an offense or related to a violation, fine, or penalty, such as mitigating factors, history of multiple violations, severity of the offense, and showings of rehabilitation. (6) A qualification is not transferable or assignable. (7) No later than March 31, 2018, a person or entity that previously qualified under the moratorium in former s. 663.041 must seek qualification as a qualified limited service affiliate or cease doing business in this state. Notwithstanding the expiration of the moratorium under former s. 663.041, a person or entity that previously qualified under such moratorium may remain open and in operation but shall refrain from engaging in new lines of business in this state until qualified as a qualified limited service affiliate under this part.
