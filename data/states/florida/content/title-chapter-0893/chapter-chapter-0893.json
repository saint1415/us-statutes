The term does not include hemp as defined in s. 581.217 or industrial hemp as defined in s. 1004.4473.(4)“Controlled substance” means any substance named or described in Schedules I-V of s. 893.03. Laws controlling the manufacture, distribution, preparation, dispensing, or administration of such substances are drug abuse laws.(5)“Cultivating” means the preparation of any soil or hydroponic medium for the planting of a controlled substance or the tending and care or harvesting of a controlled substance.(6)“Deliver” or “delivery” means the actual, constructive, or attempted transfer from one person to another of a controlled substance, whether or not there is an agency relationship.(7)“Dispense” means the transfer of possession of one or more doses of a medicinal drug by a pharmacist or other licensed practitioner to the ultimate consumer thereof or to one who represents that it is his or her intention not to consume or use the same but to transfer the same to the ultimate consumer or user for consumption by the ultimate consumer or user.(8)“Distribute” means to deliver, other than by administering or dispensing, a controlled substance.(9)“Distributor” means a person who distributes.(10)“Department” means the Department of Health.(11)“Homologue” means a chemical compound in a series in which each compound differs by one or more repeating hydrocarbon functional group units at any single point within the compound.(12)“Hospital” means an institution for the care and treatment of the sick and injured, licensed pursuant to the provisions of chapter 395 or owned or operated by the state or Federal Government.(13)“Laboratory” means a laboratory approved by the Drug Enforcement Administration as proper to be entrusted with the custody of controlled substances for scientific, medical, or instructional purposes or to aid law enforcement officers and prosecuting attorneys in the enforcement of this chapter.(14)“Listed chemical” means any precursor chemical or essential chemical named or described in s. 893.033.(15)(a)“Manufacture” means the production, preparation, propagation, compounding, cultivating, growing, conversion, or processing of a controlled substance, either directly or indirectly, by extraction from substances of natural origin, or independently by means of chemical synthesis, or by a combination of extraction and chemical synthesis, and includes any packaging of the substance or labeling or relabeling of its container, except that this term does not include the preparation, compounding, packaging, or labeling of a controlled substance by:1.A practitioner or pharmacist as an incident to his or her administering or delivering of a controlled substance in the course of his or her professional practice.2.A practitioner, or by his or her authorized agent under the practitioner’s supervision, for the purpose of, or as an incident to, research, teaching, or chemical analysis, and not for sale.(b)“Manufacturer” means and includes every person who prepares, derives, produces, compounds, or repackages any drug as defined by the Florida Drug and Cosmetic Act. However, this definition does not apply to manufacturers of patent or proprietary preparations as defined in the Florida Pharmacy Act. Pharmacies, and pharmacists employed thereby, are specifically excluded from this definition.(16)“Mixture” means any physical combination of two or more substances, including, but not limited to, a blend, an aggregation, a suspension, an emulsion, a solution, or a dosage unit, whether or not such combination can be separated into its components by physical means, whether mechanical or thermal.(17)“Nitrogen-heterocyclic analog” means an analog of a controlled substance which has a single carbon atom in a cyclic structure of a compound replaced by a nitrogen atom.(18)“Patient” means an individual to whom a controlled substance is lawfully dispensed or administered pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.(19)“Pharmacist” means a person who is licensed pursuant to chapter 465 to practice the profession of pharmacy in this state.(20)“Positional isomer” means any substance that possesses the same molecular formula and core structure and that has the same functional group or substituent as those found in the respective controlled substance, attached at any positions on the core structure, but in such manner that no new chemical functionalities are created and no existing chemical functionalities are destroyed relative to the respective controlled substance. Rearrangements of alkyl moieties within or between functional groups or substituents, or divisions or combinations of alkyl moieties, which do not create new chemical functionalities or destroy existing chemical functionalities, are allowed and include resulting compounds that are positional isomers. As used in this definition, the term “core structure” means the parent molecule that is the common basis for the class that includes, but is not limited to, tryptamine, phenethylamine, or ergoline. Examples of rearrangements resulting in creation or destruction of chemical functionalities, and therefore resulting in compounds that are not positional isomers, include, but are not limited to, ethoxy to alpha-hydroxyethyl, hydroxy and methyl to methoxy, or the repositioning of a phenolic or alcoholic hydroxy group to create a hydroxyamine. Examples of rearrangements resulting in compounds that would be positional isomers, include, but are not limited to, tert-butyl to sec-butyl, methoxy and ethyl to isopropoxy, N,N-diethyl to N-methyl-N-propyl, or alpha-methylamino to N-methylamino.(21)“Possession” includes temporary possession for the purpose of verification or testing, irrespective of dominion or control.(22)“Potential for abuse” means that a substance has properties of a central nervous system stimulant or depressant or an hallucinogen that create a substantial likelihood of its being:(a)Used in amounts that create a hazard to the user’s health or the safety of the community;(b)Diverted from legal channels and distributed through illegal channels; or(c)Taken on the user’s own initiative rather than on the basis of professional medical advice.Proof of potential for abuse can be based upon a showing that these activities are already taking place, or upon a showing that the nature and properties of the substance make it reasonable to assume that there is a substantial likelihood that such activities will take place, in other than isolated or occasional instances.(23)“Practitioner” means a physician licensed under chapter 458, a dentist licensed under chapter 466, a veterinarian licensed under chapter 474, an osteopathic physician licensed under chapter 459, an advanced practice registered nurse licensed under chapter 464, a naturopath licensed under chapter 462, a certified optometrist licensed under chapter 463, a psychiatric nurse as defined in s. 394.455, a podiatric physician licensed under chapter 461, or a physician assistant licensed under chapter 458 or chapter 459, provided such practitioner holds a valid federal controlled substance registry number.(24)“Prescription” includes any order for drugs or medicinal supplies which is written or transmitted by any means of communication by a licensed practitioner authorized by the laws of this state to prescribe such drugs or medicinal supplies, is issued in good faith and in the course of professional practice, is intended to be dispensed by a person authorized by the laws of this state to do so, and meets the requirements of s. 893.04.(a)The term also includes an order for drugs or medicinal supplies transmitted or written by a physician, dentist, veterinarian, or other practitioner licensed to practice in a state other than Florida, but only if the pharmacist called upon to fill such an order determines, in the exercise of his or her professional judgment, that the order was issued pursuant to a valid patient-physician relationship, that it is authentic, and that the drugs or medicinal supplies ordered are considered necessary for the continuation of treatment of a chronic or recurrent illness.(b)If the physician writing the prescription is not known to the pharmacist, the pharmacist shall obtain proof to a reasonable certainty of the validity of the prescription.(c)A prescription for a controlled substance may not be issued on the same prescription blank with another prescription for a controlled substance that is named or described in a different schedule or with another prescription for a medicinal drug, as defined in s. 465.003, that is not a controlled substance.(25)“Wholesaler” means any person who acts as a jobber, wholesale merchant, or broker, or an agent thereof, who sells or distributes for resale any drug as defined by the Florida Drug and Cosmetic Act. However, this definition does not apply to persons who sell only patent or proprietary preparations as defined in the Florida Pharmacy Act. Pharmacies, and pharmacists employed thereby, are specifically excluded from this definition.History.—s. 2, ch. 73-331; s. 1, ch. 75-18; s. 470, ch. 77-147; s. 1, ch. 77-174; s. 184, ch. 79-164; s. 1, ch. 79-325; s. 37, ch. 82-225; s. 169, ch. 83-216; s. 1, ch. 85-242; s. 1, ch. 91-279; s. 1, ch. 92-19; s. 1434, ch. 97-102; s. 104, ch. 97-264; s. 234, ch. 98-166; s. 300, ch. 99-8; s. 10, ch. 99-186; s. 1, ch. 2000-320; s. 3, ch. 2001-55; s. 10, ch. 2002-78; s. 13, ch. 2005-128; s. 1, ch. 2008-184; s. 18, ch. 2010-117; s. 1, ch. 2011-73; s. 12, ch. 2013-26; s. 5, ch. 2014-157; s. 1, ch. 2016-105; s. 5, ch. 2016-145; s. 18, ch. 2016-224; s. 9, ch. 2016-231; ss. 1, 10, ch. 2017-232; s. 83, ch. 2018-106; s. 2, ch. 2019-132; s. 1, ch. 2019-166; s. 2, ch. 2021-154; s. 26, ch. 2022-35; s. 3, ch. 2023-299.1Note.—Section 1, ch. 2017-232, provides that “[i]t is the intent of the Legislature to implement s. 29, Article X of the State Constitution by creating a unified regulatory structure.
