(2) INVOLUNTARY ADMISSION.— (a) Whenever notice is required to be given under this part, such notice shall be given to the individual and the individual’s guardian, guardian advocate, health care surrogate or proxy, attorney, and representative. 1. When notice is required to be given to an individual, it shall be given both orally and in writing, in the language and terminology that the individual can understand, and, if needed, the facility shall provide an interpreter for the individual. 2. Notice to an individual’s guardian, guardian advocate, health care surrogate or proxy, attorney, and representative shall be given by mail with the date, time, and method of notice delivery documented in the clinical record. Hand delivery by a facility employee may be used as an alternative, with the date and time of delivery documented in the clinical record. If notice is given by a state attorney or an attorney for the department, a certificate of service is sufficient to document service. (b) A receiving facility shall give prompt notice of the whereabouts of an individual who is being involuntarily held for examination to the individual’s guardian, guardian advocate, health care surrogate or proxy, attorney or representative, or other emergency contact identified through electronic databases pursuant to s. 394.463(2)(a), by telephone or in person within 24 hours after the individual’s arrival at the facility. Contact attempts shall be documented in the individual’s clinical record and shall begin as soon as reasonably possible after the individual’s arrival. (c)1. A receiving facility shall give notice of the whereabouts of a minor who is being involuntarily held for examination pursuant to s. 394.463 to the minor’s parent, guardian, caregiver, or guardian advocate, in person or by telephone or other form of electronic communication, immediately after the minor’s arrival at the facility. The facility may delay notification for no more than 24 hours after the minor’s arrival if the facility has submitted a report to the central abuse hotline, pursuant to s. 39.201, based upon knowledge or suspicion of abuse, abandonment, or neglect and if the facility deems a delay in notification to be in the minor’s best interest. 2. The receiving facility shall attempt to notify the minor’s parent, guardian, caregiver, or guardian advocate until the receiving facility receives confirmation from the parent, guardian, caregiver, or guardian advocate, verbally, by telephone or other form of electronic communication, or by recorded message, that notification has been received. Attempts to notify the parent, guardian, caregiver, or guardian advocate must be repeated at least once every hour during the first 12 hours after the minor’s arrival and once every 24 hours thereafter and must continue until such confirmation is received, unless the minor is released at the end of the 72-hour examination period, or until a petition for involuntary services is filed with the court pursuant to s. 394.463(2)(g). The receiving facility may seek assistance from a law enforcement agency to notify the minor’s parent, guardian, caregiver, or guardian advocate if the facility has not received within the first 24 hours after the minor’s arrival a confirmation by the parent, guardian, caregiver, or guardian advocate that notification has been received. The receiving facility must document notification attempts in the minor’s clinical record. (d) The written notice of the filing of the petition for involuntary services for an individual being held must contain the following: 1. Notice that the petition for involuntary services pursuant to s. 394.4655 or s. 394.467 has been filed with the circuit or county court, as applicable, and the address of such court. 2. Notice that the office of the public defender has been appointed to represent the individual in the proceeding, if the individual is not otherwise represented by counsel. 3. The date, time, and place of the hearing and the name of each examining expert and every other person expected to testify in support of continued detention. 4. Notice that the individual, the individual’s guardian, guardian advocate, health care surrogate or proxy, or representative, or the administrator may apply for a change of venue for the convenience of the parties or witnesses or because of the condition of the individual. 5. Notice that the individual is entitled to an independent expert examination and, if the individual cannot afford such an examination, that the court will provide for one. (e) A treatment facility shall provide notice of an individual’s involuntary admission on the next regular working day after the individual’s arrival at the facility. (f) When an individual is to be transferred from one facility to another, notice shall be given by the facility where the individual is located before the transfer.

(b)1. The designated law enforcement agency may decline to transport the person to a receiving facility only if: a. The jurisdiction designated by the county has contracted on an annual basis with an emergency medical transport service or private transport company for transportation of persons to receiving facilities pursuant to this section at the sole cost of the county or as otherwise provided in the transportation plan developed by the county; and b. The law enforcement agency and the emergency medical transport service or private transport company agree that the continued presence of law enforcement personnel is not necessary for the safety of the person or others. 2. The entity providing transportation may seek reimbursement for transportation expenses. The party responsible for payment for such transportation is the person receiving the transportation. The county shall seek reimbursement from the following sources in the following order: a. From a private or public third-party payor, if the person receiving the transportation has applicable coverage. b. From the person receiving the transportation. c. From a financial settlement for medical care, treatment, hospitalization, or transportation payable or accruing to the injured party. (c) A company that transports a patient pursuant to this subsection is considered an independent contractor and is solely liable for the safe and dignified transport of the patient. Such company must be insured and provide no less than $100,000 in liability insurance with respect to the transport of patients. (d) Any company that contracts with a governing board of a county to transport patients shall comply with the applicable rules of the department to ensure the safety and dignity of patients. (e) When a law enforcement officer takes custody of a person pursuant to this part, the officer may request assistance from emergency medical personnel if such assistance is needed for the safety of the officer or the person in custody. (f) When a member of a mental health overlay program or a mobile crisis response service is a professional authorized to initiate an involuntary examination pursuant to s. 394.463 or s. 397.675 and that professional evaluates a person and determines that transportation to a receiving facility is needed, the service, at its discretion, may transport the person to the facility or may call on the law enforcement agency or other transportation arrangement best suited to the needs of the patient. (g) When any law enforcement officer has custody of a person based on either noncriminal or minor criminal behavior that meets the statutory guidelines for involuntary examination pursuant to s. 394.463, the law enforcement officer shall transport the person to the appropriate facility within the designated receiving system pursuant to a transportation plan. Persons who meet the statutory guidelines for involuntary admission pursuant to s. 397.675 may also be transported by law enforcement officers to the extent resources are available and as otherwise provided by law. Such persons shall be transported to an appropriate facility within the designated receiving system pursuant to a transportation plan. (h) When any law enforcement officer has arrested a person for a felony and it appears that the person meets the statutory guidelines for involuntary examination or placement under this part, such person must first be processed in the same manner as any other criminal suspect. The law enforcement agency shall thereafter immediately notify the appropriate facility within the designated receiving system pursuant to a transportation plan. The receiving facility shall be responsible for promptly arranging for the examination and treatment of the person. A receiving facility is not required to admit a person charged with a crime for whom the facility determines and documents that it is unable to provide adequate security, but shall provide examination and treatment to the person where he or she is held or by telehealth. (i) If the appropriate law enforcement officer believes that a person has an emergency medical condition as defined in s. 395.002, the person may be first transported to a hospital for emergency medical treatment, regardless of whether the hospital is a designated receiving facility. (j) The costs of transportation, evaluation, hospitalization, and treatment incurred under this subsection by persons who have been arrested for violations of any state law or county or municipal ordinance may be recovered as provided in s. 901.35. (k) The appropriate facility within the designated receiving system pursuant to a transportation plan must accept persons brought by law enforcement officers, or an emergency medical transport service or a private transport company authorized by the county, for involuntary examination pursuant to s. 394.463. (l) The appropriate facility within the designated receiving system pursuant to a transportation plan must provide persons brought by law enforcement officers, or an emergency medical transport service or a private transport company authorized by the county, pursuant to s. 397.675, a basic screening or triage sufficient to refer the person to the appropriate services. (m) Each law enforcement agency designated pursuant to paragraph (a) shall establish a policy that reflects a single set of protocols for the safe and secure transportation and transfer of custody of the person. Each law enforcement agency shall provide a copy of the protocols to the managing entity. (n) When a jurisdiction has entered into a contract with an emergency medical transport service or a private transport company for transportation of persons to facilities within the designated receiving system, such service or company shall be given preference for transportation of persons from nursing homes, assisted living facilities, adult day care centers, or adult family-care homes, unless the behavior of the person being transported is such that transportation by a law enforcement officer is necessary. (o) This section may not be construed to limit emergency examination and treatment of incapacitated persons provided in accordance with s. 401.445. (2) TRANSPORTATION TO A TREATMENT FACILITY.— (a) If neither the patient nor any person legally obligated or responsible for the patient is able to pay for the expense of transporting a voluntary or involuntary patient to a treatment facility, the transportation plan established by the governing board of the county or counties must specify how the hospitalized patient will be transported to, from, and between facilities in a safe and dignified manner. (b) A company that transports a patient pursuant to this subsection is considered an independent contractor and is solely liable for the safe and dignified transportation of the patient. Such company must be insured and provide no less than $100,000 in liability insurance with respect to the transport of patients. (c) A company that contracts with one or more counties to transport patients in accordance with this section shall comply with the applicable rules of the department to ensure the safety and dignity of patients. (d) County or municipal law enforcement and correctional personnel and equipment may not be used to transport patients adjudicated incapacitated or found by the court to meet the criteria for involuntary services pursuant to s. 394.467, except in small rural counties where there are no cost-efficient alternatives. (3) TRANSFER OF CUSTODY.—Custody of a person who is transported pursuant to this part, along with related documentation, shall be relinquished to a responsible individual at the appropriate receiving or treatment facility.
