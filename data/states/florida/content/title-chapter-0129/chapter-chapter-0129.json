(2) The County Transportation Trust Fund budget shall contain an estimate of receipts by source and balances as provided herein, and an itemized estimate of expenditures that need to be incurred to carry on all work on roads and bridges in the county except that provided for in the capital outlay reserve fund budget and in district budgets pursuant to this chapter, and of unpaid vouchers of the County Transportation Trust Fund; also of the reserve for contingencies and the balance, as hereinbefore provided, which should be carried forward at the end of the year. (3) The budget for the county fine and forfeiture fund shall contain an estimate of receipts by source and balances as provided herein, and an itemized estimate of expenditures that need to be incurred to carry on all criminal prosecution, and all other law enforcement functions and activities of the county now or hereafter authorized by law, and of indebtedness of the county fine and forfeiture fund; also of the reserve for contingencies and the balance, as hereinbefore provided, which should be carried forward at the end of the year. (4)(a) Capital outlay reserve fund budget shall contain an estimate of receipts by source, including any taxes authorized by law to be levied for that purpose, and including any balance brought forward as provided for herein; and an itemized estimate of expenditures for capital purposes to give effect to general improvement programs. It shall be a plan for the expenditure of funds for capital purposes, showing as income the revenues, special assessments, borrowings, receipts from sale of capital assets, free surpluses, and down payment appropriation to be applied to the cost of a capital project or projects, expenses of issuance of obligations, engineering, supervision, contracts, and any other related expenditures. It may contain also an estimate for the reserves as hereinbefore provided and for a reserve for future construction and improvements. No expenditures or obligations shall be incurred for capital purposes except as appropriated in this budget, except for the preliminary expense of plans, specifications and estimates. (b) Under the provision herein set forth, a separate capital budget may be adopted for each special district included within the county budget, or a consolidated capital budget may be adopted providing for the consolidation of capital projects of the county and of the special districts included within the county budget into one budget, treating borrowed funds and other receipts as special revenue earmarked for capital projects as separately itemized appropriation for each district special project or county project, as the case may be. (c) Any funds in the capital budget not required to meet the current construction cost of any project may be invested in any securities of the Federal Government or in securities of any county of the state pledging the full faith and credit of such county or pledging such county’s share of the gas tax provided for in s. 16, Art. IX of the State Constitution of 1885 as adopted by the State Constitution or in s. 9, Art. XII of the State Constitution. (5) A bond interest and sinking fund budget shall be made for each county and for each special district included within the county budget having bonds outstanding. The budget shall contain an estimate of receipts by source, including any taxes authorized by law to be levied for that purpose, and including any balances brought forward as provided herein; and an itemized estimate of expenditures and reserves as follows: The bond interest and principal maturities in the year for which the budget is made shall be determined and estimates for expenses connected with the payments of such bonds and coupons, commissions of the tax collector, and of the property appraiser, and expenses of refunding operations, if any are contemplated, shall be appropriated. A sufficient “cash balance to be carried over” may be reserved as set forth hereinbefore. The sinking fund requirements provided for in the said reserve may be carried over either in cash or in securities of the Federal Government and of the local governments in Florida, or both. (6) For each special district included within the county budget, the budget must show budgeted revenues and expenditures by organizational unit which are at least at the level of detail required for the annual financial report under s. 218.32(1). The amount available from taxation and other sources, including balances brought forward from prior fiscal years, must equal the total appropriations for expenditures and reserves. The budget must include expenditures necessary to carry on all functions and activities of the special district as provided by law, including the indebtedness of the special district and the provision for required reserves.

In preparing the budget, the figure so certified shall be used as the basis for estimating the millage rate required to be levied and shall be noted on each tentative budget and each official budget, on the same line with the amount estimated to be raised from taxes. (2) On or before June 1 of each year, the sheriff, the clerk of the circuit court and county comptroller, the tax collector subject to a resolution entered into pursuant to s. 145.022(1), and the supervisor of elections shall each submit to the board of county commissioners a tentative budget for their respective offices for the ensuing fiscal year. However, the board of county commissioners may, by resolution, require the tentative budgets to be submitted by May 1 of each year. (3) The county budget officer, after tentatively ascertaining the proposed fiscal policies of the board for the next fiscal year, shall prepare and present to the board a tentative budget for the next fiscal year for each of the funds provided in this chapter, including all estimated receipts, taxes to be levied, and balances expected to be brought forward and all estimated expenditures, reserves, and balances to be carried over at the end of the year. (a) The board of county commissioners shall receive and examine the tentative budget for each fund and, subject to the notice and hearing requirements of s. 200.065, shall require such changes to be made as it deems necessary, provided the budget remains in balance. The county budget officer’s estimates of receipts other than taxes, and of balances to be brought forward, may not be revised except by a resolution of the board, duly passed and spread on the minutes of the board. However, the board may allocate to any of the funds of the county any anticipated receipts, other than taxes levied for a particular fund, except receipts designated or received to be expended for a particular purpose. (b) Upon receipt of the tentative budgets and completion of any revisions, the board shall prepare a statement summarizing all of the adopted tentative budgets. The summary statement must show, for each budget and the total of all budgets, the proposed tax millages, balances, reserves, and the total of each major classification of receipts and expenditures, classified according to the uniform classification of accounts adopted by the appropriate state agency. The board shall cause this summary statement to be advertised one time in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county, or by posting at the courthouse door if there is no such newspaper, and the advertisement must appear adjacent to the advertisement required pursuant to s. 200.065. (c) The board shall hold public hearings to adopt tentative and final budgets pursuant to s. 200.065. The hearings shall be primarily for the purpose of hearing requests and complaints from the public regarding the budgets and the proposed tax levies and for explaining the budget and any proposed or adopted amendments. The tentative budget must be posted on the county’s official website at least 2 days before the public hearing to consider such budget and must remain on the website for at least 45 days. The final budget must be posted on the website within 30 days after adoption and must remain on the website for at least 2 years. The tentative budgets, adopted tentative budgets, and final budgets shall be filed in the office of the county auditor as a public record. Sufficient reference in words and figures to identify the particular transactions must be made in the minutes of the board to record its actions with reference to the budgets. (d) By each October 15, the county budget officer shall electronically submit the following information regarding the final budget and the county’s economic status to the Office of Economic and Demographic Research in the format specified by the office: 1. Government spending per resident, including, at a minimum, the spending per resident for the previous 5 fiscal years. 2. Government debt per resident, including, at a minimum, the debt per resident for the previous 5 fiscal years. 3. Median income within the county. 4. The average county employee salary. 5. Percent of budget spent on salaries and benefits for county employees. 6. Number of special taxing districts, wholly or partially, within the county. 7. Annual county expenditures providing for the financing, acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of housing that is affordable, as that term is defined in s. 420.0004. The reported expenditures must indicate the source of such funds as “federal,” “state,” “local,” or “other,” as applicable. The information required by this subparagraph must be included in the submission due by October 15, 2020, and each annual submission thereafter.

(a) The modified-accrual basis or accrual basis of accounting must be followed for all funds in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. (b) The cost of the investments provided in this chapter, or the receipts from their sale or redemption, may not be treated as expense or income, and the investments on hand at the beginning or end of each fiscal year must be carried as separate items at cost in the fund balances; however, the amounts of profit or loss received on their sale must be treated as income or expense, as applicable. (2) The board at any time within a fiscal year may amend a budget for that year, and may within the first 60 days of a fiscal year amend the budget for the prior fiscal year, as follows: (a) Appropriations for expenditures within any fund may be decreased or increased by motion recorded in the minutes if the total appropriations of the fund does not change. The board of county commissioners may establish procedures by which the designated budget officer may authorize budget amendments if the total appropriations of the fund does not change. (b) Appropriations from the reserve for contingencies may be made to increase the appropriation for any particular expense in the same fund, or to create an appropriation in the fund for any lawful purpose, but expenditures may not be charged directly to the reserve for contingencies. (c) The reserve for future construction and improvements may be appropriated by resolution of the board for the purposes for which the reserve was made. (d) A receipt of a nature from a source not anticipated in the budget and received for a particular purpose, including but not limited to grants, donations, gifts, or reimbursement for damages, may, by resolution of the board spread on its minutes, be appropriated and expended for that purpose, in addition to the appropriations and expenditures provided for in the budget. Such receipts and appropriations must be added to the budget of the proper fund. The resolution may amend the budget to transfer revenue between funds to properly account for unanticipated revenue. (e) Increased receipts for enterprise or proprietary funds received for a particular purpose may, by resolution of the board spread on its minutes, be appropriated and expended for that purpose, in addition to the appropriations and expenditures provided for in the budget. The resolution may amend the budget to transfer revenue between funds to properly account for increased receipts. (f) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, if an amendment to a budget is required for a purpose not specifically authorized in paragraphs (a)-(e), the amendment may be authorized by resolution or ordinance of the board of county commissioners adopted following a public hearing. 1. The public hearing must be advertised at least 2 days, but not more than 5 days, before the date of the hearing. The advertisement must appear in a newspaper of paid general circulation and must identify the name of the taxing authority, the date, place, and time of the hearing, and the purpose of the hearing. The advertisement must also identify each budgetary fund to be amended, the source of the funds, the use of the funds, and the total amount of each fund’s appropriations. 2. If the board amends the budget pursuant to this paragraph, the adopted amendment must be posted on the county’s official website within 5 days after adoption and must remain on the website for at least 2 years. (3) Only the following transfers may be made between funds: (a) Transfers to correct errors in handling receipts and disbursements. (b) Budgeted transfers. (c) Transfers to properly account for unanticipated revenue or increased receipts. (4) All unexpended balances of appropriations at the end of the fiscal year shall revert to the fund from which the appropriation was made, but reserves for sinking funds and for future construction and improvements may not be diverted to other purposes. (5) Any county constitutional officer whose budget is approved by the board of county commissioners, who has not been reelected to office or is not seeking reelection, shall be prohibited from making any budget amendments, transferring funds between itemized appropriations, or expending in a single month more than one-twelfth of any itemized approved appropriation, following the date he or she is eliminated as a candidate or October 1, whichever comes later, without approval of the board of county commissioners.
