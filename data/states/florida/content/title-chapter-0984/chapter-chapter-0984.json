      "text": "984.09 Punishment for contempt of court; alternative sanctions.— (1) CONTEMPT OF COURT; LEGISLATIVE INTENT.—The court may punish any child for contempt for interfering with the court or with court administration, or for violating any provision of this chapter or order of the court relative thereto. It is the intent of the Legislature that the court restrict and limit the use of contempt powers and prohibit the use of detention care and secure detention facilities as provided in s. 984.0861. A child who commits direct contempt of court or indirect contempt of a valid court order may be taken into custody and ordered to serve an alternative sanction or placed in a shelter facility, as authorized in this section, by order of the court. (2) PLACEMENT IN A SHELTER.—A child adjudicated as a child in need of services may only be placed in a shelter for purposes of punishment for contempt of court if alternative sanctions are unavailable or inappropriate, or if the child has already been ordered to serve an alternative sanction but failed to comply with the sanction. (a) A child in need of services who has been held in direct contempt or indirect contempt may be placed, for 5 days for a first offense or 15 days for a second or subsequent offense, in a shelter operated by or contracted with the department to provide such services. In addition to disposition under this paragraph, a child in need of services who is held in direct contempt or indirect contempt may be placed in a physically secure shelter as provided under s. 984.226 if conditions of eligibility are met. (b) A child subject to proceedings under s. 984.151 who has been held in direct contempt or indirect contempt may only be placed, for 5 days for a first offense or 15 days for a second or subsequent offense, in a shelter operated by or contracted with the department for such services if a shelter bed is available. Upon a second or subsequent finding of contempt under this section, the court must refer the child to the case staffing committee with a recommendation to file a child in need of services petition. (c) Any shelter placement ordered under this section must be given as a cumulative sanction. Separate sanctions for the same act or series of acts within the same episode may not be imposed. (3) ALTERNATIVE SANCTIONS.—Upon determining that a child has committed direct contempt of court or indirect contempt of a valid court order, the court may immediately request the circuit alternative sanctions coordinator to recommend the most appropriate available alternative sanction and shall order the child to perform up to 50 hours of community service or a similar alternative sanction, unless an alternative sanction is unavailable or inappropriate, or unless the child has failed to comply with a prior alternative sanction. Alternative contempt sanctions may be provided by local industry or by any nonprofit organization or any public or private business or service entity that has entered into a contract with the department to act as an agent of the state to provide voluntary supervision of children on behalf of the state in exchange for the labor of children and limited immunity in accordance with s. 768.28(11). (4) CONTEMPT OF COURT SANCTIONS; PROCEDURE AND DUE PROCESS.— (a) If a child subject to proceedings under this chapter is charged with direct contempt of court, the court may impose an authorized sanction immediately. (b) If a child subject to proceedings under this chapter is charged with indirect contempt of court, the court must issue an order to show cause and schedule a hearing to determine whether the child committed indirect contempt of a valid court order. The child must be served with the order to show cause and notice of hearing. At the hearing, the following due process rights must be provided to the child: 1. Right to a copy of the order to show cause alleging facts supporting the contempt charge. 2. Right to an explanation of the nature and the consequences of the proceedings. 3. Right to legal counsel and the right to have legal counsel appointed by the court if the juvenile is indigent, pursuant to s. 984.07. 4. Right to confront witnesses. 5. Right to present witnesses. 6. Right to have a transcript or record of the proceeding. 7. Right to appeal to an appropriate court. The child’s parent, legal guardian, or custodian may address the court regarding the due process rights of the child. If, after the hearing, the court determines the child has committed indirect contempt of a valid court order, the court may impose an alternative sanction or may proceed under subsection (2). If the court orders shelter placement of a child found in contempt of court, the court shall review the matter every 72 hours to determine whether it is appropriate for the child to remain in the facility. (c) The court may not order that a child be placed in a shelter facility for punishment for contempt unless the court determines that an alternative sanction is inappropriate or unavailable or that the child was initially ordered to an alternative sanction and did not comply with the alternative sanction. The court is encouraged to order a child to perform community service, up to the maximum number of hours, where appropriate before ordering that the child be placed in a shelter facility as punishment for contempt of court. (5) ALTERNATIVE SANCTIONS COORDINATOR.—There is created the position of alternative sanctions coordinator within each judicial circuit. Each alternative sanctions coordinator shall serve under the direction of the chief administrative judge of the juvenile division as directed by the chief judge of the circuit. The alternative sanctions coordinator shall act as the liaison between the judiciary, local department officials, district school board employees, and local law enforcement agencies. The alternative sanctions coordinator shall coordinate within the circuit community-based alternative sanctions, including community service projects.

The criteria for the completeness of a report with respect to a child alleged to be from a family in need of services while subject to compulsory school attendance shall be governed by s. 984.03. In any case in which the representative of the department finds that the report is incomplete, the representative of the department shall return the report without delay to the person or agency originating the report or having knowledge of the facts or to the appropriate law enforcement agency having investigative jurisdiction and request additional information in order to complete the report. (3) If the representative of the department determines that in his or her judgment the interests of the family, the child, and the public will be best served by providing the family and child services and treatment voluntarily accepted by the child and the parents, legal guardians, or custodians, the department’s representative may refer the family or child to an appropriate service provider. As part of the intake procedure, the department’s representative shall inform the parent, legal guardian, or custodian, in writing, of the services currently available to the child and family by department providers and other community agencies in the county in which the family is located, and the rights and responsibilities of the parent, legal guardian, or custodian under this chapter. Upon admission, and depending on services, a staff member may be assigned to the family as deemed appropriate. (4) If the department reasonably believes that the child has been abandoned, abused, or neglected, it shall proceed pursuant to chapter 39 and report immediately to the central abuse hotline.

For the purpose of this paragraph, “school system site” includes, but is not limited to, a center approved by the superintendent of schools for the purpose of counseling students and referring them back to the school system or an approved alternative to a suspension or expulsion program.

(2)(a) The department shall file a petition for a child in need of services if the child meets the definition of a child in need of services, and the case staffing committee recommends that a petition be filed and: 1. The family and child have in good faith, but unsuccessfully, used the services and process described in ss. 984.11 and 984.12; or 2. The family or child have refused services described in ss. 984.11 and 984.12 after reasonable efforts by the department to involve the family and child in voluntary family services.

(c) The petition shall be in writing, shall state the specific grounds by which the child is designated a child in need of services, and shall certify that the conditions prescribed in paragraph (a) have been met. The petition shall be signed by the petitioner under oath stating good faith in filing the petition and shall be signed by an attorney for the department. (3)(a) The parent, legal guardian, or custodian may file a petition alleging that a child is a child in need of services if: 1. The department waives the requirement for a case staffing committee. 2.

The parent, legal guardian, or custodian does not agree with the plan for services offered by the case staffing committee. 4. The department fails to provide a written report within 7 days after the case staffing committee meets, as required under s. 984.12(10). (b) The parent, legal guardian, or custodian must give the department prior written notice of intent to file the petition. If, at the arraignment hearing, the court finds that such written notice of intent to file the petition was not provided to the department, the court shall dismiss the petition, postpone the hearing until such written notice is given, or, if the department agrees, proceed with the arraignment hearing. The petition must be served on the department’s office of general counsel. (c) The petition must be in writing and must set forth specific facts alleging that the child is a child in need of services.

(2) The petition shall be filed in the circuit in which the student is enrolled in school. (3) Original jurisdiction to hear a truancy petition shall be in the circuit court; however, the circuit court may use a general or special magistrate pursuant to Supreme Court rules. Upon the filing of the petition, the clerk shall issue a summons to the parent, legal guardian, or custodian of the student, directing that person and the student to appear for a hearing at a time and place specified. (4) The petition must contain the following: the name, age, and address of the student; the name and address of the student’s parent or guardian; the school where the student is enrolled; the efforts the school has made to get the student to attend school in compliance with s. 1003.26; the number of out-of-school contacts between the school system and student’s parent or guardian; and the number of days and dates of days the student has missed school. The petition shall be sworn to by the superintendent or his or her designee. (5) Once the petition is filed, the court shall hear the petition within 30 days. (6) The student and the student’s parent or guardian shall attend the hearing. (7) If the court determines that the student did miss any of the alleged days, the court shall enter an order finding the child to be a truant status offender and the court shall order the student to attend school and order the parent, legal guardian, or custodian to ensure that the student attends school. The court’s power under this subsection is limited to entering orders to require the student to attend school and require the student and family to participate in services to encourage regular school attendance. The court may order any of the following services: (a) The student to participate in attendance at alternative classes; (b) The student’s parent, legal guardian, or custodian to participate in parenting classes; (c) The student or the student’s parent, legal guardian, or custodian to participate in individual, group, or family counseling; (d) The student or the student’s parent, legal guardian, or custodian to participate in community mental health services or substance abuse treatment services if available and applicable; (e) The student and the student’s parent, legal guardian, or custodian to participate in services provided by state or community agencies, if appropriate, including services for families in need of services as provided in s. 984.11; (f) The student and the student’s parent, legal guardian, or custodian to attend meetings with school officials to address the child’s educational needs, classroom assignment, class schedule, and other barriers to school attendance identified by the child’s school, the child, or his or her family; (g) The student and the student’s parent, legal guardian, or custodian to engage in learning activities provided by the school board as to why education is important and the potential impact on the child’s future employment and education options if the attendance problem persists; or (h) The student or the student’s parent, legal guardian, or custodian to participate in vocational or job training. (8) If the student does not substantially comply with compulsory school attendance and court-ordered services required under subsection (7), and the child meets the definition of a child in need of services, the case shall be referred by the court to the department’s authorized agent for review by the case staffing committee under s. 984.12 with a recommendation to file a petition for a child in need of services under s. 984.15. The court shall review the case not less than every 45 days to determine whether the child is in substantial compliance with compulsory education or if the case should be referred to the case staffing committee in accord with this subsection. (9) If the student substantially complies with compulsory school attendance, the court shall close the truancy case. (10) If the child is adjudicated a child in need of services pursuant to s. 984.21, the truancy case shall be closed and jurisdiction relinquished in accordance with s. 984.04. (11) The court may retain jurisdiction of any case in which the child is noncompliant with compulsory education and the child does not meet the definition of a child in need of services under this chapter until jurisdiction lapses pursuant to s. 984.04. (12) The court may not order a child placed in shelter pursuant to this section unless the court has found the child to be in contempt for violation of a court order under s. 984.09. (13) The parent, legal guardian, or custodian and the student shall participate, as required by court order, in any sanctions or services required by the court under this section, and the court shall enforce such participation through its contempt power. (14) Any truant student 1 who meets the definition of a child in need of services and who has been found in contempt for violation of a court order under s. 984.09 two or more times shall be referred to the case staffing committee under s. 984.12 with a recommendation to file a petition for a child in need of services.

The court shall advise the child and the parent, legal guardian, or custodian of the right to counsel as provided in s. 984.07. The hearing shall be held for the child and the parent, legal guardian, or custodian to admit, deny, or consent to findings that a child is in need of services as alleged in the petition. If the child and the parent, legal guardian, or custodian admit or consent to the findings in the petition, the court shall adjudicate the child a child in need of services and proceed as set forth in the Florida Rules of Juvenile Procedure. However, if either the child or the parent, legal guardian, or custodian denies any of the allegations of the petition, the court shall hold an adjudicatory hearing within a reasonable time after the date of the arraignment hearing. (b) The court may grant a continuance of the arraignment hearing if the child or the parent, legal guardian, or custodian requests a continuance to obtain an attorney. The case shall be rescheduled for an arraignment hearing within a reasonable period of time to allow for consultation. (c) If at the arraignment hearing the child and the parent, legal guardian, or custodian consents or admits to the allegations in the petition and the court determines that the petition meets the requirements of s. 984.15(5), the court shall proceed to hold a disposition hearing at the earliest practicable time that will allow for the completion of a predisposition study. (d) Failure of a person served with notice to appear at the arraignment hearing constitutes the person’s consent to the adjudication of the child as a child in need of services. The document containing the notice to respond or appear must contain, in type as large as the balance of the document, the following or substantially similar language: FAILURE TO APPEAR AT THE ARRAIGNMENT HEARING CONSTITUTES CONSENT TO THE ADJUDICATION OF THIS CHILD AS A CHILD IN NEED OF SERVICES AND MAY RESULT IN THE COURT ENTERING AN ORDER OF DISPOSITION AND PLACING THE CHILD INTO SHELTER. If a person appears for the arraignment hearing and the court orders that person to appear, either physically or through audio-video communication technology, at the adjudicatory hearing for the child in need of services case, stating the date, time, place, and, if applicable, the instructions for appearance through audio-video communication technology, of the adjudicatory hearing, that person’s failure to appear for the scheduled adjudicatory hearing constitutes consent to adjudication of the child as a child in need of services. (2) ADJUDICATORY HEARING.— (a) The adjudicatory hearing shall be held as soon as practicable after the petition for a child in need of services is filed and in accordance with the Florida Rules of Juvenile Procedure, but reasonable delay for the purpose of investigation, discovery, or procuring counsel or witnesses shall, whenever practicable, be granted. (b) Adjudicatory hearings shall be conducted by the judge without a jury, applying the rules of evidence in use in civil cases and adjourning the hearings from time to time as necessary. In an adjudicatory hearing, a preponderance of evidence shall be required to establish that the child is in need of services. If the court finds the allegations are proven by a preponderance of evidence and the child is a child in need of services, the court shall enter an order of adjudication. (c) All hearings, except as hereinafter provided, shall be open to the public, and no person shall be excluded therefrom except on special order of the judge who, in his or her discretion, may close any hearing to the public when the public interest or the welfare of the child, in his or her opinion, is best served by so doing. Hearings involving more than one child may be held simultaneously when the several children involved are related to each other or were involved in the same case. The child and the parent, legal guardian, or custodian of the child may be examined separately and apart from each other. (3) DISPOSITION HEARING.— (a) At the disposition hearing, the court shall receive and consider a predisposition study, which shall be in writing and be presented by an authorized agent of the department or its provider. The predisposition study shall cover: 1. All treatment and services that the parent, legal guardian, or custodian and child received. 2. The love, affection, and other emotional ties existing between the family and the child. 3. The capacity and disposition of the parents, legal guardian, or custodian to provide the child with food, clothing, medical care or other remedial care recognized and permitted under the laws of this state in lieu of medical care, and other material needs. 4. The length of time that the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment and the desirability of maintaining continuity. 5. The permanence, as a family unit, of the existing or proposed custodial home. 6. The moral fitness of the parents, legal guardian, or custodian. 7. The mental and physical health of the family. 8. The home, school, and community record of the child. 9. The reasonable preference of the child, if the court deems the child to be of sufficient intelligence, understanding, and experience to express a preference. 10. Any other factor considered by the court to be relevant. (b) The predisposition study also shall provide the court with documentation regarding: 1. The availability of appropriate prevention, services, and treatment for the parent, legal guardian, custodian, and child to prevent the removal of the child from the home or to reunify the child with the parent, legal guardian, or custodian after removal or to reconcile the problems between the family and the child. 2. The inappropriateness of other prevention, treatment, and services that were available. 3. The efforts by the department to prevent shelter placement of the child or, when applicable, to reunify the parent, legal guardian, or custodian if appropriate services were available. 4. Whether voluntary family services were provided. 5. If the voluntary family services and treatment were provided, whether they were sufficient to meet the needs of the child and the family and to enable the child to remain at home or to be returned home. 6. If the voluntary family services and treatment were not provided, the reasons for such lack of provision. 7. The need for, or appropriateness of, continuing such treatment and services if the child remains in the custody of the parent, legal guardian, or custodian or if the child is placed outside the home. (c) If placement of the child with anyone other than the child’s parent, guardian, or custodian is being considered, the study shall include the designation of a specific length of time as to when custody by the parent, guardian, or custodian shall be reconsidered. (d) A copy of this predisposition study shall be furnished to the person having custody of the child at the time such person is notified of the disposition hearing. (e) After review of the predisposition study and other relevant materials, the court shall hear from the parties and consider all recommendations for court-ordered services, evaluations, treatment, and required actions designed to remedy the child’s truancy, ungovernable behavior, or running away. The court shall enter an order of disposition. Any other relevant and material evidence, including other written or oral reports, may be received by the court in its effort to determine the action to be taken with regard to the child and may be relied upon to the extent of its probative value, even though not competent in an adjudicatory hearing. Except as provided in paragraph (2)(c), this section does not prohibit the publication of proceedings in a hearing. (4) REVIEW HEARINGS.— (a) The court shall hold a review hearing within 45 days after the disposition hearing. Additional review hearings may be held as necessary, allowing sufficient time for the child and family to work toward compliance with the court orders and monitoring by the case manager. No longer than 90 days may elapse between judicial review hearings. (b) The parent, legal guardian, or custodian and the child shall be noticed to appear for the review hearing. The department must appear at the review hearing. If the parent, legal guardian, or custodian does not appear at a review hearing, or if the court finds good cause to waive the child’s presence, the court may proceed with the hearing and enter orders that affect the child and family accordingly. (c) At the review hearings, the court shall consider the department’s judicial review summary. The court shall close the case if the child has substantially complied with the case plans and court orders and no longer requires continued court supervision, subject to the case being reopened. Upon request of the petitioner, the court may close the case and relinquish jurisdiction. If the child has significantly failed to comply with the case plan or court orders, the child shall continue to be a child in need of services and reviewed by the court as needed.

(b) Order the parent, legal guardian, or custodian to pay a fine or fee based on the recommendations of the department. (2) When any child is adjudicated by the court to be a child in need of services, the court having jurisdiction of the child and parent, legal guardian, or custodian shall have the power, by order, to: (a) Place the child under the supervision of the department’s authorized agent provider of programs and services for children in need of services and families in need of services. The term supervision, for the purposes of this section, means services as defined by the contract between the department and the provider. (b) Place the child in the temporary legal custody of an adult willing to care for the child. (c) Commit the child to a licensed child-caring agency willing to receive the child and to provide services without compensation from the department. (d) Order the child, and, if the court finds it appropriate, the parent, legal guardian, or custodian of the child, to render community service in a public service program. (e) Order the child placed in shelter pursuant to s. 984.225 or s. 984.226. (3) When any child is adjudicated by the court to be a child in need of services and temporary legal custody of the child has been placed with an adult willing to care for the child, or a licensed child-caring agency, the court shall order the natural or adoptive parents of such child, including the natural father of such child born out of wedlock who has acknowledged his paternity in writing before the court, or the guardian of such child’s estate if possessed of assets which under law may be disbursed for the care, support, and maintenance of such child, to pay child support to the adult relative caring for the child, the licensed child-caring agency, the department, or the Department of Children and Families. When such order affects the guardianship estate, a certified copy of such order shall be delivered to the judge having jurisdiction of such guardianship estate. If the court determines that the parent is unable to pay support, placement of the child shall not be contingent upon issuance of a support order. The department may employ a collection agency to receive, collect, and manage the payment of unpaid and delinquent fees. The collection agency must be registered and in good standing under chapter 559. The department may pay to the collection agency a fee from the amount collected under the claim or may authorize the agency to deduct the fee from the amount collected. (4) In carrying out the provisions of this chapter, the court shall order the child, family, parent, legal guardian, or custodian of a child who is found to be a child in need of services to participate in family counseling and other professional counseling activities or other alternatives deemed necessary to address the needs of the child and family. (5) The participation and cooperation of the family, parent, legal guardian, or custodian, and the child with court-ordered services, treatment, or community service are mandatory, not merely voluntary. The court may use its contempt powers to enforce its orders.

      "text": "984.225 Powers of disposition; placement in a shelter.— (1) The court may order that a child adjudicated as a child in need of services be placed in shelter to enforce the court’s orders, to ensure the child attends school, to ensure the child receives needed counseling, and to ensure the child adheres to a service plan. While a child is in a shelter, the child shall receive education commensurate with his or her grade level and educational ability. The department, or the department’s authorized agent, must verify to the court that a shelter bed is available for the child. If the department or the department’s authorized agent verifies that a bed is not available, the department shall place the child’s name on a waiting list. The child who has been on the waiting list the longest shall get the next available bed. (2) The court shall order the parent, legal guardian, or custodian to cooperate with reunification efforts and participate in counseling. If a parent, legal guardian, or custodian prefers to arrange counseling or other services with a private provider in lieu of using services provided by the department, the family shall pay all costs associated with those services. (3) Placement of a child under this section is designed to provide residential care on a temporary basis. Such placement does not abrogate the legal responsibilities of the parent, legal guardian, or custodian with respect to the child, except to the extent that those responsibilities are temporarily altered by court order. (a) The court may order any child adjudicated a child in need of services to be placed in shelter for up to 35 days. (b) After other alternative, less restrictive, remedies have been exhausted, the child may be placed in shelter for up to 90 days if: 1. The child’s parent, legal guardian, or custodian refuses to provide food, clothing, shelter, and necessary parental support for the child and the refusal is a direct result of an established pattern of significant disruptive behavior of the child in the home of the parent, legal guardian, or custodian; 2. The child refuses to remain under the reasonable care and custody of the parent, legal guardian, or custodian, as evidenced by repeatedly running away and failing to comply with a court order; or 3. The child has failed to successfully complete an alternative treatment program or to comply with court-ordered services and the child has been placed in a shelter on at least one prior occasion pursuant to a court order after the child has been adjudicated a child in need of services. (4) The court shall review the child’s 90-day shelter placement within 45 days after the child’s placement and determine whether continued shelter is deemed necessary. The court shall also determine whether the parent, legal guardian, or custodian has reasonably participated in the child’s counseling and treatment program, and is following the recommendations of the program to work toward reunification. The court shall also determine whether the department’s reunification efforts have been reasonable. If the court finds an inadequate level of support or participation by the parent, legal guardian, or custodian before the end of the shelter commitment period, the court shall direct a staffing to take place with the Department of Children and Families. (5) If a child has not been reunited with his or her parent, legal guardian, or custodian at the expiration of the 90-day commitment period, the court may order that the child remain in the shelter for an additional 30 days if the court finds that reunification could be achieved within that period. The department is deemed to have exhausted the reasonable remedies offered under this chapter if, at the end of the 90-day shelter period, the parent, legal guardian, or custodian continues to refuse to allow the child to remain at home or creates unreasonable conditions for the child’s return. If, at the end of the 90-day shelter period, the child is not reunited with his or her parent, legal guardian, or custodian due solely to the continued refusal of the parent, legal guardian, or custodian to provide food, clothing, shelter, and parental support, the child is considered to be threatened with harm as a result of such acts or omissions, and the court shall direct that the child be handled in every respect as a dependent child. Jurisdiction shall be transferred to the custody of the Department of Children and Families, and the child’s care shall be governed under the relevant provisions of chapter 39. The department shall coordinate with the Department of Children and Families as provided in s. 984.086. The clerk of court shall serve the Department of Children and Families with any court order of referral. (6) If the child requires residential mental health treatment or residential care for a developmental disability, the court shall refer the child to the Agency for Persons with Disabilities or to the Department of Children and Families for the provision of necessary services.

      "text": "984.226 Physically secure shelter.— (1) Subject to specific legislative appropriation, the department shall establish or contract for physically secure shelters for the placement of children in need of services who meet the criteria provided in this section. (2) When a child is adjudicated as a child in need of services by a court and all other less restrictive placements have been exhausted, the court may order the child to be placed in a physically secure shelter if the child has: (a) Failed to appear for placement in a shelter for up to 90 days as ordered under s. 984.225, or failed to comply with any other provision of a valid court order relating to such placement and, as a result of such failure, has been found to be in direct or indirect contempt of court; or (b) Run away from a 90-day shelter following placement under s. 984.225. The department or an authorized agent of the department must verify to the court that a bed is available for the child in a physically secure shelter. If a bed is not available in a physically secure shelter, the court must stay the placement until such a bed is available, and the department must place the child’s name on a waiting list. The child who has been on the waiting list the longest has first priority for placement in the physically secure shelter. Physically secure shelter placement may only be used when the child cannot receive appropriate and available services due to the child running away or refusing to cooperate with attempts to provide services in other less restrictive placements. (3) A child may be placed in a physically secure shelter for up to 90 days by order of the court. If a child has not been reunited with his or her parent, guardian, or legal custodian at the expiration of the placement in a physically secure shelter, the court may order that the child remain in the physically secure shelter for an additional 30 days if the court finds that reunification could be achieved within that period. (4)(a) The court shall review the child’s placement once within every 45 days to determine whether the child can be returned home with the provision of ongoing services. (b) At any time during the placement of a child in need of services in a physically secure shelter, the department or an authorized agent of the department may submit to the court a report that recommends: 1. That the child has received all of the services available from the physically secure shelter and is ready for reunification with a parent or guardian; or 2. That the child is unlikely to benefit from continued placement in the physically secure shelter and is more likely to have his or her needs met in a different type of placement. The court may order that the child be transitioned from a physically secure shelter to a shelter placement as provided in s. 984.225 upon a finding that the physically secure shelter is no longer necessary for the child’s safety and to provide needed services. (c) The court shall determine if the parent, legal guardian, or custodian has reasonably participated in and has contributed to or participated in the child’s counseling and treatment program. (d) If the court finds an inadequate level of support or participation by the parent, legal guardian, or custodian before the end of the placement, the court shall direct a staffing to take place with the Department of Children and Families. (e) If the child requires long-term residential mental health treatment or residential care for a developmental disability, the court shall refer the child to the Department of Children and Families or the Agency for Persons with Disabilities for the provision of necessary services. The clerk of court shall serve the Agency for Persons with Disabilities or the Department of Children and Families with any court order of referral. (5) Prior to being ordered to a physically secure shelter, the child must be afforded all rights of due process required under s. 984.07. (6) While in the physically secure shelter, the child shall receive appropriate assessment, intervention, treatment, and educational services that are designed to eliminate or reduce the child’s truant, ungovernable, or runaway behavior. The child and family shall be provided with individual and family counseling and other support services necessary for reunification. (7) The court shall order the parent, legal guardian, or custodian to cooperate with efforts to reunite the child with the family, participate in counseling, and pay all costs associated with the care and counseling provided to the child and family, in accordance with the child’s insurance and the family’s ability to pay as determined by the court. Placement of a child under this section is designed to provide residential care on a temporary basis. Such placement does not abrogate the legal responsibilities of the parent, legal guardian, or custodian with respect to the child, except to the extent that those responsibilities are temporarily altered by court order.
