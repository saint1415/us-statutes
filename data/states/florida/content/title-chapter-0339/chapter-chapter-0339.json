Toll increases of 20 percent every fifth year or as determined by the Division of Bond Finance may be used in conjunction with the calculation of projected available funds. No additions shall be made to any revenue-producing project for which a covenant to complete from such moneys has been made which would expand the scope of such project unless such additions are specifically approved by the Legislature. For the purposes of this subsection, the term “project scope” means the terminal points, the number of interchanges, and grade separations as approved by the Legislature. No contingency funds in the construction trust fund for any revenue-producing project for which a covenant to complete from such moneys has been made shall be expended for any purpose other than such project until the completion of such project; however, such funds may be expended for other purposes if permitted by the proceedings authorizing such bonds and if the department certifies to the Executive Office of the Governor that such contingency funds are not required for the completion of the project and are available and sufficient for such other purposes and the Executive Office of the Governor approves such certification in writing to the department. (4) In any lease-purchase agreement or trust indenture, which includes a covenant to complete by the department from the moneys in the State Transportation Trust Fund, the department shall provide for the expeditious repayment of any and all costs incurred by the department as a result of the covenant to complete the transportation project. Such agreements shall provide for such repayment from excess tolls or constitutional gas tax proceeds not required for payment of principal, interest, reserves, and other required deposits for the bonds and for the annual reimbursement from tolls or other local moneys or both, to the extent legally available, of all operating and maintenance costs of the facilities, as provided by the applicable provisions of the State Constitution and the bond proceedings. A lease-purchase agreement must also include a statement that changes to the operating characteristics of the project toll-collection system cannot be made without the concurrence of the department, if such changes would affect department personnel and finances. (5) The provisions of subsections (3) and (4) do not apply to any revenue-producing project approved by the Legislature prior to July 1, 1978. History.—s. 213, ch. 84-309; s. 23, ch. 85-180.

(e) Provide an examination of transportation issues likely to arise during at least a 20-year period. (f) Be updated at least once every 5 years, or more often as necessary, to reflect substantive changes to federal or state law. (4) ADDITIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANS.— (a) Upon request by local governmental entities, the department may in its discretion develop and design transportation corridors, arterial and collector streets, vehicular parking areas, and other support facilities which are consistent with the plans of the department for major transportation facilities. The department may render to local governmental entities or their planning agencies such technical assistance and services as are necessary so that local plans and facilities are coordinated with the plans and facilities of the department. (b) Each regional planning council, as provided for in s. 186.504, or any successor agency thereto, shall develop, as an element of its strategic regional policy plan, transportation goals and policies. The transportation goals and policies must be prioritized to comply with the prevailing principles provided in subsection (1) and s. 334.046(1). The transportation goals and policies shall be consistent, to the maximum extent feasible, with the goals and policies of the metropolitan planning organization and the Florida Transportation Plan. The transportation goals and policies of the regional planning council will be advisory only and shall be submitted to the department and any affected metropolitan planning organization for their consideration and comments. Metropolitan planning organization plans and other local transportation plans shall be developed consistent, to the maximum extent feasible, with the regional transportation goals and policies. (c) Regional transportation plans may be developed in regional transportation areas in accordance with an interlocal agreement entered into pursuant to s. 163.01 by two or more contiguous metropolitan planning organizations; one or more metropolitan planning organizations and one or more contiguous counties, none of which is a member of a metropolitan planning organization; a multicounty regional transportation authority created by or pursuant to law; two or more contiguous counties that are not members of a metropolitan planning organization; or metropolitan planning organizations comprised of three or more counties. (d) The interlocal agreement must, at a minimum, identify the entity that will coordinate the development of the regional transportation plan; delineate the boundaries of the regional transportation area; provide the duration of the agreement and specify how the agreement may be terminated, modified, or rescinded; describe the process by which the regional transportation plan will be developed; and provide how members of the entity will resolve disagreements regarding interpretation of the interlocal agreement or disputes relating to the development or content of the regional transportation plan. Such interlocal agreement shall become effective upon its recordation in the official public records of each county in the regional transportation area. (e) The regional transportation plan developed pursuant to this section must, at a minimum, identify regionally significant transportation facilities located within a regional transportation area and contain a prioritized list of regionally significant projects. The projects shall be adopted into the capital improvements schedule of the local government comprehensive plan pursuant to s. 163.3177(3). (5) PROCEDURES FOR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN TRANSPORTATION PLANNING.— (a) During the development of the Florida Transportation Plan and prior to substantive revisions, the department shall provide citizens, affected public agencies, representatives of transportation agency employees, other affected employee representatives, private providers of transportation, and other known interested parties with an opportunity to comment on the proposed plan or revisions. These opportunities shall include, at a minimum, publishing a notice in the Florida Administrative Register and within a newspaper of general circulation within the area of each department district office. (b) During development of major transportation improvements, such as those increasing the capacity of a facility through the addition of new lanes or providing new access to a limited or controlled access facility or construction of a facility in a new location, the department shall hold one or more hearings prior to the selection of the facility to be provided; prior to the selection of the site or corridor of the proposed facility; and prior to the selection of and commitment to a specific design proposal for the proposed facility. Such public hearings shall be conducted so as to provide an opportunity for effective participation by interested persons in the process of transportation planning and site and route selection and in the specific location and design of transportation facilities. The various factors involved in the decision or decisions and any alternative proposals shall be clearly presented so that the persons attending the hearing may present their views relating to the decision or decisions that will be made. (c) Opportunity for design hearings: 1. The department, prior to holding a design hearing, shall duly notify all affected property owners of record, as recorded in the property appraiser’s office, by mail at least 20 days prior to the date set for the hearing.

      "text": "339.175 Metropolitan planning organization.— (1) PURPOSE.—It is the intent of the Legislature to encourage and promote the safe and efficient management, operation, and development of multimodal transportation systems that will serve the mobility needs of people and freight and foster economic growth and development within and through urbanized areas of this state in accordance with the department’s mission statement. To accomplish these objectives, metropolitan planning organizations, referred to in this section as M.P.O.’s, shall develop, in cooperation with the state and public transit operators, transportation plans and programs for metropolitan areas. The plans and programs for each metropolitan area must provide for the development and integrated management and operation of transportation systems and facilities, including pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation facilities that will function as an intermodal transportation system for the metropolitan area, based upon the prevailing principles provided in s. 334.046(1). The process for developing such plans and programs shall provide for consideration of all modes of transportation and shall be continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive, to the degree appropriate, based on the complexity of the transportation problems to be addressed. To ensure that the process is integrated with the statewide planning process, M.P.O.’s shall develop plans and programs that identify transportation facilities that should function as an integrated metropolitan transportation system, giving emphasis to facilities that serve important national, state, and regional transportation functions. For the purposes of this section, those facilities include the facilities on the Strategic Intermodal System designated under s. 339.63 and facilities for which projects have been identified pursuant to s. 339.2819(4). (2) DESIGNATION.— (a)1. An M.P.O. shall be designated for each urbanized area of the state; however, this does not require that an individual M.P.O. be designated for each such area. Such designation shall be accomplished by agreement between the Governor and units of general-purpose local government representing at least 75 percent of the population of the urbanized area; however, the unit of general-purpose local government that represents the central city or cities within the M.P.O. jurisdiction, as defined by the United States Bureau of the Census, must be a party to such agreement. 2. To the extent possible, only one M.P.O. shall be designated for each urbanized area or group of contiguous urbanized areas. More than one M.P.O. may be designated within an existing urbanized area only if the Governor and the existing M.P.O. determine that the size and complexity of the existing urbanized area makes the designation of more than one M.P.O. for the area appropriate. After July 1, 2025, no additional M.P.O.’s may be designated in this state except in urbanized areas, as defined by the United States Census Bureau, where the urbanized area boundary is not contiguous to an urbanized area designated before the 2020 census. (b) Each M.P.O. designated in a manner prescribed by Title 23 of the United States Code shall be created and operated under the provisions of this section pursuant to an interlocal agreement entered into pursuant to s. 163.01. The signatories to the interlocal agreement shall be the department and the governmental entities designated by the Governor for membership on the M.P.O. Each M.P.O. shall be considered separate from the state or the governing body of a local government that is represented on the governing board of the M.P.O. or that is a signatory to the interlocal agreement creating the M.P.O. and shall have such powers and privileges that are provided under s. 163.01. If there is a conflict between this section and s. 163.01, this section prevails. (c) The jurisdictional boundaries of an M.P.O. shall be determined by agreement between the Governor and the applicable M.P.O. The boundaries must include at least the metropolitan planning area, which is the existing urbanized area and the contiguous area expected to become urbanized within a 20-year forecast period, and may encompass the entire metropolitan statistical area or the consolidated metropolitan statistical area. (d) In the case of an urbanized area designated as a nonattainment area for ozone or carbon monoxide under the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. ss. 7401 et seq., the boundaries of the metropolitan planning area in existence as of the date of enactment of this paragraph shall be retained, except that the boundaries may be adjusted by agreement of the Governor and affected metropolitan planning organizations in the manner described in this section. If more than one M.P.O. has authority within a metropolitan area or an area that is designated as a nonattainment area, each M.P.O. shall consult with other M.P.O.’s designated for such area and with the state in the coordination of plans and programs required by this section. (e) The governing body of the M.P.O. shall designate, at a minimum, a chair, vice chair, and agency clerk. The chair and vice chair shall be selected from among the member delegates comprising the governing board. The agency clerk shall be charged with the responsibility of preparing meeting minutes and maintaining agency records. The clerk shall be a member of the M.P.O. governing board, an employee of the M.P.O., or other natural person. Each M.P.O. required under this section must be fully operative no later than 6 months following its designation. (3) VOTING MEMBERSHIP.— (a) The voting membership of an M.P.O. shall consist of at least 5 but not more than 25 apportioned members, with the exact number determined on an equitable geographic-population ratio basis, based on an agreement among the affected units of general-purpose local government and the Governor, as required by federal regulations. In accordance with 23 U.S.C. s. 134, the Governor may also allow M.P.O. members who represent municipalities to alternate with representatives from other municipalities within the metropolitan planning area which do not have members on the M.P.O. With the exception of instances in which all of the county commissioners in a single-county M.P.O. are members of the M.P.O. governing board, county commissioners shall compose at least one-third of the M.P.O. governing board membership. A multicounty M.P.O. may satisfy this requirement by any combination of county commissioners from each of the counties constituting the M.P.O. Voting members shall be elected officials of general-purpose local governments, one of whom may represent a group of general-purpose local governments through an entity created by an M.P.O. for that purpose. An M.P.O. may include, as part of its apportioned voting members, a member of a statutorily authorized planning board, an official of an agency that operates or administers a major mode of transportation, or an official of Space Florida. As used in this section, the term “elected officials of a general-purpose local government” excludes constitutional officers, including sheriffs, tax collectors, supervisors of elections, property appraisers, clerks of the court, and similar types of officials. County commissioners shall compose not less than 20 percent of the M.P.O. membership if an official of an agency that operates or administers a major mode of transportation has been appointed to an M.P.O. (b) In metropolitan areas in which authorities or other agencies have been or may be created by law to perform transportation functions and are or will be performing transportation functions that are not under the jurisdiction of a general-purpose local government represented on the M.P.O., such authorities or other agencies may be provided voting membership on the M.P.O. In all other M.P.O.’s in which transportation authorities or agencies are to be represented by elected officials from general-purpose local governments, the M.P.O. shall establish a process by which the collective interests of such authorities or other agencies are expressed and conveyed. (c) Any other provision of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, a chartered county with over 1 million population may elect to reapportion the membership of an M.P.O. whose jurisdiction is wholly within the county. The charter county may exercise the provisions of this paragraph if: 1. The M.P.O. approves the reapportionment plan by a three-fourths vote of its membership; 2. The M.P.O. and the charter county determine that the reapportionment plan is needed to fulfill specific goals and policies applicable to that metropolitan planning area; and 3. The charter county determines the reapportionment plan otherwise complies with all federal requirements pertaining to M.P.O. membership. Any charter county that elects to exercise the provisions of this paragraph shall notify the Governor in writing. (d) Any other provision of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, any county as defined in s. 125.011(1) may elect to have its county commission serve as the M.P.O., if the M.P.O. jurisdiction is wholly contained within the county. Any charter county that elects to exercise the provisions of this paragraph shall so notify the Governor in writing. Upon receipt of such notification, the Governor must designate the county commission as the M.P.O. The Governor must appoint four additional voting members to the M.P.O., one of whom must be an elected official representing a municipality within the county, one of whom must be an expressway authority member, one of whom must be a person who does not hold elected public office and who resides in the unincorporated portion of the county, and one of whom must be a school board member. (4) APPORTIONMENT.— (a) Each M.P.O. shall review the composition of its membership in conjunction with the decennial census, as prepared by the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, and with the agreement of the Governor and the affected general-purpose local government units that constitute the existing M.P.O., reapportion the membership as necessary to comply with subsection (3). At the request of a majority of the affected units of general-purpose local government comprising an M.P.O., the Governor and a majority of units of general-purpose local government serving on an M.P.O. shall cooperatively agree upon and prescribe who may serve as an alternate member and a method for appointing alternate members, who may vote at any M.P.O. meeting that he or she attends in place of a regular member. The method must be set forth as a part of the interlocal agreement describing the M.P.O. membership or in the operating procedures and bylaws of the M.P.O. The governmental entity so designated shall appoint the appropriate number of members to the M.P.O. from eligible officials. Representatives of the department shall serve as nonvoting advisers to the M.P.O. governing board. Additional nonvoting advisers may be appointed by the M.P.O. as deemed necessary; however, to the maximum extent feasible, each M.P.O. shall seek to appoint nonvoting representatives of various multimodal forms of transportation not otherwise represented by voting members of the M.P.O. An M.P.O. shall appoint nonvoting advisers representing major military installations located within the jurisdictional boundaries of the M.P.O. upon the request of the aforesaid major military installations and subject to the agreement of the M.P.O. All nonvoting advisers may attend and participate fully in governing board meetings but may not vote or be members of the governing board. (b) Except for members who represent municipalities on the basis of alternating with representatives from other municipalities that do not have members on the M.P.O. as provided in paragraph (3)(a), the members of an M.P.O. shall serve 4-year terms. Members who represent municipalities on the basis of alternating with representatives from other municipalities that do not have members on the M.P.O. as provided in paragraph (3)(a) may serve terms of up to 4 years as further provided in the interlocal agreement described in paragraph (2)(b). The membership of a member who is a public official automatically terminates upon the member’s leaving his or her elective or appointive office for any reason, or may be terminated by a majority vote of the total membership of the entity’s governing board represented by the member. A vacancy shall be filled by the original appointing entity. A member may be reappointed for one or more additional 4-year terms. (c) If a governmental entity fails to fill an assigned appointment to an M.P.O. within 60 days after notification by the Governor of its duty to appoint, that appointment shall be made by the Governor from the eligible representatives of that governmental entity.

Capacity improvements on county roads shall not be eligible for funding under the program. (b) In determining a county’s eligibility for assistance under this program, the department may consider whether the county has attempted to keep county roads in satisfactory condition, including the amount of local option fuel tax imposed by the county. The department may also consider the extent to which the county has offered to provide a match of local funds with state funds provided under the program. At a minimum, small counties shall be eligible only if the county has enacted the maximum rate of the local option fuel tax authorized by s. 336.025(1)(a). (c) The following criteria must be used to prioritize road projects for funding under the program: 1. The primary criterion is the physical condition of the road as measured by the department. 2. As secondary criteria the department may consider: a. Whether a road is used as an evacuation route. b. Whether a road has high levels of agricultural travel. c. Whether a road is considered a major arterial route. d. Whether a road is considered a feeder road. e. Whether a road is located in a fiscally constrained county, as defined in s. 218.67(1). f. Other criteria related to the impact of a project on the public road system or on the state or local economy as determined by the department.

      "text": "339.81 Florida Shared-Use Nonmotorized Trail Network.— (1) The Legislature finds that increasing demands continue to be placed on the state’s transportation system by a growing economy, continued population growth, and increasing tourism. The Legislature also finds that accommodating alternative travel modes to meet the needs of residents and visitors and providing trails for bicyclist and pedestrian travel that allows for the appreciation of the conservation and stewardship of environmentally important lands in Florida are of significant importance. The Legislature finds that the investment of the state in the Florida wildlife corridor as defined in s. 259.1055 is of significant interest to the public and that the provision of paved multiuse trails within or between areas of the Florida wildlife corridor would provide the public the ability to enjoy Florida’s natural resources and bring ecotourism and economic opportunities to local trail town communities. The Legislature further finds that improving bicyclist and pedestrian safety for both residents and visitors is a high priority. Therefore, the Legislature declares that the development of a nonmotorized trail network will increase mobility and recreational alternatives for Florida’s residents and visitors; enhance economic prosperity; enrich quality of life; enhance safety; reflect responsible environmental stewardship; and facilitate support for the protection, preservation, and enhancement of the natural and recreational value of the Florida wildlife corridor by providing minimally invasive public access to it when feasible and compatible with the lands. To that end, it is the intent of the Legislature that the department make use of its expertise in efficiently providing transportation projects to develop and construct the Florida Shared-Use Nonmotorized Trail Network. (2)(a) The Florida Shared-Use Nonmotorized Trail Network is created as a component of the Florida Greenways and Trails System established in chapter 260. The Florida Shared-Use Nonmotorized Trail Network consists of a statewide network of nonmotorized trails that allow bicyclists and pedestrians to access a variety of points of origin and destinations with limited exposure to motorized vehicles. (b) The multiuse trails or shared-use paths of the statewide network must be physically separated from motor vehicle traffic and constructed with asphalt, concrete, or another hard surface. (c) The statewide network provides nonmotorized transportation opportunities for bicyclists and pedestrians statewide between and within a wide range of points of origin and destinations, including, but not limited to, communities, conservation areas, lands of the Florida wildlife corridor, state parks, beaches, and other natural or cultural attractions for a variety of trip purposes, including work, school, shopping, and other personal business, as well as social, recreational, and personal fitness purposes. (3) Network components do not include sidewalks, nature trails, loop trails wholly within a single park or natural area, or on-road facilities, such as bicycle lanes or routes. However, components that connect to nature trails, loop trails, or other points of public access wholly within a single park or natural area may be included in the network, as well as any of the following: (a) On-road facilities that are no longer than one-half mile connecting two or more nonmotorized trails, if the provision of non-road facilities is infeasible and if such on-road facilities are signed and marked for nonmotorized use. (b) On-road components of the Florida Keys Overseas Heritage Trail. (4) The planning, development, operation, and maintenance of the Florida Shared-Use Nonmotorized Trail Network is declared to be a public purpose, and the department, together with other agencies of this state and all counties, municipalities, and special districts of this state, may spend public funds for such purposes and accept gifts and grants of funds, property, or property rights from public or private sources to be used for such purposes. (5)(a) The department shall include the Florida Shared-Use Nonmotorized Trail Network in its work program developed pursuant to s. 339.135. For purposes of funding and maintaining projects within the network, the department shall allocate in its program and resource plan a minimum of $50 million annually, beginning with the 2023-2024 fiscal year. (b) The department shall give funding priority to projects that: 1. Are recommended priorities by the Florida Greenways and Trails Council as regionally significant trails pursuant to s. 260.0142(4)(c). 2. Have national, statewide, or regional importance. 3. Are otherwise identified by the Florida Greenways and Trails Council as a priority for critical linkage and trail connectedness within the Florida Greenways and Trails System under chapter 260. 4. Facilitate an interconnected system of trails by completing gaps between existing trails. 5. Support the transportation needs of bicyclists and pedestrians. (c) For trail projects to be constructed within the Florida wildlife corridor as defined in s. 259.1055 or on conservation lands or other lands subject to conservation easements, land management plans, or agreements, to the greatest extent possible, the department shall ensure projects are constructed using previously disturbed lands, such as abandoned roads and railroads, utility rights-of-way, canal corridors and drainage berms, permanent fire lines, and other lands having appropriate potential to serve the purposes specified by law of both the trail network and the Florida wildlife corridor. In developing the planning and design of trails, the department shall coordinate with other state agencies to ensure that appropriate recreation or public access is available for such projects. (d) To the greatest extent practicable, the department shall program projects in the work program to plan for development of the entire trail and to minimize the creation of gaps between trail segments. The department shall, at a minimum, ensure that local support exists for projects and trail segments, including the availability or dedication of local funding sources and of contributions by private landowners who agree to make their land, or property interests in such land, available for public use as a trail. (e) Each metropolitan planning organization or board of county commissioners, as appropriate, shall include in its list of project priorities required under ss. 339.135(4)(c)1. and 339.175(8) one or more projects that are a priority under paragraph (b) and meet the requirements of this section. When developing the district work program under s. 339.135(4), each district must ensure that projects are included in the work program which are a priority under paragraph (b) and meet the requirements of this section. (6)(a) The department shall create uniform signage to identify trails that are part of the statewide network and shall, when feasible and permissible, erect signage on all such trails open to public use, regardless of when the trail was first opened. The department is not otherwise obligated to provide funds for the operation and maintenance of any trail on the statewide network. (b) The department may enter into a memorandum of agreement with a local government or other agency of the state to transfer maintenance responsibilities of an individual network component. The department may contract with a not-for-profit entity or private sector business or entity to provide maintenance services on an individual network component. (7)(a) The department may enter into a sponsorship agreement with a not-for-profit entity or private sector business or entity for commercial sponsorship displays on multiuse trails and related facilities. The department shall deposit any sponsorship agreement revenues into the State Transportation Trust Fund to be used for maintenance, signage, and provision of amenities on the multiuse trails and related facilities. Local governments may also enter into sponsorship agreements and likewise use the revenues for maintenance, signage, and provision of amenities on the multiuse trails and related facilities. A sponsorship agreement shall be administered by the department or the local government, as appropriate, and the department or the local government shall ensure that the sponsorship agreement complies with the requirements of s. 335.065(3)(b) and (c). (b) Commercial sponsorship displays are subject to the requirements of the Highway Beautification Act of 1965 and all federal laws and agreements, when applicable. This subsection does not create a proprietary or compensable interest in any sign, display site, or location. (8) By June 30, 2026, and every third year on June 30 thereafter, the department, in coordination with the Department of Environmental Protection, shall submit a report to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives summarizing the status of the Florida Shared-Use Nonmotorized Trail Network. The report may include recommendations for any legislative revisions deemed appropriate to facilitate connectivity of the statewide network. (a) At a minimum, the report must include all of the following: 1. The total number of completed miles of nonmotorized trails on the network. 2. The total number of completed miles of nonmotorized trails on the network not adjacent to a roadway facility. 3. The total number of completed miles of nonmotorized trails on the network adjacent to a roadway facility. 4. The total number of completed miles of nonmotorized trails on the network which are within or between areas of the Florida wildlife corridor as defined in s. 259.1055. 5. The total remaining miles of nonmotorized trails on the network which are planned for acquisition and construction. 6. The total expenditures, by funding source, associated with implementing the network. 7. The total expenditures, by project phase, including preliminary and environmental planning, design, acquisition of right-of-way, and new construction of trail surfaces and bridges on the network. (b) The department shall also coordinate with the Florida Tourism Industry Marketing Corporation, local governments, or other entities who have related information to include in the report. For each existing trail on the network which is open to public use, identified by the department’s trailway identification number, segment name, segment length, and county of location, the department’s report must provide nonmotorized trail operational and performance measures that include, but are not limited to: 1. The total number of trail visits. 2. The primary travel modes used on the trail. 3. The frequency of trail usage. 4. The average duration of trail usage. 5. The distance traveled during a trail visit. 6. The average amount spent by a user during a typical trail visit. 7. The total amount of user expenditures. 8. Any other measure deemed appropriate.
