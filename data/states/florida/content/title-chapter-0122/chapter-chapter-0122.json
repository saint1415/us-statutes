(2) The department and state officials administering said retirement system shall make the contribution deductions required by law from the compensation hereafter received by any of the said participating members of the Legislature for service rendered the State Legislature in the same manner as in the case of other state employment.

Requisition requirements shall be set by the department. (b) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, effective January 1, 1993, the normal retirement age for a member under this chapter is attained upon the member’s completion of 30 years of creditable service in the aggregate. (2)(a) Any state or county officer or employee who has attained the age of 55 or more and has accumulated at least 10 years’ service in the aggregate within the contemplation of this law and who has made or makes contributions to the State and County Officers and Employees’ Retirement Trust Fund for 5 or more years as prescribed by this law but who is not eligible to retire in accordance with subsection (1) may elect to retire and receive a reduced benefit, which would be the actuarial equivalent of the benefits provided in paragraph (1)(a). (b) Any county officer or employee who has served as sheriff or a full-time deputy sheriff for the last 10 years or more of employment and has attained the age of 50 or more and accumulated at least 10 years’ service in the aggregate within the contemplation of this law, and who has made or makes contributions to the State and County Officers and Employees’ Retirement Trust Fund for 5 or more years, as prescribed by this law, but who is not eligible to retire in accordance with subsection (1), may elect to retire and receive a reduced benefit, which would be the actuarial equivalent of the benefits provided in paragraph (1)(a). (3) Any state or county officer or employee shall have the right at any time prior to receipt of his or her first monthly installment of retirement compensation to elect to receive a reduced retirement compensation with the provision that if such officer or employee dies after retirement compensation installments have commenced the excess if any of his or her total contributions made to the retirement trust fund, without interest, over the total retirement compensation received by him or her shall be paid in accordance with the beneficiary designation of this law. The amount of such reduced retirement compensation shall be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of such retirement compensation otherwise payable to him or her. (4)(a) Any state or county officer or employee shall have the right at any time prior to receipt of his or her first monthly installment of retirement compensation to elect to receive a reduced retirement compensation with the provision that the surviving spouse shall continue to draw such reduced retirement compensation, or one-half thereof if so designated, so long as such spouse shall live. The amount of such reduced retirement compensation shall be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of such retirement compensation otherwise payable to such officer or employee. Any state or county officer or employee who becomes eligible for retirement and continues to hold office or be employed shall be construed to have selected the option herein which will afford the surviving spouse the greatest amount of benefits. Should such officer or employee die before retiring, his or her surviving spouse shall be entitled to receive either the accumulated contributions of such officer or employee at the date of death or the reduced retirement compensation to which the surviving spouse would have been entitled under such option, calculated on the assumption that such officer or employee retired on the date of death; provided, that for all those persons who become members of the retirement system on or after July 1, 1963, the amount of retirement compensation otherwise payable to the member at the date of death shall be determined on the basis of a retirement age of 62 years. Any officer or employee shall have the right at the time of retirement to change the option so provided; and, should the option be changed or not at the time of retirement, such option shall be effective immediately upon retirement and thereafter may not be revoked. (b) A member who elects an option in paragraph (a) shall on a form provided for that purpose designate his or her spouse as beneficiary to receive the benefits which continue to be payable upon the death of the member. After such benefits have commenced under an option in paragraph (a), the retired member may change the designation of his or her spouse as beneficiary only twice. If such a retired member remarries and wishes to make such a change, he or she may do so by filing with the department a notarized change of spouse designation form and shall notify the former spouse in writing of such change. Upon receipt of a completed change of spouse designation form, the department shall adjust the member’s monthly benefit by the application of actuarial tables and calculations developed to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the member’s current benefit. The consent of a retired member’s formerly designated spouse as beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. (5) Tables for computing the actuarial equivalent shall be approved by the department. (6) Any person retiring under the disability provision of this chapter shall not be entitled to the options of subsection (4). (7) No state or county official or employee who has a shortage in his or her accounts may retire or receive any benefits under this chapter so long as such shortage exists. (8) Any member of the retirement system whose rights have been preserved under s. 122.01(3) and who has had 30 years of service may exercise the option provided for in subsection (4) as it applies to persons who are eligible for normal retirement benefits. (9) Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter to the contrary, the following provisions shall apply to any officer or employee who has accumulated at least 10 years of service and dies: (a) If the deceased member’s surviving spouse has previously received a refund of the member’s contributions made to the retirement trust fund, such spouse may pay to the department an amount equal to the sum of the amount of the deceased member’s contributions previously refunded and interest at 3 percent compounded annually on the amount of such refunded contributions from the date of refund until July 1, 1975, and thereafter at the rate of 6.5 percent interest compounded annually to the date of payment to the department, and by so doing be entitled to receive the monthly retirement benefit provided in paragraph (c). (b) If the deceased member’s surviving spouse has not received a refund of the deceased member’s contributions, such spouse shall, upon application to the department, receive the monthly retirement benefit provided in paragraph (c). (c) The monthly benefit payable to the spouse described in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) shall be the amount which would have been payable to the deceased member’s spouse, assuming that the member retired on the date of death and had selected the option in subsection (4) which would afford the surviving spouse the greatest amount of benefits, such benefit to be based on the ages of the spouse and member as of the date of death of the member. Such benefit shall commence on the first day of the month following the payment of the aforesaid amount to the department, if paragraph (a) is applicable, or on the first day of the month following the receipt of the spouse’s application by the department, if paragraph (b) is applicable. (10) Upon the death of a retired member or beneficiary receiving monthly benefits under this chapter, the monthly benefits shall be paid through the last day of the month of death and shall terminate, or be adjusted, if applicable, as of that date in accordance with the optional form of benefit selected at the time of retirement.

Any such officer or employee who fails to be reemployed by the state or a county of the state within those 5 years shall be refunded 100 percent of his or her contributions to the retirement trust fund, without interest, and all prior service credit shall be forfeited should he or she be reemployed at a later date.

No officer or employee who has received benefits under this law shall be entitled to a refund. (2) Any former members of the state or county retirement systems established by former chapters 121 and 134, that terminated their service after 10 or more years of service and received a refund of 50 percent of their retirement contributions may, upon written request to the division, receive a refund of any balance credited to their account provided they are not members of the state and county retirement system under this chapter. (3) Any person who hereafter elects to receive retirement benefits under s. 112.05, shall not be entitled to the retirement benefit of this chapter, except for the refund of his or her contributions to the retirement trust fund as provided in this section; likewise any person who elects to receive retirement benefits under this chapter shall thereby become ineligible to receive retirement benefits under s. 112.05. (4) Should any officer or employee elect to receive a refund as provided in this section, his or her application for refund shall be submitted in the manner prescribed by the regulations adopted by the department and shall accompany the payroll certification, submitted to the department, on which he or she was last paid prior to termination. The department shall pay the entire refund due within 45 days after the first day of the month subsequent to receipt of such application for refund and said payroll certification. (5) Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter to the contrary, any officer or employee who has accumulated an aggregate of 25 or more years of service and terminates his or her employment and elects to receive a refund of his or her contributions made to the retirement trust fund in accordance with this section may, at any time prior to July 1, 1970, pay to the division an amount equal to the sum of: the amount of his or her contributions previously refunded and interest at 3 percent compounded annually on the amount of his or her refunded contributions from the date of refund to the date of payment to the division.

(2)(a) Any person retired under this chapter, except under the disability retirement provisions of ss. 122.09 and 122.34, may be reemployed by any private or public employer after retirement and receive retirement benefits and compensation from his or her employer without limitation, except that no person may receive both a salary from reemployment with any agency participating in the Florida Retirement System and retirement benefits under this chapter for a period of 12 months immediately subsequent to the date of retirement. (b) Any person to whom the limitation in paragraph (a) applies who violates such reemployment limitation and is reemployed with any agency participating in the Florida Retirement System prior to completion of the 12-month limitation period shall give timely notice of this fact in writing to his or her employer and to the department; and his or her retirement benefits shall be suspended for the balance of the 12-month limitation period. Any person employed in violation of this subsection and any employing agency which knowingly employs or appoints such person without notifying the department to suspend retirement benefits shall be jointly and severally liable for reimbursement to the retirement trust fund of any benefits paid during the reemployment limitation period. To avoid liability, such employing agency shall have a written statement from the retiree that he or she is not retired from a state-administered retirement system. Any retirement benefits received by such person while he or she is reemployed during this reemployment limitation period shall be repaid to the retirement trust fund, and his or her retirement benefits shall remain suspended until such repayment has been made. Any benefits suspended beyond the reemployment limitation period shall apply toward the repayment of benefits received in violation of the reemployment limitation. (c) The employment by an employer of any retiree of a state-administered retirement system shall have no effect on the average final compensation or years of creditable service of such retiree. Prior to July 1, 1991, upon employment of any person, other than an elected officer as provided in s. 121.053, who has been retired under a state-administered retirement program, the employer shall pay retirement contributions in an amount equal to the unfunded actuarial accrued liability portion of the employer contribution which would be required for a regular member of the Florida Retirement System. Effective July 1, 1991, contributions shall be made as provided in s. 121.122 for renewed membership.

While membership in division B shall date from the filing of such election with the administrator, for the purposes of contributions to the system and benefits to members under division B, membership in division B shall take effect upon the date of execution of the agreement.

(b) Under the conditions prescribed by s. 218(d)(6)(F) of the Social Security Act, a person who was a member of division A of this system on December 31, 1957, and who is still such a member, may transfer to division B of this system by filing a written request therefor with the administrator by December 1, 1959. Social security coverage incidental to such elective membership in division B shall be effective as of January 1, 1956, or the date such person became a member of this system, whichever is the later.

Social security coverage incidental to such elective membership in division B shall be effective as of January 1, 1956, or the date such person became a member of this system, whichever is later, but in no event earlier than the effective date specified in the agreement or modification thereof. All amounts required from a member for retroactive social security coverage shall, at the time such election is made, be deducted from the individual account of the member and the difference between the amount remaining in the individual account of such member and the total amount which such member would have contributed had he or she become a member of division B as of January 1, 1956, shall be paid into the retirement fund, and added to his or her individual account, prior to July 1, 1970, or by his or her date of retirement if earlier. If such payment is made after July 1, 1970, the member shall be required to pay interest at the rate of 10 percent of the unpaid balance compounded annually each June 30 from July 1, 1972, to the date of repayment.

Any highway patrol officer who has retired from the highway patrol and is subsequently employed by the state or a county of the state shall be eligible to participate under social security in the same manner as any other state or county employee.

A year shall be 12 running months. In the event that an officer or employee has not contributed to the retirement trust fund for at least 10 years, then the average final compensation shall mean the average salary of the last 10 years’ service.(3)“Salary” shall mean the fixed monthly compensation paid officers and employees, and where officers’ or employees’ compensation is derived from fees set by statute, salary shall be the total cash remuneration received from such fees. Under no circumstances shall salary include fees paid professional persons for special or particular services. However, salary for all plan years beginning on or after July 1, 1990, shall not include any amounts in excess of the compensation limitation (originally $200,000) established by s. 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code prior to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which limitation shall be adjusted for changes in the cost of living since 1989, in the manner provided by s. 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1991. This limitation, which has been part of the State and County Officers’ and Employees’ Retirement System since plan years beginning on or after July 1, 1990, shall be adjusted as required by federal law for qualified government plans.(4)(a)In determining the aggregate number of years of service of any officer or employee, the time of military service between 1939 and 1946 by the employee on leave of absence shall be added to the years of state or county service. Credit for any other military service shall not exceed 4 years; provided that those individuals who were employed by the War Manpower Commission in Florida (or on military leave from the War Manpower Commission) prior to November 16, 1946, by the National Reemployment Service in Florida subsequent to June 30, 1933, the1Florida State Employment Service subsequent to June 30, 1935, or in the readjustment allowance or employment service departments of the Veterans Administration in Florida between July 1, 1944, and January 1, 1950, and who continued in employment with the state or any county without more than one interruption in the performance of service, this interruption not to exceed 5 years, shall be entitled to credit for continuous service for all such employment with the named agency or department, and shall have such time added to their aggregate number of years of service; provided further, that any such employee claiming such credit shall pay into the State and County Officers and Employees’ Retirement Trust Fund an amount equivalent to the amount which would have been placed in the fund had such employee been paying into the fund from July 1, 1945, on the basis of the wages paid to such employee by the Federal Government, plus interest thereon at the rate of 3 percent compounded annually until July 1, 1975, and thereafter at the rate of 6.5 percent interest compounded annually until date of payment; and provided further, that such persons shall furnish proper proof from the governmental agency showing the payment of wages for such service and that such persons are not claiming and have not been allowed credit for such service in a federal or any other retirement system, except those persons formerly with the War Manpower Commission who, prior to 1961, received federal service credit. Leave of absence shall be construed to cover any officer or employee of the state or county who was serving as such during the calendar year of 1940, or any time subsequent thereto, and who resigned his or her employment in time of war or national emergency to enter military service and who thereafter returned to that former employment with the state or county as soon as possible after release from military service.(b)Any person claiming prior service credit under the provisions of this subsection shall pay into the State and County Officers and Employees’ Retirement Trust Fund a contribution equal to 5 percent of the earnings received during the period being claimed, plus 3 percent interest thereon compounded annually, such interest to commence and run from July 1, 1945, with respect to service prior thereto and from dates of employment with respect to service subsequent to June 30, 1945, and such interest shall continue to be figured at the rate of 3 percent until July 1, 1975, on which date and thereafter such interest shall be figured at the rate of 6.5 percent interest, compounded annually until date of payment.(5)If compensation for accumulated annual leave is due and payable and is paid to the surviving spouse and the necessary contribution is made to the retirement trust fund, time for accumulated annual leave, not to exceed 30 working days, shall be added to the aggregate number of years service and to the member’s age, provided such time is needed to make the member eligible for retirement benefits at the time of death, in which event the retirement benefits shall be computed on the basis of the retirement age specified in s. 122.08(1) and (2)(a) if the member died prior to July 1, 1963, or on the basis of a retirement age of 65 years if the member died on or after July 1, 1963. Otherwise aggregate number of years of service shall mean the total number of years, and fractional parts of years, of service of any officer or employee omitting intervening years and fractional parts of years, when such officer or employee may not be employed by the state or county. Provided that any nonacademic employee of a school board shall receive a full year’s service credit for all years under the following conditions:(a)Provided all necessary contributions have been made to the retirement trust fund.(b)Provided the employee is employed and receives salary for the full school year.(6)“Department” means the Department of Management Services.History.—s. 2, ch. 29801, 1955; ss. 1-3, ch. 57-364; s. 1, ch. 57-813; s. 2, ch. 61-119; s. 1, ch. 61-469; s. 1, ch. 61-422; s. 1, ch. 63-453; s. 3, ch. 63-555; s. 8, ch. 65-484; ss. 1, 2, ch. 67-412; ss. 31, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 39, ch. 71-377; s. 1, ch. 73-326; s. 3, ch. 74-328; s. 62, ch. 92-279; s. 55, ch. 92-326; s. 780, ch. 95-147; s. 3, ch. 95-154; s. 12, ch. 96-368; s. 54, ch. 99-255.1Note.—Seess. 2 and 15, ch. 83-174, which merge the Florida State Employment Service into the newly established Division of Labor, Employment, and Training of the Department of Labor and Employment Security and provide for a “state public employment service” within that division.
