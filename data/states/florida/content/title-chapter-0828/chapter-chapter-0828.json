      "text": "828.05 Killing an injured or diseased domestic animal.— (1) The purpose of this section is to provide a swift and merciful means whereby domestic animals which are suffering from an incurable or untreatable condition or are imminently near death from injury or disease may be destroyed without unconscionable delay and in a humane and proficient manner. (2) As used in this section, the term “officer” means: (a) Any law enforcement officer; (b) Any veterinarian; and (c) Any officer or agent of any municipal or county animal control unit or of any society or association for the prevention of cruelty to animals, or the designee of such an officer or agent. (3) Whenever any domestic animal is so injured or diseased as to appear useless and is suffering, and it reasonably appears to an officer that such animal is imminently near death or cannot be cured or rendered fit for service and the officer has made a reasonable and concerted, but unsuccessful, effort to locate the owner, the owner’s agent, or a veterinarian, then such officer, acting in good faith and upon reasonable belief, may immediately destroy such animal by shooting the animal or injecting it with a barbiturate drug. If the officer locates the owner or the owner’s agent, the officer shall notify him or her of the animal’s location and condition. If the officer locates only a veterinarian, the officer shall destroy the animal only upon the advice of the veterinarian. However, this section does not prohibit an owner from destroying his or her own domestic animal in a humane and proficient manner when the conditions described in this section exist. (4) No officer or veterinarian acting in good faith and with due care pursuant to this section will be liable either criminally or civilly for such act, nor will any civil or criminal liability attach to the employer of the officer or veterinarian. (5) A court order is not necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.

The rules shall set forth guidelines for the proper storage and handling of these prescription drugs and such other provisions as may be necessary to ensure that the drugs are used solely for the purpose set forth in this section. The rules shall also provide for an application fee not to exceed $50 and a biennial renewal fee not to exceed $50. Upon formal, written request and recommendation adopted in a public meeting by the Board of Veterinary Medicine, the Board of Pharmacy may, by rule, add controlled substances and legend drugs to the list of prescription drugs in this subsection upon a finding that such additions are necessary for the humane and lawful euthanasia of injured, sick, or abandoned domestic animals or chemical immobilization of animals. (2) Any county or municipal animal control agency or any humane society registered with the Secretary of State may apply to the Department of Health for a permit to purchase, possess, and use the prescription drugs authorized under subsection (1). Upon certification by the Board of Pharmacy that the applicant meets the qualifications set forth in the rules, the Department of Health shall issue the permit. The possession and use of the prescription drugs authorized under subsection (1) is limited to those employees or agents of the permittee certified in accordance with s. 828.058 or s. 828.27 while operating in the scope of their respective official or employment duties with the permittee. (3) The department or the board may deny a permit, and revoke, suspend, or refuse to renew the permit of any permittee, and may fine, place on probation, or otherwise discipline any permittee, upon a determination that: (a) The applicant or permittee or any of its employees or agents is using or has used a prescription drug authorized under subsection (1) for any purpose other than that set forth in this section; (b) The applicant or permittee has failed to take reasonable precautions against misuse, theft, loss, or diversion of such prescription drugs; (c) The applicant or permittee has failed to detect or to report to the Department of Health a significant loss, theft, or inventory shortage of such prescription drugs; (d) The applicant or permittee has failed to follow the rules of the Board of Pharmacy regarding proper storage and handling of such prescription drugs; or (e) The permittee has violated any provision of this section, chapter 465, chapter 499, or any rule adopted under those chapters. (4) The board shall adopt rules implementing subsection (3), provided that disciplinary action may be taken only for a substantial violation of the provisions of this section or the rules adopted under this section. In determining the severity of an administrative penalty to be assessed under this section, the department or the Board of Pharmacy shall consider: (a) The severity of the violation; (b) Any actions taken by the person to correct the violation or to remedy complaints, and the timing of those actions; and (c) Any previous violations. (5) The Department of Health may issue an emergency order immediately suspending a permit issued under this section upon a determination that a permittee, as a result of any violation of any provision of this section or any rule adopted under this section, presents a danger to the public health, safety, and welfare. (6) This section shall not apply to licensed pharmacies, veterinarians, or health care practitioners operating within the scope of the applicable professional act.

A lethal solution shall be used in the following order of preference: (a) Intravenous injection by hypodermic needle; (b) Intraperitoneal injection by hypodermic needle; or (c) If the dog or cat is unconscious with no corneal reflex, intracardial injection by hypodermic needle. (2) A dog or cat may be tranquilized with an approved and humane substance before euthanasia is performed. (3) Succinylcholine chloride, curare, curariform mixtures, any substance which acts as a neuromuscular blocking agent, or a chamber which causes a change in body oxygen may not be used on a dog or cat for any purpose. However, whenever an emergency situation exists which requires the immediate euthanasia of an injured, diseased, or dangerous animal, a law enforcement officer, a veterinarian, or an agent of a local animal control unit or the designee of such an agent may humanely destroy the animal, as provided in s. 828.05. (4)(a) Euthanasia shall be performed only by a licensed veterinarian or an employee or agent of a public or private agency, animal shelter, or other facility that is operated for the collection and care of stray, neglected, abandoned, or unwanted animals, provided the employee or agent has successfully completed a 16-hour euthanasia technician certification course. The curriculum for such course must be approved by the Board of Veterinary Medicine and must include, at a minimum, the pharmacology, proper administration, and storage of euthanasia solutions; federal and state laws regulating the storage and accountability of euthanasia solutions; euthanasia technician stress management; and proper disposal of euthanized animals. An employee or agent performing euthanasia before October 1, 1993, must obtain certification by October 1, 1994. An employee or agent who begins performing euthanasia on or after October 1, 1993, must obtain certification before performing any euthanasia. However, a certified veterinarian technician who is an employee or agent as defined in the subsection, may perform euthanasia without completing the certification course required by this subsection. Euthanasia must be performed in a humane and proficient manner. (b) No dog or cat may be left unattended between the time euthanasia procedures are first begun and the time death occurs, nor may its body be disposed of until death is confirmed by a qualified person.

(2) Any law enforcement officer, any animal control officer certified pursuant to s. 828.27, or any agent of any county or of any society or association for the prevention of cruelty to animals appointed under s. 828.03 may: (a) Lawfully take custody of any animal found neglected or cruelly treated by removing the animal from its present location, or (b) Order the owner of any animal found neglected or cruelly treated to provide certain care to the animal at the owner’s expense without removal of the animal from its present location, and shall file a petition seeking relief under this section in the county court of the county in which the animal is found within 10 days after the animal is seized or an order to provide care is issued. The court shall schedule and commence a hearing on the petition within 30 days after the petition is filed to determine whether the owner, if known, is able to adequately provide for the animal and is fit to have custody of the animal. The hearing shall be concluded and the court order entered thereon within 60 days after the date the hearing is commenced. The timeframes set forth in this subsection are not jurisdictional. However, if a failure to meet such timeframes is attributable to the officer or agent, the owner is not required to pay the officer or agent for care of the animal during any period of delay caused by the officer or agent. A fee may not be charged for filing the petition. This subsection does not require court action for taking custody and properly disposing of stray or abandoned animals as lawfully performed by animal control agents. (3) The law enforcement officer, the animal control officer certified pursuant to s. 828.27, or the agent of any county or of any society or association for the prevention of cruelty to animals taking custody of an animal pursuant to this section shall have written notice served, at least 3 days before the hearing scheduled under subsection (2), upon the owner of the animal, if he or she is known and is residing in the county where the animal was taken, in accordance with chapter 48 relating to service of process. The sheriff of the county may not charge a fee for service of such notice. (4)(a) The law enforcement officer, the animal control officer certified pursuant to s. 828.27, or the agent of any county or of any society or association for the prevention of cruelty to animals taking custody of an animal pursuant to this section shall provide for the animal until either: 1. The owner is adjudged by the court to be able to adequately provide for, and have custody of, the animal, in which case the animal shall be returned to the owner upon payment by the owner for the care and provision for the animal while in the agent’s or officer’s custody; or 2. The animal is turned over to the officer or agent pursuant to paragraph (c) and humanely disposed of. (b) If the court determines that the owner is able to provide adequately for, and have custody of, the animal, the order shall provide that the animal in the possession of the officer or agent be claimed and removed by the owner within 7 days after the date of the order. (c) Upon the court’s judgment that the owner of the animal is unable or unfit to adequately provide for the animal: 1. The court may: a. Order that the current owner have no further custody of the animal and that the animal be sold by the sheriff at public auction or remanded to the custody of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Humane Society, the county, the municipality with animal control officers certified pursuant to s. 828.27, or any agency or person the judge deems appropriate to be disposed of as the agency or person sees fit; or b. Order that the animal be destroyed or remanded directly to the custody of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Humane Society, the county, the municipality with animal control officers certified pursuant to s. 828.27, or any agency or person the judge deems appropriate to be disposed of as the agency or person sees fit. 2. The court, upon proof of costs incurred by the officer or agent, may require that the owner pay for the care of the animal while in the custody of the officer or agent. A separate hearing may be held. 3. The court may order that other animals that are in the custody of the owner and that were not seized by the officer or agent be turned over to the officer or agent if the court determines that the owner is unable or unfit to adequately provide for the animals. The court may enjoin the owner’s further possession or custody of other animals. (5) In determining the person’s fitness to have custody of an animal, the court may consider, among other matters: (a) Testimony from the agent or officer who seized the animal and other witnesses as to the condition of the animal when seized and as to the conditions under which the animal was kept. (b) Testimony and evidence as to the veterinary care provided to the animal. (c) Testimony and evidence as to the type and amount of care provided to the animal. (d) Expert testimony as to the community standards for proper and reasonable care of the same type of animal. (e) Testimony from any witnesses as to prior treatment or condition of this or other animals in the same custody. (f) The owner’s past record of judgments pursuant to this chapter. (g) Convictions pursuant to applicable statutes prohibiting cruelty to animals. (h) Other evidence the court considers to be material or relevant. (6) If the evidence indicates a lack of proper and reasonable care of the animal, the burden is on the owner to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he or she is able and fit to have custody of and adequately provide for the animal. (7) In any case in which an animal is offered for auction under this section, the proceeds shall be: (a) Applied, first, to the cost of the sale. (b) Applied, secondly, to the care of and provision for the animal by the law enforcement officer, the animal control officer certified pursuant to s. 828.27, or the agent of any county or of any society or association for the prevention of cruelty to animals taking custody. (c) Applied, thirdly, to the payment of the owner for the sale of the animal. (d) Paid over to the court if the owner is not known.

(b) A person convicted of a second or subsequent violation of this subsection shall be required to pay a minimum mandatory fine of $5,000 and serve a minimum mandatory period of incarceration of 6 months. In addition, the person shall be released only upon expiration of sentence, is not eligible for parole, control release, or any form of early release, and must serve 100 percent of the court-imposed sentence. Any plea of nolo contendere shall be considered a conviction for purposes of this subsection. (3) A person who commits multiple acts of animal cruelty or aggravated animal cruelty against an animal may be charged with a separate offense for each such act. A person who commits animal cruelty or aggravated animal cruelty against more than one animal may be charged with a separate offense for each animal such cruelty was committed upon. (4) A veterinarian licensed to practice in the state shall be held harmless from either criminal or civil liability for any decisions made or services rendered under the provisions of this section. Such a veterinarian is, therefore, under this subsection, immune from a lawsuit for his or her part in an investigation of cruelty to animals. (5) A person who intentionally trips, fells, ropes, or lassos the legs of a horse by any means for the purpose of entertainment or sport commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. As used in this subsection, the term “trip” means any act that consists of the use of any wire, pole, stick, rope, or other apparatus to cause a horse to fall or lose its balance, and the term “horse” means any animal of any registered breed of the genus Equus, or any recognized hybrid thereof. This subsection does not apply when tripping is used: (a) To control a horse that is posing an immediate threat to other livestock or human beings; (b) For the purpose of identifying ownership of the horse when its ownership is unknown; or (c) For the purpose of administering veterinary care to the horse. (6) In addition to other penalties prescribed by law, a person who is convicted of a violation of this section may be prohibited by the court from owning, possessing, keeping, harboring, or having custody or control over any animal for a period of time determined by the court. (7) Beginning January 1, 2026, the Department of Law Enforcement shall post on its website, in a searchable format prescribed by the department, the names of those individuals who have been convicted of, or who have entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, regardless of adjudication, a violation of this section.

Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection to the contrary, possession of the animal alone does not constitute a violation of this section. (4) If a court finds probable cause to believe that a violation of this section or s. 828.12 has occurred, the court shall order the seizure of any animals and equipment used in committing the violation and shall provide for appropriate and humane care or disposition of the animals. This subsection is not a limitation on the power to seize animals as evidence at the time of arrest. (5) If an animal shelter or other location is unavailable, a court may order the animal to be impounded on the property of its owner or possessor and shall order such person to provide all necessary care for the animal and to allow regular inspections of the animal by a person designated by the court. (6) If a veterinarian finds that an animal kept or used in violation of this section is suffering from an injury or a disease severe enough that it is not possible to humanely house and care for the animal pending completion of a hearing held under s. 828.073(2), final disposition of the criminal charges, or court-ordered forfeiture, the veterinarian may euthanize the animal as specified in s. 828.058. A veterinarian licensed to practice in this state shall be held harmless from criminal or civil liability for any decisions made or services rendered under this subsection. (7) If an animal can be housed in a humane manner, the provisions of s. 828.073 shall apply. For the purpose of a hearing provided pursuant to s. 828.073(2), any animal baited, bred, trained, transported, sold, owned, possessed, or used for the purpose of animal fighting or baiting shall be considered mistreated. (8) In addition to other penalties prescribed by law, the court may issue an order prohibiting a person who is convicted of a violation of this section from owning, possessing, keeping, harboring, or having custody or control over any animals within the species that are the subject of the conviction, or any animals kept for the purpose of fighting or baiting, for a period of time determined by the court.

The applicable civil penalty if the person elects to contest the citation. 9. The applicable civil penalty if the person elects not to contest the citation. 10. A conspicuous statement that if the person fails to pay the civil penalty within the time allowed, or fails to appear in court to contest the citation, the person shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to contest the citation and that, in such case, judgment may be entered against the person for an amount up to the maximum civil penalty. 11. A conspicuous statement that if the person is required to appear in court as mandated by subsection (6), he or she does not have the option of paying a fine in lieu of appearing in court. (g) “Ordinance” means any ordinance relating to the control of or cruelty to animals enacted by the governing body of a county or municipality the violation of which is a civil infraction.

(b) A maximum civil penalty not to exceed $500. (c) A civil penalty of less than the maximum civil penalty if the person who has committed the civil infraction does not contest the citation. (d) For the issuance of a citation by an officer who has probable cause to believe that a person has committed an act in violation of an ordinance. (e) For the contesting of a citation in the county court. (f) That, if a person fails to pay the civil penalty, fails to appear in court to contest the citation, or fails to appear in court as required by subsection (6), the court may issue an order to show cause upon the request of the governing body of the county or municipality. This order shall require such persons to appear before the court to explain why action on the citation has not been taken. If any person who is issued such order fails to appear in response to the court’s directive, that person may be held in contempt of court. (g) Such procedures and provisions as are necessary to implement any ordinances enacted under the authority of this section. (3) The commission of a charged infraction at a hearing authorized pursuant to this chapter must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. (4)(a)1. County-employed animal control officers must, and municipally-employed animal control officers may, successfully complete a 40-hour minimum standards training course. Such course must include, but is not limited to, training for animal cruelty investigations, search and seizure, animal handling, courtroom demeanor, and civil citations. The course curriculum must be approved by the Florida Animal Control Association. An animal control officer who successfully completes such course shall be issued a certificate indicating that he or she has received a passing grade. 2. County-employed and municipally-employed animal control officers must successfully complete the 1-hour training course developed by the Department of Children and Families pursuant to s. 39.208(5).

Such training may include, but is not limited to, training for animal cruelty investigations, search and seizure, animal handling, courtroom demeanor, and civil citations. (b) The governing body of a county or municipality may impose and collect a surcharge of up to $5 upon each civil penalty imposed for violation of an ordinance relating to animal control or cruelty. The proceeds from such surcharges shall be used to pay the costs of training for animal control officers. (5) Any person who willfully refuses to sign and accept a citation issued by an officer is guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (6) The governing body of a county or municipality may require mandatory court appearances for certain aggravated violations of a local ordinance resulting in the unprovoked biting, attacking, or wounding of a domestic animal; violations resulting in the destruction or loss of personal property; second or subsequent violations of local animal cruelty laws; or violations resulting in the issuance of a third or subsequent citation to a person. The citation must clearly inform the person of the mandatory court appearance. The governing body of the county or municipality shall maintain records to prove the number of citations issued to the person. Persons required to appear in court do not have the option of paying the fine instead of appearing in court. (7) Nothing contained in this section shall prevent any county or municipality from enacting any ordinance relating to animal control or cruelty which is identical to the provisions of this chapter or any other state law, except as to penalty. However, no county or municipal ordinance relating to animal control or cruelty shall conflict with the provisions of this chapter or any other state law. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the governing body of any county or municipality is authorized to enact ordinances prohibiting or regulating noise from any domesticated animal, violation of which shall be punishable upon conviction by a fine not to exceed $500 or by imprisonment in the county jail for a period not to exceed 60 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment, for each violation of such ordinance. This subsection shall not apply to animals on land zoned for agricultural purposes. (8) This section is an additional, supplemental, and alternative means of enforcing county or municipal codes or ordinances. This section does not prohibit a county or municipality from enforcing its codes or ordinances by any other means, including, but not limited to, the procedures provided in chapter 162.

(b) Acting under the indirect supervision of a veterinarian, an employee, an agent, or a contractor of a county or municipal animal control authority or sheriff may vaccinate against rabies dogs, cats, and ferrets that are in the custody of an animal control authority or a sheriff and which will be transferred, rescued, fostered, adopted, or reclaimed by the owner. The supervising veterinarian assumes responsibility for any person vaccinating animals at his or her direction or under his or her direct or indirect supervision. As used in this paragraph, the term “indirect supervision” means that the supervising veterinarian is required to be available for consultation through telecommunications but is not required to be physically present during such consultation. (c) The owner of every dog, cat, and ferret shall have the animal revaccinated 12 months after the initial vaccination. Thereafter, the interval between vaccinations shall conform to the vaccine manufacturer’s directions. The cost of vaccination must be borne by the animal’s owner. Evidence of circulating rabies virus neutralizing antibodies may not be used as a substitute for current vaccination in managing rabies exposure or determining the need for booster vaccinations. (2) A dog, cat, or ferret is exempt from vaccination against rabies if a licensed veterinarian has examined the animal and has certified in writing that at the time vaccination would endanger the animal’s health because of its age, infirmity, disability, illness, or other medical considerations. An exempt animal must be vaccinated against rabies as soon as its health permits. (3) Upon vaccination against rabies, the licensed veterinarian shall provide the animal’s owner and the animal control authority with a rabies vaccination certificate. Each animal control authority and veterinarian shall use the “Rabies Vaccination Certificate” of the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV) or an equivalent form approved by the local government that contains all the information required by the NASPHV Rabies Vaccination Certificate. The veterinarian who administers the rabies vaccination or who supervises the administration of the rabies vaccination as provided in paragraph (1)(b) to an animal as authorized under this section may affix his or her signature stamp in lieu of an actual signature. (4) Each ferret vaccinated according to this section must be quarantined, when necessary, according to rules of the Department of Health. (5) An animal owner’s name, street address, phone number, and animal tag number contained in a rabies vaccination certificate provided to the animal control authority is exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. However, any person who has been bitten, scratched, or otherwise exposed to a zoonotic disease or the physician of such person; a veterinarian who is treating an animal that has been bitten, scratched, or otherwise exposed to a zoonotic disease; or the owner of an animal that has been bitten, scratched, or otherwise exposed to a zoonotic disease shall be provided with any information contained in a rabies vaccination certificate but only with respect to the particular animal biting, scratching, or otherwise causing exposure. Any person with an animal tag number may receive vaccination certificate information with regard to that animal. Law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies; other animal control authorities; emergency and medical response and disease control agencies; or other governmental health agencies shall be provided information contained in the rabies vaccination certificate for the purpose of controlling the transmission of rabies; however, the receiving agencies and authorities must not release the exempt information. (6) Violation of this section is a civil infraction, punishable as provided in s. 828.27(2). (7) This section does not prohibit or limit municipalities or counties from establishing requirements similar to or more stringent than the provisions of this section for the implementation and enforcement of rabies-control ordinances. However, local governments shall not mandate revaccination of currently vaccinated animals except in instances involving postexposure treatment for rabies.
