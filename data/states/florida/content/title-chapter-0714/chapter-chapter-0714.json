(2) The court may issue an order under this chapter without written or oral notice to the adverse party only if: (a) It appears from the specific facts shown by affidavit or verified pleading or motion that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the movant or that waste, dissipation, impairment, or substantial diminution in value will result to the subject real estate before any adverse party can be heard in opposition; and (b) The movant’s attorney certifies in writing all efforts that have been made to give notice to all known adverse parties, or the reasons why such notice should not be required. (3) Only an affidavit, a declaration or a verified pleading, or a motion may be used to support the application for the appointment of a receiver, unless the adverse party appears at the hearing or has received reasonable prior notice of the hearing. Every order appointing a receiver without notice must be endorsed with the date and hour of entry, must be filed forthwith in the clerk’s office, must define the injury, must state findings by the court as to why the injury may be irreparable, and must give the reasons why the order was granted without notice if notice was not given. The order appointing a receiver shall remain in effect until the further order of the court. (4) This chapter does not displace any existing rule of procedural or judicial administration of this state governing service or notice, including, without limitation, Rule 1.070, Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, and Rule 2.525, Florida Rules of Judicial Administration, which shall remain in full force and effect.

Is being subjected to or is in danger of waste, loss, substantial diminution in value, dissipation, or impairment; or 2. Has been or is about to be the subject of a voidable transaction; (b) After judgment: 1. To carry the judgment into effect; or 2. To preserve nonexempt real property pending appeal or when an execution has been returned unsatisfied and the owner refuses to apply the property in satisfaction of the judgment; (c) In an action in which a receiver for real property may be appointed on equitable grounds, subject to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b); or (d) During the time allowed for redemption, to preserve real property sold in an execution or foreclosure sale and secure its rents to the person entitled to the rents. (2) In connection with the foreclosure or other enforcement of a mortgage, the court shall consider the following facts and circumstances, together with any other relevant facts, in deciding whether to appoint a receiver for the mortgaged property: (a) Appointment is necessary to protect the property from waste, loss, substantial diminution in value, transfer, dissipation, or impairment; (b) The mortgagor agreed in a signed record to the appointment of a receiver on default; (c) The owner agreed, after default and in a signed record, to appointment of a receiver; (d) The property and any other collateral held by the mortgagee are not sufficient to satisfy the secured obligation; (e) The owner fails to turn over to the mortgagee proceeds or rents the mortgagee was entitled to collect; or (f) The holder of a subordinate lien obtains appointment of a receiver for the property. (3) The court may condition the appointment of a receiver without prior notice or hearing under s. 714.03 on the giving of security by the person seeking the appointment for the payment of damages, reasonable attorney fees, and costs incurred or suffered by any person if the court later concludes that the appointment was not justified. If the court later concludes that the appointment was justified and the order of appointment of the receiver becomes final and no longer subject to appeal, the court shall release the bond or other security. When any order appointing a receiver or providing for injunctive relief is issued on the pleading of a municipality or the state, or any officer, agency, or political subdivision thereof, the court may require or dispense with a bond, with or without surety, and conditioned in the same manner, having due regard for public interest. (4) A party adversely affected by an order appointing a receiver may move to dissolve or modify the order at any time. If a party moves to dissolve or modify the order, the motion must be heard within 5 days after the movant applies for a hearing on the motion or at such time as the court determines is reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances after the movant applies for a hearing on the motion. After notice and a hearing, the court may grant relief for cause shown. History.—s. 1, ch. 2020-106.

(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (8), with court approval, a receiver may adopt or reject an executory contract of the owner relating to receivership property. The court may condition the receiver’s adoption and continued performance of the contract on terms appropriate under the circumstances. If the receiver does not request court approval to adopt or reject the contract within a reasonable time after the receiver’s appointment, the receiver is deemed to have rejected the contract. (3) A receiver’s performance of an executory contract before court approval under subsection (2) of its adoption or rejection is not an adoption of the contract and does not preclude the receiver from seeking approval to reject the contract. (4) A provision in an executory contract which requires or permits a forfeiture, modification, or termination of the contract because of the appointment of a receiver or the financial condition of the owner does not affect a receiver’s power under subsection (2) to adopt the contract. (5) A receiver’s right to possess or use receivership property pursuant to an executory contract terminates on rejection of the contract under subsection (2). Rejection is a breach of the contract effective immediately before appointment of the receiver. A claim for damages for rejection of the contract must be submitted by the later of: (a) The time set for submitting a claim in the receivership; or (b) Thirty days after the court approves the rejection. (6) If at the time a receiver is appointed, the owner has the right to assign an executory contract relating to receivership property under the laws of this state other than this chapter, the receiver may assign the contract with court approval. (7) If a receiver rejects an executory contract for the sale of receivership property that is real property in possession of the purchaser or a real-property timeshare interest pursuant to subsection (2), the purchaser may: (a) Treat the rejection as a termination of the contract, and in that case the purchaser has a lien on the property for the recovery of any part of the purchase price the purchaser paid; or (b) Retain the purchaser’s right to possession under the contract. If the purchaser retains his or her right to possession pursuant to this paragraph, the purchaser must continue to perform all obligations arising under the contract and may offset any damages caused by nonperformance of an obligation of the owner after the date of the rejection, but the purchaser does not have a right or claim against other receivership property or the receiver on account of the damages. (8) A receiver may not reject an unexpired lease of real property under which the owner is the landlord if: (a) The tenant occupies the leased premises as the tenant’s primary residence; (b) The receiver was appointed at the request of a person other than a mortgagee; or (c) The receiver was appointed at the request of a mortgagee and: 1. The lease is superior to the lien of the mortgage; 2. The tenant has an enforceable agreement with the mortgagee or the holder of a senior lien under which the tenant’s occupancy will not be disturbed as long as the tenant performs its obligations under the lease; 3. The mortgagee has consented to the lease, either in a signed record or by its failure to timely object that the lease violated the mortgage; or 4. The terms of the lease were commercially reasonable at the time the lease was agreed to and the tenant did not know or have reason to know that the lease violated the mortgage.
