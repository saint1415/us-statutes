Whenever a person is admitted to a hospital, such person shall be asked if he or she is a veteran. Before a hospital submits a bill for services pursuant to this section, such hospital shall take sufficient steps to determine that no other funds or means of payment are available to cover the cost of services rendered to the veteran.

Said commissioner, or his or her designee, shall have sole power to determine whether such veteran is entitled to admission to the Veterans Residential Services facility or to a hospital, including the Healthcare Center, and such veteran, if admitted, may, upon application to the commissioner, receive transportation at the expense of the state from his or her place of residence to said facility or such hospital. No veteran so admitted shall be discharged from said facility except upon the approval of the commissioner or his or her designee. The commissioner shall have sole power to remove from any hospital to another hospital any veteran whose care and treatment is paid for by the state and shall appoint such agents as are necessary to see that veterans admitted to hospitals are receiving necessary food, clothing, care and treatment.\n\n(d) Such veterans who are able to pay in whole or in part for such program or services, as determined by the applicable fee schedule adopted pursuant to subsection (d) of section 27-102l, shall receive a monthly bill for such services rendered.\n\n(e) In the event that a bill of a veteran remains unpaid and past due, the chief fiscal officer, with the approval of the commissioner, shall require the veteran to assign his or her right to receive payment of income, from whatever source, to the commissioner until (1) such account is made current, and (2) the veteran demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commissioner a reasonable likelihood of more prudent financial management for the future.
