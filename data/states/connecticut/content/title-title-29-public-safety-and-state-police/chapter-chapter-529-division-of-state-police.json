If the commissioner determines the existence of such a reason, the commissioner shall (1) deny the sale and no pistol or revolver shall be sold, delivered or otherwise transferred by such person, firm or corporation to such applicant, and (2) inform the chief of police of the town in which the applicant resides, or, where there is no chief of police, the warden of the borough or the first selectman of the town, or the chief of police of a law enforcement unit of any federally recognized Native American tribe within the borders of the state as referenced in subsection (b) of section 29-28, if the applicant has a bona fide permanent residence within the jurisdiction of such tribe, as the case may be, that there exists a reason that would prohibit such applicant from possessing a pistol or revolver.\n\n(d) No person, firm or corporation shall sell, deliver or otherwise transfer any pistol or revolver, other than at wholesale, unless such pistol or revolver is equipped with a reusable trigger lock, gun lock or gun locking device appropriate for such pistol or revolver, which lock or device shall be constructed of material sufficiently strong to prevent it from being easily disabled and have a locking mechanism accessible by key or by electronic or other mechanical accessory specific to such lock or device to prevent unauthorized removal. No pistol or revolver shall be loaded or contain therein any gunpowder or other explosive or any bullet, ball or shell when such pistol or revolver is sold, delivered or otherwise transferred.\n\n(e) Upon the sale, delivery or other transfer of any pistol or revolver, the person making the purchase or to whom the same is delivered or transferred shall sign a receipt for such pistol or revolver, which shall contain the name and address of such person, the date of sale, the caliber, make, model and manufacturer's number and a general description of such pistol or revolver, the identification number of such person's permit to carry pistols or revolvers, issued pursuant to subsection (b) of section 29-28, permit to sell firearms at retail, issued pursuant to subsection (a) of said section, or eligibility certificate for a pistol or revolver, issued pursuant to section 29-36f, if any, and the authorization number designated for the transfer by the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection.

An antique pistol or revolver, for the purposes of this section, means any pistol or revolver which was manufactured in or before 1898 and any replica of such pistol or revolver provided such replica is not designed or redesigned for using rimfire or conventional centerfire fixed ammunition except rimfire or conventional centerfire fixed ammunition which is no longer manufactured in the United States and not readily available in the ordinary channel of commercial trade.\n\n(h) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the sale, delivery or transfer of pistols or revolvers between (1) a federally-licensed firearm manufacturer and a federally-licensed firearm dealer, (2) a federally-licensed firearm importer and a federally-licensed firearm dealer, (3) federally-licensed firearm dealers, or (4) federally-licensed firearm manufacturers.\n\n(i) If the court finds that a violation of this section is not of a serious nature and that the person charged with such violation (1) will probably not offend in the future, (2) has not previously been convicted of a violation of this section, and (3) has not previously had a prosecution under this section suspended pursuant to this subsection, the court may order suspension of prosecution. The court shall not order suspension of prosecution unless the accused person has acknowledged that he understands the consequences of the suspension of prosecution. Any person for whom prosecution is suspended shall agree to the tolling of any statute of limitations with respect to such violation and to a waiver of his right to a speedy trial. Such person shall appear in court and shall be released to the supervision of the Court Support Services Division for such period, not exceeding two years, and under such conditions as the court shall order. If the person refuses to accept, or, having accepted, violates such conditions, the court shall terminate the suspension of prosecution and the case shall be brought to trial. If such person satisfactorily completes his period of probation, he may apply for dismissal of the charges against him and the court, on finding such satisfactory completion, shall dismiss such charges. If the person does not apply for dismissal of the charges against him after satisfactorily completing his period of probation, the court, upon receipt of a report submitted by the Court Support Services Division that the person satisfactorily completed his period of probation, may on its own motion make a finding of such satisfactory completion and dismiss such charges. Upon dismissal, all records of such charges shall be erased pursuant to section 54-142a. An order of the court denying a motion to dismiss the charges against a person who has completed his period of probation or terminating the participation of a defendant in such program shall be a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\n\n(j) Any person who violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of a class C felony for which two years of the sentence imposed may not be suspended or reduced by the court, and five thousand dollars of the fine imposed may not be remitted or reduced by the court unless the court states on the record its reasons for remitting or reducing such fine, except that any person who sells, delivers or otherwise transfers a pistol or revolver in violation of the provisions of this section knowing that such pistol or revolver is stolen or that the manufacturer's number or other mark of identification on such pistol or revolver has been altered, removed or obliterated, shall be guilty of a class B felony for which three years of the sentence imposed may not be suspended or reduced by the court, and ten thousand dollars of the fine imposed may not be remitted or reduced by the court unless the court states on the record its reasons for remitting or reducing such fine, and any pistol or revolver found in the possession of any person in violation of any provision of this section shall be forfeited.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 4164; February, 1965, P.A. 36; P.A. 75-42; P.A. 77-614, S. 486, 610; P.A. 82-113; July Sp.

The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to the sale, delivery or transfer of such a rifle to any person who is a member or employee of an organized local police department, the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection or the Department of Correction or a member of the military or naval forces of this state or of the United States for use in the discharge of their duties.\n\n(c) No person may purchase or receive any long gun unless such person holds a valid long gun eligibility certificate issued pursuant to section 29-37p, a valid permit to carry a pistol or revolver issued pursuant to subsection (b) of section 29-28, a valid permit to sell firearms at retail issued pursuant to subsection (a) of section 29-28 or a valid eligibility certificate for a pistol or revolver issued pursuant to section 29-36f.\n\n(d) No person, firm or corporation may sell, deliver or otherwise transfer, at retail, any long gun to any person unless such person makes application on a form prescribed and furnished by the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection, which shall be attached by the transferor to the federal sale or transfer document and filed and retained by the transferor for at least twenty years or until such transferor goes out of business. Such application shall be available for inspection during normal business hours by law enforcement officials. No such sale, delivery or other transfer of any long gun shall be made until the person, firm or corporation making such sale, delivery or transfer has ensured that such application has been completed properly and has obtained an authorization number from the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection for such sale, delivery or transfer. The Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection shall make every effort, including performing the national instant criminal background check, to determine if the applicant is eligible to receive such long gun. If it is determined that the applicant is ineligible to receive such long gun, the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection shall immediately notify the (1) person, firm or corporation to whom such application was made and no such long gun shall be sold, delivered or otherwise transferred to such applicant by such person, firm or corporation, and (2) chief of police of the town in which the applicant resides, or, where there is no chief of police, the warden of the borough or the first selectman of the town, or the chief of police of a law enforcement unit of any federally recognized Native American tribe within the borders of the state as referenced in subsection (b) of section 29-28, if the applicant has a bona fide permanent residence within the jurisdiction of such tribe, as the case may be, that the applicant is not eligible to receive a long gun. When any long gun is delivered in connection with any sale or purchase, such long gun shall be enclosed in a package, the paper or wrapping of which shall be securely fastened, and no such long gun when delivered on any sale or purchase shall be loaded or contain any gunpowder or other explosive or any bullet, ball or shell. Upon the sale, delivery or other transfer of the long gun, the transferee shall sign in triplicate a receipt for such long gun, which shall contain the name, address and date and place of birth of such transferee, the date of such sale, delivery or transfer and the caliber, make, model and manufacturer's number and a general description thereof. Not later than twenty-four hours after such sale, delivery or transfer, the transferor shall send by first class mail or electronically transfer one receipt to the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection and one receipt to the chief of police of the municipality in which the transferee resides or, where there is no chief of police, the chief executive officer of the municipality, as defined in section 7-148, in which the transferee resides or, if designated by such chief executive officer, the resident state trooper serving such municipality or a state police officer of the state police troop having jurisdiction over such municipality, or the chief of police of a law enforcement unit of any federally recognized Native American tribe within the borders of the state as referenced in subsection (b) of section 29-28, if the transferee has a bona fide permanent residence within the jurisdiction of such tribe, and shall retain one receipt, together with the original application, for at least five years.\n\n(e) No sale, delivery or other transfer of any long gun shall be made by a person who is not a federally licensed firearm manufacturer, importer or dealer to a person who is not a federally licensed firearm manufacturer, importer or dealer unless:\n\n(1) The prospective transferor and prospective transferee comply with the provisions of subsection (d) of this section and the prospective transferor has obtained an authorization number from the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection for such sale, delivery or transfer; or\n\n(2) The prospective transferor or prospective transferee requests a federally licensed firearm dealer to contact the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection on behalf of such prospective transferor or prospective transferee and the federally licensed firearm dealer has obtained an authorization number from the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection for such sale, delivery or transfer.\n\n(f) (1) For purposes of a transfer pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (e) of this section, a prospective transferor or prospective transferee may request a federally licensed firearm dealer to contact the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection to obtain an authorization number for such sale, delivery or transfer. If a federally licensed firearm dealer consents to contact the department on behalf of the prospective transferor or prospective transferee, the prospective transferor or prospective transferee shall provide to such dealer the name, sex, race, date of birth and state of residence of the prospective transferee and, if necessary to verify the identity of the prospective transferee, may provide a unique numeric identifier including, but not limited to, a Social Security number, and additional identifiers including, but not limited to, height, weight, eye and hair color, and place of birth.

The Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection shall immediately notify the dealer of the department's determination and the dealer shall immediately notify the prospective transferor or prospective transferee of such determination. If the department determines the prospective transferee is ineligible to receive such long gun, no long gun shall be sold, delivered or otherwise transferred by the prospective transferor to the prospective transferee. If the department determines the prospective transferee is eligible to receive such long gun and provides an authorization number for such sale, delivery or transfer, the prospective transferor may proceed to sell, deliver or otherwise transfer the long gun to the prospective transferee.\n\n(3) Upon the sale, delivery or other transfer of the long gun, the transferor or transferee shall complete a form, prescribed by the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection, that contains the name and address of the transferor, the name and address of the transferee, the date and place of birth of such transferee, the firearm permit or certificate number of the transferee, the firearm permit or certificate number of the transferor, if any, the date of such sale, delivery or transfer, the caliber, make, model and manufacturer's number and a general description of such long gun and the authorization number provided by the department.

The court shall not order suspension of prosecution unless the accused person has acknowledged that he understands the consequences of the suspension of prosecution. Any person for whom prosecution is suspended shall agree to the tolling of any statute of limitations with respect to such violation and to a waiver of his right to a speedy trial. Such person shall appear in court and shall be released to the supervision of the Court Support Services Division for such period, not exceeding two years, and under such conditions as the court shall order. If the person refuses to accept, or, having accepted, violates such conditions, the court shall terminate the suspension of prosecution and the case shall be brought to trial. If such person satisfactorily completes his period of probation, he may apply for dismissal of the charges against him and the court, on finding such satisfactory completion, shall dismiss such charges. If the person does not apply for dismissal of the charges against him after satisfactorily completing his period of probation, the court, upon receipt of a report submitted by the Court Support Services Division that the person satisfactorily completed his period of probation, may on its own motion make a finding of such satisfactory completion and dismiss such charges. Upon dismissal, all records of such charges shall be erased pursuant to section 54-142a. An order of the court denying a motion to dismiss the charges against a person who has completed his period of probation or terminating the participation of a defendant in such program shall be a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\n\n(j) Any person who violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of a class D felony, except that any person who sells, delivers or otherwise transfers a long gun in violation of the provisions of this section, knowing that such long gun is stolen or that the manufacturer's number or other mark of identification on such long gun has been altered, removed or obliterated, shall be guilty of a class B felony, and any long gun found in the possession of any person in violation of any provision of this section shall be forfeited.\n\n(P.A. 90-340, S. 1; P.A. 99-212, S. 16; P.A. 00-99, S. 78, 154; P.A. 11-51, S. 134; P.A. 13-3, S. 1; 13-220, S. 12; P.A. 22-26, S. 6; 22-102, S. 7, 8; 22-115, S. 4; P.A. 23-53, S. 11; 23-130, S. 7, 8.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 99-212 inserted Subsec. indicators, amended Subsec.

Elements discussed. 47 CA 586. Statute does not require state to prove that defendant possessed the knife in the vehicle; it is sufficient for state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew the knife was in the vehicle. 63 CA 228. Is not a crime to have a hammer in a motor vehicle unless it is intended to be used as a dangerous instrument or for some other illicit purpose. 70 CA 855. State's search of state and city database for evidence of permit to carry pistol was insufficient to meet state's burden of establishing that defendant lacked a valid permit to lawfully carry a pistol on date of incident because state failed to establish that defendant was a resident of the city or had a place of business within the city during the 60-day period immediately preceding the alleged conduct. 156 CA 175; judgment reversed in part, see 324 C. 782.\n\nSeparate and distinct crime from the carrying of dangerous weapons on the person. 10 CS 272.

      "text": "(a) Except as provided pursuant to section 29-38q in the case of a complaint concerning a child under eighteen years of age, upon complaint on oath by any state's attorney or assistant state's attorney or by any police officer, to any judge of the Superior Court, that such state's attorney, assistant state's attorney or police officer has probable cause to believe that a person who is at least eighteen years of age poses a risk of imminent personal injury to such person's self or to another person, the judge may issue a risk protection order prohibiting such person from acquiring or possessing a firearm or other deadly weapon or ammunition. If such state's attorney, assistant state's attorney or police officer has a good faith belief that such person posing the risk is already prohibited from acquiring or possessing a firearm, or is already the subject of a risk protection order or pending risk protection order, the state's attorney, assistant state's attorney or police officer need not, but shall have the discretion to, pursue a risk protection order pursuant to this section. As part of or following the issuance of such order, if there is probable cause to believe that (1) such person possesses one or more firearms or other deadly weapons, and (2) such firearm or firearms or other deadly weapon or deadly weapons are within or upon any place, thing or person, such judge shall issue a warrant commanding a police officer to enter into or upon such place or thing, search the same or the person and take into such officer's custody any and all firearms and other deadly weapons and ammunition. No such warrant shall be issued if the applicant for the order is a police officer, unless the application is supported by more than one police officer, under oath on the complaint. Such state's attorney, assistant state's attorney or police officer or officers may not make any such complaint unless such state's attorney, assistant state's attorney or police officer or officers, as applicable, have conducted an independent investigation and determined that such probable cause exists. Upon the issuance of any such order and warrant, if applicable, the judge shall order the clerk of the court to give notice to the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection of the issuance of such order and warrant, as applicable.\n\n(b) (1) Any family or household member or medical professional who has a good faith belief that a person who is at least eighteen years of age poses a risk of imminent personal injury to such person's self or to another person may make an application for a risk protection order investigation with the clerk of the court for any geographical area. The application and accompanying affidavit shall be made under oath and indicate: (A) The factual basis for the applicant's belief that such person poses a risk of imminent personal injury to such person's self or to another person; (B) whether such person holds a permit under subsection (b) of section 29-28, or an eligibility certificate issued under section 29-36f, 29-37p or 29-38n or currently possesses one or more firearms or other deadly weapons or ammunition, if known; and (C) where any such firearm or other deadly weapon or ammunition is located, if known.\n\n(2) Upon receipt of an application and affidavit pursuant to this subsection, if the court finds that there is a good faith belief that a person who is the subject of the application poses a risk of imminent personal injury to such person's self or to another person, the court shall order a risk protection order investigation to determine if the person who is the subject of the application poses a risk of imminent personal injury to such person's self or to another person. Upon issuance by the court of an order for investigation, the court shall: (A) Give notice to the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection of the issuance of the order for a risk protection order investigation; and (B) immediately give notice of the order and transmit the order and the application and affidavit on which the order is based to the law enforcement agency for the town in which the subject of the investigation resides. The court shall immediately enter into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) a record indicating that the person who is the subject of the investigation is ineligible to possess, purchase or otherwise receive a firearm.\n\n(3) Upon receipt of an investigation order, the law enforcement agency shall immediately investigate whether the subject of the investigation poses a risk of imminent personal injury to such person's self or to another person. If the law enforcement agency determines that there is probable cause to believe that the subject of the investigation poses a risk of imminent personal injury to such person's self or to another person, such law enforcement agency shall seek a risk protection order, and when applicable, a warrant pursuant to subsection (a) of this section not later than twenty-four hours after receiving the investigation order, or, if the law enforcement agency needs additional time to complete the investigation, as soon thereafter as is practicable. If the law enforcement agency determines that there is no probable cause to believe that the subject of the investigation poses a risk of imminent personal injury to such person's self or to another person, the law enforcement agency shall notify the court, the applicant, and the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection of such determination, in writing, not later than forty-eight hours after receiving the investigation order, if practicable, or, if the law enforcement agency needs additional time to complete the risk warrant investigation, as soon thereafter as is practicable. Upon receiving such notification that there was not a finding of probable cause, the court shall immediately remove or cancel any record entered into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System associated with such investigation for which there was no finding of probable cause.\n\n(c) A risk protection order issued under subsection (a) of this section, may issue only on an affidavit sworn to by the complainant establishing the grounds for issuing the order. A risk warrant issued under subsection (a) of this section may issue only on an affidavit sworn to by the complainant before the judge establishing the grounds for issuing the warrant. Any such affidavit shall be part of the court file. In determining whether there is probable cause for a risk protection order and warrant, if applicable, under subsection (a) of this section, the judge shall consider: (1) Recent threats or acts of violence by such person directed toward other persons; (2) recent threats or acts of violence by such person directed toward such person's self; and (3) recent acts of cruelty to animals as provided in subsection (b) of section 53-247 by such person. In evaluating whether such recent threats or acts of violence constitute probable cause to believe that such person poses a risk of imminent personal injury to such person's self or to others, the judge may consider other factors including, but not limited to (A) the reckless use, display or brandishing of a firearm or other deadly weapon by such person, (B) a history of the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force by such person against other persons, (C) prior involuntary confinement of such person in a hospital for persons with psychiatric disabilities, and (D) the illegal use of controlled substances or abuse of alcohol by such person. In the case of a complaint made under subsection (a) of this section, if the judge is satisfied that the grounds for the complaint exist or that there is probable cause to believe that such grounds exist, such judge shall issue a risk protection order and warrant, if applicable, naming or describing the person, and, in the case of the issuance of a warrant, the place or thing to be searched. The order and warrant, if applicable, shall be directed to any police officer of a regularly organized police department or any state police officer. The order and warrant, if applicable, shall state the grounds or probable cause for issuance and, in the case of a warrant, the warrant shall command the officer to search within a reasonable time the person, place or thing named for any and all firearms and other deadly weapons and ammunition. A copy of the order and warrant, if applicable, shall be served upon the person named in the order not later than three days prior to the hearing scheduled pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, together with a notice informing the person that such person has the right to a hearing under this section, the telephone number for the court clerk who can inform the person of the date and time of such hearing and the right to be represented by counsel at such hearing.\n\n(d) (1) In the case of a warrant, the municipal or state police agency that executed the warrant shall file a copy of the application for the warrant and all affidavits upon which the warrant is based with the clerk of the court for the geographical area within which the search was conducted and with the state's attorney's office for such judicial district no later than the next business day following the execution of the warrant. Prior to the execution and return of the warrant, the clerk of the court shall not disclose any information pertaining to the application for the warrant or any affidavits upon which the warrant is based. The warrant shall be executed and returned with reasonable promptness consistent with due process of law and shall be accompanied by a written inventory of all firearms and other deadly weapons and ammunition seized.\n\n(2) In the case of a risk protection order, not later than the next business day following the service of the order, the municipal or state police agency that served the order shall file with the court of the geographical area in the location in which the subject of the order resides a copy of the order and transmit to the state's attorney's office for such judicial district a return of service stating the date and time that the order was served. Prior to the service and return of the order, the clerk of court shall not disclose any information pertaining to the application for the order or any affidavits upon which the order is based to any person outside the Judicial Branch, the municipal or state police agency that served the order, or the state's attorney's office for the judicial district within which the order was served. The order shall be served and returned with reasonable promptness consistent with due process of law.\n\n(e) Not later than fourteen days after the issuance of a risk protection order and, if applicable, a warrant under this section, the court for the geographical area where the person named in the order or warrant resides shall hold a hearing to determine whether the risk protection order should continue to apply and whether the firearm or firearms or other deadly weapon or deadly weapons and any ammunition seized should be returned to the person named in the warrant or should continue to be held by the state. At such hearing the state shall have the burden of proving all material facts by clear and convincing evidence. If, after such hearing, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person poses a risk of imminent personal injury to such person's self or to another person, the court may order that the risk protection order continue to apply and that the firearm or firearms or other deadly weapon or deadly weapons and any ammunition seized pursuant to the warrant issued under subsection (a) of this section continue to be held by the state until such time that the court shall terminate such order pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and order the firearm or firearms or other deadly weapon or deadly weapons and any ammunition seized to be returned as soon as practicable to the person named in the warrant, provided such person is otherwise legally able to possess such firearm or firearms or other deadly weapon or deadly weapons and ammunition. If the court finds that the state has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the petitioner poses a risk of imminent personal injury to such person's self or to another person, the court shall terminate such order and warrant, if applicable, and order the firearm or firearms or other deadly weapon or deadly weapons and any ammunition seized to be returned as soon as is practicable to the person named in the warrant, provided such person is otherwise legally eligible to possess such firearm or firearms or other deadly weapon or deadly weapons and ammunition. If the court finds that the person poses a risk of imminent personal injury to such person's self or to another person, the court shall give notice to the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services which may take such action pursuant to chapter 319i as the department deems appropriate.\n\n(f) A risk protection order, and warrant, if applicable, shall continue to apply and the firearm or firearms or other deadly weapon or deadly weapons and any ammunition held pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall continue to be held by the state until such time that the person named in the order and warrant, if applicable, successfully petitions the court to terminate such order and warrant, if applicable. The person named in the order may first petition the court of the geographical area where the proceeding was originally conducted for a hearing to terminate such order, and warrant if applicable, at least one hundred eighty days after the hearing held pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall (1) provide to the petitioner a hearing date that is on the twenty-eighth day following the filing of such petition or the business day nearest to such day if such twenty-eighth day is not a business day, (2) notify the Division of Criminal Justice of the filing of such petition, and (3) direct the law enforcement agency for the town in which the petitioner resides to determine, not later than fourteen days after the filing of such petition, whether there is probable cause to believe that the petitioner poses a risk of imminent personal injury to such person's self or to another person. No finding of probable cause may be found solely because the petitioner is subject to an existing risk protection order or warrant. If the law enforcement agency finds no probable cause, the agency shall so notify the court which shall cancel the hearing and terminate the order and warrant, if applicable. If the law enforcement agency finds probable cause, the agency shall notify the court of such finding and the hearing shall proceed as scheduled. At such hearing the state shall have the burden of proving all material facts by clear and convincing evidence. If the court, following such hearing, finds by clear and convincing evidence that the petitioner poses a risk of imminent personal injury to such person's self or to another person, the order and warrant, if applicable, shall remain in effect. If the court finds that the state has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the petitioner poses a risk of imminent personal injury to such person's self or to another person, the court shall terminate such order and warrant, if applicable. Any person whose petition is denied may file a subsequent petition in accordance with the provisions of this subsection at least one hundred eighty days after the date on which the court denied the previous petition.\n\n(g) The court shall immediately upon termination of a risk protection order pursuant to this section remove or cancel any record entered into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System associated with such order.\n\n(h) Any person whose firearm or firearms and ammunition have been ordered seized pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, or such person's legal representative, may transfer such firearm or firearms and ammunition in accordance with the provisions of section 29-33 or other applicable state or federal law, to a federally licensed firearm dealer. Upon notification in writing by such person, or such person's legal representative, and the dealer, the head of the state agency holding such seized firearm or firearms and ammunition shall within ten days deliver such firearm or firearms and ammunition to the dealer.\n\n(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 29-36k, the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection holding any firearm or firearms or other deadly weapon or deadly weapons and any ammunition seized pursuant to a warrant issued under this section, or any local police department holding on behalf of said commissioner any such firearm or firearms or other deadly weapon or deadly weapons or ammunition, shall not destroy any such firearm or other deadly weapon or ammunition until at least one year has passed since date of the termination of a warrant under subsection (e) of this section.\n\n(j) For purposes of this section, (1) “ammunition” means a loaded cartridge, consisting of a primed case, propellant or projectile, designed for use in any firearm, (2) “family or household member” means (A) a person eighteen years of age or older who is a: (i) Spouse, (ii) parent, (iii) child, (iv) sibling, (v) grandparent, (vi) grandchild, (vii) step-parent, (viii) step-child, (ix) step-sibling, (x) mother or father-in-law, (xi) son or daughter-in-law, or (xii) brother or sister-in-law of the person who is the subject of an application pursuant to subsection (b) of this section; (B) a person residing with the person who is the subject of the application; (C) a person who has a child in common with the person who is the subject of the application; (D) a person who is dating or an intimate partner of the person who is the subject of the application; or (E) a person who is the legal guardian or former legal guardian of the person who is the subject of the application, (3) “medical professional” means any person who has examined the person who is the subject of the application and who is (A) a physician or physician assistant licensed under chapter 370, (B) an advanced practice registered nurse licensed under chapter 378, (C) a psychologist licensed under chapter 383, or (D) a clinical social worker licensed under chapter 383b, and (4) “deadly weapon” has the same meaning as provided in section 53a-3.\n\n(P.A. 99-212, S. 18; P.A. 13-3, S. 33; P.A. 21-67, S. 1; P.A. 23-89, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 13-3 made provisions re seizure and transfer of firearms applicable to ammunition, added Subsec.

Such assistant state's attorney or police officers shall not make such complaint unless such assistant state's attorney or police officers have conducted an independent investigation and determined that such probable cause exists and that there is no reasonable alternative available to prevent such child from causing imminent personal injury to others with such firearm or firearms or deadly weapon or deadly weapons.\n\n(b) (1) Any family or household member or medical professional who has a good faith belief that a child poses a risk of imminent personal injury to another person and such child possesses one or more firearms or other deadly weapon or deadly weapons and such firearm or firearms or other deadly weapon or deadly weapons are within or upon any place, thing or person, may make an application for a risk warrant with any clerk of the court for juvenile matters. The application and accompanying affidavit shall be made under oath and indicate: (A) The factual basis for the applicant's belief that such child poses a risk of imminent personal injury to another person; (B) the factual basis for the applicant's belief that such child possesses one or more firearms or deadly weapons; and (C) where any such firearm or other deadly weapon or ammunition is located, if known.\n\n(2) Upon receipt of an application and affidavit pursuant to this subsection, if the court finds that there is a good faith belief that a child poses a risk of imminent personal injury to another person and possesses one or more firearms or deadly weapons, the court shall order a risk warrant investigation to determine if the child who is the subject of the application poses a risk of imminent personal injury to another person and that the child possesses one or more firearms or deadly weapons. Upon issuance by the court of an order for a risk warrant investigation, the court shall immediately give notice of the order and transmit the order and the application and affidavit on which the order is based to the law enforcement agency for the town in which the child who is the subject of the investigation resides.\n\n(3) Upon receipt of a risk warrant investigation order of a child, the law enforcement agency shall immediately investigate whether the child who is the subject of the investigation poses a risk of imminent personal injury to another person and whether the child possesses one or more firearms or deadly weapons. If the law enforcement agency determines that there is probable cause to believe that the child who is the subject of the investigation poses a risk of imminent personal injury to another person and the child possesses one or more firearms or deadly weapons, such law enforcement agency shall seek a risk warrant pursuant to subsection (a) of this section not later than twenty-four hours after receiving the risk warrant investigation order or, if the law enforcement agency needs additional time to complete the investigation, as soon thereafter as is practicable. If the law enforcement agency determines that there is no probable cause to believe that the child who is the subject of the investigation poses a risk of imminent personal injury to another person and that the child who is the subject of the investigation possesses one or more firearms or deadly weapons, the law enforcement agency shall notify the court and the applicant of such determination, in writing, not later than forty-eight hours after receiving the investigation order, if practicable, or, if the law enforcement agency needs additional time to complete the risk warrant investigation, as soon thereafter as is practicable.\n\n(c) A risk warrant may issue only on an affidavit sworn to by the complainant before the judge and establishing the grounds for issuing the warrant, which shall be part of the juvenile court file. The file shall be considered a record of a juvenile matter and shall have the same confidentiality protections applicable to juvenile matters involving delinquency pursuant to subsections (c) and (d) of section 46b-124. In determining whether there is probable cause for a risk warrant, the judge shall consider: (1) Recent threats or acts of violence by such child directed toward other persons; and (2) recent acts of cruelty to animals as provided in subsection (b) of section 53-247, by such child. In evaluating whether such recent threats or acts of violence constitute probable cause to believe that such child poses a risk of imminent personal injury to others, the judge may consider other factors, including, but not limited to, (A) the reckless use, display or brandishing of a firearm or other deadly weapon by such child, (B) a history of the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force by such child against other persons, (C) prior involuntary confinement of such child in a hospital for persons with psychiatric disabilities, and (D) the illegal use of controlled substances or abuse of alcohol by such child. If the judge is satisfied that the grounds for the complaint exist or that there is probable cause to believe that such grounds exist, the judge shall issue a risk warrant naming or describing the child, and the place or thing to be searched. The warrant shall be directed to any police officer of a regularly organized police department or any state police officer. The warrant shall state the grounds or probable cause for issuance and shall command the officer to search within a reasonable time the child, place or thing named for any and all firearms and other deadly weapons and ammunition. A copy of the warrant shall be served upon the child and the child's parent or guardian named in the warrant not later than three days before the hearing scheduled pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, together with a notice informing the child and the child's parent or guardian that such child has the right to a hearing and the right to be represented by counsel at the hearing. If the child and the child's parent or guardian are unable to afford counsel, counsel shall be appointed on behalf of the child if determined indigent and eligible in accordance with the provisions of chapter 887 for the purposes of proceedings pursuant to this section in the juvenile court.\n\n(d) The municipal or state police agency that executed the warrant shall file a copy of the application for the warrant and all affidavits upon which the warrant is based with the clerk of the juvenile court serving the town where the child resides and with the assistant state's attorney's office for such juvenile court not later than the next business day following the execution of the warrant. The clerk of the juvenile court shall not disclose any information pertaining to the application for the warrant or any affidavits upon which the warrant is based. The warrant shall be executed and returned with reasonable promptness consistent with due process of law and shall be accompanied by a written inventory of all firearms and other deadly weapons and ammunition seized.\n\n(e) Not later than fourteen days after the issuance of a warrant under this section, the juvenile court serving the town where the child named in the risk warrant resides shall hold a hearing to determine whether the firearm or firearms or other deadly weapon or deadly weapons and ammunition should be returned to the rightful owner of any such firearm, deadly weapon or ammunition, or, if the state should continue to hold any such firearm, deadly weapon or ammunition. The judge hearing the matter may exclude from the room in which such hearing is held any person whose presence, in the court's opinion, is not necessary pursuant to subsection (b) of section 46b-122. At such hearing, the state shall have the burden of proving all material facts by clear and convincing evidence. If, after such hearing, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the child poses a risk of imminent personal injury to another person, the court may order that the firearm or firearms or other deadly weapon or deadly weapons and any ammunition seized pursuant to the warrant issued under subsection (a) of this section continue to be held by the state until further order of the court.\n\n(f) If the court finds that the state has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the child poses a risk of imminent personal injury to another person and that the child possesses one or more firearms or deadly weapons, the court shall order the firearm or firearms or other deadly weapon or deadly weapons and any ammunition seized to be returned as soon as is practicable to the rightful owner of any such firearm, deadly weapon or ammunition, provided such owner is otherwise legally eligible to possess such items.\n\n(g) For the purposes of this section, “ammunition”, “family or household member” and “medical professional” have the same meanings as provided in subsection (j) of section 29-38c and “deadly weapon” has the same meaning as provided in section 53a-3.\n\n(P.A. 23-89, S. 2.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 23-89 effective June 29, 2023.",
