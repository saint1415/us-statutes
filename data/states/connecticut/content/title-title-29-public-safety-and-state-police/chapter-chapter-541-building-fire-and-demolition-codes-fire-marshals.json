Forty replicate tests shall comprise a complete test trial for each cigarette tested;\n\n(4) The performance standard required by this section shall only be applied to a complete test trial;\n\n(5) Written certifications shall be based upon testing conducted by a laboratory that has been accredited pursuant to standard ISO or IEC 17025 of the International Organization for Standardization or such other comparable accreditation standard as the Office of the State Fire Marshal may require by regulation;\n\n(6) Laboratories conducting testing in accordance with this section shall implement a quality control and quality assurance program that includes a procedure that will determine the repeatability of the testing results. The repeatability value shall be no greater than 0.19. Such program ensures that the testing repeatability remains within the required repeatability value set forth in this subdivision for all test trials used to certify cigarettes in accordance with this section and section 29-419; and\n\n(7) No additional testing under this section is required if cigarettes are tested consistent with this section for any other purpose.\n\n(b) Each cigarette that uses lowered permeability bands in the cigarette paper to achieve compliance with the performance standard set forth in this section shall have not less than two nominally identical bands on the paper surrounding the tobacco column. At least one complete band shall be located not less than fifteen millimeters from the lighting end of the cigarette. For cigarettes on which the bands are positioned by design, there shall be not less than two bands fully located at least fifteen millimeters from the lighting end and ten millimeters from the filter end of the tobacco column, or ten millimeters from the labeled end of the tobacco column for nonfiltered cigarettes.\n\n(c) A holder of a cigarette manufacturer's license that manufactures a cigarette that the State Fire Marshal determines cannot be tested in accordance with the test method prescribed in subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of this section may propose an alternate test method and performance standard for the cigarette to the State Fire Marshal. Upon approval and a determination by the State Fire Marshal that the performance standard proposed by the holder is equivalent to the performance standard prescribed in subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section, the holder may employ such test method and performance standard to certify such cigarette pursuant to section 29-419. If the State Fire Marshal determines that another state has enacted reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards that include a test method and performance standard that are the same as those contained in this section, and the State Fire Marshal finds that the officials responsible for implementing those requirements have approved the proposed alternative test method and performance standard for a particular cigarette proposed by a holder as meeting the reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards of that state's law or regulations under a legal provision comparable to this section, then the State Fire Marshal shall authorize that holder to employ the alternative test method and performance standard to certify that cigarette for sale in this state, unless the State Fire Marshal has a reasonable basis for deciding that the alternative test should not be accepted under said sections.
