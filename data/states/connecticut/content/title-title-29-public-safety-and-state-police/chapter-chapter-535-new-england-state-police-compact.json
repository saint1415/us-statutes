The files, records, data and other information of the Bureau and, when made pursuant to the bylaws of the Conference, any copies thereof shall be available only to duly designated officers and employees of the state police departments of the party states acting within the scope of their official duty. In the possession of the aforesaid officers and employees, such records, data, and other information shall be subject to use and disposition in the same manner and pursuant to the same laws, rules and regulations applicable to similar records, data, and information of the officer's or employee's agency and the provision of this compact.\n\nAdditional Meetings and Services\n\nThe members of the Conference from any two or more party states, upon notice to the chairman as to the time and purpose of the meeting, may meet as a section for the discussion of problems common to their states. Any two or more party states may designate the Conference as a joint agency to maintain for them such additional common services as they may deem desirable for combatting organized crime.\n\nExcept in those cases where all party states join in such designation for common services, the representative of any group of such designating states in the Conference shall constitute a separate section of such Conference for the performance of the common service or services so designated provided that, if any additional expense is involved, the state so acting shall provide the necessary funds for this purpose. The creation of such a section or joint agency shall not affect the privileges, powers, responsibilities or duties of the states participating herein as embodied in the other articles of this compact.\n\nArticle VII\n\n(a) As used in this Article:\n\n1. “Emergency” means an occurrence or condition, temporary in nature, in which the state police department of a party state is, or may reasonably be expected to be, unable to cope with substantial and imminent danger to the public safety, and in which the cooperation of or aid from local police forces within the state is, or may reasonably be expected to be insufficient. Also “emergency” shall mean a situation in which an investigation of an aspect of organized crime, or events connected with organized crime require augmentation, for a limited time, of the investigative personnel of the state police department from without the state.\n\n2. “Requesting state” means the state whose state police department requests assistance in coping with an emergency.\n\n3. “Responding state” means the state furnishing aid, or requested to furnish aid, pursuant to this Article.\n\n(b) In case of emergency, upon the request of the administrative head of the state police department of a party state, the administrative head of the state police department of each responding state shall order such part of his state police forces as he, in his discretion, may find necessary, to aid the state police forces of the requesting state in order to carry out the purposes set forth in this compact. In such case, it shall be the duty of the administrative head of the state police department of each responding state to issue the necessary orders for such use of state police forces of his state without the borders of his state, and to direct such forces to place themselves under the operational control of the administrative head of the state police department of the requesting state.\n\n(c) The administrative head of the state police department of any party state, in his discretion, may withhold or recall the police forces of his state or any part or any member thereof, serving without its borders.\n\n(d) Whenever any of the state police forces of any party state are engaged outside their own state in carrying out the purposes of this compact, the individual members so engaged shall have the same powers, duties, rights, privileges and immunities as members of the state police department of the state in which they are engaged, but in any event, a requesting state shall save harmless any member of a responding state police department serving within its borders for any act or acts done by him in the performance of his duty while engaged in carrying out the purposes of this compact.\n\n(e) All liability that may arise under the laws of the requesting state or under the laws of the responding state or under the laws of a third state on account of or in connection with a request for aid, shall be assumed and borne by the requesting state.\n\n(f) Any responding state rendering aid pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the requesting state for any loss or damage to, or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment answering a request for aid, and for the cost of the materials, transportation and maintenance of state police personnel and equipment incurred in connection with such request: Provided, that nothing herein contained shall prevent any responding state from assuming such loss, damage, expense or other cost.\n\n(g) Each party state shall provide, in the same amounts and manner as if they were on duty within their state, for the pay and allowances of the personnel of its state police department while engaged without the state pursuant to this compact and while going to and returning from such duty pursuant to this compact.\n\n(h) Each party state providing for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members and the representatives of deceased members of its state police department in case such members sustain injuries or are killed within their own state, shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits in the same manner and on the same terms in case such members sustain injury or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact.\n\nArticle VIII\n\n(a) The Conference shall submit to the Governor or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget of its estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that party state for presentation to the legislature thereof.\n\n(b) Each of the Conference's budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states. The total amount of appropriations under any such budget shall be apportioned among the party states as follows: One-third in equal shares; one-third divided among the party states in the proportions that their populations bear to the total population of all the party states; and one-third divided among the party states in the proportions that the major crimes committed in each party state bear to the total number of major crimes committed in all the party states. In determining population pursuant to this paragraph, the most recent decennial census compiled by the United States Government shall be used. Numbers of major crimes shall be as reported in the most recent annual “Uniform Crime Report” compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States Department of Justice, or by any agency which may assume responsibility for such compilation in the place of such Bureau. In the event that any source of information required to be used for the purpose of this paragraph shall be discontinued, the Conference shall make its calculations on the basis of the best alternative sources of information and shall identify the sources used.\n\n(c) The Conference shall not pledge the credit of any party state. The Conference may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under Article III (j) of this compact, provided that the Conference takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to incurring any obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the Conference makes use of funds available to it under Article III (j) hereof, the Conference shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party states adequate to meet the same.\n\n(d) The Conference shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Conference shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its rules. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Conference shall be audited yearly by a qualified, public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Conference.\n\n(e) The accounts of the Conference shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly constituted officers of the party states and any persons authorized by the Conference.\n\n(f) Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent Conference compliance with laws relating to audit or inspection of accounts by or on behalf of any government contributing to the support of the Conference.\n\nConstruction and Severability\n\nThis compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating herein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\n\n(1967, P.A. 315, S. 1.)",
