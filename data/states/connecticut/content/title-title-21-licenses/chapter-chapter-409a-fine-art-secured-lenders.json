For purposes of this section and sections 21-47p and 21-47r, “licensing authority” means the chief of police of any town or city or, if such town or city does not have an organized local police department, the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection.\n\n(b) The person so licensed shall pay, for the benefit of any such city or town, respectively, or if the licensing authority of such city or town is the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection, for the benefit of the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, to the licensing authority a license fee of fifty dollars and twenty-five dollars per year thereafter for renewal of such license, and shall, at the time of receiving such license, file, with the licensing authority of such city or town, a bond to such city or town, with competent surety, in the penal sum of two thousand dollars, to be approved by such licensing authority and conditioned for the faithful performance of the duties and obligations pertaining to the business so licensed, unless such person is also licensed as a secondhand dealer in accordance with section 21-47d, in which case the licensing authority shall waive the payment of renewal fees and filing of a bond required by this subsection.\n\n(c) Each such license shall designate the place where such business is to be carried on and shall be in effect for one year unless sooner suspended or revoked. Such license shall be displayed in a conspicuous location in the place where such business is carried on. At the time of application for such license and each renewal thereof, the applicant shall disclose to the licensing authority all places used or intended to be used by the business for the purchase, receipt, storage or sale of fine art. During the term of such license, the licensee shall notify the licensing authority of any additional places that will be used by the business for the purchase, receipt, storage or sale of fine art prior to such use.\n\n(d) An application for such license shall be made in writing, under oath.

A licensee seeking renewal of such license shall file an application for renewal at least sixty days before the expiration of such license and the licensing authority shall grant or deny such renewal not later than thirty days after the filing of such application for renewal. The licensing authority may suspend, revoke or modify any license issued under this section at any time during the period of the license for good cause shown, upon notice to the licensee and following a hearing. The licensing authority shall hold any such hearing not later than thirty days after the date of issuance of such notice and shall issue a decision not more than fourteen days after any hearing. Any person aggrieved by any action of the licensing authority in denying, suspending, revoking, modifying or refusing to renew a license issued pursuant to this section may appeal from such action to the Superior Court.\n\n(P.A. 12-131, S. 2.)",
