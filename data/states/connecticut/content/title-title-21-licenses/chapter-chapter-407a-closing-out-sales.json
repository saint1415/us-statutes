Such authority may authorize the issue of such license without the filing of such statement, upon the payment of a license fee fixed by it. Upon payment of such fee, such town clerk shall issue such license, which shall remain in force as long as the licensee continuously keeps and exposes for sale in such municipality such stock of goods, wares or merchandise, but not later than the first day of October following its date.
