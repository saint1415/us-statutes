      "text": "(a) The Commissioner of Consumer Protection shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, providing for a disclosure statement which shall be used by mobile manufactured home park owners. The disclosure statement shall be a plain language summary of the rights and obligations listed in this chapter and shall not add to or diminish the rights and obligations provided by this chapter. Such disclosure statement shall include at least the following information: (1) The monthly rental fee and all considerations payable by the resident to the owner; (2) the length of the rental term; (3) the amount of land granted by the rental agreement; (4) an enumeration of goods and services to be provided to the resident, including those goods and services to be provided free of charge; (5) notice if the owner plans to terminate the operation of the park during the term of the rental agreement; (6) a statement of conditions to be complied with by the owner and resident in the event of the sale of the mobile manufactured home by the resident, including aesthetic standards for resale, which conditions shall not be altered by the owner after the rental agreement has been entered into; (7) the rights of residents regarding eviction under section 21-80; (8) the rights of residents regarding the resale of a mobile manufactured home under section 21-79; (9) the rights of residents in the event that alterations of the rules concerning the resident's use and occupancy of the premises under subsection (b) of this section are to be made; (10) notice that outstanding property taxes may be owed on the mobile manufactured home; and (11) notice that there may be liens and other encumbrances on the mobile manufactured home and that the resident or purchaser should check with the town clerk, tax assessor and tax collector to determine whether any taxes are due on the mobile manufactured home and within any liens or encumbrances on the mobile manufactured home exist. Owners shall provide each prospective resident, before any rental agreement is entered into, and each resident, at the time of the first renewal of his rental agreement which occurs after the effective date of the regulations providing for a disclosure statement, with a completed disclosure statement. No rental agreement entered into on or after the effective date of the regulations providing for a disclosure statement shall be enforceable until the requirements of this subsection are met. A copy of such statement shall be signed by the resident at the time of the rental, acknowledging receipt of a completed, signed copy and such completed, signed copy shall be kept on file by the owner for a period of four years after such resident vacates the park.\n\n(b) No owner may offer a mobile manufactured home or a mobile manufactured home space or lot for rent without providing the prospective resident with a copy of an initial written rental agreement before the resident occupies such mobile manufactured home or lot. No owner may rent a mobile manufactured home or mobile manufactured home space or lot to a new resident until a written rental agreement has been signed by the resident and the owner. The initial rental agreement and all renewals offered to a resident by the owner shall be in writing. The term of each rental agreement and renewal shall not be less than one year unless the resident requests, in writing, a term for less than one year. If the owner fails to offer the resident a written renewal of a rental agreement, or if the owner offers a renewal but the resident fails or refuses to sign it, unless there is a disagreement as to the amount of the rent, the prior rental agreement shall be deemed to be extended for one year at the then prevailing park rental and the resident shall be bound by all terms of the prior rental agreement and any prevailing park rental adopted after the prior rental and all rules and regulations properly applicable to such prior rental agreement pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. If there is a disagreement as to the amount of the rent, unless the owner terminates the lease and brings an action of summary process, the prior rental agreement shall be deemed to be extended on a month-to-month basis at the last agreed-upon rent, and the resident shall be bound by all terms of the prior rental agreement and all rules and regulations properly applicable to such prior rental agreement pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. In such an event, the owner may bring an action of summary process pursuant to section 21-80, or the resident may seek relief under section 47a-23c or sections 7-148b to 7-148f, inclusive, if applicable.\n\n(c) Whenever a resident rents a mobile manufactured home or a mobile manufactured home space or lot in a mobile manufactured home park which is also a common interest community from a declarant, successor declarant or person acting on the declarant's or successor declarant's behalf, such declarant, successor declarant or person shall, prior to entering into a rental agreement, provide the resident with a written notice that the mobile manufactured home or the mobile manufactured home space or lot is located in a common interest community.\n\n(d) An owner, from time to time, may adopt a rule or regulation, however described, concerning the resident's use and occupancy of the premises. Such rule or regulation shall be enforceable against the resident only if (1) the purpose of the rule or regulation is to promote the convenience, safety or welfare of the residents, preserve the owner's property from abusive use or make a fair distribution of services and facilities held out for the residents generally; (2) such rule or regulation is reasonably related to the purpose for which it is adopted; (3) such rule or regulation applies to all residents on the premises in a fair manner, provided reasonable exemptions may be made for good cause; (4) such rule or regulation is sufficiently explicit in its prohibition, direction or limitation of the resident's conduct to fairly inform him of what he shall or shall not do to comply, and (5) the resident has written notice of such rule or regulation at the time he enters into the rental agreement or when such rule or regulation is adopted. A rule or regulation having the effect of substantially modifying the terms of a rental agreement previously entered into by a resident shall not apply to such rental agreement without the written consent of the resident.\n\n(e) Each owner shall file with the Department of Consumer Protection copies of the park's rental agreements, aesthetic standards to be complied with by the owner and resident in the event of the sale of the mobile manufactured home by the resident, and rules or regulations concerning the resident's use and occupancy of the premises. Any change in the documents required to be filed under this subsection, other than a change in rent, shall be filed with the Department of Consumer Protection. No rental agreements, aesthetic standards, or rules or regulations, and no changes in the terms or provisions of such documents, other than a change in rent, shall be effective until such documents or changes are filed with the Department of Consumer Protection.\n\n(f) (1) Any person making an application to appear before any municipal, state or federal agency with respect to any matter changing the land use of a specific mobile manufactured home park shall give written notice of the application by first class mail addressed to the affected units of the park or by personal delivery to the units not later than seven days after its filing. The notice shall state the reasons for which the application was filed.\n\n(2) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (5) of this subsection, any mobile manufactured home park owner who intends to discontinue the use of the land as a mobile manufactured home park or to sell land used as a mobile manufactured home park to any person who intends to discontinue its use as a mobile manufactured home park shall give written notice by first class mail addressed to each mobile manufactured home unit or by personal delivery to each unit upon such land if such transaction will entail the discontinuance of the use of the land for mobile manufactured home park purposes. If an owner of a mobile manufactured home has given the park owner written notice that the owner resides in a place other than the owner's unit, notice shall be sent by first class mail to the address so provided. The notice shall include a statement advising the recipient of the intended discontinuance of use or sale and, except as otherwise provided in subdivision (5) of this subsection, shall be mailed or delivered at least one hundred twenty days prior to the discontinuance of the use of the land as a mobile manufactured home park. The notice may run concurrently with the notice required by subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of section 21-80 or subparagraph (E) of subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of section 21-80. A copy of such notice from the park owner shall be sent to any association of residents of the mobile manufactured home park which has made a written request for such notice.\n\n(3) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (5) of this subsection, within one hundred twenty days after the notice provided for in subdivision (2) of this subsection has been mailed, any association representing twenty-five per cent or more of the units in the park, including an association formed after the issuance of the notice, may notify the owner of the park that it is interested in purchasing the mobile manufactured home park. A copy of such notice may be filed on the land records of the town in which the mobile manufactured home park is located. If such notice is given, except as otherwise provided in subdivision (5) of this subsection, the association shall have three hundred sixty-five days after the notice required in subdivision (2) of this subsection has been given to purchase the park through negotiation or the method set forth in subdivision (4) of this subsection. Upon the request of the association, the Department of Housing shall assist the association in developing financing for the purchase of the park.\n\n(4) If the association and the park owner cannot agree upon a purchase price, the association shall have the right to purchase the property: (A) If the association matches the essential provisions of any existing bona fide offer to purchase the park made by another potential purchaser which offer by such other purchaser the owner is prepared to accept; or (B) if there is no such offer, at a purchase price to be established by an appraiser chosen by the association and the park owner. If the two parties cannot agree upon one appraiser, either party may notify the other, in writing, of such disagreement, and the association shall choose an appraiser, the park owner shall choose an appraiser, and the two appraisers shall choose a third appraiser, which three appraisers shall establish a value of the park. If the park owner refuses to select an appraiser within fifteen days of such notice, the Commissioner of Consumer Protection shall choose an appraiser for the park owner. The costs of all appraisers shall be paid equally by the association and the park owner. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (5) of this subsection, if, within three hundred sixty-five days from the mailing of the notice required in subdivision (2) of this subsection, no agreement for such sale signed by the association and the park owner has been filed upon the land records, or if the association has not filed a certified statement to purchase the park at the appraised value which value shall also be certified on the land records by the appraiser or appraisers, the right provided in this subsection to purchase the park shall be void and any recorded notice filed pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection shall be void.\n\n(5) In any case in which a mobile manufactured home park with two hundred or more units in which a majority of residents have been given written notice, prior to June 10, 1999, of the intended discontinuance of the use of the land as a mobile manufactured home park, regardless of whether one or more of such notices or the service of such notices is subsequently deemed invalid or ineffective, (A) any subsequent notice of such intended discontinuance that is given or required to be given after June 23, 1999, by the owner pursuant to this subsection, and (B) any notice given or action taken pursuant to this subsection after June 23, 1999, by any association representing twenty-five per cent or more of the units in the park shall be subject to the time limitations contained in this subsection that were in effect immediately prior to June 23, 1999.\n\n(1972, P.A. 186, S. 7; P.A. 73-57, S. 3; 73-94, S. 1, 2; P.A. 74-333, S. 10, 12; P.A. 76-143, S. 2, 4; P.A. 81-322, S. 2; P.A. 83-389, S. 2; 83-456, S. 1, 7; June Sp.

      "text": "(a) No owner or operator of a mobile manufactured home park shall require a resident who owns a mobile manufactured home which is safe, sanitary and in conformance with aesthetic standards to remove the home from the development at the time such mobile manufactured home is sold or a mortgage on such a home is foreclosed provided that the purchaser or foreclosing mortgagee shall assume and be bound by the rental agreement of the foreclosed mortgagor and shall be bound by the rules and regulations of the park.\n\n(b) A mobile manufactured home shall be presumed to be safe and sanitary if it is established that the mobile manufactured home was constructed in accordance with any nationally recognized building or construction code or standard. Failure to meet any such standard or the provisions of any such code shall not automatically raise a presumption that the mobile manufactured home is unsafe or unsanitary. Such failure shall not be used as a reason for withholding approval of an on-site sale unless such failure renders the mobile manufactured home unsafe or unsanitary.\n\n(c) The owner of a mobile manufactured home park shall bear the burden of showing that a mobile manufactured home is unsafe, unsanitary, or fails to meet the aesthetic standards of the development. No aesthetic standard concerning those physical characteristics such as size, original color or original building materials, which cannot be changed without undue financial hardship to the resident, shall be applied against a mobile manufactured home.\n\n(d) Any purchaser of a mobile manufactured home sold by a resident may become a resident of the mobile manufactured home park provided he meets the entry requirements for said park and such requirements are equally applied by the owner to all purchasers and prospective residents and the owner approves such entry. Such approval may not be withheld except for good cause. For the purposes of this section good cause means a reasonable cause for the owner to believe (1) that such purchaser intends to utilize the purchased mobile manufactured home for an illegal or immoral purpose or for any purpose that would disturb the quiet enjoyment of the other residents of the park or (2) that the purchaser is or will be financially unable to pay the rent for the space or lot upon which the purchased mobile manufactured home is located. If the owner denies approval to a purchaser, he shall, in writing, state any reason for such disapproval. Such statement shall be delivered to the resident and the purchaser or prospective resident within ten days after the owner receives the completed application of the purchaser or prospective resident. Failure to deliver such notification within ten days shall be deemed to be approval.\n\n(e) Any resident wishing to sell his or her home shall request a written statement of the owner's intentions regarding the condition of the home. Within twenty days after receipt of such a request, the owner shall approve the home's condition for resale or deliver a written statement to the resident specifying the reasons why the home is not safe, sanitary, or in conformance with aesthetic standards. Failure of the owner to respond within twenty days shall be deemed to be an approval of the home's condition for resale. If the resident disputes the owner's response, he may seek a declaratory ruling from the Department of Consumer Protection. The resident may attempt to correct defects identified by the owner and may again request the owner's approval of the home's condition for resale. If the resident again disputes the owner's response, he may once again seek a declaratory ruling from the department. An owner's statement of approval shall remain in force for not more than six months. No owner shall exact a commission or fee with respect to the price realized by the seller, unless he has acted as agent for the seller in a sale pursuant to a written contract, or charge a rent for the mobile manufactured home space or lot upon which the purchased mobile manufactured home is located greater than the prevailing rent for any other space or lot located in the park.\n\n(P.A. 74-333, S. 4, 12; P.A. 76-143, S. 3, 4; P.A. 79-237; P.A. 81-322, S. 5; P.A. 83-389, S. 5; June Sp.

(b); P.A. 83-389 amended section to prohibit owner from requiring removal of mobile home on sale or foreclosure if home is safe, sanitary and in conformance with aesthetic standards and purchaser or foreclosing mortgagee assumes rental agreement and is bound by park rules and regulations, established presumption re safe and sanitary condition and limited types of aesthetic standards applied, replacing former Subsec. (a) with Subsecs. (a) to (c) and relettering former Subsecs. (b) and (c) accordingly, and added provisions to establish procedure for obtaining park owner's approval of sale; June Sp. Sess.

If such breach can be remedied by repair by the resident or payment of damages by the resident to the owner and such breach is not so remedied within twenty-one days, the rental agreement shall terminate except that (A) if the breach is remediable by repairs or the payment of damages and the resident adequately remedies the breach within said twenty-one-day period, the rental agreement shall not terminate, or (B) if substantially the same act or omission for which notice was given recurs within six months, the owner may terminate the rental agreement in accordance with the provisions of sections 47a-23 to 47a-23b, inclusive. For the purposes of this subdivision, “serious nuisance” means (i) inflicting bodily harm upon another resident or the owner or threatening to inflict such harm with the present ability to effect the harm and under circumstances which would lead a reasonable person to believe that such threat will be carried out, (ii) substantial and wilful destruction of part of the premises, (iii) conduct which presents an immediate and serious danger to the safety of other residents or the owner, or (iv) using the premises for prostitution or the illegal sale of drugs. If the owner elects to evict based upon an allegation, pursuant to subdivision (8) of subsection (b) of section 21-82, that the resident failed to require other persons on the premises with the resident's consent to conduct themselves in a manner that will not constitute a serious nuisance, and the resident claims to have had no knowledge of such conduct, then, if the owner establishes that the premises have been used for the illegal sale of drugs, the burden shall be on the resident to show that the resident had no knowledge of the creation of the serious nuisance.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 47a-23, termination of any tenancy in a mobile manufactured home park shall be effective only if made in the following manner:\n\n(A) By the resident giving at least thirty days' notice to the owner;\n\n(B) By the owner giving the resident at least sixty days' written notice, which shall state the reason or reasons for such termination, except that, when termination is based upon subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the owner need give the resident only thirty days' written notice, which notice shall state the total arrearage due provided, the owner shall not maintain or proceed with a summary process action against a resident who tenders the total arrearage due to the owner within such thirty days and who has not so tendered an arrearage under this subparagraph during the preceding twelve months.\n\n(4) Except as otherwise specified, proceedings under this section shall be as prescribed by chapter 832.\n\n(5) Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit an owner from increasing the rent at the termination of the rental agreement if (A) the owner delivers a written notice of the proposed rent increase to the resident at least thirty days before the start of a new rental agreement; (B) the proposed rent is consistent with rents for comparable lots in the same park; and (C) the rent is not increased in order to defeat the purpose of this subsection.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 47a-35 and 47a-36, if judgment is entered in a summary process action against a mobile manufactured home owner and resident based upon subparagraph (D) of subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of this section, execution shall not issue until six months from the date of such judgment. The court shall condition such stay of execution upon a requirement that the mobile manufactured home owner and resident make payments to the plaintiff in the summary process action in such installments as the court may direct for the use and occupancy of the premises during the period of such stay at the rate for which such mobile manufactured home owner and resident was most recently liable as rent or in such other sum as is reasonable.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 47a-35 and 47a-36, if judgment is entered in a summary process action against a resident who owns the mobile manufactured home, the resident may, prior to the expiration of the automatic stay of execution provided in section 47a-35 or 47a-36, as applicable, move for permission to exercise in good faith the resident's right to sell the mobile manufactured home in place in the mobile manufactured home park, subject to the provisions of section 21-79, and the court may stay execution upon such judgment pending sale of the home. Such stay may be ordered for a period or periods in an aggregate not to exceed twelve months from the date of the judgment in the summary process action, except that any such stay or stays extending beyond six months from the date of the judgment in the summary process action shall be reviewed every two months to determine that the resident is making a good faith effort to sell the home. The court shall condition such stay of execution upon a requirement that the resident make payments to the plaintiff in the summary process action in such installments as the court may direct for the use and occupancy of the premises during the period of such stay at the rate for which such resident was most recently liable as rent or in such other amount as is reasonable and may, in addition, impose other reasonable terms and conditions on the stay. If there is a rental arrearage at the time of the entry of the order, the court shall order that it be paid out of the proceeds of the sale, except that the court, upon finding that the resident has the present ability to pay the arrearage, may require that all or part of such arrearage be paid as a condition of the stay.\n\n(e) (1) If (A) a judgment for possession has been entered against the resident and all occupants of a mobile manufactured home pursuant to chapter 832 and this section; (B) no rent or other payment has been received for the use and occupancy of the lot upon which the mobile manufactured home is situated for at least four months; (C) at least sixty days have passed since the expiration of the last stay of execution pursuant to chapter 832 and this section; and (D) notwithstanding the provisions of section 47a-42, the mobile manufactured home remains upon the lot, the owner of the mobile manufactured home park may initiate a petition to the Superior Court pursuant to this section. Such petition may be brought as a supplemental proceeding in the summary process action, in which case no additional entry fee shall be required.\n\n(2) The petition shall allege the acts specified in subdivision (1) of this subsection and, in addition, shall allege supporting facts which demonstrate that the owner of the mobile manufactured home has failed or refused to make reasonable efforts to remove the home from the lot or to sell the home in place or that, in spite of reasonable efforts to locate the owner of the mobile manufactured home or such owner's representative, the owner of the mobile manufactured home park has been unable to locate such owner. Reasonable efforts to locate the owner of the mobile manufactured home shall include, but not be limited to, reasonable inquiry of relatives or associates of the owner of the home, if known to the owner of the park, and of other residents of the park.\n\n(3) A copy of the petition and the notice of the hearing on the petition shall be given to the owner of the mobile manufactured home, the municipality and all lienholders who have recorded a lien against the mobile manufactured home or of whom the owner of the mobile manufactured home park has actual knowledge. Notice to the municipality and to lienholders shall be by certified mail. Notice to the owner of the mobile manufactured home shall be designed to maximize the likelihood that the owner will receive actual notice of the petition, without regard to whether the owner appeared in the summary process action. Such notice to the owner of the mobile manufactured home shall be conspicuously posted at the entrance to the mobile manufactured home and also sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the owner of the mobile manufactured home and to the attorney, if any, who appeared for such owner in the summary process action. Notice to the owner of the mobile manufactured home shall be sent to such owner at the owner's last-known address and also to such owner in care of any other person reasonably believed to know the location of the owner. The court may require supplemental notice if it finds that additional notice is likely to result in actual notice to the owner of the mobile manufactured home.\n\n(4) At the hearing on the petition, the court shall determine whether all the requirements of subdivisions (1), (2) and (3) of this subsection have been satisfied and, if they have, shall also determine whether the home has been abandoned. If such requirements have been satisfied and such home has been abandoned, the court shall order the owner of the mobile manufactured home park to conduct a public sale of the home. Nothing in this section shall preclude the court from deferring the entry of an order requiring sale and from issuing other appropriate orders, if the court finds that, within a reasonable period of time, the owner of the mobile manufactured home will remove the home from the lot or dispose of the home by sale or will make other appropriate arrangements with the park owner. The order directing sale shall require notice which includes a conspicuous statement that the sale will extinguish all previous ownership and lien rights. Notice shall be given by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to all persons entitled to notice of the petition. Notice shall also be posted conspicuously at the entrance of the home and shall be advertised at least three times in the real estate section of a daily paper with general circulation in the area where the park is situated. Any person, including a lienholder or the owner of the mobile manufactured home park, may bid at the sale. The proceeds of such sale shall be applied first to the costs of the sale and then to the payment of lienholders in the order of the priority of their liens. If proceeds remain thereafter they shall be paid over to the owner of the mobile manufactured home. Upon conclusion of the sale, the park owner shall file an affidavit with the court setting forth the nature of its compliance with the court's order of sale. The court, upon finding compliance with its order, shall issue a conveyance of title and release of liens, if any, to the purchaser for filing in the land records, which shall constitute good title to the home, and no execution shall issue on the original summary process action.\n\n(P.A. 74-333, S. 5, 12; P.A. 77-614, S. 609, 610; P.A. 78-347, S. 1, 2; P.A. 81-322, S. 6; P.A. 82-162, S. 3; 82-372, S. 2; P.A. 83-456, S. 2, 7; June Sp.
