The licensing authority of any city or town may grant a secondhand dealer license to any suitable person with a fixed place of business within the limits of such city or town. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any transaction involving the purchase of personal property of any type from a person who is not a wholesaler for the purpose of reselling or exchanging such property by (1) a bona fide charitable or religious corporation, or (2) a person conducting a garage sale, yard sale, tag sale or estate sale conducted entirely at a private residence, provided such sale does not exceed seventy-two hours in duration during any six-month period from the requirements of this section.\n\n(b) Any person granted a license under subsection (a) of this section shall pay, for the benefit of the city or town, respectively, or if the licensing authority is the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection, for the benefit of the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, to the licensing authority a license fee of two hundred fifty dollars, and one hundred dollars per year thereafter, for renewal of such license, and shall, at the time of receiving such license, file, with the licensing authority, a bond to such city or town, with competent surety, in the amount of ten thousand dollars, to be approved by such licensing authority and conditioned for the faithful performance of the duties and obligations pertaining to the business so licensed.\n\n(c) Each such license shall designate the place where such business is to be carried on and shall be in effect for one year unless sooner suspended or revoked. Such license shall be displayed in a conspicuous location in the place where such business is carried on. At the time of application for such license and each renewal thereof, the applicant shall disclose to the licensing authority all places used or intended to be used by the business for the purchase, receipt, storage or sale of property. During the term of such license, the licensee shall notify the licensing authority of any additional places that will be used by the business for the purchase, receipt, storage or sale of property prior to such use.\n\n(d) An application for such license shall be made in writing, under oath. The application shall contain: (1) The type of business to be engaged in, (2) the applicant's full name, age and date and place of birth, (3) the applicant's residence addresses and places of employment within the preceding five years, (4) the applicant's present occupation, (5) any crime of which the applicant has been convicted and the date and place of such conviction, and (6) such additional information as the licensing authority deems necessary to investigate the qualifications, character, competency and integrity of the applicant. If the applicant is a corporation, limited liability company, partnership or association, the application shall contain the information required by this subsection for each individual who is or will be an officer, shareholder, financial backer or creditor, other than a financial institution, of such entity or any other individual with a relationship to such entity similar to that of an officer, shareholder, financial backer or creditor.\n\n(e) The application for such license and any renewal thereof shall contain information on any Internet web site or account used by such applicant to conduct the business.

Any criminal history records checks required pursuant to this subsection shall be conducted in accordance with section 29-17a. The licensing authority may charge the applicant, employee or person a fee equal to the fees established by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the State Police Bureau of Identification for performing such criminal history records checks.\n\n(g) The licensing authority shall grant or deny an application for a license not later than ninety days after the filing of such application with the licensing authority. A licensee seeking renewal of such license shall file for a renewal at least sixty days before the expiration of such license and the issuing authority shall grant or deny such renewal not later than thirty days from the filing of such application for renewal. Failure of the licensing authority to act on such application or renewal within such period shall be deemed to be a denial.\n\n(h) The licensing authority may suspend or revoke any license issued under this section or modify the requirements for such license at any time during the period of the license for good cause shown, upon notice to the licensee and following a hearing, which shall be held not later than five days following the date of issuance of such notice. The licensing authority shall issue a decision not more than fourteen days following any hearing.\n\n(i) Any person aggrieved by any action of the licensing authority in denying, suspending, revoking or refusing to renew a license issued pursuant to this section or modifying the requirements for such license may appeal from such action to the Superior Court.\n\n(j) Any applicant for a license or renewal thereof may, at the time of the initial application or any time thereafter, apply for an exemption from the provisions of this section for the term of the license or for such shorter period as the licensing authority may determine. The licensing authority may grant such exemption for good cause shown. The licensing authority may, for good cause shown, exempt any person from the provisions of this section who engages in activities otherwise subject to the provisions of this section on an occasional basis.\n\n(k) Any person who wilfully engages in the business of a secondhand dealer, unless licensed in accordance with this section, or after notice that such person's license has been suspended or revoked, shall be guilty of a class D felony.\n\n(P.A. 11-100, S. 10; June 12 Sp.
