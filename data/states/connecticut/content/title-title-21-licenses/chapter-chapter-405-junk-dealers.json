Each such junk dealer shall make an application for a license in the town where such dealer is engaged in business. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a junk dealer or employee of such dealer from authorizing a person to enter a junk yard owned by such dealer for the purpose of salvaging or collecting parts or scraps for purchase from such dealer or employee. Except as otherwise provided by special act, and except where there exists a duly constituted local zoning or planning commission, any town, city or borough may, by ordinance, regulate the establishment, location or conduct of any junk yard within its territorial limits.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 4648; 1953, S. 2331d; 1957, P.A. 13, S. 89; P.A. 73-14, S. 1, 2; P.A. 11-213, S. 46.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 73-14 substituted motor vehicle department for state police department where appearing; (Revisor's note: In 1997 references throughout the general statutes to “Motor Vehicle(s) Commissioner” and “Motor Vehicle(s) Department” were replaced editorially by the Revisors with “Commissioner of Motor Vehicles” or “Department of Motor Vehicles”, as the case may be, for consistency with customary statutory usage); P.A. 11-213 deleted provisions re registration with Department of Motor Vehicles, added provisions re making application for license in town where dealer is engaged in business and added provision re entry into junk yard by certain persons, effective July 1, 2011.\n\nCited. 155 C. 284.",

Each license granted under the provisions of this section shall designate the place where such business is to be carried on, and shall continue for one year unless sooner revoked. Each such dealer shall keep a book in which shall be written in English a description of such articles and the name and residence and a general description of the person from whom, and the time and hour when, such property was received; and such book, and all articles of property mentioned in such book, and the place where such business is carried on, may be examined at any time by the selectmen of the town or any person designated by such selectmen, and, in any city or borough, by the chief of police of such city or borough or any person designated by the chief. Each such dealer shall make, weekly, sworn statements of all his or her transactions under such license, describing the goods received and setting forth the name and residence and a description of the person from whom such goods were received, to the chief of police in the case of cities or boroughs and, in other cases, to the town clerk of the town in which such junk dealer resides, and shall keep all goods at least five days after the filing of such statement.

Constitutionality upheld and statute interpreted; official determines suitability of person but has no further discretion. 140 C. 637. Writ of mandamus to compel selectmen to issue license would not lie where selectmen had not considered question of plaintiff's suitability for license since issuance of such license is discretionary with selectmen; if there is a duty enforceable on board by way of mandamus, it is the duty to act, either affirmatively or negatively, on application properly presented to it under section. 155 C. 283.",
