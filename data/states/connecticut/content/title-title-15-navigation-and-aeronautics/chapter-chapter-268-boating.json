(B) A sailboat which is close-hauled on the port tack shall keep out of the way of a sailboat which is close-hauled on the starboard tack. (C) When two sailboats are running free with the wind on different sides, the sailboat which has the wind on the port side shall keep out of the way of the other. (D) When two sailboats are running free with the wind on the same side, the sailboat which is to the windward shall keep out of the way of the other.\n\n(4) Every vessel overtaking another vessel shall keep out of the way of the overtaken vessel. Any person operating a vessel shall not follow another vessel more closely than is reasonable and prudent and shall have regard for prevailing circumstances and conditions so as to not create a risk of collision.\n\n(5) Every vessel which is required by these rules to keep out of the way of another vessel, on approaching such other vessel, shall slacken speed, stop, reverse or alter course as necessary and, as circumstances permit, avoid crossing ahead of or hazarding the other vessel. The other vessel shall maintain her course and speed.\n\n(6) In obeying and construing these rules, regard shall be had to all dangers of navigation and collision and any special circumstances which may render a departure from these rules necessary in order to avoid immediate danger. For the purposes of this subsection, following too closely to avoid collision with another vessel shall be considered a violation.\n\n(7) The operator of a vessel shall at all times maintain a proper lookout required by the ordinary practice of seamen and by the special circumstances of the case.\n\n(8) Violation of any provision of this section shall be an infraction.\n\n(1961, P.A. 520, S. 11; P.A. 76-381, S. 22; P.A. 94-188, S. 13; P.A. 99-219, S. 1, 3.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 76-381 added Subsec.

Such information shall be sufficient to identify the abandoned vessel and shall contain, at a minimum and when such information is known, the registration number of such vessel, the make and model of such vessel, the length and color of such vessel, the town and water body nearest to the location of such vessel abandonment and instructions for contacting the commissioner.\n\n(4) The commissioner shall send a certified letter to the person who abandoned such vessel, provided such person can be identified and, in such letter, identify the abandoned vessel, notify the recipient of the consequences of abandonment under the provisions of this section and provide instructions regarding retrieval of such vessel.\n\n(5) The commissioner shall provide to the party with standing a water resistant adhesive label advising that the subject vessel is being processed pursuant to the provisions of this section and that contains instructions on how to contact the commissioner in order to acquire more information or intervene in such procedures. The party with standing shall immediately affix the label to the abandoned vessel in a prominent location in such a manner as to be visible to an approaching person.\n\n(6) A forty-five-day abandoned vessel period shall commence beginning on the date of the first attempt to deliver the certified letter described in subdivision (4) of this subsection. In any case in which a vessel is not registered, such period shall begin when the commissioner posts information regarding the abandoned vessel on the Internet web site described in subdivision (3) of this subsection. The commissioner may suspend such abandoned vessel period for not more than six months for just cause, provided the commissioner shall state, in writing, for publication on such abandoned vessel Internet web site described in subdivision (3) of this subsection, the reason for such suspension and the elements necessary to resume the abandoned vessel period.\n\n(7) On the day following the expiration of the abandoned vessel period, if any person who abandoned such vessel, vessel lienholder or person with a security interest did not contact the commissioner or otherwise failed to remove such abandoned vessel, the commissioner shall issue a notice of assumed ownership, by certified mail, to the party with standing and provide a copy of the notice to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles by electronic mail. If such abandoned vessel is the subject of a vessel lien or security interest, as filed with the Secretary of the State, the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall file a notice of discharge with the Secretary of the State. Such notice shall: (A) Identify the vessel lien or security interest by a file number, (B) describe the vessel by identification number or type, and (C) indicate that a notice of assumed ownership was issued to the party with standing. The notice of assumed ownership shall be a termination of any and all liens and security interests against such vessel and shall satisfy the notice of removal requirements of section 49-56a. Upon issuance of said notice of assumed ownership the party with standing shall be deemed to be the owner of the abandoned vessel, and the original of the notice of assumed ownership shall be prima facie evidence of such ownership. In the event such vessel is titled in this or another state, such notice of assumed ownership shall be prima facie evidence of a transfer, by operation of law, from a titleholder to the party with standing and shall be deemed sufficient documentation to establish the party with standing's ownership interest or right to acquire the ownership interest. The Commissioner of Motor Vehicles shall cancel the existing registration for such vessel and shall note the transfer of ownership to the party with standing in the vessel registration record, if such record exists and is accessible to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. If such vessel is registered by a registering agency other than the Department of Motor Vehicles, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles shall notify such agency, by electronic mail, of the transfer of ownership.\n\n(8) If the person who abandoned such vessel contacts the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection, such person shall have until the last day of the abandoned vessel period described in subdivision (6) of this subsection to remove such abandoned vessel from the property or possession of the party with standing, as applicable. If the person who abandoned such vessel fails to remove such vessel by said day, the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection, in conjunction with the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, shall cause the registration of the abandoned vessel to be cancelled and shall issue a notice of assumed ownership to the party with standing. The commissioner may suspend the abandoned vessel period, in accordance with subdivision (6) of this subsection, at the request of the person who abandoned the vessel and for just cause shown. The person who abandoned the vessel shall be liable for any property damage caused by the removal of the abandoned vessel that is undertaken pursuant to this subdivision.\n\n(i) For a period of forty-five days following the end of a declared state of emergency that resulted in the widespread displacement of vessels and that was declared to be an emergency by the Governor pursuant to chapter 517, there shall be no fee for the filing of a notice of abandoned vessel, pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (h) of this section, and notarization of such notice shall not be required. Notwithstanding sections 1-217 and 14-10, the commissioner may publish the name of the owner of any such abandoned vessel and town of record, as such information appears on vessel registration records, during the declared emergency and until such time as such vessel is no longer deemed abandoned.\n\n(j) A notice of abandoned vessel, as described in subdivision (1) of subsection (h) of this section, shall be prepared and submitted to the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection for each abandoned vessel, including any vessel that is documented with the United States Coast Guard in accordance with the maritime or admiralty laws of the United States or that is relocated to an abandoned vessel holding area by persons or agents acting in a relief or emergency capacity.\n\n(k) The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection may waive the requirement to contact the person who abandoned such vessel by certified mail, as required by subdivision (4) of subsection (h) of this section, if contact with such person is otherwise established by electronic mail or another suitable means of communication, as determined by the commissioner.\n\n(l) Notwithstanding any provisions of the general statutes, any waste oil, fuel, antifreeze or other hazardous materials stored on an abandoned vessel and incidental to the operation and maintenance of such abandoned vessel shall be deemed household hazardous waste, for the purpose of disposal of such materials, if removed from such abandoned vessel in preparation for the storage, removal or destruction of such abandoned vessel.\n\n(m) Any person who abandons a vessel shall have committed a violation and shall be fined not less than three hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars, except if such abandonment occurred during a declared emergency and as a result of the conditions that caused such emergency to be declared.\n\n(P.A. 73-257, S. 22, 27; P.A. 11-80, S. 1; P.A. 14-57, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: Pursuant to P.A. 11-80, “Commissioner of Environmental Protection” was changed editorially by the Revisors to “Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection” in Subsec. (b), effective July 1, 2011; P.A. 14-57 amended Subsec.

Each marine dealer or marine engine manufacturer shall keep a record of each loaned number certificate showing the date loaned, the vessel hull identification number (HIN) of the vessel on which such number is displayed, the date returned and the name and address of the person operating any vessel with such loaned number certificate. Such dealer or engine manufacturer shall give a copy of this record to each person to whom such number certificate is loaned, which copy shall be carried in the vessel at all times when operated. This record shall be retained by the dealer or engine manufacturer for a period of six months from the date on which the number certificate was loaned and such record shall be available during business hours for examination by any police officer, marine officer or conservation officer.
