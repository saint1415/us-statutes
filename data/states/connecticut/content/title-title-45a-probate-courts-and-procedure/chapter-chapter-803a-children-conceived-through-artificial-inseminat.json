Not later than thirty days after the date of receipt of such document, the fiduciary of the decedent's estate or person filing an affidavit or statement in lieu of administration shall provide written notification of the existence of such document to the court. In the absence of being in possession of a document described in subsection (a) of this section, if the fiduciary of the decedent's estate or person filing an affidavit or statement in lieu of administration has actual knowledge that the decedent, during his or her lifetime, preserved sperm or eggs, or executed a document described in subsection (a) of this section, such fiduciary or person shall provide written notification to the court. The failure of a surviving spouse, fiduciary or person filing an affidavit or statement in lieu of administration to comply with the notice requirements prescribed in this subsection shall not impair a child's right to property under subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(c) Except as provided in section 45a-787, the Probate Court having jurisdiction of the estate of the decedent, or if no probate proceedings have been commenced, the Probate Court for the district in which the decedent was domiciled at the time of death, shall have jurisdiction over any dispute relating to the rights to property of a child conceived and born after the death of a decedent, whether or not the property is part of the probate estate. A child or person acting on behalf of a child who claims rights to the property of a decedent under subsection (a) of this section shall prove such claim by clear and convincing evidence.\n\n(P.A. 13-301, S. 1; P.A. 14-122, S. 54.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 14-122 made a technical change in Subsec.
