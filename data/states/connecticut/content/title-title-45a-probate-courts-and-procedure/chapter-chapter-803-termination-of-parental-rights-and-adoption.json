(Name of child), a person under the age of eighteen years”, and shall set forth with specificity: (1) The name, sex, date and place of birth, and present address of the child; (2) the name and address of the petitioner, and the nature of the relationship between the petitioner and the child; (3) the names, dates of birth and addresses of the parents of the child, if known, including the name of any putative father named by the mother, and the tribe and reservation of an American Indian parent; (4) if the parent of the child is a minor, the names and addresses of the parents or guardian of the person of such minor; (5) the names and addresses of: (A) The guardian of the person of the child; (B) any guardians ad litem appointed in a prior proceeding; (C) the tribe and reservation of an American Indian child; and (D) the child-placing agency which placed the child in his current placement; (6) the facts upon which termination is sought, the legal grounds authorizing termination, the effects of a termination decree and the basis for the jurisdiction of the court; (7) the name of the persons or agencies which have agreed to accept custody or guardianship of the child's person upon disposition.\n\n(c) If the information required under subdivisions (2) and (6) of subsection (b) of this section is not stated, the petition shall be dismissed. If any other facts required under subdivision (1), (3), (4), (5) or (7) of subsection (b) of this section are not known or cannot be ascertained by the petitioner, he shall so state in the petition. If the whereabouts of either parent or the putative father named under subdivision (3) of subsection (b) of this section are unknown, the petitioner shall diligently search for any such parent or putative father. The petitioner shall file an affidavit with the petition indicating the efforts used to locate the parent or putative father.\n\n(d) If a petition indicates that either or both parents consent to the termination of their parental rights, or if at any time following the filing of a petition and before the entry of a decree a parent consents to the termination of his parental rights, each consenting parent shall acknowledge such consent on a form promulgated by the Office of the Chief Court Administrator evidencing to the satisfaction of the court that the parent has voluntarily and knowingly consented to the termination of his parental rights. No consent to termination by a mother shall be executed within forty-eight hours immediately after the birth of her child. A parent who is a minor shall have the right to consent to termination of parental rights and such consent shall not be voidable by reason of such minority. A guardian ad litem shall be appointed by the court to assure that such minor parent is giving an informed and voluntary consent.\n\n(e) A petition under this section shall be filed in the Probate Court for the district in which (1) the petitioner resides, (2) the child resides, is domiciled or is located at the time of the filing of the petition, or (3) in the case of a minor who is under the guardianship of any child care facility or child-placing agency, in the Probate Court for the district in which any office of the agency is located. If the petition is filed with respect to a child born out of wedlock, the petition shall state whether there is a putative father to whom notice shall be given under subdivision (3) of subsection (b) of section 45a-716.\n\n(f) If any petitioner under subsection (a) is a minor or incompetent, the guardian ad litem, appointed by the court in accordance with section 45a-708, must approve the petition in writing, before action by the court.\n\n(g) Before a hearing on the merits in any case in which a petition for termination of parental rights is contested in a Probate Court, the Probate Court shall, on the motion of any legal party except the petitioner, or may on its own motion or that of the petitioner, transfer the case to the Superior Court in accordance with rules adopted by the judges of the Supreme Court. In addition to the provisions of this section, the Probate Court may, on the court's own motion or that of any interested party, transfer any termination of parental rights case to a Regional Children's Probate Court established pursuant to section 45a-8a. If the case is transferred, the clerk of the Probate Court shall transmit to the clerk of the Superior Court or the Regional Children's Probate Court to which the case was transferred, the original files and papers in the case. The Superior Court or the Regional Children's Probate Court to which the case was transferred, upon hearing after notice as provided in sections 45a-716 and 45a-717, may grant the petition as provided in section 45a-717.\n\n(h) Either or both birth parents and an intended adoptive parent may enter into a cooperative postadoption agreement regarding communication or contact between either or both birth parents and the adopted child. Such an agreement may be entered into if: (1) An order terminating parental rights has not yet been entered; and (2) either or both birth parents agree to a voluntary termination of parental rights, including an agreement in a case which began as an involuntary termination of parental rights. The postadoption agreement shall be applicable only to a birth parent who is a party to the agreement. Such agreement shall be in addition to those under common law. Counsel for the child and any guardian ad litem for the child may be heard on the proposed cooperative postadoption agreement. There shall be no presumption of communication or contact between the birth parents and an intended adoptive parent in the absence of a cooperative postadoption agreement.\n\n(i) If the court determines that the child's best interests will be served by postadoption communication or contact with either or both birth parents, the court shall so order, stating the nature and frequency of the communication or contact. A court may grant postadoption communication or contact privileges if: (1) Each intended adoptive parent consents to the granting of communication or contact privileges; (2) the intended adoptive parent and either or both birth parents execute a cooperative agreement and file the agreement with the court; (3) consent to postadoption communication or contact is obtained from the child, if the child is at least twelve years of age; and (4) the cooperative postadoption agreement is approved by the court.\n\n(j) A cooperative postadoption agreement shall contain the following: (1) An acknowledgment by either or both birth parents that the termination of parental rights and the adoption is irrevocable, even if the adoptive parents do not abide by the cooperative postadoption agreement; and (2) an acknowledgment by the adoptive parents that the agreement grants either or both birth parents the right to seek to enforce the cooperative postadoption agreement.\n\n(k) The terms of a cooperative postadoption agreement may include the following: (1) Provision for communication between the child and either or both birth parents; (2) provision for future contact between either or both birth parents and the child or an adoptive parent; and (3) maintenance of medical history of either or both birth parents who are a party to the agreement.\n\n(l) The order approving a cooperative postadoption agreement shall be made part of the final order terminating parental rights. The finality of the termination of parental rights and of the adoption shall not be affected by implementation of the provisions of the postadoption agreement, nor is the cooperative postadoption contingent upon the finalization of an adoption. Such an agreement shall not affect the ability of the adoptive parents and the child to change their residence within or outside this state.\n\n(m) A disagreement between the parties or litigation brought to enforce or modify the agreement shall not affect the validity of the termination of parental rights or the adoption and shall not serve as a basis for orders affecting the custody of the child. The court shall not act on a petition to change or enforce the agreement unless the petitioner had participated, or attempted to participate, in good faith in mediation or other appropriate dispute resolution proceedings to resolve the dispute and allocate any cost for such mediation or dispute resolution proceedings.\n\n(n) An adoptive parent, guardian ad litem for the child or the court on its own motion may, at any time, petition for review of communication or contact ordered pursuant to subsection (i) of this section, if the adoptive parent believes that the best interests of the child are being compromised. The court may order the communication or contact be terminated, or order such conditions in regard to communication or contact as the court deems to be in the best interest of the adopted child.\n\n(o) For any child who is the subject of a petition for adoption under this chapter, the court shall consider the appropriateness of postadoption communication or contact with a sibling of such child, including, but not limited to, visitation, written correspondence or telephone calls. If the court determines such postadoption communication or contact is in the best interest of the child, the court shall order that such child have access to and visitation rights with such sibling until the child reaches eighteen years of age.\n\n(p) The court shall consider the following factors in determining whether postadoption communication or contact with a sibling is in the best interest of the child: (1) The age of the child and his or her sibling; (2) the extent of the existing relationship between the child and his or her sibling; (3) the physical, emotional and psychological needs, including any special needs, and stability of the child and his or her sibling; (4) the child's opinion and the opinion of his or her sibling regarding such postadoption communication or contact; (5) the opinion of the adoptive parent regarding such postadoption communication or contact; (6) opinions of experts, including any individuals who may have provided services to the child or his or her sibling; (7) the long-term plans for the child and his or her sibling; and (8) any relevant logistical concerns.\n\n(q) Any determination of the court pursuant to subsection (o) of this section shall be included in the final adoption order, but such determination shall not affect the validity of the adoption. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority of the court to enforce its orders in any manner permitted by law.\n\n(r) An adoptive parent may, at any time, petition the court to review its determination regarding postadoption communication or contact between a child and his or her sibling. Upon receiving such petition, the court shall conduct a review of its determination using the factors listed in subsection (p) of this section and may order the communication or contact to be terminated or modified if the court determines that such termination or modification is in the best interest of the child. If any dispute arises pursuant to such review, the court may order the parties to engage in mediation.\n\n(s) The court shall not, pursuant to the review required under subsection (r) of this section, increase communication or contact between the adopted child and his or her sibling unless the court (1) receives consent from the adoptive parent; and (2) inquires about and considers the opinion of the child regarding such increase.\n\n(P.A. 73-156, S. 3; P.A. 74-164, S. 2, 20; P.A. 75-420, S. 4, 6; P.A. 76-436, S. 641, 681; P.A. 77-614, S. 521, 610; P.A. 79-223; 79-631, S. 33, 77, 85, 111; P.A. 80-476, S. 144; P.A. 83-355, S. 1; P.A. 84-449, S. 2, 7; P.A. 86-264, S. 8; P.A. 93-91, S. 1, 2; 93-170, S. 2; P.A. 95-349, S. 4; P.A. 96-130, S. 5; P.A. 00-75, S. 9; 00-137, S. 4; P.A. 01-195, S. 98, 181; P.A. 04-142, S. 6; P.A. 12-66, S. 10; P.A. 15-199, S. 18; P.A. 16-7, S. 7; 16-28, S. 9; P.A. 17-136, S. 8; P.A. 19-47, S. 16.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 74-164 specified right to petition court for appointment of statutory parent or termination of one parent's parental rights in cases where adoption is contemplated, specified right of minor parent to petition, and made minor changes in wording to conform with definitions of Sec. 45-61b in existing provisions and added Subsecs.

      "text": "(a) At the hearing held on any petition for the termination of parental rights filed in the Probate Court under section 45a-715, or filed in the Superior Court under section 17a-112, or transferred to the Superior Court from the Probate Court under section 45a-715, any party to whom notice was given shall have the right to appear and be heard with respect to the petition. If a parent who is consenting to the termination of such parent's parental rights appears at the hearing on the petition for termination of parental rights, the court shall explain to the parent the meaning and consequences of termination of parental rights. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require the appearance of a consenting parent at the hearing regarding the termination of such parent's parental rights except as otherwise provided by court order.\n\n(b) If a respondent parent appears without counsel, the court shall inform such respondent parent of his or her right to counsel and upon request, if he or she is unable to pay for counsel, shall appoint counsel to represent such respondent parent. No respondent parent may waive counsel unless the court has first explained the nature and meaning of a petition for the termination of parental rights. Unless the appointment of counsel is required under section 46b-136, the court may appoint counsel to represent or appear on behalf of any child in a hearing held under this section to speak on behalf of the best interests of the child. If the respondent parent is unable to pay for his or her own counsel or if the child is unable to pay for the child's counsel, in the case of a Superior Court matter, the reasonable compensation of counsel appointed for the respondent parent or the child shall be established by, and paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department and, in the case of a Probate Court matter, the reasonable compensation of counsel appointed for the respondent parent or the child shall be established by, and paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department, however, in the case of a Probate Court matter, if funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such purposes, such compensation shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund.\n\n(c) The court shall, if a claim for parentage has been filed by an alleged genetic parent in accordance with section 46b-571, continue the hearing under the provisions of this section until the claim for parentage is adjudicated, provided the court may combine the hearing on the claim for parentage with the hearing on the termination of parental rights petition.\n\n(d) Upon finding at the hearing or at any time during the pendency of the petition that reasonable cause exists to warrant an examination, the court, on its own motion or on motion by any party, may order the child to be examined at a suitable place by a physician, psychiatrist or licensed clinical psychologist appointed by the court. The court may also order examination of a parent or custodian whose competency or ability to care for a child before the court is at issue. The expense of any examination shall be paid for by the petitioner, respondent or the party who requested the examination in such proportion as the court determines. If a party responsible for payment is indigent, such party's share of the expense shall be paid for by funds appropriated to the Judicial Department, however, in the case of a Probate Court matter, if funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such purposes, the compensation of the physician, psychiatrist or psychologist shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund. The court may consider the results of the examinations in ruling on the merits of the petition.\n\n(e) (1) The court may, and in any contested case shall, request the Commissioner of Children and Families or any child-placing agency licensed by the commissioner to make an investigation and written report to it, within ninety days from the receipt of such request. The report shall indicate the physical, mental and emotional status of the child and shall contain such facts as may be relevant to the court's determination of whether the proposed termination of parental rights will be in the best interests of the child, including the physical, mental, social and financial condition of the biological parents, and any other factors which the commissioner or such child-placing agency finds relevant to the court's determination of whether the proposed termination will be in the best interests of the child. (2) If such a report has been requested, upon the expiration of such ninety-day period or upon receipt of the report, whichever is earlier, the court shall set a day for a hearing not more than thirty days thereafter. The court shall give reasonable notice of such adjourned hearing to all parties to the first hearing, and to such other persons as the court shall deem appropriate. (3) The report shall be admissible in evidence, subject to the right of a party to require that the person making it appear as a witness and be subject to examination.\n\n(f) At the adjourned hearing or at the initial hearing where no investigation and report has been requested, the court may approve a petition for termination of parental rights based on consent filed pursuant to this section terminating the parental rights and may appoint a guardian of the person of the child, or if the petitioner requests, the court may appoint a statutory parent, if it finds, upon clear and convincing evidence that (1) the termination is in the best interest of the child, and (2) such parent has voluntarily and knowingly consented to termination of the parent's parental rights with respect to such child. If the court denies a petition for termination of parental rights based on consent, it may refer the matter to an agency to assess the needs of the child, the care the child is receiving and the plan of the parent for the child. Consent for the termination of the parental right of one parent does not diminish the parental rights of the other parent of the child nor does it relieve the other parent of the duty to support the child.\n\n(g) At the adjourned hearing or at the initial hearing where no investigation and report has been requested, the court may approve a petition terminating the parental rights and may appoint a guardian of the person of the child, or, if the petitioner requests, the court may appoint a statutory parent, if it finds, upon clear and convincing evidence, that (1) the termination is in the best interest of the child, and (2) (A) the child has been abandoned by the parent in the sense that the parent has failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest, concern or responsibility as to the welfare of the child; (B) the child has been denied, by reason of an act or acts of parental commission or omission, including, but not limited to, sexual molestation and exploitation, severe physical abuse or a pattern of abuse, the care, guidance or control necessary for the child's physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being. Nonaccidental or inadequately explained serious physical injury to a child shall constitute prima facie evidence of acts of parental commission or omission sufficient for the termination of parental rights; (C) there is no ongoing parent-child relationship which is defined as the relationship that ordinarily develops as a result of a parent having met on a continuing, day-to-day basis the physical, emotional, moral and educational needs of the child and to allow further time for the establishment or reestablishment of the parent-child relationship would be detrimental to the best interests of the child; (D) a child of the parent (i) was found by the Superior Court or the Probate Court to have been neglected, abused or uncared for, as those terms are defined in section 46b-120, in a prior proceeding, or (ii) is found to be neglected, abused or uncared for and has been in the custody of the commissioner for at least fifteen months and such parent has been provided specific steps to take to facilitate the return of the child to the parent pursuant to section 46b-129 and has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child; (E) a child of the parent, who is under the age of seven years is found to be neglected, abused or uncared for, and the parent has failed, is unable or is unwilling to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable amount of time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child and such parent's parental rights of another child were previously terminated pursuant to a petition filed by the Commissioner of Children and Families; (F) the parent has killed through deliberate, nonaccidental act another child of the parent or has requested, commanded, importuned, attempted, conspired or solicited such killing or has committed an assault, through deliberate, nonaccidental act that resulted in serious bodily injury of another child of the parent; (G) except as provided in subsection (h) of this section, the parent committed an act that constitutes sexual assault as described in section 53a-70, 53a-70a, 53a-70c, 53a-71, 53a-72a, 53a-72b or 53a-73a or compelling a spouse or cohabitor to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force or by the threat of the use of force as described in section 53a-70b of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2019, if such act resulted in the conception of the child; or (H) the parent was finally adjudged guilty of sexual assault under section 53a-70, 53a-70a, 53a-70c, 53a-71, 53a-72a, 53a-72b or 53a-73a or of compelling a spouse or cohabitor to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force or by the threat of the use of force under section 53a-70b of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2019, if such act resulted in the conception of the child.\n\n(h) If the petition alleges an act described in subparagraph (G) of subdivision (2) of subsection (g) of this section that resulted in the conception of the child as a basis for termination of parental rights and the court determines that the respondent parent was finally adjudged not guilty of such act of sexual assault under section 53a-70, 53a-70a, 53a-70c, 53a-71, 53a-72a, 53a-72b or 53a-73 or of compelling a spouse or cohabitor to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force or by the threat of the use of force under section 53a-70b of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2019, the court shall transfer the case to the Superior Court and the clerk of the Probate Court shall transmit to the clerk of the Superior Court to which the case was transferred, the original files and papers in the case. The Superior Court, upon hearing after notice as provided in this section and section 45a-716, may grant the petition as provided in this section.\n\n(i) Except in the case where termination is based on consent, in determining whether to terminate parental rights under this section, the court shall consider and shall make written findings regarding: (1) The timeliness, nature and extent of services offered, provided and made available to the parent and the child by a child-placing agency to facilitate the reunion of the child with the parent; (2) the terms of any applicable court order entered into and agreed upon by any individual or child-placing agency and the parent, and the extent to which all parties have fulfilled their obligations under such order; (3) the feelings and emotional ties of the child with respect to the child's parents, any guardian of the child's person and any person who has exercised physical care, custody or control of the child for at least one year and with whom the child has developed significant emotional ties; (4) the age of the child; (5) the efforts the parent has made to adjust such parent's circumstances, conduct or conditions to make it in the best interest of the child to return the child to the parent's home in the foreseeable future, including, but not limited to, (A) the extent to which the parent has maintained contact with the child as part of an effort to reunite the child with the parent, provided the court may give weight to incidental visitations, communications or contributions and (B) the maintenance of regular contact or communication with the guardian or other custodian of the child; and (6) the extent to which a parent has been prevented from maintaining a meaningful relationship with the child by the unreasonable act or conduct of the other parent of the child, or the unreasonable act of any other person or by the economic circumstances of the parent.\n\n(j) If the parental rights of only one parent are terminated, the remaining parent shall be sole parent and, unless otherwise provided by law, guardian of the person.\n\n(k) In the case where termination of parental rights is granted, the guardian of the person or statutory parent shall report to the court within thirty days of the date judgment is entered on a case plan, as defined by the federal Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, as amended from time to time, for the child. At least every three months thereafter, such guardian or statutory parent shall make a report to the court on the implementation of the plan. The court may convene a hearing upon the filing of a report and shall convene a hearing for the purpose of reviewing the plan no more than twelve months from the date judgment is entered or from the date of the last permanency hearing held pursuant to subsection (k) of section 46b-129 if the child or youth is in the care and custody of the Commissioner of Children and Families, whichever is earlier, and at least once a year thereafter until such time as any proposed adoption plan has become finalized. If the Commissioner of Children and Families is the statutory parent for the child, at such a hearing the court shall determine whether the department has made reasonable efforts to achieve the permanency plan. In the case where termination of parental rights is granted, the guardian of the person or statutory parent shall obtain the approval of the court prior to placing the child or youth for adoption outside the state. Before ordering or approving such placement, the court shall make findings concerning compliance with the provisions of section 17a-175. Such findings shall include, but not be limited to: (1) A finding that the state has received notice in writing from the receiving state, in accordance with subsection (d) of Article III of section 17a-175, indicating that the proposed placement does not appear contrary to the interests of the child, (2) the court has reviewed such notice, (3) whether or not an interstate compact study or other home study has been completed by the receiving state, and (4) if such a study has been completed, whether the conclusions reached by the receiving state as a result of such study support the placement.\n\n(P.A. 73-156, S. 7; P.A. 74-164, S. 6, 20; P.A. 75-420, S. 4, 6; P.A. 76-436, S. 644, 681; P.A. 77-614, S. 521, 610; P.A. 79-592, S. 3; 79-631, S. 79, 111; P.A. 80-476, S. 146; P.A. 82-202, S. 2; P.A. 83-387, S. 2; 83-478, S. 2; June Sp.

(1), deleted similar proviso in Subdiv. (2) where court could waive one-year requirement if it found that child under age of 3 because of his age “has a greater vulnerability to damage from the circumstances of his present situation”, added Subdiv. (3) where there are no identifiable acts of parental commission or omission but court sees no ongoing parent-child relationship and to continue the situation to allow for establishment or reestablishment of such relationship would be detrimental to child, deleted provision whereby court could approve termination where parent without custody unreasonably withholds consent “contrary to the best interest of the child”, and added provisions specifying that when one parent's rights are terminated, the remaining parent is sole parent and natural guardian and specifying court's power to terminate rights of parent or putative father if such person consents to the termination and waives notice; P.A. 75-420 replaced welfare commissioner with commissioner of social services; P.A. 76-436 replaced juvenile court with superior court, effective July 1, 1978; P.A. 77-614 replaced social services commissioner with commissioner of human resources, effective January 1, 1979; P.A. 79-592 added provisions re effect of claim for paternity on proceedings and, with P.A. 79-631, replaced human resources commissioner with commissioner of children and youth services; P.A. 80-476 divided section into Subsecs. and rephrased and reordered provisions; P.A. 82-202 amended Subsec.

(e) to require the court to consider and make written findings concerning certain factors in its determination of whether to terminate parental rights, and relettered the remaining subsection accordingly; P.A. 83-478 amended Subsec. (d) to rephrase the grounds for termination, to provide that “nonaccidental or inadequately explained serious physical injury to a child shall constitute prima facie evidence of acts of parental commission or omission sufficient for the termination of parental rights”, to require the court to find in connection with any of the grounds, rather than just the abandonment ground, that the termination is in the best interests of the child and that the condition causing termination has existed for not less than one year, and to authorize the court to waive the requirement that one year expire prior to the termination of parental rights, but because of omission from June special session act, was effective only from October 1, 1983, through March 31, 1984, that is, until June act's effective date of April 1, 1984; June Sp. Sess. P.A. 83-11 inserted a new Subsec. (b) re the appointment and payment of counsel, inserted a new Subsec. (d) re an examination of the child, parent or custodian and the payment for such examination, and relettered the intervening and remaining subsections accordingly, effective April 1, 1984; P.A. 84-171 amended Subsec. (f) to restore amendment made by P.A. 83-478; P.A. 84-449 substantially revised and rephrased section adding provisions re the procedure for termination of parental rights based on consent and revising provisions for the appointment and payment of counsel and the ordering of and payment for an examination of the child; P.A. 90-31 amended Subsec.

(k) by specifying that 90-day deadline for initial reports begins on date judgment is entered, by specifying that guardian or statutory parent to make subsequent report and requiring the court to convene hearing for review of plan no more than 15 months from date judgment is entered and at least once a year thereafter; P.A. 95-238 added Subsec. (f)(4) re unregenerate parents and Subsec. (g)(2) re children under age 7 and made technical changes; P.A. 95-316 amended Subsec.

Respondent father's due process rights were not violated in termination of parental rights proceeding where he participated by telephone due to his incarceration and where his request for a trial transcript and a continuance were denied, because respondent did not identify on appeal any evidence or argument that he could have presented if trial court had granted his request for a transcript and a continuance. 300 C. 463.\n\nCited. 24 CA 135; 25 CA 586; judgment reversed, see 223 C. 492; 29 CA 176; Id., 600; 34 CA 176; 35 CA 490; 39 CA 353; 40 CA 675.\n\nCited. 44 CS 169; Id., 551.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nIn action for the termination of parental rights, the court did not deny respondent her procedural due process rights when conducting a trial on the merits with only her counsel present as the court still required petitioner to prove by clear and convincing evidence not only the grounds for termination, but that it was in the child's best interest for respondent's parental rights to be terminated. 111 CA 210.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\nRequirement that the court advise a party that appears without counsel of such party's right to counsel and right to have counsel appointed “at the hearing” during parental rights termination proceeding is not limited to the actual trial, but rather requires the court to advise such party when the party first appears without counsel after being served with a termination petition. 135 CA 470. Parent's right to effective assistance of counsel in parental rights termination proceeding is statutory and not rooted in federal or state constitutions. 140 CA 626. A court must determine whether a parent's waiver of the statutory right to counsel is intelligent and voluntary, but such a waiver does not trigger a specifically formulated canvass by the court. 150 CA 78.\n\nSubsec. (e):\n\nPrecluding social studies merely because trial court did not first request their production would have elevated form over substance and served only to delay proceedings where petitioner submitted social studies to trial court as proactive measure to comply with Sec. 17a-112(j) and Subdiv. (1). 196 CA 333.\n\nSubsec. (f):\n\nSubdiv. (3): Cannot be read together with Sec. 46b-129 so as to permit custody determinations made under that statute to lead directly to the termination determination made under this section; judgment of Appellate Court in 25 CA 586 reversed. 223 C. 492.\n\nTrial court determination to terminate parental rights upheld. 49 CA 541.\n\nSubsec. (g):\n\nSubdiv. (2)(C): Inquiry requires two step test, first petitioner must prove lack of ongoing parent-child relationship and only if proven proceed to second step where petitioner must prove that to allow for further time to establish or reestablish relationship would be contrary to the best interests of the child. 330 C. 744.\n\nSubdiv. (2): While a respondent's imprisonment alone does not constitute abandonment under Subpara. (A), it does not excuse his failure to attempt either to contact or to visit with his children; court properly terminated parental rights of respondent on basis of no ongoing parent-child relationship under Subpara. (C) because child had no emotional bond with respondent whom he had never seen and about whom he was not aware and it would be detrimental to child's best interests to allow time for such a relationship to develop since child perceives his mother, stepfather and half-sisters as his family and respondent is likely to be incarcerated for several additional years. 120 CA 465. Subdiv. (2)(A) does not contemplate a sporadic showing of the indicia of interest, concern or responsibility for the welfare of a child, and a parent must maintain a reasonable degree of interest in the welfare of his or her child; the term “maintain” implies a continuing, reasonable degree of concern. Id., 712. Because the language in Subdiv. (2)(D) is virtually identical to that in Sec. 17a-112(j)(3)(B), the meaning and analytical framework applicable to that section applies to Subdiv. (2)(D). 134 CA 1. A parent who fails to provide the care, guidance or control necessary for child's well-being as contemplated under Subdiv. (2)(B) is not exempt from the provisions of Subsec. simply because some other person provides such care, guidance or control during parent's absence. 158 CA 154. Subdiv. (2): State's interest in preserving family integrity is the same regardless of whether party seeking termination of an individual's parental rights is the commissioner or the custodial parent; parent petitioning for termination of respondent parent's parental rights cannot establish lack of ongoing parent-child relationship on basis of petitioning parent's own interference with respondent parent's efforts to maintain contact with child. 167 CA 248. Subdiv. (2): A court cannot find both than an ongoing parent-child relationship exists and that a custodial parent prevented one from existing. 178 CA 215. Subdiv. (2): The initial test for determining whether an ongoing parent-child relationship exists is whether the child has any present positive feelings for the parent; a trial court may consider the question of interference only if the child does not have such feelings. Id. Subdiv. (2)(B): Circumstances of the termination of respondent's parental rights to other children in other actions are separate and distinct from those as to the child in current action and collateral estoppel cannot apply to preclude respondent from litigating whether his abuse of other children resulted in the denial of care, guidance, or control necessary for the physical, educational, moral, or emotional well-being of child in current action. 180 CA 132.\n\nSubsec. (h):\n\nA court need not perform a balancing test underMathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, to determine the adverse effects of the failure to terminate defendant's parental rights on her child against defendant's constitutionally protected right to raise her child because section passes constitutional muster. 168 CA 538.\n\nFather did not abandon children and mother resisted any meaningful, cooperative visitation relationship between father and children; mother cannot be permitted to prevent visitation and then allege father's parental rights should be terminated for failure to maintain a relationship. 53 CS 329.",

The petition shall be filed in the Probate Court for the district in which the petitioner or child resides or in the district in which the main office or any local office of the petitioner or the proposed statutory parent is located. The statutory parent shall be the Commissioner of Children and Families or a child-placing agency. Notice of the proceeding shall be sent to the guardian of the person, the child, if age twelve or older, the petitioner, the Commissioner of Children and Families and the proposed statutory parent by first class mail not less than ten days before the date of the hearing. Notice is not required for any party who files in court a written waiver of notice.\n\n(b) The statutory parent shall be the guardian of the person of the child, shall be responsible for the welfare of the child and the protection of the child's interests and shall retain custody of the child until the child attains the age of eighteen unless, before that time, the child is legally adopted or committed to the Commissioner of Children and Families or a licensed child-placing agency.\n\n(c) Any statutory parent may resign or be removed for good cause shown. Upon filing of a petition for the removal of a statutory parent or filing of a resignation of a statutory parent in the Probate Court in which the statutory parent was appointed, the court shall schedule a hearing, on the removal petition or resignation. Notice of such hearing shall be sent in accordance with section 45a-716, except that notice need not be sent to any parties whose rights have previously been terminated. At the hearing the court may accept the resignation, remove the statutory parent, or deny the petition for removal.
