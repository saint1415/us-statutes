For the purposes of subsections (d) to (g), inclusive, of this section, “payment” also includes any payment from any separate fund, regardless of the reason for the payment.\n\n(2) “Separate fund” includes a private or commercial annuity, an individual retirement account and a pension, profit-sharing, stock-bonus or stock-ownership plan. “Separate fund” does not include a payment pursuant to an installment sale contract.\n\n(b) To the extent that a payment is characterized as interest or a dividend or a payment made in lieu of interest or a dividend, a trustee shall allocate the payment to income. The trustee shall allocate to principal the balance of the payment and any other payment received in the same accounting period that is not characterized as interest, a dividend or an equivalent payment.\n\n(c) If no part of a payment is characterized as interest, a dividend or an equivalent payment, and all or part of the payment is required to be made, a trustee shall allocate to income ten per cent of the part that is required to be made during the accounting period and the balance to principal. If no part of a payment is required to be made or the payment received is the entire amount to which the trustee is entitled, the trustee shall allocate the entire payment to principal. For purposes of this subsection, a payment is not “required to be made” to the extent that it is made because the trustee exercises a right of withdrawal.\n\n(d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e) of this section, subsections (f) and (g) of this section apply, and subsections (b) and (c) of this section do not apply, in determining the allocation of a payment made from a separate fund to:\n\n(1) A trust to which an election to qualify for a marital deduction would be allowed under Section 2056(b)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time; or\n\n(2) A trust that qualifies for the marital deduction under Section 2056(b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time.\n\n(e) Subsections (d), (f) and (g) of this section do not apply if and to the extent that the series of payments would, without the application of subsection (d) of this section, qualify for the marital deduction under Section 2056(b)(7)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time.\n\n(f) A trustee shall determine the internal income of each separate fund for the accounting period as if the separate fund were a trust subject to this section. On request of the surviving spouse, the trustee shall demand that the person administering the separate fund distribute the internal income to the trust. The trustee shall allocate a payment from the separate fund to income to the extent of the internal income of the separate fund and distribute that amount to the surviving spouse. The trustee shall allocate the balance of the payment to principal. On request of the surviving spouse, the trustee shall allocate principal to income to the extent the internal income of the separate fund exceeds payments made from the separate fund to the trust during the accounting period.\n\n(g) If a trustee cannot determine the internal income of a separate fund but can determine the value of the separate fund, the internal income of the separate fund is deemed to equal four per cent of the fund's value, according to the most recent statement of value preceding the beginning of the accounting period. If the trustee can determine neither the internal income of the separate fund nor the fund's value, the internal income of the fund is deemed to equal the product of the interest rate and the present value of the expected future payments, as determined under Section 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time, for the month preceding the account period for which the computation is made.\n\n(h) This section does not apply to a payment to which section 45a-542r applies.\n\n(i) The provisions of this section apply to a trust described in subsection (d) of this section on and after the following dates:\n\n(1) If the trust is not funded as of October 1, 2010, the date of the decedent's death.\n\n(2) If the trust is initially funded in the calendar year beginning January 1, 2010, the date of the decedent's death.\n\n(3) If the trust is not described in subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection, the date of January 1, 2010.\n\n(P.A. 99-164, S. 18, 36; P.A. 10-31, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 99-164 effective January 1, 2000; P.A. 10-31 amended Subsec.

If the property of the first trust includes shares of stock in an S corporation and the first trust is, or but for the provisions of sections 45a-545a to 45a-545cc, inclusive, other than this section would be, a qualified subchapter-S trust within the meaning of Section 1361(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time, and the regulations thereunder, the second-trust instrument shall not include or omit a term that prevents the second trust from qualifying as a qualified subchapter-S trust.\n\n(5) If the first trust contains property that qualified, or would have qualified but for the provisions of sections 45a-545a to 45a-545cc, inclusive, other than this section, for a zero inclusion ratio for purposes of the generation-skipping transfer tax under Section 2642(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time, and the regulations thereunder, the second-trust instrument shall not include or omit a term that, if included in or omitted from the first-trust instrument, would have prevented the transfer to the first trust from qualifying for a zero inclusion ratio under said Section 2642(c).\n\n(6) If the first trust is directly or indirectly the beneficiary of qualified benefits property, the second-trust instrument may not include or omit any term that, if included in or omitted from the first-trust instrument, would have increased the minimum distributions required with respect to the qualified benefits property under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time, and the regulations thereunder and any applicable regulations, or any similar requirements that refer to said Section 401(a)(9) or the regulations thereunder. If an attempted exercise of the decanting power violates the provisions of this subdivision, the trustee is deemed to have held the qualified benefits property and any reinvested distributions of the property as a separate share from the date of the exercise of the power and section 45a-545v applies to the separate share.\n\n(7) If the first trust qualifies as a grantor trust because of the application of Section 672(f)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time, and the regulations thereunder, the second trust may not include or omit a term that, if included in or omitted from the first-trust instrument, would have prevented the first trust from qualifying under said Section 672(f)(2)(A).\n\n(8) As used in this subdivision, “tax benefit” means a federal or state tax deduction, exemption, exclusion or other benefit not otherwise listed in this section, except for a benefit arising from being a grantor trust. Subject to subdivision (9) of this subsection, a second-trust instrument may not include or omit a term that, if included in or omitted from the first-trust instrument, would have prevented qualification for a tax benefit if: (A) The first-trust instrument expressly indicates an intent to qualify for the benefit or the first-trust instrument clearly is designed to enable the first trust to qualify for the benefit; and (B) the transfer of property held by the first trust or the first trust qualified or, but for the provisions of sections 45a-545a to 45a-545cc, inclusive, other than this section, would have qualified for the tax benefit.\n\n(9) Subject to subdivision (4) of this subsection: (A) Except as provided in subdivision (7) of this subsection, the second trust may be a nongrantor trust, even if the first trust is a grantor trust; and (B) except as provided in subdivision (10) of this subsection, the second trust may be a grantor trust, even if the first trust is a nongrantor trust.\n\n(10) An authorized fiduciary may not exercise the decanting power if a settlor objects in a signed record delivered to the fiduciary within the notice period and: (A) The first trust and a second trust are both grantor trusts, in whole or in part, the first trust grants the settlor or another person the power to cause the first trust to cease to be a grantor trust, and the second trust does not grant an equivalent power to the settlor or other person; or (B) the first trust is a nongrantor trust and a second trust is a grantor trust, in whole or in part, with respect to the settlor, unless: (i) The settlor has the power at all times to cause the second trust to cease to be a grantor trust; or (ii) the first-trust instrument contains a provision granting the settlor or another person a power that would cause the first trust to cease to be a grantor trust and the second-trust instrument contains the same provision.\n\n(P.A. 24-104, S. 19.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 24-104 effective January 1, 2025.",
