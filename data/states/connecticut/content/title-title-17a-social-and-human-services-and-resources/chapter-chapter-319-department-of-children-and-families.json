Except as provided in subsection (i) of this section, the commissioner may terminate the admission of any child or youth voluntarily admitted to the department after (1) giving reasonable notice in writing to (A) the parent or guardian of any child or youth, and (B) the child, if such child is fourteen years of age or older, or youth, and (2) if the commissioner has previously petitioned the Probate Court pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, providing notice to the Probate Court of such petition. Any child or youth admitted voluntarily to the department may be placed in, or transferred to, any resource, facility or institution within the department or available to the commissioner, provided the commissioner shall give written notice to such child or youth and to the parent or guardian of the child of the commissioner's intention to make a transfer at least ten days prior to any actual transfer, unless written notice is waived by those entitled to receive it, or unless an emergency commitment of such child or youth is made pursuant to section 17a-502.

The Commissioner of Children and Families may continue to provide services to the child or youth in collaboration with the department to which the child or youth has been transferred or may terminate the voluntary services if, in the commissioner's discretion, the department to which the child or youth has been transferred provides adequate services. The commissioner shall provide written notice of his or her intention to terminate services following a transfer to another department to a child fourteen years of age or older, or youth, and to the parent or guardian of such child or youth.

A case service plan shall be required for all children and youths receiving services voluntarily from the department who are not in an out-of-home placement. A permanency plan shall be required for all children and youths voluntarily admitted to the department and placed by the department in a foster home licensed pursuant to section 17a-114 or a facility licensed pursuant to section 17a-145. Upon receipt of such petition, the court shall set a time and place for a hearing to be held within thirty days of receipt of the petition, unless continued by the court for cause shown. The court shall order notice of the hearing to be given by first class mail at least five days prior to the hearing to the Commissioner of Children and Families, and by first class mail at least five days prior to the hearing to the parents or guardian of the child or youth and the child, if such child is fourteen years of age or older, or youth. If the whereabouts of the parent or guardian are unknown, or if delivery cannot reasonably be effected, then notice shall be ordered to be given by publication. In making its determination as to whether there is an appropriate case service plan for a child or youth, the court shall consider the items specified in subdivision (2) of subsection (d) of this section. In making its determination as to whether there is an appropriate permanency plan for a child or youth, the court shall consider the items specified in subsection (f) of this section. The court shall possess continuing jurisdiction in proceedings under this section.\n\n(d) (1) If the child or youth is not in an out-of-home placement, the commissioner shall not be required to file periodic motions for review of the case service plan, provided the court shall conduct a hearing to review the case service plan on motion of the commissioner, a parent or guardian of the child or youth or a child fourteen years of age or older, or youth. The court may conduct a hearing on its own motion to review the case service plan for a child or youth who is not in an out-of-home placement if the court determines that imminent concerns regarding the health and safety of the child or youth require a hearing. The court shall provide notice of the time and place of the hearing on such motion to the commissioner, the parents or guardian of the child or youth and to the child, if such child is fourteen years of age or older, or youth, not later than ten days prior to the date of such hearing. In making its determination as to whether there is an appropriate case service plan, the court shall consider the items specified in subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n(2) At a hearing on a motion to review a case service plan for a child or youth who is not in an out-of-home placement, the court shall approve a case service plan that is in the best interests of the child or youth. The health and safety of the child or youth shall be of paramount concern in formulating such plan. At such hearing, the court shall consider among other things: (A) The appropriateness of the department's plan for service to the child or youth and his or her family; (B) the treatment and support services that have been offered and provided to the child or youth to strengthen the family; and (C) any further efforts which have been or will be made to promote the best interests of the child or youth. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court may: (i) Direct that the services being provided be continued if the court determines that continuation of the child or youth in services is in the child's or youth's best interests, or (ii) direct that the child's or youth's services be modified to reflect the child's or youth's best interest.\n\n(e) Ten months after admitting a child or youth on a voluntary basis and annually thereafter if the child or youth remains in the custody of the commissioner and remains placed (1) in a foster home licensed pursuant to section 17a-114, (2) in a foster home approved by a child-placing agency licensed pursuant to section 17a-149, or (3) in a facility licensed pursuant to section 17a-145, the commissioner shall file a motion for review of a permanency plan. A hearing on such motion shall be held not later than thirty days after the filing of such motion. Not later than ten days prior to the date of such hearing, the court shall provide notice to the commissioner, the parents or guardian of the child or youth and to the child, if such child is fourteen years of age or older, or youth, of the time and place of such hearing. In making its determination as to whether there is an appropriate permanency plan in place, the court shall consider the items specified in subsection (f) of this section.\n\n(f) (1) At a hearing to review a permanency plan for a child or youth who is placed in a foster home licensed pursuant to section 17a-114 or facility licensed pursuant to section 17a-145, the court shall approve a permanency plan that is in the best interests of the child or youth and takes into consideration the child's or youth's need for permanency. The health and safety of the child or youth shall be of paramount concern in formulating such plan. At such hearing, the court shall consider among other things: (A) The appropriateness of the department's plan for service to the child or youth and his or her family; (B) the treatment and support services that have been offered and provided to the child or youth to strengthen and reunite the family; (C) if return home is not likely for the child or youth, the efforts that have been made or should be made to evaluate and plan for other modes of care; and (D) any further efforts that have been or will be made to promote the best interests of the child or youth.\n\n(2) The permanency plan may include the goal of (A) placement of the child or youth with the parent or guardian, (B) transfer of guardianship, (C) termination of parental rights and adoption, or (D) for a youth, such other planned permanent living arrangement ordered by the court, provided the commissioner has documented a compelling reason why it would not be in the best interest of the youth for the permanency plan to include the goals in subparagraphs (A) to (C), inclusive, of this subdivision. Such other planned permanent living arrangement may include, but not be limited to, placement of a youth in an independent living program or long-term foster care with an identified foster parent.\n\n(3) At a hearing on a motion to review a permanency plan, the court shall review the status of the child or youth and the progress being made to implement the permanency plan, determine a timetable for attaining the permanency prescribed by the plan and determine whether the commissioner has made reasonable efforts to achieve the permanency plan. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court may: (A) Direct that the services being provided, or the placement of the child or youth and reunification efforts, be continued if the court, after hearing, determines that continuation of the child or youth in services or placement is in the child's or youth's best interests, or (B) direct that the child's or youth's services or placement be modified to reflect the child's or youth's best interest.\n\n(4) If the permanency plan for a youth includes the goal of such other planned permanent living arrangement pursuant to subparagraph (D) of subdivision (2) of this subsection, the department shall document for the court: (A) The manner and frequency of efforts made by the department to return the youth home or to secure placement for the youth with a fit and willing relative, legal guardian or adoptive parent; and (B) the steps the department has taken to ensure (i) the youth's foster family home or child care institution is following a reasonable and prudent parent standard, as defined in section 17a-114d; and (ii) the youth has regular opportunities to engage in age appropriate and developmentally appropriate activities, as defined in section 17a-114d.\n\n(5) If the permanency plan for a youth includes the goal of such other planned permanent living arrangement pursuant to subparagraph (D) of subdivision (2) of this subsection, the court shall (A) (i) ask the youth about his or her desired permanency outcome, or (ii) if the youth is unavailable to appear at a hearing held in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, require the attorney for the youth to consult with the youth regarding the youth's desired permanency outcome and report the same to the court; (B) make a judicial determination that, as of the date of hearing, such other planned permanent living arrangement is the best permanency plan for the youth; and (C) document the compelling reasons why it is not in the best interest of the youth to return home or to be placed with a fit and willing relative, legal guardian or adoptive parent.\n\n(g) The commissioner shall adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 concerning (1) applications for voluntary admission, (2) the grant or denial of services, (3) informal administrative case review, and (4) termination of voluntary admission.\n\n(h) Any person aggrieved by a decision of the commissioner denying voluntary services may appeal such decision through an administrative hearing held pursuant to chapter 54.\n\n(i) Any parent or guardian of a child or youth, or any child fourteen years of age or older, who is aggrieved by a termination of admission pursuant to subsection (b) of this section may (1) request an administrative hearing in accordance with the regulations adopted by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (g) of this section, or (2) request a hearing before the Probate Court. If, upon such hearing, the Probate Court finds that the termination of admission was made in accordance with the applicable regulations adopted by the commissioner, the court shall uphold such termination. If the court finds that the termination of admission was not made in accordance with the applicable regulations, the court may order the continuation of services and specify a time for the determination of a new case service or permanency plan.\n\n(j) Notwithstanding any provision of sections 17a-1 to 17a-26, inclusive, and 17a-28 to 17a-49, inclusive, any person already under the care and supervision of the Commissioner of Children and Families who has passed such person's eighteenth birthday but has not yet reached such person's twenty-first birthday may be permitted to remain voluntarily under the supervision of the commissioner, provided the commissioner, in the commissioner's discretion, determines that such person would benefit from further care and support from the Department of Children and Families.

Because defendant was over 18 and could not be “committed, admitted or transferred” to department's care and custody, requirement that department explore alternative of transfer to out-of-state institution did not apply to defendant and juvenile court properly declined to explore such alternative. 276 C. 633.\n\nAnnotations to present section:\n\nCited. 43 CA 613.\n\nSubsec.

The term “dangerous” did not render Subsec. unconstitutionally vague as applied to respondent who had been previously adjudicated delinquent for a physical assault; respondent was denied due process and entitled to a hearing before a judge, without the need for a jury, in a matter that could subject her to incarceration in an adult correctional facility; burden is on Department of Children and Families to adduce evidence re whether a transfer to Department of Correction is warranted by clear and convincing evidence that the juvenile subject to the transfer is a danger to himself or herself or others or cannot be safely held under supervision of Department of Children and Families, and some evidence must also be adduced that the transfer is in the juvenile's best interest. 157 CA 826.",

In the event that an application has previously been filed in another Probate Court with respect to the same confinement, no further action shall be taken on such previous application. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 45a-7, if the child is confined to a hospital outside the district of the Probate Court in which the application for the child's commitment was made, the probate judge from the district where the application was filed shall have jurisdiction to hold the hearing on such commitment at the hospital where such child is hospitalized. The court shall exercise jurisdiction only upon written application alleging that such child suffers from a mental disorder and is in need of treatment. Such application may be filed by any person, and shall include the name and address of the hospital for mental illness to which the child's commitment is being sought and shall include the name, address and telephone number of any attorney appointed for the child by the Superior Court pursuant to section 46b-129.\n\n(b) Any application for commitment of any child under sections 17a-75 to 17a-83, inclusive, shall be transferred from the Probate Court where it has been filed to the superior court of appropriate venue upon motion of any legal party except the petitioner.\n\n(c) The motion for such transfer shall be filed with the Probate Court prior to the beginning of any hearing on the merits.

The court hearing the matter shall further assign a place for hearing such application and shall cause reasonable notice thereof to be given to the child, his or her parents and the hospital for mental illness named in such application and to such relatives and others as it deems advisable. The notice shall inform the child (1) that he or she has a right to be present at the hearing; (2) that he or she has a right to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses testifying at any hearing upon such application; (3) that the court has appointed an attorney to represent him or her, and the name, address and telephone number of such attorney. Counsel appointed to represent such child shall also be appointed guardian ad litem for such child unless the court deems it appropriate to appoint a separate guardian ad litem. The fees for counsel appointed to represent the child shall be paid by the parents or guardian or the estate of such child. The notice to the child's parents or legal guardian shall inform them that (A) they have the right to be present at the hearing; (B) they have the right to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses testifying at the hearing upon such application; and (C) they may be represented by an attorney and if they cannot afford an attorney, that the court shall appoint an attorney to represent them. The notice to the hospital for mental illness of children shall inform such hospital of the time and place of the hearing, and request that if such hospital is unable to admit such child, it shall so inform the court immediately. Prior to such hearing, counsel for the child and counsel for the parents, respectively, in accordance with the provisions of section 52-146e, shall be afforded access to all records including, without limitation, hospital records if such child is hospitalized, and shall be entitled to take notes therefrom. If such child is hospitalized at the time of any hearing held under this section, the hospital shall make available at such hearing for use by the court or his or her counsel and by counsel for the parents all records in its possession relating to the child's need for hospitalization. The reasonable compensation of counsel appointed under the provisions of this section for persons who are indigent or otherwise unable to pay shall be established by, and paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department, however, if funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such purposes, such compensation shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund.\n\n(b) The court hearing the matter shall require a sworn certificate from at least two impartial physicians selected by the court, one of whom shall be a physician specializing in psychiatry. Both physicians shall be licensed to practice medicine in this state and shall have practiced medicine for at least one year. All appointments shall be made in accordance with procedures adopted by the Judicial Department. If such appointments have not already been made for a case transferred from the Probate Court under subsections (b) and (c) of section 17a-76, then such physicians shall be appointed as soon as reasonably possible by the superior court to which such matter has been transferred. Each physician shall make a report on a separate form adopted for such purpose by the Probate Court Administrator or the Superior Court. The certificates shall include a statement from each physician that he or she has personally examined such child within ten days of the hearing. The charges for such physicians shall be established by the Judicial Department and shall be paid in accordance with section 17a-82.\n\n(c) If the child refuses to be examined by the court appointed physicians as herein provided, the court may issue a warrant for the apprehension of the child and a police officer for the town in which such court is located or if there is no such police officer then the state police shall deliver the child to a general hospital where the child shall be examined by two physicians one of whom shall be a psychiatrist, in accordance with subsection (b) of this section. If, as a result of such examination, the child is committed under subsection (e) of this section, transportation of the child to any such hospital shall be in accordance with said subsection (e). If the child is not committed under subsection (e) of this section, he or she shall be released and the reports of such physicians shall be sent to the Court of Probate to satisfy the requirement of examination of two physicians under subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(d) The child shall be present at any hearing for his or her commitment under the provisions of this section, provided the court may exclude him or her from such portions of the hearing at which testimony is given which the court determines would be seriously detrimental to his or her emotional or mental condition. If the child is medicated at that time, a representative from the hospital shall inform the court of such fact and of the common effects of such medication. At the request of counsel for such child or if in the opinion of at least one physician the child could be a danger to himself or herself or others or it would be detrimental to the child's health and welfare to travel to the court facility hearing the application, then such hearing shall be held at the hospital in which the child is hospitalized. In that event, such hospital shall provide adequate facilities for such hearing. All interested parties shall have the right to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses who testify at any hearing on the application.\n\n(e) If, after such hearing, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the child suffers from a mental disorder, is in need of hospitalization for treatment, and such treatment is available, and such hospitalization is the least restrictive available alternative, it shall make an order for his or her commitment for a definite period not to exceed six months to a hospital for mental illness of children to be named in such order. Unless already hospitalized, such order shall direct some suitable person to convey the child to such hospital together with a copy of such order. In appointing a person to execute such order, the court shall give preference to a near relative or friend of the child, so far as it deems practicable and judicious. All costs for transportation shall be paid in accordance with section 17a-82. Such hospital shall release the child when it concludes that he or she is no longer in need of hospitalization.\n\n(f) Any child who has been committed by any court to a hospital for mental illness of children may be transferred to any other hospital for mental illness of children upon agreement of the superintendents of the respective institutions from and to which it is desired to make such transfer. Such agreement shall be in writing, executed in triplicate and in accordance with a form prescribed by the Attorney General, which form shall be uniform throughout the state. One copy of such agreement shall be filed for record in the court by which such person was committed and one copy retained in the files of each of the institutions participating in such transfer. Any such agreement shall have the same effect as an order of the court committing the person named in such order. No such transfer shall be made until the parent or representative of the child has received written notification. The parent of any child so transferred, or his or her next friend, may make application to the court which made the order of commitment, for a revocation or modification of such agreement, and such court shall order such notice of the time and place of hearing on such application as it finds reasonable and upon such hearing may revoke, modify or affirm such transfer. Such application shall act as a stay of any such order of transfer. Such hospital shall release the child when it concludes that he or she is no longer in need of hospitalization.\n\n(g) No later than ten days prior to the expiration of the period of commitment, or prior to the expiration of any period of recommitment under the provisions of sections 17a-75 to 17a-83, inclusive, an application for recommitment may be brought by any person to the court which heard the original application. Such application shall be brought in conformity with the provisions of this section and section 17a-76 and may result in a further commitment for a definite period not to exceed six months. In the event such an application is filed, the original commitment or recommitment order shall be extended for a sufficient time to hold a hearing under this section and section 17a-76, but in no event for more than twenty days beyond the expiration of the original commitment or recommitment. All fees and expenses incurred upon proceedings required by this section shall be payable as provided in section 17a-82.\n\n(P.A. 79-511, S. 3; P.A. 80-204; 80-269; P.A. 81-472, S. 35, 159; P.A. 83-295, S. 22; P.A. 89-326, S. 5, 7; P.A. 96-170, S. 2, 23; P.A. 97-90, S. 5, 6; P.A. 16-28, S. 24.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 80-204 inserted new Subsec.

The hearing may be requested at any time prior to the initiation of proceedings under section 17a-76. The hearing shall be held by the court of probate in the district in which the hospital is located. The hospital shall immediately notify such court of any request for a hearing by a child hospitalized under section 17a-79. At the conclusion of the hearing, unless the court finds that there is clear and convincing evidence to conclude that the child suffers from a mental disorder and is in need of hospitalization for treatment, that such treatment is available and that there is no less restrictive available alternative, the court shall order such child's release from the hospital, otherwise such hospitalization may continue in accordance with section 17a-79.
