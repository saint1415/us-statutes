The reasonable compensation for counsel provided to indigent respondents shall be established by, and paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department, however, if funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such purposes, such compensation shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund.\n\n(e) Unless the respondent is represented by counsel, the court shall immediately appoint an attorney to represent the respondent from a list of attorneys admitted to practice in this state provided by the Probate Court Administrator in accordance with regulations adopted by the Probate Court Administrator in accordance with section 45a-77.

The explanation shall include the results of a psychological assessment within the past year, an interview or observation of the respondent, and an evaluation of adaptive behavior. Such report shall include a statement of the respondent's needs. Duplicate copies of the report shall be filed with the Commissioner of Developmental Services, or the commissioner's designee, and all attorneys of record not less than five days prior to the date of the hearing. The court shall order the psychologist to appear for cross-examination at the request of the respondent if the respondent makes such request not less than three days prior to the date of the hearing.\n\n(g) If the court, after hearing, finds there is clear and convincing evidence that the respondent has intellectual disability and meets the criteria set out in subsection (a) of this section, the court shall order the respondent placed with the Department of Developmental Services for placement in the least restrictive environment available or which can be created within existing resources of the department.\n\n(h) If, after hearing, the court determines that the respondent's need for placement is so critical as to require immediate placement, the court shall order the respondent to be temporarily placed in the most appropriate available placement.

The report shall contain the name and address of the person believed to have intellectual disability and be in need of immediate care and treatment, and such person's family, legal representative or other person responsible for such person's care, and all evidence forming the basis for such belief and shall be signed and dated by the person making such report. The Commissioner of Developmental Services, or the commissioner's designee, shall promptly determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the person named in the report has intellectual disability and is in need of immediate care and treatment, which care and treatment is not being provided by such person's family, legal representative or other person responsible for such person's care and if the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, so determines, shall assume the care and custody of such person. The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall, within twenty-four hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, after assuming the care and custody of such person, file a petition pursuant to subsection (b) of this section in the Probate Court for the district in which such person resided prior to emergency placement.
