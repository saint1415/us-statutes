The person whose consent is required shall be informed of the nature and consequences of the particular medical treatment or surgical procedure, the reasonable risks, benefits and purpose of such medical treatment or surgical procedure and any alternative medical treatment or surgical procedure which is available. The consent of any person or of any parent or legal representative of any person may be withdrawn at any time prior to the commencement of the medical treatment or surgical procedure. The regional or training school director having custody and control of a person living in a residential facility may authorize necessary medical treatment or surgical procedure for such person where, in the opinion of the person's attending physician, the medical treatment or surgical procedure is of an emergency nature and there is insufficient time to obtain the required written consent provided for in this section. The attending physician shall prepare a report describing the nature of the emergency which necessitated such medical treatment or surgical procedure and shall file a copy of such report in the patient's record.\n\n(g) The commissioner's oversight and monitoring of the medical care of persons placed or treated under the direction of the commissioner does not include the authority to make treatment decisions, except in limited circumstances in accordance with statutory procedures. In the exercise of such oversight and monitoring responsibilities, the commissioner shall not impede or seek to impede a properly executed medical order to withhold cardiopulmonary resuscitation. For purposes of this subsection, “properly executed medical order to withhold cardiopulmonary resuscitation” (1) means (A) a written order by the attending physician or advanced practice registered nurse; (B) in consultation and with the consent of the patient or a person authorized by law; (C) when the attending physician or advanced practice registered nurse is of the opinion that the patient is in a terminal condition, as defined in section 19a-570; and (D) when such physician or advanced practice registered nurse has requested and obtained a second opinion from a Connecticut licensed physician or advanced practice registered nurse in the appropriate specialty that confirms the patient's terminal condition; and (2) includes the entry of such an order when the attending physician or advanced practice registered nurse (A) is of the opinion that the patient is in the final stage of a terminal condition but cannot state that the patient may be expected to expire during the next several days or weeks, or (B) in consultation with a physician qualified to make a neurological diagnosis, deems the patient to be permanently unconscious, provided the commissioner has reviewed the decision with the department's director of health and clinical services, or such director's designee, the legal representative of the patient and others whom the commissioner deems appropriate, and determines that the order is a medically acceptable decision. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to individuals with a legally valid advance directive.\n\n(h) Any person applying for services from the Commissioner of Developmental Services or any person placed by a Probate Court under the direction of the Commissioner of Developmental Services, and such person's legal representative, shall be informed orally and in writing at the time of application or placement of the rights guaranteed by this section.
