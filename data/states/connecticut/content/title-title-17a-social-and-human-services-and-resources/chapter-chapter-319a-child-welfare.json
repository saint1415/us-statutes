(b) by deleting provision re person who in good faith does not make report re child abuse or neglect being immune from civil or criminal liability, designating existing provision re making report of child abuse or neglect as Subdiv. (1), adding Subdiv. (2) re immunity from civil or criminal liability when providing professional medical intervention or assistance in proceeding involving child abuse or neglect, replacing “be incurred or imposed” with “arise from or be related to the actions taken pursuant to this subsection” and by adding provision re immunity from civil or criminal liability only extends to action done pursuant to subsection and not to malpractice of a medical professional that results in personal injury or death, effective July 1, 2018, and applicable to any civil action pending on or filed on or after said date; P.A. 24-41 amended Subsec.

      "text": "(a) Upon receiving a report of child abuse or neglect, as provided in sections 17a-101a to 17a-101c, inclusive, or section 17a-103, in which the alleged perpetrator is (1) a person responsible for such child's health, welfare or care, (2) a person given access to such child by such responsible person, or (3) a person entrusted with the care of a child, the Commissioner of Children and Families, or the commissioner's designee, shall cause the report to be classified and evaluated immediately. If the report contains sufficient information to warrant an investigation, the commissioner shall make the commissioner's best efforts to commence an investigation of a report concerning an imminent risk of physical harm to a child or other emergency within two hours of receipt of the report and shall commence an investigation of all other reports within seventy-two hours of receipt of the report. A report classified by the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, as lower risk may be referred for family assessment and services pursuant to subsection (g) of this section. Any such report may thereafter be referred for standard child protective services if safety concerns for the child become evident. A report referred for standard child protective services may be referred for family assessment and services at any time if the department determines there is a lower risk to the child. If the alleged perpetrator is a school employee, as defined in section 53a-65, or is employed by an institution or facility licensed or approved by the state to provide care for children, the department shall notify the Department of Education or the state agency that has issued such license or approval to the institution or facility of the report and the commencement of an investigation by the Commissioner of Children and Families. The department shall complete any such investigation not later than thirty-three business days after the date of receipt of the report. If the report is a report of child abuse or neglect in which the alleged perpetrator is not a person specified in subdivision (1), (2) or (3) of this subsection, the Commissioner of Children and Families shall refer the report to the appropriate local law enforcement authority for the town in which the child resides or in which the alleged abuse or neglect occurred.\n\n(b) The Commissioner of Children and Families shall establish protocols for the investigation of and response to reports of child abuse or neglect of children from birth to three years of age. Such protocols shall include, but need not be limited to, (1) appropriate supervision of the case, (2) appropriate visitation by department personnel to such children, (3) documentation of case activities relevant to the safety and well-being of such children, and (4) a case supervision tool specific to the unique needs and risk status of children from birth to three years of age. All investigations of a report of child abuse or neglect pursuant to this section shall include a home visit at which the child and any siblings are observed, if appropriate, a determination of the nature, extent and cause or causes of the reported abuse or neglect, a determination of the person or persons suspected to be responsible for such abuse or neglect, the name, age and condition of other children residing in the same household and an evaluation of the parents and the home. The report of such investigation shall be in writing. The investigation shall also include, but not be limited to, a review of criminal conviction information concerning the person or persons alleged to be responsible for such abuse or neglect and previous allegations of abuse or neglect relating to the child or other children residing in the household or relating to family violence. After an investigation into a report of abuse or neglect has been completed, the commissioner shall determine, based upon a standard of reasonable cause, whether a child has been abused or neglected, as defined in section 46b-120. If the commissioner determines that abuse or neglect has occurred, the commissioner shall also determine whether: (A) There is an identifiable person responsible for such abuse or neglect; and (B) such identifiable person poses a risk to the health, safety or well-being of children and should be recommended by the commissioner for placement on the child abuse and neglect registry established pursuant to section 17a-101k. If the commissioner has made the determinations in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this subsection, the commissioner shall issue notice of a recommended finding to the person suspected to be responsible for such abuse or neglect in accordance with section 17a-101k. If the child is represented by an attorney or guardian ad litem, the commissioner shall notify the child's attorney or guardian ad litem in writing not less than five days prior to the date of any meeting in which the department is considering removing the child from the household, except, if the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, has authorized the immediate removal of a child from his or her household pursuant to the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall not be required to provide advance written notice of such removal to the child's attorney or guardian ad litem.\n\n(c) Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, no entry of the recommended finding shall be made on the child abuse or neglect registry and no information concerning the finding shall be disclosed by the commissioner pursuant to a check of the child abuse or neglect registry or request for information by a public or private entity for employment, licensure, or reimbursement for child care purposes pursuant to programs administered by the Department of Social Services or pursuant to any other general statute that requires a check of the child abuse or neglect registry until the exhaustion or waiver of all administrative appeals available to the person suspected to be responsible for the abuse or neglect, as provided in section 17a-101k.\n\n(d) If the child abuse or neglect resulted in or involves (1) the death of a child; (2) the risk of serious physical injury or emotional harm of a child; (3) the serious physical harm of a child; (4) the arrest of a person due to abuse or neglect of a child; (5) a petition filed by the commissioner pursuant to section 17a-112 or 46b-129; or (6) sexual abuse of a child, entry of the recommended finding may be made on the child abuse or neglect registry and information concerning the finding may be disclosed by the commissioner pursuant to a check of the child abuse or neglect registry or request for information by a public or private entity for employment, licensure, or reimbursement for child care purposes pursuant to programs administered by the Department of Social Services or pursuant to any other general statute that requires a check of the child abuse or neglect registry, prior to the exhaustion or waiver of all administrative appeals available to the person suspected to be responsible for the abuse or neglect as provided in section 17a-101k.\n\n(e) If the Commissioner of Children and Families, or the commissioner's designee, has probable cause to believe that the child or any other child in the household is in imminent risk of physical harm from the child's surroundings and that immediate removal from such surroundings is necessary to ensure the child's safety, the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall authorize any employee of the department or any law enforcement officer to remove the child and any other child similarly situated from such surroundings without the consent of the child's parent or guardian. The commissioner shall record in writing the reasons for such removal and include such record with the report of the investigation conducted under subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(f) The removal of a child pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall not exceed ninety-six hours. During the period of such removal, the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall provide the child with all necessary care, including medical care, which may include an examination by a physician or mental health professional with or without the consent of the child's parents, guardian or other person responsible for the child's care, provided reasonable attempts have been made to obtain consent of the child's parents or guardian or other person responsible for the care of such child. During the course of a medical examination, a physician may perform diagnostic tests and procedures necessary for the detection of child abuse or neglect. If the child is not returned home within such ninety-six-hour period, with or without protective services, the department shall proceed in accordance with section 46b-129.\n\n(g) (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) to (f), inclusive, of this section, the commissioner may establish a program of family assessment response to reports of child abuse and neglect whereby the report may be referred to appropriate community providers for family assessment and services without an investigation or at any time during an investigation, provided there has been an initial safety assessment of the circumstances of a family and child and criminal background checks have been performed on all adults involved in the report. Services provided through family assessment response shall include an array of community-based services and supports designed to meet the individual needs of families, build upon their strengths, enhance child development, reduce child abuse and neglect and increase the health, safety and well-being of children.\n\n(2) In response to an accepted family assessment report, the department shall conduct a comprehensive family assessment that shall include a safety and risk assessment and an assessment of family strengths and needs. Such assessment shall include personal interviews with the child and the child's parent or primary caretaker, an evaluation of the home environment and the performance of criminal background checks on all adults residing in the same household. Such assessment may include, as appropriate, personal interviews with other children or adults residing in the same household as well as any other caregivers, family members and collateral contacts. In conducting such assessment, the department shall consider the age and vulnerability of the child, family functioning, family history of abuse and neglect and family history of involvement with the department. The department shall, upon securing any necessary releases, request any relevant out-of-state history of child abuse or neglect involving any adults residing in the same household.\n\n(3) The following reports of suspected child abuse or neglect shall not be referred for family assessment response: (A) Sexual abuse, (B) abuse or neglect occurring in an out-of-home placement, (C) abuse or neglect resulting in the death or serious physical or mental injury of a child, or (D) where the department's safety assessment reveals that the child is unsafe. A case supervisor or manager shall approve all referrals to family assessment response.\n\n(4) Prior to referring a report to an appropriate community provider, the department shall develop a service plan designed to meet the family's immediate needs for services and supports and to guide the community provider's development of a long-term plan of care for the family.\n\n(5) Following a referral pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection, a community provider shall schedule an in-person meeting with the family and shall develop a plan of care. Such plan of care shall be developed in consultation with the family and shall include (A) a review of the department's family assessment and service plan and any services and supports the family is currently receiving, and (B) an identification of the family's ongoing needs and the services and supports that may be available to meet such needs. Such plan of care shall identify the family's strengths and needs and describe the services and supports to be offered to (i) address the family's needs, (ii) build upon the family's strengths, and (iii) increase the health, safety and well-being of the child. The provider shall monitor the family's participation and progress with the plan of care.\n\n(6) The community provider shall maintain ongoing contact with the family through in-person meetings, visits to the home, child and family team meetings and phone calls. If at any time following the referral or during the implementation of the plan of care, the provider has reasonable cause to suspect or believe that any child under eighteen years of age (A) has been abused or neglected, as defined in section 46b-120, (B) has suffered a nonaccidental physical injury or an injury that is at variance with the history given for such injury, or (C) is placed at imminent risk of serious harm, the provider shall report or cause a report to be made in accordance with the provisions of sections 17a-101b to 17a-101d, inclusive.\n\n(7) The community provider shall schedule an in-person meeting with the family prior to the end of services. The determination to end services shall be based upon the family's preference and progress in meeting the goals outlined in the plan of care. The community provider shall submit individual child and family specific data and administrative service data to the department not later than thirty days after ending services. Such data shall identify the needs of the family, the services and supports made available to address those needs, the family's met and unmet treatment goals, the final disposition at the time of ending services and the reasons for the family's discharge from services, including, but not limited to, met treatment goals, family relocation, the receipt of a new report by the department or transfer of the family to another provider.\n\n(8) Subdivisions (5) to (7), inclusive, of this subsection shall apply to all community provider service contracts in effect on June 9, 2016, to the extent they are not in conflict with such contracts, and shall apply to all contracts entered into, amended, extended or renewed on or after June 9, 2016.\n\n(9) The commissioner shall adopt procedures to establish a method for the department to monitor the progress of the child and family referred to a community provider pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection and to set standards for reopening an investigation pursuant to this section. Such standards shall include, but need not be limited to, provisions for the reassignment of a report referred for family assessment response for an immediate investigation based on (A) a reassessment of the initial report of child abuse or neglect or the discovery of new or additional facts indicating that the child is unsafe, or (B) a determination that the report meets the criteria of subdivision (3) of this subsection and, as a result, does not qualify for family assessment response. Not later than January 1, 2017, the commissioner shall submit a report regarding such procedures and standards, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a, to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to children.\n\n(10) Consistent with the provisions of section 17a-28, the department shall disclose all relevant information in its possession concerning the child and family, including prior child protection activity, to each provider to whom a report has been referred for use by the provider in the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of unique needs of the family and the prevention of future reports. Each provider who has received a report of child abuse or neglect referred pursuant to this subsection shall disclose to the department, consistent with the provisions of section 17a-28, all relevant information gathered during assessment, diagnosis and treatment of the child and family. The department may use such information solely to monitor and ensure the continued safety and well-being of the child or children.\n\n(11) Not later than July 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, the department shall submit a report, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a, to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to children for inclusion in the annual report card prepared pursuant to section 2-53m on the status of family assessment response. Such report shall include data from the previous calendar year, including, but not limited to: (A) The number of accepted reports of child abuse or neglect, and the percentage of reports assigned to the family assessment response track; (B) the disposition of families assigned a family assessment response; (C) for cases assigned to the family assessment response track, a breakdown by reporter type; (D) the number and percentage of family assessment response cases that changed track to investigations; (E) an analysis of the department's prior or subsequent involvement with a family that has been assigned to family assessment response, if applicable; (F) an analysis of the department's prior or subsequent involvement with a family that has been assigned to a community partner agency; (G) a description of services that are commonly provided to families referred to the community support for families program; (H) a description of the department's staff development and training practices relating to intake; (I) the number and percentage of referred families who were ultimately enrolled in the community support for families program; (J) the number and percentage of families receiving a family assessment response broken down by race and ethnicity; (K) the reason for discharge from the community support for families program, as identified in subdivision (7) of this subsection, broken down by race and ethnicity; (L) a comparison of the needs identified and the needs addressed for families referred to the community support for families program; and (M) an analysis of the efficacy of the department's risk and safety assessment practices, including information concerning the methodology used to determine the reliability of such practices, the utilization of evidence-based practices and tools, and the effectiveness of such assessment practices for identifying children at risk for abuse or neglect.\n\n(P.A. 96-246, S. 9; P.A. 97-319, S. 13, 22; P.A. 02-138, S. 15; P.A. 05-35, S. 1; 05-207, S. 2; P.A. 11-93, S. 16; 11-240, S. 1; P.A. 13-54, S. 1; P.A. 14-187, S. 17; P.A. 16-190, S. 1; P.A. 17-92, S. 1; P.A. 18-71, S. 1; 18-186, S. 4; P.A. 19-120, S. 2.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 97-319 amended Subsec.

      "text": "(a) The Commissioner of Children and Families shall make reasonable efforts to reunify a parent with a child unless the court (1) determines that such efforts are not required pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or subsection (j) of section 17a-112, or (2) has approved a permanency plan other than reunification pursuant to subsection (k) of section 46b-129.\n\n(b) The Commissioner of Children and Families or any other party may, at any time, file a motion with the court for a determination that reasonable efforts to reunify the parent with the child are not required. The court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on the motion not later than thirty days after the filing of the motion or may consolidate the hearing with a trial on a petition to terminate parental rights pursuant to section 17a-112. The court may determine that such efforts are not required if the court finds upon clear and convincing evidence that: (1) The parent has subjected the child to the following aggravated circumstances: (A) The child has been abandoned, as defined in subsection (j) of section 17a-112; or (B) the parent has inflicted or knowingly permitted another person to inflict sexual molestation or exploitation or severe physical abuse on the child or engaged in a pattern of abuse of the child; (2) the parent has killed, through deliberate, nonaccidental act, another child of the parent or a sibling of the child, or has requested, commanded, importuned, attempted, conspired or solicited to commit or knowingly permitted another person to commit the killing of the child, another child of the parent or sibling of the child, or has committed or knowingly permitted another person to commit an assault, through deliberate, nonaccidental act, that resulted in serious bodily injury of the child, another child of the parent or a sibling of the child; (3) the parental rights of the parent to a sibling have been terminated within three years of the filing of a petition pursuant to this section, provided the commissioner has made reasonable efforts to reunify the parent with the child during a period of at least ninety days; (4) the parent was convicted by a court of competent jurisdiction of sexual assault, except a conviction of a violation of section 53a-71 or 53a-73a resulting in the conception of the child; or (5) the child was placed in the care and control of the commissioner pursuant to the provisions of sections 17a-57 to 17a-60, inclusive, and section 17a-61.\n\n(c) If the court determines that such efforts are not required, the court shall, at such hearing or at a hearing held not later than thirty days after such determination, approve a permanency plan for such child. The plan may include (1) adoption and a requirement that the commissioner file a petition to terminate parental rights, (2) transfer of guardianship, or (3) for a child sixteen years of age or older, such other planned permanent living arrangement as may be ordered by the court, provided the commissioner has documented a compelling reason why it would not be in the best interests of the child for the permanency plan to include one of the options set forth in subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection. The child's health and safety shall be of paramount concern in formulating such plan. If the permanency plan for a child sixteen years of age or older includes such other planned permanent living arrangement pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection, the provisions of subdivisions (3) to (5), inclusive, of subsection (k) of section 46b-129 shall be applicable.\n\n(d) If the court determines that reasonable efforts to reunify the parent with the child are not required, the Department of Children and Families shall use its best efforts to maintain the child in the initial out-of-home placement, provided the department determines that such placement is in the best interests of the child, until such time as a permanent home for the child is found or the child is placed for adoption. If the permanency plan calls for placing the child for adoption or in some other permanent home, good faith efforts shall be made to place the child for adoption or in some other permanent home.\n\n(P.A. 98-241, S. 7, 18; P.A. 00-137, S. 14; P.A. 01-142, S. 3; P.A. 06-102, S. 6; P.A. 15-51, S. 2; 15-199, S. 2; 15-242, S. 48.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 98-241 effective July 1, 1998; P.A. 00-137 amended Subsec. (a)(1)(A) to change reference from Sec. 17a-112 (c) to Sec. 17a-112 (j); P.A. 01-142 amended Subsec. (a) by permitting “any other party” to petition court for determination, requiring court to hold evidentiary hearing on petition within 30 days of filing of petition, requiring standard for court to determine that efforts to reunify parent with child are not appropriate to be upon clear and convincing evidence, adding “another child of the parent or” before “a sibling of the child”, and adding Subdiv. (5) re placement of child in care and control of commissioner pursuant to Secs. 17a-57 to 17a-61, inclusive; P.A. 06-102 inserted new Subsec. (a) re commissioner's duty to make reasonable efforts to reunify a parent with a child unless a court approves a permanency plan to the contrary or determines efforts are not required, redesignated existing Subsecs. (a) and (b) as Subsecs. (b) and (c), amended Subsec. (b) to substitute the filing of a motion for a petition and insert provisions re consolidated hearings, amended Subsecs. (b)(1)(B) and (b)(2) to insert “or knowingly permitted another person to inflict”, amended Subsec. (b)(3) to delete “involuntarily” re termination of parental rights to a sibling, amended Subsec. (c) to insert Subdiv. designators and rewrite provisions re adoption, amended Subsec. (c)(2) to permit long-term foster care with a licensed or certified relative and delete independent living as a placement option, inserted new Subsec. (c)(4) re other planned living arrangement as may be ordered by the court, added new Subsec. (d) re duties of department if the court determines that reasonable efforts to reunify the parent and child are not required, and made technical changes and substituted “required” for “appropriate” re reunification efforts throughout; P.A. 15-51 amended Subsec. (c)(2) by deleting “or certified as a relative caregiver”; P.A. 15-199 amended Subsec. (c) by deleting former Subdiv. (2) re long-term foster care with a relative, redesignating existing Subdiv. (3) re transfer of guardianship as Subdiv. (2), redesignating existing Subdiv. (4) as Subdiv. (3) and amending same to add reference to child age 16 or older, adding provision re permanency plan for child age 16 or older, and making a conforming change, effective July 1, 2015; P.A. 15-242 amended Subsec. (b) by replacing “17a-61, inclusive,” with “17a-60, inclusive, and section 17a-61”, effective July 1, 2015.\n\nFinding of reunification efforts not required under this section and Sec. 17a-112(j)(1) is an independent basis on which to terminate parental rights. 322 C. 231. The department is required to make reasonable efforts to reunify a child with one parent and, if reunification is accomplished with one parent, further reunification efforts are not required. 325 C. 833.\n\nThe department's duty to make reasonable efforts to reunify the parent with the child arises only when the parent has a reasonable prospect for overcoming the particular statutory ground for termination and, thereafter, reassuming a responsible parental role in the child's life; in assessing the department's efforts to reunify a parent with a child, an important factor to be considered is the degree to which the department complied with all applicable court orders issued for that purpose. 170 CA 833. Plain language of section requires department to make reasonable efforts to reunify the parent with the child unless certain specific conditions are met; where none of the exceptions to the statutory mandate of section apply, the court did not have authority to order that the department cease reunification efforts and Sec. 46b-121(b)(1) does not grant such authority. 221 CA 59.",

      "heading": "(Formerly Sec. 17-43a). - Termination of parental rights of child committed to commissioner",
      "text": "(a) In respect to any child in the custody of the Commissioner of Children and Families in accordance with section 46b-129, either the commissioner, or the attorney who represented such child in a pending or prior proceeding, or an attorney appointed by the Superior Court on its own motion, or an attorney retained by such child after attaining the age of fourteen, may petition the court for the termination of parental rights with reference to such child. The petition shall be in the form and contain the information set forth in subsection (b) of section 45a-715, and be subject to the provisions of subsection (c) of said section. If a petition indicates that either or both parents consent to the termination of their parental rights, or if at any time following the filing of a petition and before the entry of a decree, a parent consents to the termination of the parent's parental rights, each consenting parent shall acknowledge such consent on a form promulgated by the Office of the Chief Court Administrator evidencing that the parent has voluntarily and knowingly consented to the termination of such parental rights. No consent to termination by a mother shall be executed within forty-eight hours immediately after the birth of such mother's child. A parent who is a minor shall have the right to consent to termination of parental rights and such consent shall not be voidable by reason of such minority. A guardian ad litem shall be appointed by the court to assure that such minor parent is giving an informed and voluntary consent.\n\n(b) Either or both birth parents and an intended adoptive parent may enter into a cooperative postadoption agreement regarding communication or contact between either or both birth parents and the adopted child. Such an agreement may be entered into if: (1) The child is in the custody of the Department of Children and Families; (2) an order terminating parental rights has not yet been entered; and (3) either or both birth parents agree to a voluntary termination of parental rights, including an agreement in a case which began as an involuntary termination of parental rights. The postadoption agreement shall be applicable only to a birth parent who is a party to the agreement. Such agreement shall be in addition to those under common law. Counsel for the child and any guardian ad litem for the child may be heard on the proposed cooperative postadoption agreement. There shall be no presumption of communication or contact between the birth parents and an intended adoptive parent in the absence of a cooperative postadoption agreement.\n\n(c) If the Superior Court determines that the child's best interests will be served by postadoption communication or contact with either or both birth parents, the court shall so order, stating the nature and frequency of the communication or contact. A court may grant postadoption communication or contact privileges if: (1) Each intended adoptive parent consents to the granting of communication or contact privileges; (2) the intended adoptive parent and either or both birth parents execute a cooperative agreement and file the agreement with the court; (3) consent to postadoption communication or contact is obtained from the child, if the child is at least twelve years of age; and (4) the cooperative postadoption agreement is approved by the court.\n\n(d) A cooperative postadoption agreement shall contain the following: (1) An acknowledgment by either or both birth parents that the termination of parental rights and the adoption is irrevocable, even if the adoptive parents do not abide by the cooperative postadoption agreement; and (2) an acknowledgment by the adoptive parents that the agreement grants either or both birth parents the right to seek to enforce the cooperative postadoption agreement.\n\n(e) The terms of a cooperative postadoption agreement may include the following: (1) Provision for communication between the child and either or both birth parents; (2) provision for future contact between either or both birth parents and the child or an adoptive parent; and (3) maintenance of medical history of either or both birth parents who are parties to the agreement.\n\n(f) The order approving a cooperative postadoption agreement shall be made part of the final order terminating parental rights. The finality of the termination of parental rights and of the adoption shall not be affected by implementation of the provisions of the postadoption agreement. Such an agreement shall not affect the ability of the adoptive parents and the child to change their residence within or outside this state.\n\n(g) A disagreement between the parties or litigation brought to enforce or modify the agreement shall not affect the validity of the termination of parental rights or the adoption and shall not serve as a basis for orders affecting the custody of the child. The court shall not act on a petition to change or enforce the agreement unless the petitioner had participated, or attempted to participate, in good faith in mediation or other appropriate dispute resolution proceedings to resolve the dispute and allocate any cost for such mediation or dispute resolution proceedings.\n\n(h) An adoptive parent, guardian ad litem for the child or the court, on its own motion, may, at any time, petition for review of any order entered pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, if the petitioner alleges that such action would be in the best interests of the child. The court may modify or terminate such orders as the court deems to be in the best interest of the adopted child.\n\n(i) The Superior Court upon hearing and notice, as provided in sections 45a-716 and 45a-717, may grant a petition for termination of parental rights based on consent filed pursuant to this section if it finds that (1) upon clear and convincing evidence, the termination is in the best interest of the child, and (2) such parent has voluntarily and knowingly consented to termination of the parent's parental rights with respect to such child. If the court denies a petition for termination of parental rights based on consent, it may refer the matter to an agency to assess the needs of the child, the care the child is receiving and the plan of the parent for the child. Consent for the termination of the parental rights of one parent does not diminish the parental rights of the other parent of the child, nor does it relieve the other parent of the duty to support the child.\n\n(j) The Superior Court, upon notice and hearing as provided in sections 45a-716 and 45a-717, may grant a petition filed pursuant to this section if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that (1) the Department of Children and Families has made reasonable efforts to locate the parent and to reunify the child with the parent in accordance with subsection (a) of section 17a-111b, unless the court finds in this proceeding that the parent is unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts, except that such finding is not required if the court has determined at a hearing pursuant to section 17a-111b, or determines at trial on the petition, that such efforts are not required, (2) termination is in the best interest of the child, and (3) (A) the child has been abandoned by the parent in the sense that the parent has failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest, concern or responsibility as to the welfare of the child; (B) the child (i) has been found by the Superior Court or the Probate Court to have been neglected, abused or uncared for in a prior proceeding, or (ii) is found to be neglected, abused or uncared for and has been in the custody of the commissioner for at least fifteen months and the parent of such child has been provided specific steps to take to facilitate the return of the child to the parent pursuant to section 46b-129 and has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child; (C) the child has been denied, by reason of an act or acts of parental commission or omission including, but not limited to, sexual molestation or exploitation, severe physical abuse or a pattern of abuse, the care, guidance or control necessary for the child's physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being, except that nonaccidental or inadequately explained serious physical injury to a child shall constitute prima facie evidence of acts of parental commission or omission sufficient for the termination of parental rights; (D) there is no ongoing parent-child relationship, which means the relationship that ordinarily develops as a result of a parent having met on a day-to-day basis the physical, emotional, moral and educational needs of the child and to allow further time for the establishment or reestablishment of such parent-child relationship would be detrimental to the best interest of the child; (E) the parent of a child under the age of seven years who is neglected, abused or uncared for, has failed, is unable or is unwilling to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable period of time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child and such parent's parental rights of another child were previously terminated pursuant to a petition filed by the Commissioner of Children and Families; (F) the parent has killed through deliberate, nonaccidental act another child of the parent or has requested, commanded, importuned, attempted, conspired or solicited such killing or has committed an assault, through deliberate, nonaccidental act that resulted in serious bodily injury of another child of the parent; or (G) the parent committed an act that constitutes sexual assault as described in section 53a-70, 53a-70a, 53a-70c, 53a-71, 53a-72a, 53a-72b or 53a-73a or compelling a spouse or cohabitor to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force or by the threat of the use of force as described in section 53a-70b of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2019, if such act resulted in the conception of the child.\n\n(k) Except in the case where termination of parental rights is based on consent, in determining whether to terminate parental rights under this section, the court shall consider and shall make written findings regarding: (1) The timeliness, nature and extent of services offered, provided and made available to the parent and the child by an agency to facilitate the reunion of the child with the parent; (2) whether the Department of Children and Families has made reasonable efforts to reunite the family pursuant to the federal Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, as amended from time to time; (3) the terms of any applicable court order entered into and agreed upon by any individual or agency and the parent, and the extent to which all parties have fulfilled their obligations under such order; (4) the feelings and emotional ties of the child with respect to the child's parents, any guardian of such child's person and any person who has exercised physical care, custody or control of the child for at least one year and with whom the child has developed significant emotional ties; (5) the age of the child; (6) the efforts the parent has made to adjust such parent's circumstances, conduct, or conditions to make it in the best interest of the child to return such child home in the foreseeable future, including, but not limited to, (A) the extent to which the parent has maintained contact with the child as part of an effort to reunite the child with the parent, provided the court may give weight to incidental visitations, communications or contributions, and (B) the maintenance of regular contact or communication with the guardian or other custodian of the child; and (7) the extent to which a parent has been prevented from maintaining a meaningful relationship with the child by the unreasonable act or conduct of the other parent of the child, or the unreasonable act of any other person or by the economic circumstances of the parent.\n\n(l) Any petition brought by the Commissioner of Children and Families to the Superior Court, pursuant to subsection (a) of section 46b-129, may be accompanied by or, upon motion by the petitioner, consolidated with a petition for termination of parental rights filed in accordance with this section with respect to such child. Notice of the hearing on such petitions shall be given in accordance with sections 45a-716 and 45a-717. The Superior Court, after hearing, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (i) or (j) of this section, may, in lieu of granting the petition filed pursuant to section 46b-129, grant the petition for termination of parental rights as provided in section 45a-717.\n\n(m) Nothing contained in this section and sections 17a-113, 45a-187, 45a-606, 45a-607, 45a-707 to 45a-709, inclusive, 45a-715 to 45a-718, inclusive, 45a-724, 45a-725, 45a-727, 45a-733, 45a-754 and 52-231a shall negate the right of the Commissioner of Children and Families to subsequently petition the Superior Court for revocation of a commitment of a child as to whom parental rights have been terminated in accordance with the provisions of this section. The Superior Court may appoint a statutory parent at any time after it has terminated parental rights if the petitioner so requests.\n\n(n) If the parental rights of only one parent are terminated, the remaining parent shall be the sole parent and, unless otherwise provided by law, guardian of the person.\n\n(o) In the case where termination of parental rights is granted, the guardian of the person or statutory parent shall report to the court not later than thirty days after the date judgment is entered on a case plan, as defined by the federal Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, as amended from time to time, for the child which shall include measurable objectives and time schedules. At least every three months thereafter, such guardian or statutory parent shall make a report to the court on the progress made on implementation of the plan. The court may convene a hearing upon the filing of a report and shall convene and conduct a permanency hearing pursuant to subsection (k) of section 46b-129 for the purpose of reviewing the permanency plan for the child not more than twelve months from the date judgment is entered or from the date of the last permanency hearing held pursuant to subsection (k) of section 46b-129, whichever is earlier, and at least once a year thereafter while the child remains in the custody of the Commissioner of Children and Families. For children where the commissioner has determined that adoption is appropriate, the report on the implementation of the plan shall include a description of the reasonable efforts the department is taking to promote and expedite the adoptive placement and to finalize the adoption of the child, including documentation of child specific recruitment efforts. At such hearing, the court shall determine whether the department has made reasonable efforts to achieve the permanency plan. If the court determines that the department has not made reasonable efforts to place a child in an adoptive placement or that reasonable efforts have not resulted in the placement of the child, the court may order the Department of Children and Families, within available appropriations, to contract with a child-placing agency to arrange for the adoption of the child. The department, as statutory parent, shall continue to provide care and services for the child while a child-placing agency is arranging for the adoption of the child.\n\n(p) The provisions of section 17a-152, regarding placement of a child from another state, and the provisions of section 17a-175, regarding the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, shall apply to placements pursuant to this section.\n\n(q) The provisions of this section shall be liberally construed in the best interests of any child for whom a petition under this section has been filed.\n\n(1959, P.A. 184, S. 1; February, 1965, P.A. 488, S. 9; P.A. 73-156, S. 4; P.A. 74-164, S. 3, 20; P.A. 75-420, S. 4, 6; P.A. 76-226; 76-436, S. 589, 681; P.A. 77-452, S. 7, 72; P.A. 82-202, S. 1; P.A. 83-355, S. 2; 83-387, S. 1; 83-478, S. 1; P.A. 84-449, S. 1, 7; P.A. 87-555, S. 1; P.A. 93-91, S. 1, 2; 93-193, S. 1; P.A. 94-81, S. 1; P.A. 95-238, S. 3; P.A. 96-130, S. 39; 96-246, S. 18; P.A. 98-241, S. 8, 18; P.A. 99-166, S. 4; P.A. 00-75, S. 1; 00-137, S. 1; 00-196, S. 15; P.A. 01-159, S. 3; 01-195, S. 21, 22, 181; P.A. 03-243, S. 1; P.A. 06-102, S. 7, 8; P.A. 15-159, S. 1; P.A. 16-28, S. 15; 16-70, S. 1; 16-105, S. 1, 2; P.A. 19-189, S. 3.)\n\nHistory: 1965 act changed “no degree of interest” to “reasonable degree of interest” in Subdiv.

(b) to require the court to consider and make written findings concerning certain factors in its determination of whether to terminate parental rights, and relettered the remaining subsections accordingly: P.A. 83-478 amended Subsec. (a) by requiring the court prior to granting a petition for termination to find that “the termination is in the best interest of the child”, rephrasing the grounds for termination and inserting in Subdiv.

Jurisdiction for terminating parental rights lies either in Probate Court or Superior Court pursuant to this section and Sec. 45a-715(a) and (g); administrative hearing officer in department has no authority to hear or determine a petition for termination of parental rights; there is no statutory requirement that department file a treatment plan as condition precedent to filing of a termination petition; in a termination proceeding, burden is on department to prove by clear and convincing evidence that sufficient grounds exist for termination and that termination would serve the best interests of the child. 49 CA 706.

Id., 763. Parent failed to achieve personal rehabilitation when, as of date of the petition, parent is unrecovered, active alcoholic and substance abuser, unable to provide for care and custody of the children, and termination of parental rights is in best interest of the children where trial court made specific findings regarding the seven statutory factors. 51 CA 446. Trial court did not err in finding the parent had not rehabilitated herself and could not assume a responsible position in the life of the child within a reasonable time. Id., 829. Res judicata does not bar reliance on provision authorizing termination of parental rights where a child has been found in prior proceeding to have been neglected. 52 CA 576. Burden of proof was not shifted to respondent father as to whether department made reasonable efforts to reunify him with the child because department made reasonable efforts specifically directed to respondent by offering him over the course of 3 years at least 6 services to facilitate reunification. 56 CA 776. 7 factors set forth in section serve simply as guidelines to court and are not statutory prerequisites that need to be proven by clear and convincing evidence before termination can be ordered. 60 CA 96. Use of clearly erroneous standard of review on appeal from a termination of parental rights proceeding does not deny respondent adequate procedural safeguards. 85 CA 528.

The interconnection among Subsecs. (j)(1), (j)(3) and (k) reveals a legislative intent that, in attempting to reunify the parent with the child pursuant to Subsec.

Under 2003 revision, department must prove either that it has made reasonable efforts to reunify parent and child or, alternatively, that the parent is unwilling or unable to benefit from reunification efforts. 293 C. 539. Where prior neglect adjudication must be opened, there was no longer any basis for trial court's finding that the children were neglected, regardless of whether parent raised claim on appeal, because court's finding was based on the prior neglect adjudication. 301 C. 345. A prior order of specific steps toward rehabilitation is required for any termination of parental rights grounded solely on a parent's failure to rehabilitate, except that, under the particular circumstances of this case, failure to provide specific steps constituted harmless error. 310 C. 485. It was necessary for the trial court to consider events subsequent to the filing of the petition for termination of parental rights when determining whether the department has made reasonable efforts to reunify child with respondent. 321 C. 523. Subdiv. (1): Finding of reunification efforts not required under section and Sec. 17a-111b is an independent basis on which to terminate parental rights. 322 C. 231. Department's failure to make reasonable modifications to its services, programs or activities to accommodate a parent's disability would likely preclude a finding under Subdiv. (1) that the department's reunification efforts were reasonable under the circumstances. 326 C. 480. Subdiv. (3)(C): “act or acts of parental commission or omission” includes both positively harmful actions of a parent and a parent's more passive failures to take action to prevent harm from occurring, and respondents' omissions, namely their failure over the course of three years to acknowledge the cause of the child's injuries and to take therapeutic steps that would prevent a similar tragedy from occurring in the future, clearly fell within the purview of Subpara. 327 C. 506.

Provisions for granting a petition under Subsec. interpreted. 51 CA 595. “Reasonable efforts” in Subdiv. (1) defined and department required to take into consideration parent's mental condition when determining what “reasonable efforts” to make at reunification. 54 CA 463. Trial court properly found, with respect to Subdiv. (3)(D), that biological father of the minor child did not maintain an ongoing parent-child relationship and that to allow additional time for establishing such a relationship would be detrimental to the best interests of the minor child who had no positive memories of and negative feelings toward her father. 55 CA 807. Subdiv. (3): Abandonment focuses on parent's conduct and occurs where a parent fails to visit a child, does not display love or affection for the child, does not personally interact with the child and demonstrates no concern for the child's welfare; to “maintain” a reasonable degree of interest, concern or responsibility implies a continuing, reasonable degree of concern and not a sporadic showing. 56 CA 12. As used in Subdiv. (3)(B), personal rehabilitation refers to restoration of a parent to his or her former constructive and useful role as a parent; Subdiv. (3)(B) is not void for vagueness; it provides fair warning of the conduct necessary for personal rehabilitation and provides minimum guidelines for enforcement. Id., 167. Failure to achieve rehabilitation must be proven by clear and convincing evidence, which is something more than preponderance of the evidence, required in neglect proceedings and in other civil cases, but something less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt, required in criminal cases; rehabilitation must be foreseeable within a reasonable time, which is a factual determination that must be made on case-by-case basis. Id., 688. “Personal rehabilitation” under Subdiv. (3)(B), revised to 1997, defined. 57 CA 441. Discussed re parent's failure to achieve sufficient personal rehabilitation and lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship; Appellate Court need only find one statutory basis to affirm decision to terminate parental rights. 58 CA 234. Father abandoned child within meaning of statute; claim is not valid that section is unconstitutionally void for vagueness because it fails to put an incarcerated parent on notice re how to prevent termination of parental rights; section does not violate double jeopardy clause of U.S. Constitution as applied to incarcerated parent. Id., 244. Subdiv. (3)(B) requires trial court to analyze respondent's rehabilitative status as it relates to needs of the child and such rehabilitation must be foreseeable within a reasonable time; trial court's finding that respondent failed to achieve sufficient personal rehabilitation was not clearly erroneous. 61 CA 19. Adjudication of neglect is not a prerequisite to order terminating parental rights on the basis of abandonment. Id., 185. Court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to applyMatthews v. Eldridgebalancing test in denying respondent's motion to bifurcate termination hearing; Subsec. protects due process rights of respondent by requiring clear and convincing evidence in the adjudicatory phase. Id., 197. Evidence and standards re determination of degree of personal rehabilitation under Subdiv. (3)(B) in adjudicatory phase of termination proceedings discussed. Id., 224. Reasonable efforts, for purposes of Subdiv. (1), means doing everything reasonable, not everything possible; relative youth of respondent not an excuse in determination of failure to achieve personal rehabilitation under Subdiv. (3)(B). Id., 248. Department's act of offering mother substance abuse evaluation and treatment, parenting skill classes, domestic violence counseling, a family reunification program, a psychological evaluation and visitation constituted “reasonable efforts to locate the parent and to reunify the child with the parent”; trial court's determination to terminate parental rights based on failure to achieve sufficient personal rehabilitation affirmed. 62 CA 470. Father's claim under Subsec. is moot because father did not challenge court's finding that he was unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts, which finding satisfied the statute's first prong; case is distinguishable fromIn re Valerie D. because here it was the father's own conduct, not conduct of a third party, that prevented development of a relationship with his children. Id., 500. Subdiv. (3)(D): Trial court's conclusion that there was no ongoing parent-child relationship was factually supported by the record; evidence established that 9-year-old child had no present memories of or feelings for respondent father and had never known his father; court also found by clear and convincing evidence that it was not in child's best interest to allow further time to establish a parent-child relationship because child is very emotionally fragile and suffers from several disorders, has bonded with his maternal grandparents who are making progress with him, has a strong need for permanency and respondent father is unable to understand child's special needs. 63 CA 516. Lack of rehabilitation may be demonstrated by the length of time in which defendant waits to begin the first rehabilitative steps. 65 CA 538. Court properly based its decision on 217 C. 459 where respondent, rather than the state, created circumstances that caused and perpetuated the lack of an ongoing relationship between respondent and the child. 67 CA 417. Trial court's determination that department had made reasonable efforts to reunify respondent and her child was not clearly erroneous. 68 CA 342. Trial court improperly concluded that department's efforts to reunify respondent with minor child were reasonable under circumstances of case where department acknowledged that decision not to engage respondent in further reunification efforts was based on prior experiences with respondent; at department's request, respondent completed substance abuse treatment yet department did not make reasonable efforts at reunification when it should have done so; trial court's finding that respondent was unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts not supported by clear and convincing evidence. 73 CA 637. In determining whether there was an ongoing parent-child relationship, it is the character of that relationship at the time of the filing of termination petition that is relevant to court's inquiry. 75 CA 466. Subdiv. (3)(B): Personal rehabilitation refers to restoration of a parent to his or her former constructive and useful role as a parent; statute requires court to find by clear and convincing evidence that the parent's level of rehabilitation is less than that which would encourage a belief that he or she can assume a responsible position in the child's life within a reasonable time. 83 CA 17. Consideration of best interest of child comes after a determination that termination is warranted. 85 CA 528. Statutory requirements for termination of parental rights discussed; court properly concluded that commissioner had established, by clear and convincing evidence, that, despite parental skills training provided by department to parents, parents did not have ability to care for their daughters, either at time of termination proceedings or in the immediately foreseeable future; legislature's choice of “clear and convincing evidence” standard of proof under Subsec. does not violate due process provisions of state constitution; state constitution does not require court or legislature to equate terminations of parental rights with criminal convictions. 90 CA 565. Judgment terminating father's parental rights was improper and could not stand where evidence showed department made no efforts to foster a relationship between child and father prior to filing of termination petition because father's paternity had not been conclusively established. 93 CA 42. Subdiv. (3): Although “serious physical injury” in Subpara. (F) is not defined in statute, the court looked to its commonly approved usage, which is its dictionary definition; when applied to circumstances of case, there is ample evidence that the child's physical injury, a broken elbow caused by respondent mother who threw her young child across the floor and failed to seek medical attention for her injury for almost five days after the assault, was serious since the assault caused a severe fracture to child's elbow, required casting and caused distress to the child for at least three weeks after the assault. 97 CA 748. Subdiv. (3)(B)(ii): Neither Appellate Court nor trial court may speculate, or make a finding with respect to a termination of parental rights petition, on the basis of evidence that is not in the record. 104 CA 635. Subdiv. (3)(B)(ii): Issue is not whether parent has improved her ability to manage her life but whether she has gained an ability to care for the specific needs of her children. Id., 744. Subdiv. (3)(B): In making the determination as to whether the parent has achieved a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation, the proper focus is on the parent's demonstrable development in relation to the needs of the child; the critical issue in assessing rehabilitation is whether the parent has gained the ability to care for the particular needs of the child at issue. 108 CA 839. In action for the termination of parental rights, the court did not deny respondent her procedural due process rights when conducting a trial on the merits with only her counsel present as the court still required petitioner to prove by clear and convincing evidence not only the grounds for termination, but that it was in the child's best interest for respondent's parental rights to be terminated. 111 CA 210. Trial court properly concluded that mother's denial of drug use and refusal to submit to drug testing supported adjudication that she failed to achieve personal rehabilitation under Subdiv. (3)(B); court properly determined that mother failed to achieve personal rehabilitation under section despite extensive use of support systems. 112 CA 69. Parental rights may be terminated under Subdiv. (3)(B)(i) because a parent must be able to meet the needs of the child, which are paramount, regardless of the needs of the parent, and the critical issue is not whether the parent has improved ability to manage own life but whether the parent has gained ability to care for the needs of the child. Id., 582. Reasonable efforts to reunite respondent and child were no longer appropriate where respondent abandoned child by leaving home and not communicating with child or inquiring as to child's welfare while respondent was living and incarcerated in another state or when he returned to Connecticut, where he failed to support child and was convicted and incarcerated for sexual assault of a minor. 115 CA 111. Department made reasonable efforts to reunify child with parent where department offered mother substance abuse treatment, group and individual therapy, drug testing, supervised and unsupervised visitation, parenting education, psychological evaluation, in-home reunification services, housing assistance and transportation and mother failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation and her inability to parent prevented her from assuming a responsible position with respect to her child. 117 CA 710. Subdiv. (3)(B): Trial court must analyze the respondent's rehabilitative status as it relates to the needs of the particular child and whether prospects for rehabilitation can be realized within a reasonable time given the age and needs of the child. 120 CA 523. Subsec. not unconstitutionally void for vagueness as applied to respondent since referral for sexual offender treatment was sufficient to put respondent on notice that failure to attend could result in termination of his parental rights. 121 CA 376. Court improperly required petitioner to prove a subordinate fact by clear and convincing evidence. 123 CA 103. Subdiv. (3): Unresolved issues of domestic violence and lack of stable, safe housing support conclusion that parent failed to achieve sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation; respondent did not demonstrate that her counsel's representation resulted in prejudice to her. 126 CA 71. A 3-month time frame for achieving necessary degree of personal rehabilitation was reasonable given the age and needs of the child. 129 CA 449. Subdiv. (3)(B): “Rehabilitation” is not limited to the conduct contemplated in the prescribed specific steps. 148 CA 308. Subdiv. (3)(B): The use of “provide” in Subpara. does not require physical delivery of the specific steps to parent where parent has evaded detection or refused to respond to department's inquiries, neither is there one-size-fits-all definition prescribing steps to be taken, rather, it is more consistent with jurisprudence in this area that this issue be addressed on case-by-case basis. 185 CA 512. Subdiv. (1): Where respondent challenged only one of the two separate and independent bases for upholding court's determination that the requirements of the Subdiv. had been satisfied, court unable to provide respondent with practical relief on appeal. 190 CA 583. In analyzing issue of reasonable reunification efforts under Subsec., trial court did not improperly fail to consider events that occurred after the adjudication date as there were no obvious factors that affected the practicality of reunification efforts prior to such date. 194 CA 633. Subdiv. (3)(D): Failure to establish that no parent-child relationship existed between respondent and child does not inevitably lead to conclusion that the parent-child relationship was normal and healthy or meaningful. 202 CA 106. Subdiv. (3)(C): Although the respondent did not commit physical or sexual abuse against his own children, his sexual assault of another minor and consequent incarceration resulted in his children being abused and neglected in the custody of their mother and denied his children the care, guidance, or control necessary for their wellbeing. 211 CA 275. Subdiv. (1): Mother's failure to challenge termination of parental rights on both statutory grounds rendered complaint moot. 218 CA 424. Subdiv. (3)(B): It is well established that personal rehabilitation does not require a parent to prove ability to assume full responsibility for the child, unaided by available support systems; although respondent argued that the evidentiary sufficiency standard of review in child protection cases should be replaced by the former clear error standard, the Supreme Court's decision in 318 C. 569, holding that the appropriate standard of review is evidentiary sufficiency, is binding. 220 CA 315, 322.\n\nCited. 44 CS 551. Legislature intended that Subdiv. (3)(F) be applied retroactively to facts which took place prior to its enactment; also, the law to be applied in a termination proceeding is the law that exists at time termination proceeding is brought. 45 CS 586. Subdiv. (3)(B)(i): Respondent's due process rights were not violated because one of the elements authorizing termination of parental rights required proof by clear and convincing evidence that a neglect finding was made in a prior proceeding and did not require a relitigation of such finding in the termination proceeding. 53 CS 402.\n\nSubsec. (k) (former Subsec. (d)):\n\nCited. 229 C. 345. The plain language of Subdiv. (4) directs the trial court to consider the children's emotional ties with a long list of people in determining whether termination of respondent's parental rights is in their best interest; nothing in Subdiv. (4), however, required the trial court to consider only the children's emotional ties with respondent; therefore, it was appropriate for the trial court to consider the children's emotional ties to the preadoptive foster family in considering whether termination of respondent's parental rights was in the children's best interest; although a trial court shall consider and make written findings re the factors enumerated in Subsec., the trial court's determination of the best interests of a child will not be overturned on the basis of one factor if that determination is otherwise factually supported and legally sound. 317 C. 723.\n\nCited. 24 CA 338; 30 CA 839; 33 CA 12; 38 CA 214; 39 CA 353; 44 CA 80. Trial court's findings that department had made the statutorily required “reasonable efforts” to reunify children with their mother were not supported by clear and convincing evidence; judgments reversed. 48 CA 290. Record supported trial court's factual findings where trial court found that respondent's decision to protect abuser, to deny or disregard the effects of sexual abuse on the child and to refuse counseling services prevented respondent from having a relationship with the child, and that department offered various counseling services to assist respondent and to facilitate reunification with the child, but respondent failed to utilize them. 49 CA 763. Subdiv. (1): Although respondent mother was offered a number of services by department aimed at reunification, including overnight visitation, visitation at the school and rehabilitation center, a bus pass to facilitate transportation, a psychological evaluation and various other social worker services, she failed to take advantage of them and to become more than minimally involved in her child's life; court found by clear and convincing evidence that department made reasonable and appropriate efforts to reunite respondent mother with her child. 56 CA 12. In certain instances, court may be required to make written findings concerning child's emotional ties to preadoptive family; such finding is required when child has developed significant emotional ties to preadoptive family and that family has exercised physical care, custody or control of the child for at least 1 year. 107 CA 395. In arriving at decision in dispositional phase of whether it is established by clear and convincing evidence that continuation of respondent's parental rights is not in best interest of the child, court is mandated to consider and make written findings regarding the 7 factors delineated in Subsec. 120 CA 523. Under Subsec., the word “reasonable” is the linchpin on which department's efforts in a particular set of circumstances are to be adjudged, using the clear and convincing standard of proof; “reasonable efforts” means doing everything reasonable, not everything possible. 124 CA 650. Subdiv. (7) does not require the court to consider the effect of respondent's illness and treatment when it evaluates the evidence. 163 CA 322; judgment reversed on alternate grounds, see 323 C. 640.",

The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to remove or limit any existing liability protection afforded by law.\n\n(e) Any private entity that contracts with the department to provide placement services to children in the legal custody of the department shall have policies consistent with this section. Policies that are not consistent with this section include those that are incompatible with, contradictory to or more restrictive than those provided in this section.\n\n(P.A. 15-199, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 15-199 effective July 1, 2015.",

Finding.\n\nThe states which are parties to this compact find that:\n\n(1) In order to obtain adoptive families for children with special needs, states must assure prospective adoptive parents of substantial assistance, usually on a continuing basis, in meeting the high costs of supporting and providing for the special needs and the services required by such children.\n\n(2) The states have a fundamental interest in promoting adoption for children with special needs because the care, emotional stability, and general support and encouragement required by such children can be best, and often only, obtained in family homes with a normal parent-child relationship.\n\n(3) The states obtain fiscal advantages from providing adoption assistance because the alternative is for the states to bear the higher cost of meeting all the needs of all children while in foster care.\n\n(4) The necessary assurances of adoption assistance for children with special needs, in those instances where children and adoptive parents live in states other than the one undertaking to provide the assistance, include the establishment and maintenance of suitable substantive guarantees and workable procedures for interstate cooperation and payments to assist with the necessary costs of child maintenance, the procurement of services and the provision of medical assistance.\n\nArticle II. Purposes.\n\nThe purposes of this compact are to:\n\n(1) Strengthen protections for the interests of children with special needs on behalf of whom adoption assistance is committed to be paid, when such children are in or move to states other than the one committed to provide adoption assistance.\n\n(2) Provide substantive assurances and operating procedures which will promote the delivery of medical and other services to children on an interstate basis through programs of adoption assistance established by the laws of the states which are parties to this compact.\n\nArticle III. Definitions.\n\nAs used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction:\n\n(1) “Child with special needs” means a minor who has not yet attained the age at which the state normally discontinues children's services, or a child who has not yet reached the age of twenty-one, where the state determines that the child's mental or physical disability warrants the continuation of assistance beyond the age of majority, for whom the state has determined the following:\n\n(A) That the child cannot or should not be returned to the home of his or her parents;\n\n(B) That there exists, with respect to the child, a specific factor or condition, such as his or her ethnic background, age or membership in a minority or sibling group, or the presence of factors such as a medical condition or physical, mental or emotional disability, because of which it is reasonable to conclude that such child cannot be placed with adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance; and\n\n(C) That, except where it would be against the best interests of the child because of such factors as the existence of significant emotional ties with prospective adoptive parents while in their care as a foster child, a reasonable but unsuccessful effort has been made to place the child with appropriate adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance.\n\n(2) “Adoption assistance” means the payment or payments for the maintenance of a child which are made or committed to be made pursuant to the adoption assistance program established by the laws of a party state.\n\n(3) “State” means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or any territory or possession of the United States.\n\n(4) “Adoption assistance state” means the state that is signatory to the adoption assistance agreement in a particular case.\n\n(5) “Residence state” means the state in which the child is a resident by virtue of the residence of the adoptive parents.\n\n(6) “Parents” means either the singular or plural of the word “parent”.\n\nArticle IV. Adoption Assistance.\n\n(a) Each state shall determine the amount of adoption assistance and other aid which it will give to children with special needs and their adoptive parents in accordance with its own laws and programs. The adoption assistance and other aid may be made subject to periodic reevaluation of eligibility by the adoption assistance state in accordance with its laws.\n\n(b) The adoption assistance, medical assistance and other services and benefits to which this compact applies are those provided to children with special needs and their adoptive parents from the effective date of the adoption assistance agreement.\n\n(c) Every case of adoption assistance shall include a written adoption assistance agreement between the adoptive parents and the appropriate agency of the state undertaking to provide the adoption assistance. Every such agreement shall contain provisions for the fixing of actual or potential interstate aspects of the assistance so provided as follows:\n\n(1) An express commitment that the assistance so provided shall be payable without regard for the state of residence of the adoptive parents, both at the outset of the agreement period and at all times during its continuance;\n\n(2) A provision setting forth with particularity the types of care and services toward which the adoption assistance state will make payments;\n\n(3) A commitment to make medical assistance available to the child in accordance with Article V of this compact;\n\n(4) An express declaration that the agreement is for the benefit of the child, the adoptive parents and the state and that it is enforceable by any or all of them; and\n\n(5) The date or dates upon which each payment or other benefit provided thereunder is to commence, but in no event prior to the effective date of the adoption assistance agreement.\n\n(d) Any services or benefits provided for a child by the residence state and the adoption assistance state may be facilitated by the party states on each other's behalf. To this end, the personnel of the child welfare agencies of the party states shall assist each other, as well as the beneficiaries of adoption assistance agreements, in assuring prompt and full access to all benefits expressly included in such agreements. It is further recognized and agreed that, in general, all children to whom adoption assistance agreements apply shall be eligible for benefits under the child welfare, education, rehabilitation, mental health and other programs of their state of residence on the same basis as other resident children.\n\n(e) Adoption assistance payments on behalf of a child in another state shall be made on the same basis and in the same amounts as they would be made if the child was living in the state making the payments.\n\nArticle V. Medical Assistance.\n\n(a) Children for whom a party state is committed, in accordance with the terms of an adoption assistance agreement to provide federally aided medical assistance under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 USC Section 1396 et seq., are eligible for such medical assistance during the entire period for which the agreement is in effect. Upon application therefore, the adoptive parents of a child who is the subject of such an adoption assistance agreement shall receive a medical assistance identification document made out in the child's name. The identification shall be issued by the medical assistance program of the residence state and shall entitle the child to the same benefits pursuant to the same procedures, as any other child who is covered by the medical assistance program in the state, whether or not the adoptive parents are themselves eligible for medical assistance.\n\n(b) The identification document shall bear no indication that an adoption assistance agreement with another state is the basis for its issuance. However, if the identification is issued pursuant to such an adoption assistance agreement, the records of the issuing state and the adoption assistance state shall show the fact, and shall contain a copy of the adoption assistance agreement and any amendment or replacement thereof, as well as all other pertinent information. The adoption assistance and medical assistance programs of the adoption assistance state shall be notified of the issuance of such identification.\n\n(c) A state which has issued a medical assistance identification document pursuant to this compact, which identification is valid and currently in force, shall accept, process and pay medical assistance claims thereon as it would with any other medical assistance claims by eligible residents.\n\n(d) The federally-aided medical assistance provided by a party state pursuant to this compact shall be in accordance with subsections (a) to (c), inclusive, of this article. In addition, when a child who is covered by an adoption assistance agreement is living in another party state, payment or reimbursement for any medical services and benefits specified under the terms of the adoption assistance agreement, which are not available to the child under Title XIX medical assistance program of the residence state, shall be made by the adoption assistance state as required by its law. Any payments so provided shall be of the same kind and at the same rates as provided for children who are living in the adoption assistance state. However, where the payment rate authorized for a covered service under the medical assistance program of the adoption assistance state exceeds the rate authorized by the residence state for that service, the adoption assistance state shall not be required to pay the additional amounts for the services or benefits covered by the residence state.\n\n(e) A child referred to in subsection (a) of this article, whose residence is changed from one party state to another party state, shall be eligible for federally-aided medical assistance under the medical assistance program of the new state of residence.\n\nArticle VI. Compact Administration.\n\n(a) In accordance with its own laws and procedures, each state which is a party to this compact shall designate a compact administrator and such deputy compact administrators as it deems necessary. The compact administrator shall coordinate all activities under this compact within his or her state. The compact administrator shall also be the principal contact for officials and agencies within and without the state for the facilitation of interstate relations involving this compact and the protection of benefits and services provided pursuant thereto.

      "text": "(a) As used in this section, (1) “caregiver” means (A) a fictive kin caregiver, as defined in section 17a-114, who is licensed or approved to provide foster care, and who is caring for a child, (B) a relative caregiver, which means a person who is twenty-one years of age or older, related to a child by birth, adoption or marriage and is licensed or approved to provide foster care, or (C) a person who is a licensed or approved foster care provider pursuant to section 17a-114 and is caring for a child because the parent of the child has died or become otherwise unable to care for the child for reasons that make reunification with the parent and adoption not viable options within the foreseeable future, and (2) “commissioner” means the Commissioner of Children and Families.\n\n(b) The commissioner shall establish a program of subsidized guardianship for the benefit of children who have been in foster care for not less than six consecutive months, for whom neither reunification with a parent nor adoption is an appropriate permanency option, and who have been living with a caregiver. A caregiver may request a guardianship subsidy from the commissioner.\n\n(c) If a caregiver who is receiving a guardianship subsidy for a child is also caring for the child's sibling, the commissioner shall provide a guardianship subsidy to such caregiver in accordance with regulations adopted by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. For purposes of this subsection, “child's sibling” includes a stepbrother, stepsister, a half-brother or a half-sister.\n\n(d) The commissioner shall provide the following subsidies under the subsidized guardianship program in accordance with this section and the regulations adopted pursuant to subsection (e) of this section: (1) A special-need subsidy, which shall be a lump sum payment for one-time expenses resulting from the assumption of care of the child and shall not exceed two thousand dollars; and (2) a medical subsidy comparable to the medical subsidy to children in the subsidized adoption program. The subsidized guardianship program shall also provide a monthly subsidy on behalf of the child payable to the caregiver that is based on the circumstances of the caregiver and the needs of the child and shall not exceed the foster care maintenance payment that would have been paid on behalf of the child if the child had remained in licensed foster care.\n\n(e) The commissioner shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, implementing the subsidized guardianship program established under this section. Such regulations shall include all federal requirements necessary to maximize federal reimbursement available to the state, including, but not limited to, (1) eligibility for the program, (2) the maximum age at which a child is no longer eligible for a guardianship subsidy, including the maximum age, for purposes of claiming federal reimbursement under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, at which a child is no longer eligible for a guardianship subsidy, and (3) a procedure for determining the types and amounts of the subsidies.\n\n(f) (1) A guardianship subsidy provided pursuant to this section shall continue, subject to the commissioner's annual review, until the child reaches the age of eighteen. A guardianship subsidy provided pursuant to this section may continue, subject to the commissioner's annual review, through the child's twenty-first birthday, provided the child is (A) enrolled in a full-time approved secondary education program or an approved program leading to an equivalent credential, (B) enrolled full time in an institution that provides postsecondary or vocational education, or (C) participating full time in a program or activity approved by the commissioner that is designed to promote or remove barriers to employment. The commissioner, in his or her discretion, may waive the provision of full-time enrollment or participation based on compelling circumstances. To receive a guardianship subsidy pursuant to this subsection, the guardian shall, at the time of the annual review, submit to the commissioner a sworn statement that the child is still meeting the requirements of subparagraphs (A) to (C), inclusive, of this subdivision, provided the commissioner, in his or her discretion, may waive such requirements based on compelling circumstances.\n\n(2) Annually, the subsidized guardian shall submit to the commissioner a sworn statement that the child is still living with and receiving support from the guardian. The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, may require that the subsidized guardian submit any additional documentation that the commissioner or designee deems necessary for the purpose of determining whether such child is still living with and receiving support from the subsidized guardian. The parent of any child receiving assistance through the subsidized guardianship program shall remain liable for the support of the child as required by the general statutes.\n\n(g) A guardianship subsidy shall not be included in the calculation of household income in determining eligibility for benefits of the caregiver of the subsidized child or other persons living within the household of the caregiver.\n\n(h) Payments for guardianship subsidies shall be made from moneys available from any source to the commissioner for child welfare purposes. The commissioner shall develop and implement a plan that: (1) Maximizes use of the subsidized guardianship program to decrease the number of children in the legal custody of the commissioner and to reduce the number of children who would otherwise be placed into nonrelative foster care when there is a caregiver willing to provide care; (2) maximizes federal reimbursement for the costs of the subsidized guardianship program, provided whatever federal maximization method is employed shall not result in the caregiver of a child being subject to work requirements as a condition of receipt of benefits for the child or the benefits restricted in time or scope other than as specified in subsection (c) of this section; and (3) ensures necessary transfers of funds between agencies and interagency coordination in program implementation. The commissioner shall seek all federal waivers and reimbursement as are necessary and appropriate to implement this plan.\n\n(i) In the case of the death, severe disability or serious illness of a caregiver who is receiving a guardianship subsidy or an adoptive parent who is receiving a subsidy pursuant to section 17a-117 or 17a-118, the commissioner may transfer such subsidy to a successor guardian who meets the department's foster care safety requirements and who is appointed as legal guardian by a court of competent jurisdiction. For purposes of maximizing federal reimbursement for the costs of the subsidized guardianship program, the commissioner shall request that the caregiver or adoptive parent identify such successor guardian in the subsidy agreement and any addendum thereto.\n\n(j) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the commissioner from continuing to pay guardianship subsidies to those relative caregivers who entered into written subsidy agreements with the Department of Children and Families prior to October 5, 2009.\n\n(k) Not less than thirty days prior to the termination or reduction of a guardianship subsidy, the commissioner shall (1) provide written notice of such reduction or termination to the caregiver receiving such subsidy, and (2) provide such caregiver with a hearing before the department in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54. If such an appeal is taken, the subsidy shall continue without modification until the final decision of the department.\n\n(P.A. 97-272, S. 7, 9; June Sp. Sess.

      "text": "The Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in form substantially as follows:\n\nINTERSTATE COMPACT ON THE PLACEMENT OF CHILDREN\n\nARTICLE I. Purpose and Policy\n\nIt is the purpose and policy of the party states to cooperate with each other in the interstate placement of children to the end that:\n\n(a) Each child requiring placement shall receive the maximum opportunity to be placed in a suitable environment and with persons or institutions having appropriate qualifications and facilities to provide a necessary and desirable degree and type of care.\n\n(b) The appropriate authorities in a state where a child is to be placed may have full opportunity to ascertain the circumstances of the proposed placement, thereby promoting full compliance with applicable requirements for the protection of the child.\n\n(c) The proper authorities of the state from which the placement is made may obtain the most complete information on the basis of which to evaluate a projected placement before it is made.\n\n(d) Appropriate jurisdictional arrangements for the care of children will be promoted.\n\nARTICLE II. Definitions\n\nAs used in this compact:\n\n(a) “Child” means a person who, by reason of minority, is legally subject to parental, guardianship or similar control.\n\n(b) “Sending agency” means a party state, officer or employee thereof; a subdivision of a party state, or officer or employee thereof; a court of a party state; a person, corporation, association, charitable agency or other entity which sends, brings, or causes to be sent or brought any child to another party state.\n\n(c) “Receiving state” means the state to which a child is sent, brought, or caused to be sent or brought, whether by public authorities or private persons or agencies, and whether for placement with state or local public authorities or for placement with private agencies or persons.\n\n(d) “Placement” means the arrangement for the care of a child in a family free or boarding home or in a child-caring agency or institution but does not include any institution caring for the mentally ill, mentally defective or epileptic or any institution primarily educational in character, and any hospital or other medical facility.\n\nARTICLE III. Conditions for Placement\n\n(a) No sending state shall send, bring, or cause to be sent or brought into any other party state any child for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption unless the sending agency shall comply with each and every requirement set forth in this article and with the applicable laws of the receiving state governing the placement of children therein.\n\n(b) Prior to sending, bringing or causing any child to be sent or brought into a receiving state for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption, the sending agency shall furnish the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state written notice of the intention to send, bring, or place the child in the receiving state. The notice shall contain:\n\n(1) The name, date and place of birth of the child.\n\n(2) The identity and address or addresses of the parents or legal guardian.\n\n(3) The name and address of the person, agency or institution to or with which the sending agency proposes to send, bring, or place the child.\n\n(4) A full statement of the reasons for such proposed action and evidence of the authority pursuant to which the placement is proposed to be made.\n\n(c) Any public officer or agency in a receiving state which is in receipt of a notice pursuant to paragraph (b) of this article may request of the sending agency, or any other appropriate officer or agency of or in the sending agency's state, and shall be entitled to receive therefrom, such supporting or additional information as it may deem necessary under the circumstances to carry out the purpose and policy of this compact.\n\n(d) The child shall not be sent, brought, or caused to be sent or brought into the receiving state until the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state shall notify the sending agency, in writing, to the effect that the proposed placement does not appear to be contrary to the interests of the child.\n\nARTICLE IV. Penalty for Illegal Placement\n\nThe sending, bringing, or causing to be sent or brought into any receiving state of a child in violation of the terms of this compact shall constitute a violation of the laws respecting the placement of children of both the state in which the sending agency is located or from which it sends or brings the child and of the receiving state. Such violation may be punished or subjected to penalty in either jurisdiction in accordance with its laws. In addition to liability for any such punishment or penalty, any such violation shall constitute full and sufficient grounds for the suspension or revocation of any license, permit, or other legal authorization held by the sending agency which empowers or allows it to place, or care for children.\n\nARTICLE V. Retention of Jurisdiction\n\n(a) The sending agency shall retain jurisdiction over the child sufficient to determine all matters in relation to the custody, supervision, care, treatment and disposition of the child which it would have had if the child had remained in the sending agency's state, until the child is adopted, reaches majority, becomes self-supporting or is discharged with the concurrence of the appropriate authority in the receiving state. Such jurisdiction shall also include the power to effect or cause the return of the child or its transfer to another location and custody pursuant to law. The sending agency shall continue to have financial responsibility for support and maintenance of the child during the period of the placement. Nothing contained herein shall defeat a claim of jurisdiction by a receiving state sufficient to deal with an act of delinquency or crime committed therein.\n\n(b) When the sending agency is a public agency, it may enter into an agreement with an authorized public or private agency in the receiving state providing for the performance of one or more services in respect of such case by the latter as agent for the sending agency.\n\n(c) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent a private charitable agency authorized to place children in the receiving state from performing services or acting as agent in that state for a private charitable agency of the sending state; nor to prevent the agency in the receiving state from discharging financial responsibility for the support and maintenance of a child who has been placed on behalf of the sending agency without relieving the responsibility set forth in paragraph (a) hereof.\n\nARTICLE VI. Institutional Care of Delinquent Children\n\nA child adjudicated delinquent may be placed in an institution in another party jurisdiction pursuant to this compact but no such placement shall be made unless the child is given a court hearing on notice to the parent or guardian with opportunity to be heard, prior to his being sent to such other party jurisdiction for institutional care and the court finds that:\n\n1. Equivalent facilities for the child are not available in the sending agency's jurisdiction; and\n\n2. Institutional care in the other jurisdiction is in the best interest of the child and will not produce undue hardship.\n\nARTICLE VII. Compact Administrator\n\nThe executive head of each jurisdiction party to this compact shall designate an officer who shall be general coordinator of activities under this compact in his jurisdiction and who, acting jointly with like officers of other party jurisdictions, shall have power to promulgate rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this compact.\n\nARTICLE VIII. Limitations\n\nThis compact shall not apply to:\n\n(a) The sending or bringing of a child into a receiving state by his parent, stepparent, grandparent, adult brother or sister, adult uncle or aunt, or his guardian and leaving the child with any such relative or nonagency guardian in the receiving state.\n\n(b) Any placement, sending or bringing of a child into a receiving state pursuant to any other interstate compact to which both the state from which the child is sent or brought and the receiving state are party, or to any other agreement between said states which has the force of law.\n\nARTICLE IX. Enactment and Withdrawal\n\nThis compact shall be open to joinder by any state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and, with the consent of Congress, the Government of Canada or any province thereof. It shall become effective with respect to any such jurisdiction when such jurisdiction has enacted the same into law. Withdrawal from this compact shall be by the enactment of a statute repealing the same, but shall not take effect until two years after the effective date of such statute and until written notice of the withdrawal has been given by the withdrawing state to the governor of each other party jurisdiction. Withdrawal of a party state shall not affect the rights, duties and obligations under this compact of any sending agency therein with respect to a placement made prior to the effective date of withdrawal.\n\nARTICLE X. Construction and Severability\n\nThe provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\n\n(1967, P.A. 178, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: Sec. 17-81a transferred to Sec. 17a-175 in 1991.\n\nSee Sec. 17a-112 re placement of children in cases involving termination of parental rights.\n\nSee Sec. 46b-129 re placement of neglected, uncared for or dependent child.\n\nAnnotation to former section 17-81a:\n\nCited. 8 CA 656.\n\nAnnotations to present section:\n\nSection does not apply to out-of-state noncustodial parents. 305 C. 723.\n\nCompact does not permit a trial court to order an out-of-state placement to a member of a minor child's extended family without the approval of the placement by an agency in the receiving state. 121 CA 150. Claim that section does not apply to out-of-state noncustodial parents is moot and beyond review of court because of child's placement with respondent. 129 CA 727; judgment reversed, see 305 C. 723. Section is plain and unambiguous, and by its terms, the compact's applicability is limited to the out-of-state placement of children in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption; section does not encompass out-of-state reunification of children with their father and a paternal aunt. 218 CA 731.",
