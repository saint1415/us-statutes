If the respondent is confined to a hospital, notwithstanding the provisions of section 45a-7, the probate judge from the district where the application was filed shall hold the hearing on such commitment at the hospital where such person is confined, if in the opinion of at least one of the physicians appointed by the court to examine him it would be detrimental to the health and welfare of the respondent to travel to the Probate Court where the application was filed or if it could be dangerous to the respondent or others for him to travel to such court.

The notice shall inform the respondent that he or she has a right to be present at the hearing; that he or she has a right to counsel; that he or she, if indigent, has a right to have counsel appointed to represent him or her; and that he or she has a right to cross-examine witnesses testifying at any hearing upon such application.\n\n(b) (1) If the court finds such respondent is indigent or otherwise unable to pay for counsel, the court shall appoint counsel for such respondent, unless such respondent refuses counsel and the court finds that the respondent understands the nature of his or her refusal. The court shall provide such respondent a reasonable opportunity to select his or her own counsel to be appointed by the court. If the respondent does not select counsel or if counsel selected by the respondent refuses to represent such respondent or is not available for such representation, the court shall appoint counsel for the respondent from a panel of attorneys admitted to practice in this state provided by the Probate Court Administrator in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Probate Court Administrator in accordance with section 45a-77. The reasonable compensation of appointed counsel shall be established by, and paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department, except that if funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such purposes, such compensation shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund.\n\n(2) Prior to such hearing, such respondent or his or her counsel, in accordance with the provisions of sections 52-146d to 52-146i, inclusive, shall be afforded access to all records including, but not limited to, hospital records if such respondent is hospitalized, and shall be entitled to take notes from any of such records. If such respondent is hospitalized at the time of the hearing, the hospital shall make available at such hearing for use by such hospitalized respondent or his or her counsel all records in its possession relating to the condition of such hospitalized respondent. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 52-146d to 52-146i, inclusive, and subject to the rules of evidence as provided in subsection (h) of this section, all such hospital records directly relating to the hospitalized respondent shall be admissible at the request of any party or the Probate Court in any proceeding relating to confinement to or release from a hospital for psychiatric disabilities.\n\n(c) (1) The court shall require the certificates, signed under penalty of false statement, of at least two impartial physicians selected by the court, one of whom shall be a practicing psychiatrist, and each of whom shall be licensed to practice medicine in the state of Connecticut and shall have been a practitioner of medicine for at least one year and shall not be connected with the hospital for psychiatric disabilities to which the application is being made, or related by blood or marriage to the applicant, or to the respondent. Such certificates shall indicate that the physicians have personally examined the respondent not more than ten days prior to such hearing. The court shall appoint such physicians from a list of physicians and psychiatrists provided by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services and such appointments shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Probate Court Administrator in accordance with section 45a-77. Each such physician shall make a report on a separate form provided for that purpose by the Probate Court Administrator and shall answer such questions as may be set forth on such form as fully and completely as reasonably possible. Such form shall include, but not be limited to, questions relating to the specific psychiatric disabilities alleged, whether or not the respondent is dangerous to himself or herself or others, whether or not such illness has resulted or will result in serious disruption of the respondent's mental and behavioral functioning, whether or not hospital treatment is both necessary and available, whether or not less restrictive placement is recommended and available and whether or not the respondent is incapable of understanding the need to accept the recommended treatment on a voluntary basis. Each such physician shall state upon the form the reasons for his or her opinions. Such respondent or his or her counsel shall have the right to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses who testify at any hearing on the application. If such respondent notifies the court not less than three days before the hearing that he or she wishes to cross-examine the examining physicians, the court shall order such physicians to appear.\n\n(2) The court shall cause a recording of the testimony of such hearing to be made, to be transcribed only in the event of an appeal from the decree rendered under this section. A copy of such transcript shall be furnished without charge to any appellant whom the Probate Court finds unable to pay for such copy. The cost of such transcript shall be paid from funds appropriated to the Judicial Department.\n\n(3) If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent has psychiatric disabilities and is dangerous to himself or herself or others or gravely disabled, the court shall make an order for his or her commitment, considering whether or not a less restrictive placement is available, to a hospital for psychiatric disabilities to be named in such order, there to be confined for the period of the duration of such psychiatric disabilities or until he or she is discharged or converted to voluntary status pursuant to section 17a-506 in due course of law. Such court order shall further command some suitable person to convey such person to such hospital for psychiatric disabilities and deliver him or her, with a copy of such order and of such certificates, to the keeper thereof. In appointing a person to execute such order, the court shall give preference to a near relative or friend of the person with psychiatric disabilities, so far as the court deems it practicable and judicious. Notice of any action taken by the court shall be given to the respondent and his or her attorney, if any, in such manner as the court concludes would be appropriate under the circumstances.\n\n(d) If the respondent refuses to be examined by the court-appointed physicians as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the court may issue a warrant for the apprehension of the respondent and a police officer for the town in which such court is located or if there is no such police officer then the state police shall deliver the respondent to a general hospital where the respondent shall be examined by two physicians, one of whom shall be a practicing psychiatrist, in accordance with subsection (c) of this section. If as a result of such examination, the respondent is committed under section 17a-502, transportation of the respondent to any such hospital, if such respondent is a female, shall be in accordance with the provisions of section 17a-505. If the respondent is not committed under section 17a-502, the respondent shall be released and the reports of such physicians shall be sent to the Probate Court to satisfy the requirement of examination by two physicians under subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(e) The respondent shall be given the opportunity to elect voluntary status under section 17a-506 at any time prior to adjudication of the application, subject to the following provisions: (1) In the event that a patient is in the hospital, the patient shall be informed by a member of the hospital staff within twenty-four hours prior to the time an application is filed with the court, that he or she may continue in the hospital on a voluntary basis under the provisions of section 17a-506, and any application for involuntary commitment by the hospital shall include a statement that such voluntary status has been offered to the respondent and refused, and (2) in the event that a respondent is not hospitalized, the notice of hearing shall inform the respondent that the respondent has the right to enter the hospital on a voluntary basis under the provisions of section 17a-506, and, if the respondent enters the hospital under section 17a-506, the application for involuntary commitment shall be withdrawn. When any patient who has elected voluntary status following the filing of an application but prior to adjudication in any proceeding for involuntary commitment thereafter notifies the hospital that he or she wants to be released, a new application for involuntary commitment may be filed. If such new application is filed not later than forty-five days after the patient's election of voluntary status on a prior application, the application for involuntary commitment may, at the discretion of the judge, be heard on the merits, notwithstanding the patient's subsequent request to remain a voluntary patient under the provisions of section 17a-506. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 17a-29, 17a-540, 17a-543, 17a-544, subsection (f) of section 17a-547 and section 17a-548, if a patient under section 17a-506 refuses to accept medication or treatment in accordance with the treatment plan prescribed by the attending physician and such patient is imminently dangerous to himself or others, an application for involuntary commitment may be filed for such patient in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(f) The respondent shall be present at any hearing for his or her commitment under this section. If the respondent is medicated at that time, the hospital shall provide written notice to the court of such fact and of the common effects of such medication.\n\n(g) The hospital shall notify each patient at least annually that such patient has a right to a further hearing pursuant to this section. If the patient requests such hearing, it shall be held by the Probate Court for the district in which the hospital is located. Any such request shall be immediately filed with the appropriate court by the hospital. After such request is filed with the Probate Court, it shall proceed in the manner provided in subsections (a), (b), (c) and (f) of this section. In addition, the hospital shall furnish the Probate Court for the district in which the hospital is located on a monthly basis with a list of all patients confined in the hospital involuntarily without release for one year since the last annual review under this section of the patient's commitment or since the original commitment. The hospital shall include in such notification the type of review the patient last received.

If the head of the hospital, in consultation with a physician, determines that the condition of an involuntary patient not declared incapable of caring for himself or herself pursuant to said sections is of an extremely critical nature and the patient is incapable of informed consent, medical or surgical procedures may be performed with the written informed consent of: (1) The patient's health care representative; (2) the patient's conservator or guardian, if he or she has one; (3) the patient's next of kin; (4) a person designated by the patient pursuant to section 1-56r; or (5) a qualified physician appointed by a judge of the Probate Court. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, if obtaining the consent provided for in this section would cause a medically harmful delay to a voluntary or involuntary patient whose condition is of an extremely critical nature, as determined by personal observation by a physician or the senior clinician on duty, emergency treatment may be provided without consent.\n\n(c) No psychosurgery or shock therapy shall be administered to any patient without the patient's written informed consent, except as provided in this subsection. Such consent shall be for a maximum period of thirty days and may be revoked at any time. If it is determined by the head of the hospital and two qualified physicians that the patient has become incapable of giving informed consent, shock therapy may be administered upon order of the Probate Court if, after hearing, such court finds that the patient is incapable of informed consent and there is no other, less intrusive beneficial treatment. An order of the Probate Court authorizing the administration of shock therapy pursuant to this subsection shall be effective for not more than forty-five days.\n\n(d) A facility may establish an internal procedure governing decisions concerning involuntary medication treatment for inpatients. Such procedure shall provide (1) that any decision concerning involuntary medication treatment shall be made by a person who is not employed by the facility in which the patient is receiving treatment, provided the selection of such person shall not be made until the patient's advocate has had reasonable opportunity to discuss such selection with the facility, (2) written and oral notification to the patient of available advocacy services, (3) notice to the patient and the patient's advocate, if one has been chosen, of any proceeding for the determination of the necessity for involuntary treatment not less than forty-eight hours prior to such proceeding, (4) the right of the patient to representation during any such proceeding, (5) questioning of any witness at any such proceeding including, if requested, one or both of the physicians who made the determination pursuant to subsection (e) of this section concerning the patient's capacity to give informed consent and the necessity of medication for the patient's treatment, and (6) a written decision. If a decision is made in accordance with the standards set forth in this section that a patient shall receive involuntary medication, and there is substantial probability that without such medication for the treatment of the psychiatric disabilities of the patient the condition of the patient will rapidly deteriorate, such involuntary medication may be provided for a period not to exceed thirty days or until a decision is made by the Probate Court under subsection (e) or (f) of this section, whichever is sooner.\n\n(e) (1) (A) If it is determined by the head of the hospital and two qualified physicians that a patient is incapable of giving informed consent to medication for the treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities and such medication is deemed to be necessary for the patient's treatment, a facility may utilize the procedures established in subsection (d) of this section and may apply to the Probate Court for appointment of a conservator of the person with specific authority to consent to the administration of medication or, in a case where a conservator of the person has previously been appointed under section 45a-650, the facility or the conservator may petition the Probate Court to grant such specific authority to the conservator. The Probate Court may appoint a conservator with such specific authority pursuant to this subparagraph if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the patient is incapable of giving informed consent to medication for the treatment of the patient's psychiatric disability and such medication is necessary for the patient's treatment.\n\n(B) The conservator shall meet with the patient and the physician, review the patient's written record and consider the risks and benefits from the medication, the likelihood and seriousness of adverse side effects, the preferences of the patient, the patient's religious views, and the prognosis with and without medication. After consideration of such information, the conservator shall either consent to the patient receiving medication for the treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities or refuse to consent to the patient receiving such medication.\n\n(2) The authority of a conservator to consent to the administration of medication under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be effective for not more than one hundred twenty days. In the case of continuous hospitalization of the patient beyond such one hundred twenty days, if the head of the hospital and two qualified physicians determine that the patient continues to be incapable of giving informed consent to medication for the treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities and such medication is deemed to be necessary for the patient's treatment, the authority of the conservator to consent to the administration of medication may be extended for a period not to exceed one hundred twenty days by order of the Probate Court without a hearing upon application by the head of the hospital. Prompt notice of the order shall be given to the patient, conservator and facility.\n\n(f) (1) If it is determined by the head of the hospital and two qualified physicians that (A) a patient is capable of giving informed consent but refuses to consent to medication for treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities, (B) there is no less intrusive beneficial treatment, and (C) without medication, the psychiatric disabilities with which the patient has been diagnosed will continue unabated and place the patient or others in direct threat of harm, the facility may utilize the procedures established in subsection (d) of this section and may apply to the Probate Court to authorize the administration to the patient of medication for the treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities, despite the refusal of the patient to consent to such medication. The Probate Court may authorize the administration of medication to the patient pursuant to this subdivision if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that (i) the patient is capable of giving informed consent but refuses to consent to medication for treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities, (ii) there is no less intrusive beneficial treatment, and (iii) without medication, the psychiatric disabilities with which the patient has been diagnosed will continue unabated and place the patient or others in direct threat of harm.\n\n(2) An order authorizing the administration of medication under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be effective for not more than one hundred twenty days. In the case of continuous hospitalization of the patient beyond such one hundred twenty days, if the head of the hospital and two qualified physicians determine that (A) the patient continues to be capable of giving informed consent but refuses to consent to medication for treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities, (B) there is no less intrusive beneficial treatment, and (C) without medication, the psychiatric disabilities with which the patient has been diagnosed will continue unabated and place the patient or others in direct threat of harm, the order may be extended for a period not to exceed one hundred twenty days by order of the Probate Court without a hearing. Prompt notice of the order shall be given to the patient and facility.\n\n(g) If a decision has been made to administer involuntary medication to a patient pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, the patient may petition the Probate Court to expedite the hearing on an application filed by the facility pursuant to subsection (e) or (f) of this section or, if no application has been filed, to hold a hearing to decide whether to allow the administration of involuntary medication. Either hearing shall be held within fifteen days after the date of the patient's petition.\n\n(h) For the purposes of this section, “voluntary patient” means any patient sixteen years of age or older who applies in writing for, and is admitted to, a hospital for observation, diagnosis or treatment of a mental disorder.\n\n(i) Unless there is a serious risk of harm to the patient or others, based upon the patient's past history or current condition, nothing in this section authorizes any form of involuntary medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment of any patient who in the sincere practice of his or her religious beliefs is being treated by prayer alone in accordance with the principles and practices of a church or religious denomination by a duly accredited practitioner or ordained minister, priest or rabbi thereof.

      "text": "(a)(1)(A) If it is determined by the head of the hospital and two qualified physicians that a patient who is a defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services pursuant to section 54-56d is incapable of giving informed consent to medication for the treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities and such medication is deemed to be necessary for the patient's treatment, the facility in which the patient is placed may petition the probate court for the district in which such facility is located for appointment of a special limited conservator with specific authority to consent to the administration of medication, provided an employee of such facility shall not be appointed or serve as the special limited conservator. The provisions of section 45a-649 concerning issuance of a citation and notice, personal service and representation by, appointment of, and compensation of an attorney shall apply to any petition filed under this subsection as if such patient were a respondent under section 45a-649, except that (i) the court shall only be required to issue such citation and notice to the patient, the patient's attorney and any conservator appointed for the patient, and (ii) the court, in its discretion, may order notice as it directs to other persons having an interest in the patient and to such persons the patient requests to be notified. The Probate Court may appoint a special limited conservator with such specific authority pursuant to this subparagraph if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the patient is incapable of giving informed consent to medication for the treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities and such medication is necessary for the patient's treatment. The Probate Court may grant the special limited conservator specific authority to consent to the release of the patient's medical records to such facility if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the patient is unwilling or unable to release such records and such records are necessary to make decisions concerning the patient's treatment.\n\n(B) The special limited conservator shall meet with the patient and the physician, review the patient's written record and consider the risks and benefits from the medication, the likelihood and seriousness of adverse side effects, the preferences of the patient, the patient's religious views, and the prognosis with and without medication. After consideration of such information, the special limited conservator shall either consent to the patient receiving medication for the treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities or refuse to consent to the patient receiving such medication.\n\n(2) The authority of a special limited conservator to consent to the administration of medication under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be effective for not more than one hundred twenty days. In the case of continuous hospitalization of the patient beyond such one hundred twenty days, if the head of the hospital and two qualified physicians determine that the patient continues to be incapable of giving informed consent to medication for the treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities and such medication is deemed to be necessary for the patient's treatment, the authority of the special limited conservator to consent to the administration of medication may be extended for a period not to exceed one hundred twenty days by order of the Probate Court without a hearing upon application by the head of the hospital. Prompt notice of the order shall be given to the patient, special limited conservator and facility.\n\n(3) The reasonable compensation of a special limited conservator appointed under this subsection shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund.\n\n(b) (1) If it is determined by the head of the hospital and two qualified physicians that (A) a patient who is a defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services pursuant to section 54-56d is capable of giving informed consent but refuses to consent to medication for treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities, (B) there is no less intrusive beneficial treatment, and (C) without medication, the psychiatric disabilities with which the patient has been diagnosed will continue unabated and place the patient or others in direct threat of harm, the facility in which the patient is placed may petition the probate court for the district in which such facility is located to authorize the administration to the patient of medication for the treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities, despite the refusal of the patient to consent to such medication. The provisions of section 45a-649 concerning issuance of a citation and notice, personal service and representation by, appointment of, and compensation of an attorney shall apply to any petition filed under this subsection as if such patient were a respondent under section 45a-649, except that (i) the court shall only be required to issue such citation and notice to the patient, the patient's attorney and any conservator appointed for the patient, and (ii) the court, in its discretion, may order notice as it directs to other persons having an interest in the patient and to such persons the patient requests to be notified. The Probate Court may authorize the administration of medication to the patient if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that (I) the patient is capable of giving informed consent but refuses to consent to medication for treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities, (II) there is no less intrusive beneficial treatment, and (III) without medication, the psychiatric disabilities with which the patient has been diagnosed will continue unabated and place the patient or others in direct threat of harm.\n\n(2) An order authorizing the administration of medication under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be effective for not more than one hundred twenty days. In the case of continuous hospitalization of the patient beyond such one hundred twenty days, if the head of the hospital and two qualified physicians determine that (A) the patient continues to be capable of giving informed consent but refuses to consent to medication for treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities, (B) there is no less intrusive beneficial treatment, and (C) without medication, the psychiatric disabilities with which the patient has been diagnosed will continue unabated and place the patient or others in direct threat of harm, the order may be extended for a period not to exceed one hundred twenty days by order of the Probate Court without a hearing. Prompt notice of the order shall be given to the patient and facility.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, if obtaining consent under this section would cause a medically harmful delay to a patient whose condition is of an extremely critical nature, as determined by the personal observation of a physician or the senior clinician on duty in the facility in which the patient is placed, the physician or senior clinician may order medication for treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities without consent.\n\n(d) Unless there is a serious risk of harm to the patient or others, based upon the patient's past history or current condition, nothing in this section authorizes any form of involuntary medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment of any patient who in the sincere practice of his or her religious beliefs is being treated by prayer alone in accordance with the principles and practices of a church or religious denomination by a duly accredited practitioner or ordained minister, priest or rabbi thereof.\n\n(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the application of sections 45a-644 to 45a-663, inclusive, except as specifically provided in this section.\n\n(P.A. 04-160, S. 3; P.A. 07-117, S. 2; P.A. 19-99, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 07-117 inserted Subpara.

The court shall send copies of the recommendation or application to the state's attorney and to counsel for the acquittee. An acquittee may apply for discharge not more than once every six months and no sooner than six months after the initial board hearing held pursuant to section 17a-583.\n\n(b) The recommendation or application shall contain the dates on which any prior recommendations or applications for discharge had been filed with the court, the dates on which decisions thereon were rendered, and a statement of facts, including any change in circumstances since the determination on the most recent recommendation or application, sufficient to qualify the acquittee as a person who should be discharged. A recommendation by the board shall contain findings and conclusions to support the recommendation.\n\n(c) If reasonable cause exists to believe that the acquittee remains a person with psychiatric disabilities or a person with intellectual disability to the extent that his discharge at the expiration of his maximum term of commitment would constitute a danger to himself or others, the state's attorney, at least one hundred thirty-five days prior to such expiration, may petition the court for an order of continued commitment of the acquittee.\n\n(d) The court shall forward any application for discharge received from the acquittee and any petition for continued commitment of the acquittee to the board. The board shall, within ninety days of its receipt of the application or petition, file a report with the court, and send a copy thereof to the state's attorney and counsel for the acquittee, setting forth its findings and conclusions as to whether the acquittee is a person who should be discharged.

If the acquittee is indigent, the court shall provide him with the services of a psychiatrist or psychologist to perform the examination at the expense of the state. Any such separate examination report shall be filed with the court within thirty days of the notice of intent to perform the examination.

At the hearing, the acquittee shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the acquittee is a person who should be discharged.\n\n(g) The court shall make a finding as to the mental condition of the acquittee and, considering that its primary concern is the protection of society and its secondary concern is the safety and well-being of the acquittee, make one of the following orders: (1) If the court finds that the acquittee is not a person who should be discharged, the court shall order the recommendation or application for discharge be dismissed; or (2) if the court finds that the acquittee is a person who should be discharged, the court shall order the acquittee discharged from custody.

Meaning of “psychiatric disabilities” within definition of “person who should be discharged” is not governed by the standard in either Sec. 17a-495(c) or 17a-458(a) and trial court applied the correct standard, found in governing regulations, in its interpretation of the term; the determination of whether person is a danger to himself or others is a question of fact and is to be reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard; trial court's finding that defendant suffered from a severe personality disorder and should therefore not be discharged did not violate defendant's substantive due process rights. 265 C. 697. Trial court's conclusions that Subsec. (c) violated defendant's due process rights under Connecticut Constitution and state and federal equal protection rights present questions of law over which Supreme Court's review is plenary. 268 C. 508. Defendant's further commitment under section is constitutional because state may subject insanity acquittees like defendant to recommitment procedure that is more restrictive than the procedure applicable to civilly committed inmates, and such difference does not violate right to equal protection. 307 C. 299.\n\nCited. 43 CA 592. Statute found not to be unconstitutionally vague; court rejected arguments that the lack of definition of “dangerous to himself and others” and burden of predicting future conduct made statute vague. 69 CA 666. Court may properly credit board's opinions and rely on its findings; such findings are not inadmissible hearsay. 100 CA 407.\n\nSubsec. (c):\n\nSection impliedly imposes same burden on the state at a hearing for continued commitment of an acquittee beyond his current definite period of commitment as is imposed in a civil commitment hearing under Sec. 17a-498(c). 230 C. 400. Subsec. neither affects a suspect group nor implicates a fundamental right for purposes of federal equal protection clause, and therefore must be analyzed under rational basis review. 268 C. 508.\n\nClearly erroneous standard applies to review of court's findings as to whether an acquittee is currently mentally ill to the point of posing a danger to himself or community if discharged. 77 CA 564. Does not violate defendant's constitutional rights to due process and equal protection of the laws. 92 CA 206.",

Any acquittee found so violent as to require confinement under conditions of maximum security shall not be confined in any hospital for psychiatric disabilities or placed with the Commissioner of Developmental Services unless such hospital or said commissioner has the trained and equipped staff, facilities or security to accommodate such acquittee.\n\n(b) The Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services may transfer any acquittee who requires (1) confinement under conditions of maximum security pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, and (2) medical treatment that is unavailable in the maximum security environment or would constitute a safety hazard to the acquittee or others due to the use of certain medical equipment or material, to a facility that can provide such medical treatment, provided (A) the commissioner ensures that the conditions of custody of the acquittee at such facility are and remain equivalent to conditions of maximum security, (B) the commissioner consults with a licensed health care provider who has evaluated the acquittee regarding such transfer and the licensed health care provider approves of such transfer, and (C) transfer of the acquittee back to the maximum security setting occurs upon completion of the medical treatment. The commissioner shall provide the board with notice of such transfer at the most reasonable time determined by the superintendent, but not later than forty-eight hours after such transfer.\n\n(c) Each hospital for psychiatric disabilities treating acquittees under secure conditions shall establish a risk management review committee comprised of licensed clinical professionals and administrators of the hospital to review requests to transfer an acquittee from a maximum security division of the hospital to a lower security division of the hospital for the reason described in this subsection. If at any time after the confinement of an acquittee in a hospital for psychiatric disabilities under conditions of maximum security, the superintendent of such hospital is of the opinion, after consultation with the hospital's risk management review committee, that the acquittee's psychiatric supervision and treatment would be safely advanced by permitting the acquittee to transfer to a lower security division of the hospital, the superintendent may effectuate the transfer. The superintendent shall provide the board with at least forty-eight hours advance notice of the transfer. The board shall notify each victim, as defined in section 17a-601, of the acquittee regarding the transfer.\n\n(P.A. 85-506, S. 20, 32; P.A. 87-486, S. 12; P.A. 95-257, S. 48, 58; P.A. 07-73, S. 2(b); P.A. 17-179, S. 1; P.A. 22-45, S. 8.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 87-486 added reference to an acquittee placed with the commissioner of mental retardation; Sec. 17-257t transferred to Sec. 17a-599 in 1991; P.A. 95-257 substituted “psychiatric disabilities” for “mental illness”, effective July 1, 1995; pursuant to P.A. 07-73 “Commissioner of Mental Retardation” was changed editorially by the Revisors to “Commissioner of Developmental Services”, effective October 1, 2007; P.A. 17-179 designated existing provisions re determination of whether acquittee is so violent as to require confinement under maximum security as Subsec. (a) and added Subsec. (b) re transfer of acquittee for medical treatment; P.A. 22-45 amended Subsec. (b) by eliminating requirement that the commissioner provide written justification to the board for transfer for medical treatment and requiring consultation with and approval by a health care provider and notification of the board re such transfer and added Subsec. (c) requiring the establishment of a risk management review committee to review requests to transfer from maximum security division to a lower security division.\n\nNothing in section limits board's discretion re placement of acquittees who are not found to be so violent as to require maximum security confinement, thus section does not contemplate that only “so violent” acquittees may be confined under conditions of maximum security, and therefore regulation re maximum security confinement for acquittees does not impermissibly conflict with section. 291 C. 307.",

      "text": "The Interstate Compact on Mental Health is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this state with all other states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:\n\nINTERSTATE COMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH\n\nThe contracting states solemnly agree that:\n\nThe party states find that the proper and expeditious treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient can be facilitated by cooperative action, to the benefit of the patients, their families, and society as a whole. Further, the party states find that the necessity of and desirability for furnishing such care and treatment bears no primary relation to the residence or citizenship of the patient but that, on the contrary, the controlling factors of community safety and humanitarianism require that facilities and services be made available for all who are in need of them. Consequently, it is the purpose of this compact and of the party states to provide the necessary legal basis for the institutionalization or other appropriate care and treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient under a system that recognizes the paramount importance of patient welfare and to establish the responsibilities of the party states in terms of such welfare.\n\nAs used in this compact:\n\n(a) “Sending state” shall mean a party state from which a patient is transported pursuant to the provisions of the compact or from which it is contemplated that a patient may be so sent.\n\n(b) “Receiving state” shall mean a party state to which a patient is transported pursuant to the provisions of the compact or to which it is contemplated that a patient may be so sent.\n\n(c) “Institution” shall mean any hospital or other facility maintained by a party state or political subdivision thereof for the care and treatment of mental illness or mental deficiency.\n\n(d) “Patient” shall mean any person subject to or eligible as determined by the laws of the sending state, for institutionalization or other care, treatment, or supervision pursuant to the provisions of this compact.\n\n(e) “Aftercare” shall mean care, treatment and services provided a patient, as defined herein, on convalescent status or conditional release.\n\n(f) “Mental illness” shall mean mental disease to such extent that a person so afflicted requires care and treatment for his own welfare, or the welfare of others, or of the community.\n\n(g) “Mental deficiency” shall mean mental deficiency as defined by appropriate clinical authorities to such extent that a person so afflicted is incapable of managing himself and his affairs, but shall not include mental illness as defined herein.\n\n(h) “State” shall mean any state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\nArticle III\n\n(a) Whenever a person physically present in any party state shall be in need of institutionalization by reason of mental illness or mental deficiency, he shall be eligible for care and treatment in an institution in that state irrespective of his residence, settlement or citizenship qualifications.\n\n(b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this article to the contrary notwithstanding, any patient may be transferred to an institution in another state whenever there are factors based upon clinical determinations indicating that the care and treatment of said patient would be facilitated or improved thereby. Any such institutionalization may be for the entire period of care and treatment or for any portion or portions thereof. The factors referred to in this paragraph shall include the patient's full record with due regard for the location of the patient's family, character of the illness and probable duration thereof, and such other factors as shall be considered appropriate.\n\n(c) No state shall be obliged to receive any patient pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this article unless the sending state has given advance notice of its intention to send the patient; furnished all available medical and other pertinent records concerning the patient; given the qualified medical or other appropriate clinical authorities of the receiving state an opportunity to examine the patient if said authorities so wish; and unless the receiving state shall agree to accept the patient.\n\n(d) In the event that the laws of the receiving state establish a system of priorities for the admission of patients, an interstate patient under this compact shall receive the same priority as a local patient and shall be taken in the same order and at the same time that he would be taken if he were a local patient.\n\n(e) Pursuant to this compact, the determination as to the suitable place of institutionalization for a patient may be reviewed at any time and such interest of the patient.\n\n(a) Whenever, pursuant to the laws of the state in which a patient is physically present, it shall be determined that the patient should receive aftercare or supervision, such care or supervision may be provided in a receiving state. If the medical or other appropriate clinical authorities having responsibility for the care and treatment of the patient in the sending state shall have reason to believe that aftercare in another state would be in the best interest of the patient and would not jeopardize the public safety, they shall request the appropriate authorities in the receiving state to investigate the desirability of affording the patient such aftercare in said receiving state, and such investigation shall be made with all reasonable speed. The request for investigation shall be accompanied by complete information concerning the patient's intended place of residence and the identity of the person in whose charge it is proposed to place the patient, the complete medical history of the patient, and such other documents as may be pertinent.\n\n(b) If the medical or other appropriate clinical authorities having responsibility for the care and treatment of the patient in the sending state and the appropriate authorities in the receiving state find that the best interest of the patient would be served thereby, and if the public safety would not be jeopardized thereby, the patient may receive aftercare or supervision in the receiving state.\n\n(c) In supervising, treating, or caring for a patient on aftercare pursuant to the terms of this article, a receiving state shall employ the same standards of visitation, examination, care and treatment that it employs for similar local patients.\n\nWhenever a dangerous or potentially dangerous patient escapes from an institution in any party state, that state shall promptly notify all appropriate authorities within and without the jurisdiction of the escape in a manner reasonably calculated to facilitate the speedy apprehension of the escapee. Immediately upon the apprehension and identification of any such dangerous or potentially dangerous patient, he shall be detained in the state where found pending disposition in accordance with law.\n\nThe duly accredited officers of any state party to this compact, upon the establishment of their authority and the identity of the patient, shall be permitted to transport any patient being moved pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact, without interference.\n\nArticle VII\n\n(a) No person shall be deemed a patient of more than one institution at any given time. Completion of transfer of any patient to an institution in a receiving state shall have the effect of making the person a patient of the institution in the receiving state.\n\n(b) The sending state shall pay all costs of and incidental to the transportation of any patient pursuant to this compact, but any two or more party states may, by making a specific agreement for that purpose, arrange for a different allocation of costs as among themselves.\n\n(c) No provision of this compact shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationships among the departments, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or responsibilities therefor.\n\n(d) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent any party state or subdivision thereof from asserting any right against any person, agency or other entity in regard to costs for which such party state or subdivision thereof may be responsible pursuant to any provision of this compact.\n\n(e) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to invalidate any institutionalization, care or treatment of the mentally ill or mentally deficient, or any statutory authority pursuant to which such agreements may be made.\n\nArticle VIII\n\n(a) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to abridge, diminish, or in any way impair the rights, duties, and responsibilities of any patient's guardian on his own behalf or in respect of any patient for whom he may serve, except that where the transfer of any patient to another jurisdiction makes advisable the appointment of a supplemental or substitute guardian, any court of competent jurisdiction in the receiving state may make such supplemental or substitute appointment and the court which appointed the previous guardian shall upon being duly advised of the new appointment, and upon the satisfactory completion of such accounting and other acts as such court may by law require, relieve the previous guardian of power and responsibility to whatever extent shall be appropriate in the circumstances; provided, however, that in the case of any patient having settlement in the sending state, the court of competent jurisdiction in the sending state, which court in the State of Connecticut shall be the Superior Court, shall have sole discretion to relieve a guardian appointed by it or continue his power and responsibility, whichever it shall deem advisable. The court in the receiving state may, in its discretion, confirm or reappoint the person or persons previously serving as guardian in the sending state in lieu of making a supplemental or substitute appointment.\n\n(b) The term “guardian” as used in paragraph (a) of this article shall include any guardian, trustee, legal committee, conservator, or other person or agency however denominated who is charged by law with power to act for or responsibility for the person or property of a patient.\n\n(a) No provision of this compact except Article V shall apply to any person institutionalized while under sentence in a penal or correctional institution or while subject to trial on a criminal charge, or whose institutionalization is due to the commission of an offense for which, in the absence of mental illness or mental deficiency, said person would be subject to incarceration in a penal or correctional institution.\n\n(b) To every extent possible, it shall be the policy of states party to this compact that no patient shall be placed or detained in any prison, jail or lockup, but such patient shall, with all expedition, be taken to a suitable institutional facility for mental illness or mental deficiency.\n\n(a) Each party state shall appoint a “compact administrator” who, on behalf of his state, shall act as general coordinator of activities under the compact in his state and who shall receive copies of all reports, correspondence, and other documents relating to any patient processed under the compact by his state either in the capacity of sending or receiving state. The compact administrator or his duly designated representative shall be the official with whom other party states shall deal in any matter relating to the compact or any patient processed thereunder.\n\n(b) The compact administrators of the respective party states shall have power to promulgate reasonable rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this compact.\n\nThe duly constituted administrative authorities of any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements for the provision of any service or facility or for the maintenance of any institution on a joint or cooperative basis whenever the states concerned shall find that such agreements will improve services, facilities, or institutional care and treatment in the fields of mental illness or mental deficiency. No such supplementary agreement shall be construed so as to relieve any party state of any obligation which it otherwise would have under other provisions of this compact.\n\nArticle XII\n\nThis compact shall enter into full force and effect as to any state when enacted by it into law and such state shall thereafter be a party thereto with any and all states legally joining therein.\n\nArticle XIII\n\n(a) A state party to this compact may withdraw therefrom by enacting a statute repealing the same. Such withdrawal shall take effect one year after notice thereof has been communicated officially and in writing to the governors and compact administrators of all other party states. However, the withdrawal of any state shall not change the status of any patient who has been sent to said state or sent out of said state pursuant to the provisions of the compact.\n\n(b) Withdrawal from any agreement permitted by Article VII (b) as to costs or from any supplementary agreement made pursuant to Article XI shall be in accordance with the terms of such agreement.\n\nArticle XIV\n\nThis compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\n\n(November, 1955, S.
