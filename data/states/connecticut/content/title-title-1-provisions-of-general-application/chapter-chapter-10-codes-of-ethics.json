      "text": "(a)(1) Upon the complaint of any person on a form prescribed by the board, signed under penalty of false statement, or upon its own complaint, the ethics enforcement officer of the Office of State Ethics shall investigate any alleged violation of this part, section 1-101bb or section 1-101nn. Not later than five days after the receipt or issuance of such complaint, the board shall provide notice of such receipt or issuance and a copy of the complaint by registered or certified mail to any respondent against whom such complaint is filed and shall provide notice of the receipt of such complaint to the complainant. When the ethics enforcement officer of the Office of State Ethics undertakes an evaluation of a possible violation of this part, section 1-101bb or section 1-101nn prior to the filing of a complaint, the subject of the evaluation shall be notified not later than five business days after an Office of State Ethics staff member's first contact with a third party concerning the matter.\n\n(2) In the conduct of its investigation of an alleged violation of this part, section 1-101bb or section 1-101nn, the Office of State Ethics shall have the power to hold hearings, administer oaths, examine witnesses and receive oral and documentary evidence. The Office of State Ethics may subpoena witnesses under procedural rules adopted by the Citizen's Ethics Advisory Board as regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 to compel attendance before the Office of State Ethics and to require the production for examination by the ethics enforcement officer of the Office of State Ethics of any books and papers which the Office of State Ethics deems relevant in any matter under investigation or in question, provided any such subpoena is issued either pursuant to a majority vote of the Citizen's Ethics Advisory Board or pursuant to the signature of the chairperson of such board. The vice-chairperson of such board may sign any such subpoena if the chairperson of such board is unavailable. In the exercise of such powers, the Office of State Ethics may use the services of the state police, who shall provide the same upon the office's request. The Office of State Ethics shall make a record of all proceedings conducted pursuant to this subsection. The ethics enforcement officer of the Office of State Ethics may bring any alleged violation of this part before a judge trial referee assigned by the Chief Court Administrator for such purpose for a probable cause hearing. Such judge trial referee shall be compensated in accordance with the provisions of section 52-434 from such funds as may be available to the Office of State Ethics. Any witness summoned before the Office of State Ethics or a judge trial referee pursuant to this subsection shall receive the witness fee paid to witnesses in the courts of this state. During any investigation conducted pursuant to this subsection or any probable cause hearing conducted pursuant to this subsection, the respondent shall have the right to appear and be heard and to offer any information which may tend to clear the respondent of probable cause to believe the respondent has violated any provision of this part, section 1-101bb or section 1-101nn. The respondent shall also have the right to be represented by legal counsel and to examine and cross-examine witnesses. Not later than ten days prior to the commencement of any hearing conducted pursuant to this subsection, the Office of State Ethics shall provide the respondent with a list of its intended witnesses. Any finding of probable cause to believe the respondent is in violation of any provisions of this part shall be made by a judge trial referee not later than thirty days after the ethics enforcement officer brings such alleged violation before such judge trial referee, except that such thirty-day limitation period shall not apply if the judge trial referee determines that good cause exists for extending such limitation period.\n\n(b) If a judge trial referee determines that probable cause exists for the violation of a provision of this part, section 1-101bb or section 1-101nn, the board shall initiate hearings to determine whether there has been a violation of this part, section 1-101bb or section 1-101nn. Any such hearing shall be initiated by the board not later than thirty days after the finding of probable cause by a judge trial referee and shall be concluded not later than ninety days after its initiation, except that such thirty or ninety-day limitation period shall not apply if the judge trial referee determines that good cause exists for extending such limitation period. A judge trial referee, who has not taken part in the probable cause determination on the matter shall be assigned by the Chief Court Administrator and shall be compensated in accordance with section 52-434 out of funds available to the Office of State Ethics. Such judge trial referee shall preside over such hearing and rule on all issues concerning the application of the rules of evidence, which shall be the same as in judicial proceedings. The judge trial referee shall have no vote in any decision of the board. All hearings of the board held pursuant to this subsection shall be open. At such hearing the board shall have the same powers as the Office of State Ethics under subsection (a) of this section and the respondent shall have the right to be represented by legal counsel, to compel attendance of witnesses and the production of books, documents, records and papers and to examine and cross-examine witnesses. Not later than ten days prior to the commencement of any hearing conducted pursuant to this subsection, the Office of State Ethics shall provide the respondent with a list of its intended witnesses. The judge trial referee shall, while engaged in the discharge of the duties as provided in this subsection, have the same authority as is provided in section 51-35 over witnesses who refuse to obey a subpoena or to testify with respect to any matter upon which such witness may be lawfully interrogated, and may commit any such witness for contempt for a period no longer than thirty days. The Office of State Ethics shall make a record of all proceedings pursuant to this subsection. During the course of any such hearing, no ex-parte communication shall occur between the board, or any of its members, and: (1) The judge trial referee, or (2) any staff member of the Enforcement Division of the Office of State Ethics, concerning the complaint or the respondent. The board shall find no person in violation of any provision of this part, section 1-101bb or section 1-101nn except upon the concurring vote of two-thirds of its members present and voting. No member of the board shall vote on the question of whether a violation of any provision of this part has occurred unless such member was physically present for the duration of any hearing held pursuant to this subsection. Not later than forty-five days after the public hearing conducted in accordance with this subsection, the board shall publish its finding and a memorandum of the reasons therefor. Such finding and memorandum shall be deemed to be the final decision of the board on the matter for the purposes of chapter 54. The respondent, if aggrieved by the finding and memorandum, may appeal therefrom to the Superior Court in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183.\n\n(c) If a judge trial referee finds, after a hearing pursuant to this section, that there is no probable cause to believe that a public official or state employee has violated a provision of this part, section 1-101bb or section 1-101nn, or if the board determines that a public official or state employee has not violated any such provision, or if a court of competent jurisdiction overturns a finding by the board of a violation by such a respondent, the state shall pay the reasonable legal expenses of the respondent as determined by the Attorney General or by the court if appropriate. If any complaint brought under the provisions of this part, section 1-101bb or section 1-101nn is made with the knowledge that it is made without foundation in fact, the respondent shall have a cause of action against the complainant for double the amount of damage caused thereby and, if the respondent prevails in such action, the respondent may be awarded by the court the costs of such action together with reasonable attorneys' fees.\n\n(d) No complaint may be made under this section later than five years after the violation alleged in the complaint has been committed.\n\n(e) No person shall take or threaten to take official action against an individual for such individual's disclosure of information to the board or the general counsel, ethics enforcement officer or staff of the Office of State Ethics under the provisions of this part, section 1-101bb or section 1-101nn. After receipt of information from an individual under the provisions of this part, section 1-101bb or section 1-101nn, the Office of State Ethics shall not disclose the identity of such individual without such individual's consent unless the Office of State Ethics determines that such disclosure is unavoidable during the course of an investigation. No person shall be subject to civil liability for any good faith disclosure that such person makes to the Office of State Ethics.\n\n(P.A. 77-600, S. 4, 15; 77-605, S. 16, 21; 77-614, S. 486, 587, 610; P.A. 78-303, S. 85, 136; P.A. 79-493, S. 4, 9; P.A. 81-296, S. 1; P.A. 83-249, S. 5, 14; 83-586, S. 2, 14; June Sp.

      "text": "(a)(1) Upon the complaint of any person on a form prescribed by the Office of State Ethics, signed under penalty of false statement, or upon its own complaint, the ethics enforcement officer of the Office of State Ethics shall investigate any alleged violation of this part or section 1-101bb. Not later than five days after the receipt or issuance of such complaint, the Office of State Ethics shall provide notice of such receipt or issuance and a copy of the complaint by registered or certified mail to any respondent against whom such complaint is filed and shall provide notice of the receipt of such complaint to the complainant. When the Office of State Ethics undertakes an evaluation of a possible violation of this part or section 1-101bb prior to the filing of a complaint, the subject of the evaluation shall be notified not later than five business days after a staff member of the Office of State Ethics undertakes the first contact with a third party concerning the matter.\n\n(2) In the conduct of its investigation of an alleged violation of this part, the Office of State Ethics shall have the power to hold hearings, administer oaths, examine witnesses and receive oral and documentary evidence. The Office of State Ethics may subpoena witnesses under procedural rules adopted by the Citizen's Ethics Advisory Board as regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 to compel attendance before the Office of State Ethics and to require the production for examination by the ethics enforcement officer of the Office of State Ethics of any books and papers which the ethics enforcement officer of the Office of State Ethics deems relevant in any matter under investigation or in question, provided any such subpoena is issued either pursuant to a majority vote of the Citizen's Ethics Advisory Board or pursuant to the signature of the chairperson of such board. The vice-chairperson of such board may sign any such subpoena if the chairperson of such board is unavailable. In the exercise of such powers, the Office of State Ethics may use the services of the state police, who shall provide the same upon the office's request. The Office of State Ethics shall make a record of all proceedings conducted pursuant to this subsection. Any witness summoned before the Office of State Ethics or a judge trial referee pursuant to this subsection shall receive the witness fee paid to witnesses in the courts of this state. The ethics enforcement officer of the Office of State Ethics may bring any alleged violation of this part or section 1-101bb before a judge trial referee assigned by the Chief Court Administrator for such purpose for a probable cause hearing. Such judge trial referee shall be compensated in accordance with the provisions of section 52-434 from such funds as may be available to the Office of State Ethics. The respondent shall have the right to appear at any hearing held pursuant to this subsection and be heard and to offer any information which may tend to clear the respondent of probable cause to believe the respondent has violated any provision of this part or section 1-101bb. The respondent shall also have the right to be represented by legal counsel and to examine and cross-examine witnesses. Not later than ten days prior to the commencement of any hearing conducted pursuant to this subsection, the Office of State Ethics shall provide the respondent with a list of its intended witnesses. Any finding of probable cause to believe the respondent is in violation of any provision of this part or section 1-101bb shall be made by a judge trial referee not later than thirty days after the ethics enforcement officer brings such alleged violation before such judge trial referee, except that such thirty-day limitation period shall not apply if the judge trial referee determines that good cause exists for extending such limitation period.\n\n(b) If a judge trial referee indicates that probable cause exists for the violation of a provision of this part or section 1-101bb, the board shall initiate hearings to determine whether there has been a violation of this part or section 1-101bb. Any such hearing shall be initiated by the board not later than thirty days after the finding of probable cause by a judge trial referee and shall be concluded not later than ninety days after its initiation, except that such thirty-day or ninety-day limitation period shall not apply if the judge trial referee determines that good cause exists for extending such limitation period. A judge trial referee, who has not taken part in the probable cause determination on the matter shall be assigned by the Chief Court Administrator and shall be compensated in accordance with section 52-434 out of funds available to the board. Such judge trial referee shall preside over such hearing and rule on all issues concerning the application of the rules of evidence, which shall be the same as in judicial proceedings. The judge trial referee shall have no vote in any decision of the board. All hearings of the board held pursuant to this subsection shall be open. At such hearing the board shall have the same powers as the Office of State Ethics under subsection (a) of this section and the respondent shall have the right to be represented by legal counsel, to compel attendance of witnesses and the production of books, documents, records and papers and to examine and cross-examine witnesses. Not later than ten days prior to the commencement of any hearing conducted pursuant to this subsection, the Office of State Ethics shall provide the respondent with a list of its intended witnesses. The judge trial referee shall, while engaged in the discharge of the duties as provided in this subsection, have the same authority as is provided in section 51-35 over witnesses who refuse to obey a subpoena or to testify with respect to any matter upon which such witness may be lawfully interrogated, and may commit any such witness for contempt for a period no longer than thirty days. The Office of State Ethics shall make a record of all proceedings pursuant to this subsection. During the course of any such hearing, no ex-parte communication shall occur between the board, or any of its members, and: (1) The judge trial referee, or (2) any staff member of the Enforcement Division of the Office of State Ethics, concerning the complaint or the respondent. The board shall find no person in violation of any provision of this part or section 1-101bb except upon the concurring vote of two-thirds of its members present and voting. No member of the board shall vote on the question of whether a violation of any provision of this part or section 1-101bb has occurred unless such member was physically present for the duration of any hearing held pursuant to this subsection. Not later than forty-five days after the public hearing conducted in accordance with this subsection, the board shall publish its finding and a memorandum of the reasons therefor. Such finding and memorandum shall be deemed to be the final decision of the board on the matter for the purposes of chapter 54. The respondent, if aggrieved by the finding and memorandum, may appeal therefrom to the Superior Court in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183.\n\n(c) If any complaint brought under the provisions of this part or section 1-101bb is made with the knowledge that it is made without foundation in fact, the respondent shall have a cause of action against the complainant for double the amount of damage caused thereby and if the respondent prevails in such action, the respondent may be awarded by the court the costs of such action together with reasonable attorneys' fees.\n\n(d) No complaint may be made under this section except within five years next after the violation alleged in the complaint has been committed.\n\n(e) No person shall take or threaten to take official action against an individual for such individual's disclosure of information to the board or the general counsel, ethics enforcement officer or staff of the Office of State Ethics under the provisions of this part or section 1-101bb. After receipt of information from an individual under the provisions of this part, the Office of State Ethics shall not disclose the identity of such individual without such person's consent unless the Office of State Ethics determines that such disclosure is unavoidable during the course of an investigation.\n\n(P.A. 77-605, S. 4, 21; 77-614, S. 486, 587, 610; P.A. 78-303, S. 85, 136; P.A. 79-615, S. 3, 10; P.A. 81-296, S. 2; P.A. 83-586, S. 10, 14; P.A. 84-52, S. 3; 84-519, S. 2; 84-546, S. 145, 173; P.A. 85-290, S. 5; June 12 Sp.
