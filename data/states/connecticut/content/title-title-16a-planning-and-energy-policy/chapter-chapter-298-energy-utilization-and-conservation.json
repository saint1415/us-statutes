      "text": "The General Assembly finds that the state of Connecticut is severely disadvantaged by its lack of primary energy resources; that primarily as a result of past policies and tendencies, the state has become dependent upon petroleum as an energy source; that national energy policies do not preclude the recurrence of serious problems arising from this dependence during petroleum shortages; that the increase in oil prices since the 1973 oil embargo has had a major impact on the state; that the economy has suffered directly because of our dependence on petroleum and constraints upon the rate of conversion to alternatives; that other conventional sources of energy are subject to constraints involving supply, transportation, cost and environmental, health and safety considerations; and that the state must address these problems by conserving energy, increasing the efficiency of energy utilization and developing renewable energy sources. The General Assembly further finds that energy use has a profound impact on the society, economy and environment of the state, particularly in its impact on low and moderate-income households and interrelationship with population growth, high density urbanization, industrial well-being, resource utilization, technological development and social advancement, and that energy is critically important to the overall welfare and development of our society. Therefore, the General Assembly declares that it is the policy of the state of Connecticut to (1) conserve energy resources by avoiding unnecessary and wasteful consumption; (2) consume energy resources in the most efficient manner feasible; (3) develop and utilize renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind energy, to the maximum practicable extent; (4) diversify the state's energy supply mix; (5) where practicable, replace energy resources vulnerable to interruption due to circumstances beyond the state's control with those less vulnerable; (6) assist citizens and businesses in implementing measures to reduce energy consumption and costs; (7) ensure that low-income households can meet essential energy needs; (8) maintain planning and preparedness capabilities necessary to deal effectively with future energy supply interruptions; and (9) when available energy alternatives are equivalent, give preference for capacity additions first to conservation and load management. The state shall seek all possible ways to implement this policy through public education and cooperative efforts involving the federal government, regional organizations, municipal governments, other public and private organizations and concerned individuals, using all practical means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated to promote the general welfare by creating and maintaining conditions under which energy can be utilized effectively and efficiently. The General Assembly further declares that it is the continuing responsibility of the state to use all means consistent with other essential considerations of state policy to improve and coordinate the plans, functions, programs and resources of the state to attain the objectives stated herein without harm to the environment, risk to health or safety or other undesirable or unintended consequences, to preserve wherever possible a society which supports a diversity and variety of individual choice, to achieve a balance between population and resource use which will permit the maintenance of adequate living standards and a sharing of life's amenities among all citizens, and to enhance the utilization of renewable resources so that the availability of nonrenewable resources can be extended to future generations. The General Assembly declares that the energy policy is essential to the preservation and enhancement of the health, safety and general welfare of the people of the state and that its implementation therefore constitutes a significant and valid public purpose for all state actions.\n\n(P.A. 78-262, S. 1, 2; P.A. 79-449, S. 1, 7; P.A. 82-222, S. 1, 7; P.A. 92-106, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 79-449 amended section to point out constraints on conversion to alternative forms of energy, including conventional sources of energy and to include consideration of development of renewable forms of energy; P.A. 82-222 applied energy policy to diversification, energy costs and supply interruptions and to all state actions; P.A. 92-106 added a new Subdiv. (9) providing preference to conservation over other equivalent energy alternatives.\n\nCited. 20 CA 474.",

The Energy Conservation Management Board, in consultation with the Office of Policy and Management, shall create promotional materials to explain the energy-savings performance contract program.\n\n(d) The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection may fix, charge and collect fees to cover costs incurred for any administrative support and resources or services provided under this section from the state agencies and participating municipalities that use its technical support services. State agencies and participating municipalities may add the costs of these fees to the total cost of the energy-savings performance contract. All such fees shall be disclosed prior to services being rendered. Any participating municipality may opt out of the state energy-savings performance contract process rather than incur such fees. Initial administrative funding to establish and manage the energy-savings performance contracting process for state agencies and participating municipalities shall be recovered from the Energy Conservation Management Board.\n\n(e) The standardized energy-savings performance contract process for state agencies and participating municipalities shall include requests for qualifications or requests for proposals.\n\n(1) The Department of Administrative Services, in consultation with the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, shall issue a request for qualifications from companies that can offer energy-savings performance contract services to create a list of qualified energy service providers. A state agency shall use the qualified list. A municipality may use the qualified list or establish its own qualification process.\n\n(2) When reviewing requests for qualifications, the department shall consider a company's experience with (A) design, engineering, installation, maintenance and repairs associated with energy-savings performance contracts; (B) conversions to a different energy or fuel source, associated with a comprehensive energy efficiency retrofit; (C) post-installation project monitoring, data collection and reporting of savings; (D) overall project management and qualifications; (E) accessing long-term financing; (F) financial stability; (G) projects of similar size and scope; (H) in-state projects and Connecticut-based subcontractors; (I) United States Department of Energy programs; (J) professional certifications; and (K) other factors determined by the department to be relevant and appropriate.\n\n(3) Before entering into an energy-savings performance contract pursuant to this section, a state agency or participating municipality shall issue a request for proposals from three or more qualified energy service providers. A state agency or participating municipality may award the energy-savings performance contract to the qualified energy service provider that best meets the needs of the state agency or participating municipality, which need not be the lowest cost provided. A cost-effective feasibility analysis shall be prepared in response to the request for proposals.\n\n(4) The cost-effective feasibility analysis included in the response to the request for proposals shall serve as the selection document for purposes of selecting a qualified energy service provider to engage in final contract negotiations. Factors to be included in selecting among the qualified energy service providers shall include, but not be limited to, (A) contract terms, (B) comprehensiveness of the proposal, (C) financial stability of the provider, (D) comprehensiveness of cost savings measures, (E) experience and quality of technical approach, and (F) overall benefits to the state agency or municipality.\n\n(f) One qualified energy service provider selected as a result of the request for proposals set forth in subsection (e) of this section shall prepare an investment-grade audit, which, upon acceptance, shall be part of the final energy-savings performance contract entered into by the state agency or participating municipality. Such investment-grade energy audit shall include estimates of the amounts by which utility cost savings and operation and maintenance cost savings would increase and estimates of all costs of such utility cost savings measures or energy-savings measures, including, but not limited to, (1) itemized costs of design, (2) engineering, (3) equipment, (4) materials, (5) installation, (6) maintenance, (7) repairs, and (8) debt service. The qualified energy service provider and the state agency or participating municipality shall agree on the cost of the investment-grade audit before it is conducted. If, after preparation of the investment-grade audit, the state agency or participating municipality decides not to execute an energy-savings performance contract and the costs and benefits described in the investment-grade audit are not materially different from those described in the cost-effective feasibility analysis submitted in response to the request for proposals, the state agency or participating municipality shall pay the costs incurred in preparing such investment-grade audit. In all other instances, the costs of the investment-grade audit shall be deemed part of the costs of the energy-savings performance contract.\n\n(g) The guidelines adopted pursuant to this section may require that the cost savings projected by the qualified provider be reviewed by a professional engineer licensed in this state who has a minimum of three years experience in energy calculation and review, is not an officer or employee of a qualified provider for the contract under review, and is not otherwise associated with the contract. In conducting the review, the engineer shall focus primarily on the proposed improvements from an engineering perspective, the methodology and calculations related to cost savings, increases in revenue, and, if applicable, efficiency or accuracy of metering equipment. An engineer who reviews a contract shall maintain the confidentiality of any proprietary information the engineer acquires while reviewing the contract.\n\n(h) A municipality may use funds designated for operating and capital expenditures or utilities for any energy-savings performance contract, including, but not limited to, contracts entered into pursuant to this section.\n\n(i) A guaranteed energy-savings performance contract may provide for financing, including tax exempt financing, by a third party. The contract for third-party financing may be separate from the energy-savings performance contract. A state agency or participating municipality may use designated funds, bonds, lease purchase agreements or master lease for any energy-savings performance contracts, provided its use is consistent with the purpose of the appropriation.\n\n(j) Each energy-savings performance contract shall provide that all payments between parties, except obligations on termination of the contract before its expiration, shall be made over time and the objective of such energy-savings performance contracts is implementation of cost savings measures and energy and operational cost savings.\n\n(k) An energy-savings performance contract, and payments provided thereunder, may extend beyond the fiscal year in which the energy-savings performance contract became effective, subject to appropriation of moneys, if required by law, for costs incurred in future fiscal years. The energy-savings performance contract may extend for a term not to exceed twenty years. The allowable length of the contract may also reflect the useful life of the cost savings measures. An energy-savings performance contract may provide for payments over a period not to exceed deadlines specified in the energy-savings performance contract from the date of the final installation of the cost savings measures.\n\n(l) The energy-savings performance contract may provide that reconciliation of the amounts owed under the energy-savings performance contract shall occur in a period beyond one year with final reconciliation occurring within the term of the energy-savings performance contract. An energy-savings performance contract shall include contingency provisions in the event that actual savings do not meet predicted savings.\n\n(m) The energy-savings performance contract shall require the qualified energy service provider to provide to the state agency or participating municipality an annual reconciliation of the guaranteed energy cost savings. If the reconciliation reveals a shortfall in annual energy cost savings, the qualified energy service provider shall make payment to the state agency or participating municipality in the amount of the shortfall. If the reconciliation reveals an excess in annual energy cost savings, the excess savings shall remain with the state agency or municipality, and shall not be used to cover potential energy cost savings shortages in subsequent years or actual energy cost savings shortages in previous contract years.\n\n(n) During the term of each energy performance contract, the qualified energy service provider shall monitor the reductions in energy consumption and cost savings attributable to the cost savings measures installed pursuant to the energy-savings performance contract and shall, not less than annually, prepare and provide a report to the state agency or participating municipality documenting the performance of the cost savings measures to the state agency or participating municipality. The report shall adhere to the most current version of the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol.\n\n(o) The qualified energy service provider and state agency or participating municipality may agree to modify savings calculations based on any of the following:\n\n(1) Subsequent material change to the baseline energy consumption identified at the beginning of the energy-savings performance contract;\n\n(2) Changes in the number of days in the utility billing cycle;\n\n(3) Changes in the total square footage of the building;\n\n(4) Changes in the operational schedule of the facility;\n\n(5) Changes in facility temperature;\n\n(6) Material change in the weather;\n\n(7) Material changes in the amount of equipment or lighting used at the facility; or\n\n(8) Any other change which reasonably would be expected to modify energy use or energy costs.\n\n(p) Any state agency or participating municipality that enters into an energy-savings performance contract pursuant to this section shall report the name of the project, the project host, the investment on the project and the expected energy savings to the Office of Policy and Management and the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. Such reporting shall be done at the same time that the energy-savings performance contract is executed.\n\n(q) A state agency or participating municipality may direct savings realized under the energy-savings performance contract to contract payment and other required expenses and may, when practicable, reinvest savings beyond that required for contract payment and other required expenses into additional energy-savings measures.\n\n(P.A. 11-80, S. 123; P.A. 16-173, S. 3.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 11-80 effective July 1, 2011; P.A. 16-173 redefined “cost effective” in Subsec.

The State Bond Commission shall establish a range of rates of interest payable on loans pursuant to subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of this subsection and shall apply the range to applicants in accordance with a formula which reflects their income. Such range shall be not less than zero per cent for any applicant in the lowest income class and not more than one per cent above the rate of interest borne by the general obligation bonds of the state last issued prior to the most recent date such range was established for any applicant for whom the adjusted gross income of the household member or members who contribute to the support of his household does not exceed one hundred ten per cent of the median area income by household size.\n\n(c) The commissioner shall establish a program under which he shall make funds deposited in the Energy Conservation Loan Fund available for low-cost loans or deferred loans under subsection (a) of this section for residential structures containing more than four dwelling units, or for contracts guaranteeing payment of loans or deferred loans provided by private institutions for such structures for the purposes specified under subsection (a) of this section. Any such loan or deferred loan shall be an amount equaling not more than three thousand five hundred dollars multiplied by the number of dwelling units in such structure, provided no such loan or deferred loan shall exceed one hundred thousand dollars. If the applicant seeks a loan or deferred loan for a structure containing more than thirty dwelling units, he shall include in his application a commitment to make comparable energy improvements of benefit to all dwelling units in the structure in addition to the thirty units which are eligible for the loan or deferred loan. Applications for contracts of guarantee shall be limited to structures containing not more than thirty dwelling units and the amount of the guarantee shall be not more than three thousand dollars for each dwelling unit benefiting from the loan or deferred loan.

Such benefit assessment lien, shall be paid in installments and each installment payment shall be collected in the same manner as the property taxes of the participating municipality on real property, including, in the event of default or delinquency, with respect to any penalties, fees and remedies. Each such benefit assessment lien may be recorded and released in the manner provided for property tax liens and shall take precedence over all other liens or encumbrances except a lien for taxes of the municipality on real property, which lien for taxes shall have priority over such benefit assessment lien, and provided that the precedence of such benefit assessment lien over any lien held by an existing mortgage holder shall be subject to the written consent of such existing mortgage holder. To the extent any benefit assessment lien installment is not paid when due, the benefit assessment lien may be foreclosed to the extent of any unpaid installment payments due and owing and any penalties, interest and fees related thereto. In the event a benefit assessment lien is foreclosed or a lien for taxes of the municipality on real property is foreclosed or enforced by levy and sale in accordance with chapter 204, the benefit assessment lien shall be extinguished solely with regard to any installments that were due and owing on the date of the judgment of such foreclosure or levy and sale and the benefit assessment lien shall otherwise survive such judgment or levy and sale to the extent of any unpaid installment payments of the benefit assessment secured by such benefit assessment lien that are due after the date of such judgment or levy and sale.\n\n(h) Any participating municipality may assign to the bank any and all benefit assessment liens filed by the participating municipality, as provided in the written agreement between the participating municipality and the bank. The bank may sell or assign, for consideration, any and all benefit assessment liens received from the participating municipality. The consideration received by the bank shall be negotiated between the bank and the assignee. The assignee or assignees of such benefit assessment liens shall have and possess the same powers and rights at law or in equity as the bank and the participating municipality and its tax collector would have had if the benefit assessment lien had not been assigned with regard to the precedence and priority of such benefit assessment lien, the accrual of interest and the fees and expenses of collection. The assignee shall have the same rights to enforce such benefit assessment liens as any private party holding a lien on real property, including, but not limited to, foreclosure and a suit on the debt. Costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the assignee as a result of any foreclosure action or other legal proceeding brought pursuant to this section and directly related to the proceeding shall be taxed in any such proceeding against each person having title to any property subject to the proceedings.
