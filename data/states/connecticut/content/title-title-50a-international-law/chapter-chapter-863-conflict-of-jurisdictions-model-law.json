The courts of this state shall enforce the judgments of the designated adjudicating forum in accordance with the provisions of chapter 861. The selection of the adjudicating forum shall be accorded presumptive validity in this state if the written decision determining the adjudicating forum evaluated the substance of the factors set forth in section 50a-202.\n\n(d) Where no conclusive determination has been made by another court as provided in this section, the proper adjudicating forum shall be determined in accordance with sections 50a-202 and 50a-203 by the courts of this state requested to enforce the judgment.\n\n(P.A. 91-324, S. 11.)",
