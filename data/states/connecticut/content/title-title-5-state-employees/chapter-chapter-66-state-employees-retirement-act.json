The Retirement Commission shall, on or before December first, annually certify to the General Assembly the amount necessary on the basis of an actuarial determination to gradually establish and subsequently maintain the retirement fund on such determined actuarial reserve basis, and make such other recommendations with regard to such fund and its administration as the commission deems appropriate. The Retirement Commission shall, at least once every two years, prepare a valuation of the assets and liabilities of the system. On the basis of each such valuation, it shall redetermine the normal rate of contribution and, until it is amortized, the unfunded past service liability. The General Assembly shall review the commission's recommendations and certification and shall appropriate to the retirement fund the amount certified by the Retirement Commission as necessary provided said certification is in compliance with this section at the time of certification, and the amount so certified shall not be reduced or used for other than the purposes of this section.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the Retirement Commission shall not finalize any valuation prepared pursuant to said subdivision, or certify the amount necessary to maintain the retirement fund on an actuarial reserve basis pursuant to said subdivision, until such valuation and certification account for any funds deemed to be appropriated to the State Employees Retirement Fund pursuant to subsection (c) of section 4-30a.\n\n(b) The Retirement Commission shall determine on an actuarial basis (1) a normal rate of contribution which the state shall be required to make into the retirement fund in order to meet the actuarial cost of current service and (2) the unfunded past service liability. For the first sixteen years, the funding program for the actuarial reserve basis shall consist of the following percentages of the sum of normal cost and the amount required for a forty-year amortization of unfunded liabilities:\n\nFiscal YearBeginningPercentage to be paid of normal costplus full 40-year amortizationfrom the beginning of such fiscal year7-1-71307-1-72357-1-73407-1-74457-1-75457-1-76507-1-77557-1-78607-1-79657-1-80707-1-81757-1-82807-1-83857-1-84907-1-85957-1-861007-1-871007-1-88100\n\nprovided said state payments shall not be reduced or diverted to any purpose other than the payment into the retirement fund until the foregoing schedule of payments has been completed and said fund is determined to be actuarially sound.\n\n(c) Transfer of appropriated amounts from the General Fund to the retirement fund shall be made in equal monthly payments during the fiscal year.\n\n(d) No act liberalizing the benefits of the plan shall be enacted by the General Assembly until the assembly has requested and received from the Retirement Commission a certification of the cost of such change under the actuarial funding basis adopted by section 5-154 and this section using full normal cost plus forty-year amortization.\n\n(e) There shall be a valuation of the assets and liabilities of the system as of December 31, 1983, June 30, 1985, and June 30, 1986. The valuation of the assets and liabilities of the system as of December 31, 1983, shall reflect, to the greatest extent possible, any transfers made pursuant to section 5-158h and any service credits purchased by the date of the valuation.\n\n(f) The same actuarial cost method and assumptions as were employed in determining the certification for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1982, shall be utilized for the annual Retirement Commission certification of the amount necessary to fund the system prior to the December 31, 1983, valuation, but shall reflect the increases in percentage indicated in subsection (b) of this section. The certification resulting from the December 31, 1982, valuation shall not estimate or otherwise reflect the effect of any contractual changes to the retirement system approved by the General Assembly on June 30, 1982, and effective on October 1, 1982.\n\n(g) For any appropriation based on an actuarial valuation undertaken on or after December 31, 1983, the Retirement Commission shall separately indicate the actuarial cost of current service for the members of tier II. Such current service cost for tier II members shall be one hundred per cent funded. All other funding shall be in accordance with the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section.\n\n(h) Any recovery of pension costs from an appropriated or nonappropriated source other than the General Fund or Special Transportation Fund that causes the payments to the State Employees Retirement System to exceed the actuarially determined employer contribution for any fiscal year shall be deposited into the State Employees Retirement Fund as an additional employer contribution at the end of such fiscal year.\n\n(1971, P.A. 666, S. 2; 1972, P.A. 71, S. 2; P.A. 75-581, S. 4, 6; P.A. 76-233, S. 1, 2; P.A. 77-390, S. 5, 8; P.A. 78-367, S. 1, 3; P.A. 83-533, S. 4, 54; P.A. 85-422, S. 1, 2; June Sp.

The investment return for the fund shall be calculated by the following formula:\n\nA is the market value of the fund, including any due but unpaid contribution, as of the first day of the fiscal year;\n\nB is the market value of the fund, including any due but unpaid contribution, as of the last day of the fiscal year; and\n\nI is the market value return of the fund, which shall be equal to B reduced by A, but increased by the total amount of benefits and expenses paid from the fund during the year, and decreased by the total amount of employer and employee contributions for that year, whether or not paid;\n\n(B) The market value of the system's assets as of the appropriate June thirtieth was greater than fifty per cent of the sum of (i) the liability for retired members and their beneficiaries; (ii) the liability for former members entitled to a deferred vested benefit; and (iii) the then current value of employee contributions, plus interest, for active members. In determining such liabilities, the fund's actuary shall recognize future cost-of-living adjustments provided under tier I and tier II and shall employ the actuarial assumptions utilized for regular valuation purposes. The actuary may utilize reasonable estimates to make such calculations; and\n\n(C) The actual unfunded past service liability of the system as of the appropriate June thirtieth was less than the expected unfunded past service liability as indicated by the table developed pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection for the June thirtieth five years later. In determining the actual unfunded past service liability, the actuary shall employ the actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized for the last regular valuation.

Three of such members, one of whom shall be the elected chairman or the elected secretary of the board, shall constitute a quorum for the determination of any applicant's entitlement. The chairman or the secretary shall report the findings of the board to the Retirement Commission from time to time as requested by the commission as to the entitlement of each applicant or the continuance of disability of members so retired.

In such event, such member shall receive credit for the years he was disabled, subject to a maximum total credit of twenty-five years or actual years of service to the date of disability, whichever is greater. Such member shall then (1) retire on normal or early retirement, if eligible, or (2) retain a vested right to a deferred pension, if eligible.\n\n(f) No credit for a period of service of any kind prior to the months in which contribution therefor is made shall be given under this chapter or any special act in determining state service in connection with an application for disability retirement other than for injury received in performance of duty as a state employee, if such disability occurred within five years after payment of a single lump sum or commencement of payroll deductions pursuant to subsection (c) of section 5-167. The foregoing limitation shall not apply to credit obtained immediately after transfer from the teachers' retirement system under section 10-183p for service previously credited in said system; but in that case no benefit for retirement on account of disability occurring within such five-year period, other than for injury received in performance of duty as a state employee, shall exceed the benefit which would have been payable by said system if transfer had not been made.\n\n(g) Twenty per cent of all outside earned salary or wages shall be offset against the disability retirement payments by the state during the first two years of disability.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the following maximum benefit limitations shall apply if the member's date of disability occurs on or after January 1, 1984.

To verify the operation of the maximums, members shall authorize the Social Security Administration to provide the Retirement Commission, on an ongoing basis, any information with regard to covered earnings or Social Security benefits payable. In the event both of the maximums indicated below apply, the lesser disability benefit shall be payable. Such maximums shall be subject to reexamination annually, as indicated in subsection (h) of this section.\n\n(1) The disability benefit provided under this section shall not exceed one hundred per cent of the member's base salary or the rate of salary of the member on his date of disability, whichever is greater, less any periodic cash benefit payments being made to a member under the Workers' Compensation Act, less any federal disability Social Security benefits, including primary and family, paid on account of the member's Social Security earnings history, less all outside earned salary or wages, unless the Retirement Commission determines that such salary or wages are being paid as part of the rehabilitation of the disabled member. Any such determination that such earned salary or wages is for rehabilitation must be reapproved by the Retirement Commission no less frequently than every eighteen months, or the offset shall apply. The offset for workers' compensation and federal Social Security disability benefits shall apply when such benefits commence even if such benefits initially commence after the member's disability retirement date.\n\n(2) The disability benefit provided under this section shall not exceed eighty per cent of the member's base salary or the rate of salary of the member on the date of disability, whichever is greater, less any periodic cash benefit payments being made to a member under the Workers' Compensation Act, less any federal disability Social Security benefits, including primary and family, being paid on account of the member's Social Security earnings history. The offsets shall apply when such benefits commence even if such benefits initially commence after the member's disability retirement date.\n\n(3) The offsets for workers' compensation and federal Social Security disability benefits shall be reduced by the amount of any attorney's fees a member incurs to obtain such benefits.\n\n(h) As of each anniversary date, as defined in section 5-162d, of such retired employee, the benefits provided under this section shall be subject to the following adjustments: (1) The benefits provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall be subject to the increase provided in section 5-162d or 5-162h, whichever is appropriate; (2) the net maximum benefit provided in subdivision (2) of subsection (g) of this section shall be subject to the increase provided in section 5-162d or 5-162h, whichever is appropriate; (3) this subdivision shall apply only to the maximum benefit provided in subdivision (1) of subsection (g) of this section which shall only be considered if the member had outside earned salary or wages. The salary as described in subdivision (1) of subsection (g) of this section shall be increased by the percentage compensation increase that would have applied to an employee in the position and “step” of the member, at the date of disability had that employee continued to be employed and continued automatic progression to the maximum “step” for his classification. On the date of recomputation of benefits, the offsets for workers' compensation and federal Social Security shall be increased by that same percentage or the percentage increase granted under the cost-of-living provision of the Workers' Compensation Act and the Social Security Act respectively, whichever is less. This offset amount shall be adjusted to reflect any change in these benefits other than those resulting from the cost-of-living provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act or the Social Security Act. In no case shall the offset be greater than the actual benefits paid. Outside earned salary or wages shall reflect actual amounts earned during the preceding calendar year. In no event shall the application of this subdivision and subdivision (1) of subsection (g) of this section result in an income from all sources that would be less than the income that would have been paid had the member remained in service and progressed to the maximum “step” for his classification; (4) except as specifically indicated in subdivision (3) of this subsection, the maximum disability income determined under subsection (g) of this section will not be affected, when the workers' compensation benefits or the Social Security benefits are increased by cost-of-living provisions in the Workers' Compensation Act or the Social Security Act; (5) the maximum disability income under subdivision (2) of subsection (g) of this section will be recalculated if either the workers' compensation benefits or the Social Security benefits are decreased or discontinued. Any such recalculated maximum shall not reflect any increases arising after the initial application of the offset because of the cost-of-living provisions in the Workers' Compensation Act or the Social Security Act, except as specifically indicated in subdivision (3) of this subsection.\n\n(i) If a member qualifies for disability compensation under section 5-142, such member shall continue to be credited with service hereunder, and shall not be deemed to have retired until he elects to retire. While the member is receiving compensation under section 5-142, the disability retirement benefits under this section shall be payable only if greater than the compensation paid under section 5-142. In such event, the benefits under this section shall be temporarily reduced by the amount of benefits payable under section 5-142 for the period of receipt of benefits under section 5-142. If a member is granted disability compensation under section 5-142 retroactively for the same period of time such member received disability retirement benefits under this section, such disability compensation benefits shall be reduced by the amount of disability retirement benefits received during such period, except that if the disability retirement benefits received during such period were greater than the retroactive payment of disability compensation benefits for such period, no disability compensation payments shall be paid to the member for such period.\n\n(j) A member whose date of disability occurs prior to January 1, 1984, shall have his benefits calculated in accordance with the provisions of law in effect at the time of such occurrence. A member's date of disability shall be his last date of active employment by the state prior to such disability or the date as of which his benefits under this section are payable, whichever is earlier. A leave of absence for medical reasons shall not be deemed to be active employment.\n\n(k) If after review of all testimony and documentary evidence, including medical reports, presented in connection with any determination or recommendation concerning entitlement to or continuation of disability retirement, any member of the board who believes that an individual was treated by a physician who is or may be unable to practice medicine with reasonable skill or safety, shall file a petition, pursuant to section 20-13d, with the Department of Public Health for investigation under section 20-13e. The record of the board concerning any such petition, and the proceedings of the board in connection therewith, shall remain confidential to the same extent as a record of the Department of Public Health under section 20-13e.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 382; 1951, S. 150d; 1957, P.A. 595, S. 7; 670, S. 1; 1958 Rev., S. 5-101; 1961, P.A. 234, S. 18; 1963, P.A. 399; 407; February, 1965, P.A. 509, S. 1; 1967, P.A. 798; 1971, P.A. 627, S. 1; 628, S. 1, 2; P.A. 75-628, S. 1, 5; P.A. 77-390, S. 4, 8; P.A. 78-208, S. 28, 35; 78-331, S. 32, 58; P.A. 79-376, S. 6; P.A. 80-301; P.A. 83-533, S. 16, 54; P.A. 85-510, S. 7, 10, 17, 35; P.A. 87-248; 87-317; P.A. 89-52; P.A. 90-308, S. 11, 15; P.A. 93-381, S. 9, 39; P.A. 95-257, S. 12, 21, 58; P.A. 05-208, S. 3; 05-288, S. 34; P.A. 11-51, S. 134; 11-82, S. 7.)\n\nHistory: 1961 act “restated” state employees retirement act “in a simpler, clearer and more orderly form”; 1963 acts amended Subsecs.

The employment commencement date is that date on which the employee first works an hour for which he is paid or entitled to payment by the state. An employee's reemployment commencement date is that date after his severance from service date on which the employee first works an hour for which he is paid or entitled to payment by the state. If any employee resigns or is terminated for cause and he is subsequently reemployed within twelve months, the period between his severance from service date and the date of his reemployment shall be included in his vesting service, except that if he resigns or is terminated for cause during a period of absence from service for other reasons, as aforesaid, vesting service shall be recognized for the period from his severance from service date to the date of his reemployment only if he is reemployed within twelve months of the first day of such absence. A break in service shall occur if an employee is not reemployed within one year after a severance from service date. A permanent break in service occurs if there has been a break in service, the employee is not vested under section 5-192o, and the period from his severance from service date to his reemployment commencement date equals or exceeds his vesting service prior to his severance from service date. In the event of a permanent break in service, any period prior to the permanent break in service shall be excluded from the employee's vesting service. In the event of a break in service which is not permanent, any period prior to such break in service shall be included in the employee's vesting service.\n\n(b) If an employee is absent from the service of the state because of service in the armed forces of the United States and if he returns to the service of the state within ninety days after becoming entitled to release from active duty in the armed forces or after hospitalization continuing after discharge for a period of not more than one year, such absence shall not count as a break in service. The period of any such absence shall be considered as vesting service.\n\n(c) A period during which an employee is on a leave of absence approved by the state or otherwise granted pursuant to the terms of the appropriate collective bargaining agreement shall not be considered as a break in service. No vesting service shall be granted for such a period except as specifically indicated in this section.\n\n(d) Any teacher, as defined in section 10-183b, in state service who is employed for a full academic year, equivalent to at least ten months credited service, shall be deemed to be employed for the entire year. Any such teacher who has completed the work obligations of his appointment period and who retires after May first, but before September first, shall receive, upon retirement, credit for the entire appointment year and the remaining biweekly payments due for the entire appointment year, together with any amounts held back previously.\n\n(e) A member who is or has been granted a leave of absence without pay to pursue a course of study which is connected with the work of the agency and which is for the purpose of increasing his proficiency in his position may count up to four years of the period of the leave as vesting service and such leave shall in no event be treated as a severance from service.\n\n(f) If an employee is absent from the service of the state due to a work-related injury or disease for which periodic workers' compensation cash benefits are payable, the period of such absence shall not count as a break in service and shall be considered vesting service.\n\n(g) In no event will more than one year of vesting service be granted for any twelve calendar months.\n\n(h) Subject to the requirements indicated in this subsection, vesting service may include employment with another state or states. A member of the tier II plan who has been in the active full-time employment of another state or states for some past period or periods for which he has received and will receive no retirement benefit or pension shall receive vesting service for such period or periods, not to exceed ten years in the aggregate, provided the state or states in which such service was rendered make similar provision for former employees of this state. If such member had received a lump sum payment, other than his contributions and interest thereon, from such other state or states in lieu of a retirement benefit, he shall not be eligible to receive credit under this subsection. When a person who has gained credit for such prior service retires, not more than one year of such out-of-state service may be counted for each two years of state service.\n\n(i) A member who served as a member of the General Assembly shall receive vesting service for such periods of service, subject to the provisions of subsections (a) and (g) of this section.\n\n(j) Subject to the requirements of this subsection, vesting service shall also include service in time of war, as defined in section 27-103, and up to three years of national emergency service, as defined by law, for normal, hazardous duty and early retirements. A member of the tier II plan who has performed service in time of war or national emergency service may receive vesting service for the period of such service, provided the member who has performed such service has not received and will not receive a pension for such period or periods, and provided further that such vesting service shall not exceed ten years in the aggregate. To receive such service credit, a member shall apply to the Retirement Commission within one year of his commencement of state service or within one year of June 22, 1992, whichever is later.\n\n(P.A. 83-533, S. 25, 54; P.A. 85-502, S. 6, 9; 85-510, S. 26, 35; P.A. 92-226, S. 2, 28.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 85-502 added Subsec.

The offsets shall apply when such benefits commence even if such benefits initially commence after the member's disability retirement date.\n\n(3) The offsets for workers' compensation and federal Social Security disability benefits shall be reduced by the amount of any attorney's fees a member incurs to obtain such benefits.\n\n(e) As of each anniversary date of such retired employee, as provided in section 5-192s, the benefits provided under this section shall be subject to the following adjustments:\n\n(1) The benefits provided in subsection (c) of this section shall be subject to the increase provided in section 5-192s;\n\n(2) The net maximum benefit provided in subdivision (2) of subsection (d) of this section shall be subject to the increase provided in section 5-192s;\n\n(3) This subdivision shall apply only to the maximum benefit provided in subdivision (1) of subsection (d) of this section which shall only be considered if the member has outside earned salary or wages. The salary as described in subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of subsection (d) of this section shall be increased by the percentage compensation increase that would have applied to an employee in the position and “step” of the member at the date of disability had that employee continued to be employed and continued automatic progression to the maximum “step” for his classification. On the date of recomputation of the benefits, the offsets for workers' compensation and federal Social Security shall be increased by the lesser of that same percentage or the percentage increase granted under the cost-of-living provision of the Workers' Compensation Act and the Social Security Act respectively. This offset amount shall be adjusted to reflect any change in these benefits other than those resulting from the cost-of-living provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act or the Social Security Act. In no case will the offset be greater than the actual benefits paid. Outside earned salary or wages shall reflect actual amounts earned during the preceding calendar year. In no event shall the application of this subdivision and subdivision (1) of subsection (d) of this section result in an income from all sources that would be less than the income that would have been paid had the member remained in state service and progressed to the maximum “step” for his classification;\n\n(4) Except as specifically indicated in the preceding subdivision (3) of this subsection, the maximum disability income determined under subsection (d) of this section will not be affected, when the workers' compensation benefits or the Social Security benefits are increased by cost-of-living provisions in the Workers' Compensation Act or the Social Security Act; and\n\n(5) The maximum disability income under subdivision (2) of subsection (d) of this section will be recalculated if either the workers' compensation benefits or the Social Security benefits are decreased or discontinued. Any such recalculated maximum shall not reflect any increases arising after the initial application of the offset because of the cost-of-living provisions in the Workers' Compensation Act or the Social Security Act except as specifically indicated in subdivision (3) of this subsection.\n\n(f) The board of physicians appointed pursuant to section 5-169 shall be utilized for purposes of determination of any applicant's entitlement.\n\n(g) No reconsideration of a decision concerning eligibility for a disability retirement allowance or the prior discontinuance of such allowance shall be made by the board unless a member, upon application to the board for a redetermination, discloses additional facts concerning his condition at the date of termination of employment or at the time of discontinuance as appropriate.\n\n(h) Retirement income being paid for disability retirement shall be discontinued if the member recovers from such disability prior to reaching what would have been his normal retirement date. In such event, such member shall receive credit for both vesting and credited service purposes for the years he was disabled, subject to a maximum total credit of thirty years or actual years of service to date of disability, whichever is greater. Unless such member has been reemployed, he shall then be deemed to have retired on normal or early retirement, if eligible, or retain a vested right to a deferred pension, if eligible.\n\n(i) If a member is entitled to disability compensation under section 5-142 such member shall continue to earn vesting service and credited service, provided such member has not retired. After retirement, if benefits continue to be payable under section 5-142, the disability retirement benefits under this section shall be payable only if larger. In such event, the benefits under this section shall be temporarily reduced by the amount of benefits payable under section 5-142 for the period of receipt of benefits under section 5-142.\n\n(P.A. 83-533, S. 32, 54; P.A. 84-411, S. 7, 8; P.A. 85-510, S. 18, 35; P.A. 05-208, S. 2.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 84-411 amended Subsec. (c) to clarify that monthly income is based on “one-twelfth” of 1.33% of final average earnings; P.A. 85-510 amended Subsec. (a) by deleting provision that a member who becomes disabled prior to age 65 is eligible for disability retirement if the disability was a result of an injury received in the performance of his duty as a state employee, or the member has completed at least 10 years of vested service and substituting provisions that a member who becomes disabled prior to age 65 is eligible for disability retirement if the member has completed at least 10 years of state service, and a member who becomes disabled as a result of an injury received in the performance of his duty as a state employee is eligible for disability retirement, regardless of his period of state service or his age; P.A. 05-208 amended Subsec. (d) by making a technical change and adding new Subdiv. (3) requiring offsets for workers' compensation and Social Security benefits to be reduced by attorney's fees incurred to obtain those benefits, effective July 1, 2005.\n\nSee Sec. 18-101e re calculation of disability retirement income for correction officers upon designation of extraordinary circumstances.\n\nBenefits paid pursuant to section are in the nature of retirement benefits and not disability benefits. 262 C. 746. Re distribution under Sec. 46b-81, retirement benefit attributable to years of service constitutes marital property while benefits attributable to disability suffered after marriage was dissolved do not constitute marital property. 292 C. 597.",

A member who has been married at least one year will be presumed to elect the option offered under subdivision (1) of this subsection unless a contrary election is made by the member. All other members will be presumed to elect the option offered under subdivision (4) of this subsection unless a contrary election is made by the member. Any election or change of election must be filed before retirement income payments begin. No option shall be effective until a member has retired, and in the event a member dies prior to the date benefits would have commenced, any election of an option shall be deemed cancelled except as provided in subsection (c) of section 5-192r. The amount of income that will be paid under the options will be determined by multiplying the retirement income as determined under sections 5-192l to 5-192p, inclusive, as applicable, by the actuarially equivalent option factors last adopted by the Retirement Commission. Such factors shall be identical to those provided under section 5-165 unless the Retirement Commission shall determine otherwise. The factors may be periodically adjusted upward or downward by the Retirement Commission to reflect changing interest, mortality, or election of option patterns, provided that they shall be reviewed and adjusted by January 1, 1985. Any such changes shall apply only to members whose benefits commence after the effective date of adoption of such factors. The retirement options are as follows: (1) A reduced amount payable to the member for his lifetime, with the provision that after his death his spouse, if surviving, shall be entitled to receive a lifetime income equal to fifty per cent of the reduced monthly amount payable to the member; (2) a reduced amount payable to the member for his lifetime, with the provision that after his death, his contingent annuitant shall be entitled to receive a lifetime income equal to either fifty or one hundred per cent of the reduced amount payable to the member; (3) a reduced amount payable to the member for his lifetime, with the provision that if he shall die within either a ten or twenty-year period following the date his retirement income commences, whichever is selected by the member, the reduced amount continues to his contingent annuitant for the balance of the ten or twenty-year period, respectively; or (4) an amount payable to the member for his lifetime, with no payments continuing after the member's death.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, a temporary minimum shall apply whenever the Retirement Commission adopts revised factors which could result in a smaller benefit to a member than would have been payable under the previously existing factors. Such minimum shall be determined as follows: (1) The benefit the member had earned as of the date of the change in factors shall be calculated, based on his final average earnings and credited service or based on his vesting service as of that date; (2) any early retirement reduction in such benefit shall be based upon his age as determined on the date benefits will commence, and his type of retirement; and (3) the option factor shall be determined utilizing the factors in effect prior to such change, but based on appropriate ages as of the date benefits will commence. If such minimum results in a larger benefit, the larger benefit shall be payable.\n\n(P.A. 83-533, S. 33, 54.)",
