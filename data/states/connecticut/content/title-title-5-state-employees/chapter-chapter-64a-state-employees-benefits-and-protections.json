As used in this section, “state officer or employee” includes any member of a state officer's or employee's immediate family who is named or included in any such claim, demand, suit or judgment solely by reason of such familial relationship; and “immediate family” has the same meaning as provided in section 1-79.\n\n(b) The state, through the Attorney General, shall provide for the defense of any such state officer, employee or member in any civil action or proceeding in any state or federal court arising out of any alleged act, omission or deprivation which occurred or is alleged to have occurred while the officer, employee or member was acting in the discharge of his duties or in the scope of his employment, except that the state shall not be required to provide for such a defense whenever the Attorney General, based on his investigation of the facts and circumstances of the case, determines that it would be inappropriate to do so and he so notifies the officer, employee or member in writing.\n\n(c) Legal fees and costs incurred as a result of the retention by any such officer, employee or member of an attorney to defend his interests in any such civil action or proceeding shall be borne by the state only in those cases where (1) the Attorney General has stated in writing to the officer, employee or member, pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, that the state will not provide an attorney to defend the interests of the officer, employee or member, and (2) the officer, employee or member is thereafter found to have acted in the discharge of his duties or in the scope of his employment, and not to have acted wantonly, recklessly or maliciously. Such legal fees and costs incurred by such officer, employee or member shall be paid to such officer, employee or member only after the final disposition of the suit, claim or demand and only in such amounts as shall be determined by the Attorney General to be reasonable. In determining whether such amounts are reasonable, the Attorney General may consider whether it was appropriate for a group of officers, employees or members to be represented by the same counsel.\n\n(d) Such officer, employee or member may bring an action in the Superior Court against the state to enforce the provisions of this section.\n\n(e) The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to any such officer, employee or member to the extent he has a right to indemnification under any other section of the general statutes.\n\n(P.A. 83-464, S. 3, 5; P.A. 05-114, S. 3; P.A. 23-46, S. 38.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 05-114 made technical changes in Subsec. (c), added new Subsec. (d) re Superior Court action to enforce section, redesignated existing Subsec. (d) as Subsec. (e) and made technical changes therein; P.A. 23-46 amended Subsec. (a) to add definitions of “state officer or employee” and “immediate family”, effective June 13, 2023.",
