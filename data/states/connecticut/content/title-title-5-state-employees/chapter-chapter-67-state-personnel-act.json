Each such employee who has completed twenty years of service shall be entitled to one day for each additional year up to twenty-five years of service, and each such employee with twenty-five or more years of service shall be entitled to not more than twenty days' vacation, subject to regulations issued by the Commissioner of Administrative Services.

Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 4-168 to 4-172, inclusive, in order to effectuate the purposes of subsections (a) and (c) of this section, prior to adopting or amending such regulations and not later than January 1, 2025, the commissioner shall adopt policies and procedures to implement the provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of this section that shall have the force and effect of law. The commissioner shall post all policies and procedures on the department's Internet web site, and submit such policies and procedures to the Secretary of the State for posting on the eRegulations System, at least fifteen days prior to the effective date of any policy or procedure.

(c):\n\n“Day” of personal leave represents an entire 24-hour period for which a state employee elects not to work, but, nonetheless, is paid; legislature's use of terms “day” and “holiday” reflects its intent that employees shall be compensated for leave commensurate with their scheduled hours during the calendar day. 267 C. 255.",

      "text": "(a) As used in this section, (1) “state employee” or “employee” means any elected official, officer or full-time employee of the Executive, Legislative or Judicial Department, and (2) “part pay” means the difference between the state employee's base rate of pay, plus longevity, in the employee's primary position on the date the employee is called to active service in the armed forces of any state or the United States and the total compensation the employee receives for such active service, as certified to the State Comptroller by the employing state agency in a manner acceptable to the State Comptroller.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes or any public or special act, the state shall continue to provide coverage, under a group hospitalization and medical and surgical insurance plan sponsored by the state under section 5-259, for the dependents of any state employee and the state employee who is a member of the armed forces of any state or of any reserve component of the armed forces of the United States and who has been called to active service in the armed forces of any state or the United States for a military operation, war or national emergency, for the duration of such call-up to active service, provided such state employee and dependents were covered by the insurance plan on the date the state employee was called to active service and the state employee continues to pay any amount that the employee was required to pay for coverage before being called to active service. Any payment required to be made by the employee for coverage under this subsection may be deducted from compensation provided under subsection (c) of this section. The state shall reimburse any state employee who has paid premiums for the continuation of any such group hospitalization and medical and surgical insurance plan between the date such state employee was called to active service and November 20, 2001. The reimbursement shall be in the amount of the state's portion of the premiums so paid.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes or any public or special act, any state employee who is a member of the armed forces of any state or of any reserve component of the armed forces of the United States and who has been called to active service in the armed forces of any state or the United States for a military operation, war or national emergency, shall continue to accrue all vacation time, equivalent leave time and sick time to which the employee would be entitled if he or she had continued working in his or her state position during the time of such active service, and shall be credited with such accrued vacation time, equivalent leave time or sick time, except that if the accrual of such vacation time, equivalent leave time or sick time pursuant to this subsection while on active service would cause the employee to exceed any limit on leave time pursuant to any provision of the general statutes, the regulations of Connecticut state agencies or a collective bargaining agreement, the limit shall be temporarily waived to allow the employee to use the excess leave time before the later of the following: (1) From the date of the state employee's discharge from active service until the state employee returns to state employment, (2) not later than one hundred twenty calendar days after the state employee returns to state employment, (3) not later than one hundred twenty calendar days after the state employee is credited with such excess leave time, or (4) for state employees in teaching or professional positions in Unified School District #1 established pursuant to section 18-99a within the Department of Correction who were credited with equivalent leave time pursuant to this section, not later than one year after the employee is credited with such excess leave time. The employee shall be entitled to a leave of absence with pay as provided in section 27-33 from the date on which the employee was called to active service. After the expiration of such leave of absence with pay, the state employee shall receive part pay for the duration of such call-up to active service if the compensation received by the state employee for such active service is less than the employee's base rate of pay, plus longevity, in the employee's primary position. The state employee shall not be required to exhaust accrued vacation time, equivalent leave time or sick time in order to be eligible for the paid leave of absence and part pay under this subsection. As used in this section, “equivalent leave time” means leave time classified as other than vacation time or sick time and includes, but is not limited to, leave time classified as recess rather than vacation time.\n\n(d) No state employee shall be deemed ineligible for any benefit under this section or under any other provision of this chapter solely because such employee's leave time is classified as recess or other equivalent leave time rather than vacation time pursuant to the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement, including a collective bargaining agreement covering a state employee in a teaching, instructional or professional position in Unified School District #1 or #2 or, prior to July 1, 2014, Unified School District #3.\n\n(Nov. 13 Sp.
