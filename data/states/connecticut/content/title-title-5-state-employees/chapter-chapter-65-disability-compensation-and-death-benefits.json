If total incapacity results from such injury, such person shall be removed from the active payroll the first day of incapacity, exclusive of the day of injury, and placed on an inactive payroll. Such person shall continue to receive the full salary that such person was receiving at the time of injury subject to all salary benefits of active employees, including annual increments, and all salary adjustments, including salary deductions, required in the case of active employees, for a period of two hundred sixty weeks from the date of the beginning of such incapacity. Thereafter, such person shall be removed from the payroll and shall receive compensation at the rate of fifty per cent of the salary that such person was receiving at the expiration of said two hundred sixty weeks as long as such person remains so disabled, except that any such person who is a member of the Division of State Police within the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection shall receive compensation at the rate of sixty-five per cent of such salary as long as such person remains so disabled. Such benefits shall be payable to a member of the Division of State Police after two hundred sixty weeks of disability only if the member elects in writing to receive such benefits in lieu of any benefits payable to the employee under the state employees retirement system. In the event that such disabled member of the Division of State Police elects the compensation provided under this subsection, no benefits shall be payable under chapter 568 or the state employees retirement system until the former of the employee's death or recovery from such disability.

If any such employee is found to be infected with any such disease, contracted while in the employ of the state and during the performance of such employee's duties, the state shall pay for all necessary medical and hospital expenses resulting from such disease and, if incapacity results, such employee shall be removed from the payroll the first day of incapacity and shall receive compensation at the rate of one-half the salary he was receiving at the time of infection. Such state employee may elect to receive, in addition to the benefits due him under this subsection, an amount which will result in his receiving his full salary or wages for the period of any accumulated sick leave, computed on an hourly basis, due him. Upon the expiration of such period of sick leave, the provisions of this subsection shall apply. All provisions of the workers' compensation law not inconsistent herewith, including the specific indemnities and provisions for hearing and appeal, shall be available to any such state employee or the dependents of such a deceased employee. All payments of compensation made to a state employee under this section shall be made from the fund designated “Compensation Awards to State Employees”. If a state employee has been disabled by tuberculosis at any time prior to his employment by the state or if on the first physical examination herein provided for he is found to have a tuberculous lesion, any subsequent disability from tuberculosis within five years of the commencement of such employment shall be presumed prima facie to be due to his previous infection and not to have been contracted in the course of such employment, even if such employment involved exposure to tuberculosis. In such case such state employee shall be removed from the payroll the first day of incapacity and the state shall not be liable for the payment of any resulting medical or hospital expenses or for the payment of compensation for loss of earnings of such disabled state employee.\n\n(c) If a member of the Division of State Police within the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection who is not subject to the federal Insurance Contributions Act for such employment becomes or became disabled on or after July 1, 1979, and (1) the disability is not compensable under the terms of subsection (a) of this section and he elects or elected to receive disability retirement benefits under the provisions of section 5-169 or 5-192p, or (2) he elects or elected to receive such disability retirement benefits in lieu of benefits otherwise available under subsection (a) of this section, the member shall be eligible to receive benefits under the provisions of subsection (d) of this section. Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, the benefits granted under subsection (d) of this section shall be deemed to be federal Social Security disability benefits for purposes of calculating the maximum benefits available under the provisions of section 5-169 or 5-192p. Any disability Social Security benefits payable to or on behalf of such member shall also be recognized for purposes of calculating such maximum benefits. For the purposes of this subsection, “disability” means any medically determinable injury or physical or mental impairment which permanently prevents the discharge of normal police functions by any member of the Division of State Police, provided the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection cannot find a suitable position within the agency for such member. The determination as to whether a member is so disabled shall be made by the board of physicians established under section 5-169. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in section 5-169, the maximum benefit limitation as set forth in subdivisions (1) and (2) of subsection (g) of section 5-169 shall apply to any member receiving the new benefits provided by subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(d) Commencing on May 8, 1984, or the date of disability, if later, each such disabled member of the Division of State Police within the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection shall receive a monthly allowance payable by the state employees retirement system, as long as the member remains so disabled, as follows: (1) To a disabled member, a monthly allowance of three hundred dollars for such disabled member's lifetime; (2) if such disabled member is married, an additional monthly allowance of two hundred fifty dollars payable to the member and payable for the member's lifetime or until the spouse's divorce from the member; (3) if there are less than three dependent children, a monthly allowance of two hundred fifty dollars payable to the member for each child until each such child reaches the age of eighteen or until the child's marriage if such occurs earlier; (4) if there are three or more dependent children, a monthly allowance of five hundred and seventy-five dollars payable to the member but deemed to be divided equally among them. As each such dependent child reaches the age of eighteen years, or marries, if such occurs earlier, the child's share shall be deemed divided equally among the remaining surviving children, provided each child's share shall not exceed two hundred fifty dollars; when the shares payable on behalf of all but one of such dependent children have ceased, the disability benefit payable on behalf of the remaining child shall be two hundred fifty dollars. These benefits shall be integrated with the benefits of section 5-169 or 5-192p as if they were federal Social Security disability benefits in order to determine the maximum benefits payable to such disabled member. These benefits shall be subject to increases as provided in subsection (e) of this section. All benefits provided under this subsection shall be discontinued at the earlier of the member's recovery from disability or the member's death. If a disabled member dies, the survivor benefits provided under sections 5-146 to 5-150, inclusive, shall be payable.\n\n(e) On January 1, 1985, and annually thereafter, up to and including January 1, 1988, the benefits then being provided under subsection (d) of this section to a disabled member of the Division of State Police within the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection shall be increased by three per cent. Such increase shall not affect the initial level of benefits payable to a member who qualifies for such disability benefits under subsection (d) after the date of any increase under this subsection. Such benefits shall be deemed to be the cost-of-living provision of the federal Social Security disability law for purposes of calculating the maximum benefits available under the provisions of section 5-169 or 5-192p.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 419; 1949, 1951, 1953, 1955, S. 183d; 1949, 1953, S. 2131d; 1957, P.A. 251; March, 1958, P.A. 27, S. 35; 1959, P.A. 331; 1963, P.A. 298; February, 1965, P.A. 151; 1969, P.A. 175, S. 1; 730, S. 14; P.A. 73-122, S. 13, 27; 73-402; P.A. 76-111, S. 5; 76-436, S. 399, 681; P.A. 77-614, S. 69, 70, 165, 486, 610; P.A. 78-138, S. 1–3; 78-162, S. 1–3; P.A. 79-376, S. 3; P.A. 80-34, S. 1, 2; 80-482, S. 4, 6, 170, 191, 345, 348; P.A. 83-13, S. 5; P.A. 84-48, S. 13, 17; P.A. 85-510, S. 2, 35; P.A. 87-496, S. 43, 110; P.A. 89-82, S. 7, 11; P.A. 91-339, S. 40; P.A. 95-195, S. 5, 83; 95-257, S. 11, 58; P.A. 96-219, S. 6; P.A. 01-208, S. 1, 3; P.A. 03-19, S. 10; June 30 Sp.
