Retailers shall post a sign, in a conspicuous location, which adequately discloses to consumers that in the event the retail price of a consumer commodity is greater than the advertised or posted retail price for the consumer commodity, the retailer shall give such consumer commodity to the consumer at no cost to the consumer.\n\n(2) The provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection shall not apply to a retailer if the retailer (A) improperly fails to redeem a digital or paper coupon which, if properly redeemed, would reduce the price of a consumer commodity, or (B) fails to remove a sign adjoining a consumer commodity and disclosing a time-limited reduced price for the consumer commodity after the time period specified for such reduced price has expired.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 21-79 and except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, if a consumer presents a digital or paper coupon which, if properly redeemed, would reduce the price of a consumer commodity, including, but not limited to, any fruit or vegetable weighed at the point of sale, and the retailer fails to properly redeem such coupon, such retailer shall provide to the consumer a refund in an amount that is equal to the value of such coupon. If a retailer offers a consumer commodity, including, but not limited to, any fruit or vegetable weighed at the point of sale, for sale at a reduced price for a specified time period, and a sign disclosing such reduced price remains adjacent to the consumer commodity after expiration of such time period, the retailer shall only require a consumer to pay the reduced price disclosed in such sign for such consumer commodity.\n\n(d) The Commissioner of Consumer Protection, after providing notice and conducting a hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, may issue a warning citation to, or impose a civil penalty of not more than one hundred dollars for the first offense and not more than five hundred dollars for each subsequent offense on, any person who, or association, corporation, firm or partnership that, violates any provision of subsection (b) or (c) of this section.
