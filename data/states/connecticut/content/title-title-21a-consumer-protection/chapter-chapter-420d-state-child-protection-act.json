The administrator shall compile, within available appropriations, and from time to time amend, a list of toys and other articles which are intended for use by children and which are classified as banned hazardous substances, and shall post such list in a conspicuous place on the department's web site.

The reuse of a food, drug or cosmetic container as a container for a hazardous substance shall be deemed to be an act which results in the hazardous substance being a misbranded hazardous substance. As used in this subdivision, “food”, “drug” and “cosmetic” have the same meanings as in the Connecticut Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; (8) the use by any person to his own advantage, or revealing other than to the administrator or officers or employees of the agency, or to the courts when relevant in any judicial proceeding under sections 21a-335 to 21a-346, inclusive, of any information acquired under authority of section 21a-343 concerning any method of process which as a trade secret is entitled to protection; (9) the introduction or delivery for introduction into commerce of any item containing asbestos which reasonably may be expected to be used in the construction or repair of structures, without clearly indicating by labeling thereon that the item contains asbestos and that asbestos may cause cancer when inhaled, or the introduction or delivery for introduction into commerce of any toy or other article for sale in this state marketed for the use of children under the age of sixteen containing asbestos; (10) the alteration or removal of any item upon which the commissioner or his authorized agent has placed an embargo prior to the time the commissioner, such agent or a court permits the alteration or removal of such item; (11) the introduction or delivery for introduction into commerce, after December 31, 1992, of any toy or other article for sale in this state and marketed for the use of children between the ages of three and seven, or determined to be for the use of children between the ages of three and seven by the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission pursuant to 16 CFR Part 1500 et seq., as published in the Code of Federal Regulations Revised to January 1, 1991, and as from time to time amended, or the Commissioner of Consumer Protection pursuant to sections 21a-335 to 21a-346, inclusive, which would be classified as a banned hazardous substance under 16 CFR Part 1501.4(b)(1) of said code and does not bear a conspicuous warning label that clearly and specifically communicates that the contents include small parts which pose a hazard for children under the age of three, except that any toy or other article that contains, as of December 31, 1992, a safety warning label in substantial compliance with the requirements of this subdivision shall be determined by the commissioner to be in compliance with this subdivision until October 1, 1993. As used in this subdivision, “conspicuous” has the same meaning and characteristics regarding type size as in 16 CFR Part 1500.121(c)(2) of said code; and (12) the introduction or delivery for introduction into commerce, or the distribution or sale, of a drying oil or drying oil product, manufactured after December 31, 1994, which does not bear a conspicuous warning label on a side or back panel of such product stating: “DANGER - RAGS, STEEL WOOL OR WASTE SOAKED WITH .... (INSERT PRODUCT NAME) MAY SPONTANEOUSLY CATCH FIRE IF IMPROPERLY DISCARDED. IMMEDIATELY AFTER USE, PLACE RAGS, STEEL WOOL OR WASTE IN A SEALED WATER-FILLED METAL CONTAINER.” As used in this subdivision, “conspicuous” has the same meaning and characteristics regarding type size as in 16 CFR Part 1500.121(c)(2) of said code.\n\n(b) A children's product shall not be a banned hazardous substance, as defined in subsection (p) of section 21a-335, solely on the basis of containing a component that exceeds the standards pursuant to subparagraph (B) of said subsection (p) if such component is not accessible to a child because it is not physically exposed by reason of a covering or casing and if it will not become physically exposed through normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product. For purposes of this subsection, paint, coatings or electroplating shall not be considered barriers that would render lead in the substrate inaccessible to a child through normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product.\n\n(c) Within available appropriations, if the administrator determines that it is not feasible for certain children's products that are electronic devices, including batteries, to meet the standards pursuant to subparagraph (B) of subsection (p) of section 21a-335 by July 1, 2009, the administrator shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to (1) set standards to reduce the exposure of and accessibility to lead in such devices, and (2) establish a schedule by which such electronic devices shall be in full compliance with the standards established in said subparagraph (B). Such devices shall not be considered banned hazardous substances pursuant to said subsection (p) if they comply with the provisions of such regulations.\n\n(1971, P.A. 121, S. 3; P.A. 80-398, S. 1; P.A. 85-242, S. 1; P.A. 92-127, S. 1; May Sp.
