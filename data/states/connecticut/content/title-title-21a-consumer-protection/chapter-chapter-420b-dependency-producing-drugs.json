No prescription blank containing a prescription for a schedule II substance shall contain more than one prescription. No prescription or order for a controlled substance issued by a practitioner to an inanimate object or thing shall be considered a valid prescription within the meaning of this chapter.\n\n(b) Each prescribing practitioner, as defined in section 20-14c, who the Department of Consumer Protection authorizes to prescribe controlled substances, within the scope of practice of his or her license, shall electronically transmit the controlled substance prescription to a pharmacy. Electronically transmitted prescriptions shall be promptly printed out in hardcopy or created as an electronic record and filed by the prescriber. Electronically transmitted prescriptions shall be consistent with the requirements of the federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 USC 801, as amended from time to time. All records shall be kept on file for three years at the premises of the licensed practitioner and maintained in such form as to be readily available for inspection by the commissioner, his or her authorized agent or other persons, as authorized in section 21a-265, at reasonable times. For purposes of this subsection and subsections (c), (d) and (e) of this section, the term “electronically transmit” means to transmit by computer modem or other similar electronic device.\n\n(c) A licensed practitioner shall not be required to electronically transmit a prescription when:\n\n(1) Electronic transmission is not available due to a temporary technological or electrical failure. In the event of a temporary technological or electrical failure, the practitioner shall, without undue delay, reasonably attempt to correct any cause for the failure that is within his or her control. A practitioner who issues a prescription, but fails to electronically transmit the prescription, as permitted by this subsection, shall document the reason for the practitioner's failure to electronically transmit the prescription in the patient's medical record as soon as practicable, but in no instance more than seventy-two hours following the end of the temporary technological or electrical failure that prevented the electronic transmittal of the prescription. For purposes of this subdivision, “temporary technological or electrical failure” means failure of a computer system, application or device or the loss of electrical power to such system, application or device, or any other service interruption to such system, application or device that reasonably prevents the practitioner from utilizing his or her certified application to electronically transmit the prescription in accordance with subsection (b) of this section;\n\n(2) The practitioner reasonably determines that it would be impractical for the patient to obtain substances prescribed by an electronically transmitted prescription in a timely manner and that such delay would adversely impact the patient's medical condition, provided if such prescription is for a controlled substance, the quantity of such controlled substance does not exceed a five-day supply for the patient, if the controlled substance was used in accordance with the directions for use. A practitioner who issues a prescription, but fails to electronically transmit the prescription, as permitted by this subsection, shall document the reason for the practitioner's failure to electronically transmit the prescription in the patient's medical record;\n\n(3) The prescription is to be dispensed by a pharmacy located outside this state. A practitioner who issues a prescription, but fails to electronically transmit the prescription, as permitted by this subsection, shall document the reason for the practitioner's failure to electronically transmit the prescription in the patient's medical record;\n\n(4) Use of an electronically transmitted prescription may negatively impact patient care, such as a prescription containing two or more products to be compounded by a pharmacist, a prescription for direct administration to a patient by parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous or intraspinal infusion, a prescription that contains long or complicated directions, a prescription that requires certain elements to be included by the federal Food and Drug and Administration, or an oral prescription communicated to a pharmacist by a health care practitioner for a patient in a chronic and convalescent nursing home, licensed pursuant to chapter 368v; or\n\n(5) The practitioner demonstrates, in a form and manner prescribed by the commissioner, that such practitioner does not have the technological capacity to issue an electronically transmitted prescription. For the purposes of this subsection, “technological capacity” means possession of a computer system, hardware or device that can be used to electronically transmit controlled substance prescriptions consistent with the requirements of the federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 USC 801, as amended from time to time. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to a practitioner when such practitioner is prescribing as a telehealth provider, as defined in section 19a-906, section 1 of public act 20-2 of the July special session* or section 1 of public act 21-9*, as applicable, pursuant to subsection (c) of section 19a-906, subsection (c) of section 1 of public act 20-2 of the July special session* or subsection (c) of section 1 of public act 21-9*, as applicable.\n\n(d) Any prescription issued in a form other than an electronically transmitted prescription pursuant to subsection (c) of this section may be issued as a written order or, to the extent permitted by the federal Controlled Substance Act, 21 USC 801, as from time to time amended, as an oral order or transmitted by facsimile machine. Such oral order or order transmitted by facsimile machine shall be promptly reduced to writing on a prescription blank or a hardcopy printout or created as an electronic record and filed by the pharmacist filling it. No duplicate, carbon or photographic copies and no printed or rubber-stamped orders shall be considered valid prescriptions within the meaning of this chapter.\n\n(e) Prescriptions for schedule II substances shall be electronically transmitted by the prescribing practitioner at the time of issuance and previously signed orders for such schedule II substances shall not be considered valid prescriptions within the meaning of this chapter. No practitioner shall prescribe, dispense or administer schedule II sympathomimetic amines as anorectics, except as may be authorized by regulations adopted by the Departments of Public Health and Consumer Protection acting jointly. To the extent permitted by the federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 USC 801, as from time to time amended, in an emergency, the dispensing of schedule II substances may be made upon the oral order of a prescribing registrant known to or confirmed by the filling pharmacist. The filling pharmacist shall promptly reduce such oral order to writing on a prescription blank, provided such oral order shall be confirmed by the proper completion and mailing or delivery of a prescription prepared by the prescribing registrant to the pharmacist filling such oral order within seventy-two hours after the oral order has been given. Such prescription of the registrant shall be affixed to the temporary prescription prepared by the pharmacist and both prescriptions shall be maintained on file as required in this chapter. The Department of Public Health and the Department of Consumer Protection, acting jointly, may adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, allowing practitioners to prescribe, dispense or administer schedule II sympathomimetic amines as anorectics under certain specific circumstances. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a licensed pharmacist to determine the diagnosis of a patient prior to dispensing a prescription for such substances to a patient.\n\n(f) All prescriptions for controlled substances shall comply fully with any additional requirements of the federal food and drug laws, the federal Controlled Substances Act, and state laws and regulations adopted under this chapter.\n\n(g) Repealed by P.A. 82-419, S. 46, 47.\n\n(h) Except when dispensed directly by a practitioner, other than a pharmacy, to an ultimate user, a controlled substance included in schedule III or IV, which is a prescription drug as determined under federal food and drug laws, shall not be dispensed without a written, electronically transmitted or oral prescription of a practitioner. The prescription shall not be filled or refilled more than six months after the date thereof or be refilled more than five times, unless renewed by the practitioner.\n\n(i) A controlled substance included in schedule V shall not be distributed or dispensed other than for a medical purpose.\n\n(j) A pharmacy may sell and dispense controlled substances upon the prescription of a prescribing practitioner, as defined in section 20-571.\n\n(k) Pharmacies shall file filled prescriptions for controlled substances separately from other prescriptions. All schedule II prescriptions shall be filed in a separate file or in an electronic file. All schedule III, IV and V prescriptions shall be filed in another separate file or in an electronic file, except as otherwise provided for in regulations adopted pursuant to section 21a-243, 21a-244 or 21a-244a. All written controlled substance prescriptions shall, immediately upon filling, be filed chronologically and consecutively.\n\n(l) (1) Any pharmacy may transfer:\n\n(A) A prescription for a controlled substance included in schedule III, IV or V to any other pharmacy in accordance with the requirements set forth in the federal Controlled Substances Act 21 USC 801 et seq. and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as from time to time amended; and\n\n(B) An unfilled prescription for a controlled substance included in schedule II, III, IV or V that was electronically transmitted in accordance with the requirements set forth in the federal Controlled Substances Act 21 USC 801 et seq. and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as from time to time amended. The pharmacy may transfer the unfilled electronic prescription by telephone or other electronic transmission if:\n\n(i) Such transfer is consistent with the federal Controlled Substances Act 21 USC 801 et seq. and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as from time to time amended, and policies established by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration;\n\n(ii) The pharmacy that first receives such prescription:\n\n(I) Takes measures to prevent such prescription from being filled at any pharmacy other than the pharmacy to which the such pharmacy is transferring such prescription; and\n\n(II) Records the name, telephone number and address of the pharmacy to which such pharmacy is transferring such prescription, and the name and license number of the pharmacist who receives such transferred prescription; and\n\n(iii) The pharmacy that receives such transferred prescription records:\n\n(I) All of the information required under subsection (a) of this section;\n\n(II) That such prescription has been transferred;\n\n(III) The name of the pharmacy that first received such prescription;\n\n(IV) The date on which such prescription was issued;\n\n(V) The date on which such prescription was transferred; and\n\n(VI) Any refills issued for such prescription if such prescription is for a controlled substance included in schedule III, IV or V of the federal Controlled Substances Act 21 USC 801 et seq.\n\n(2) The pharmacy that first receives an electronically transmitted prescription described in subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of this subsection may send a facsimile containing the prescription information for such prescription if such pharmacy is transferring such prescription pursuant to said subparagraph by telephone.\n\n(m) A practitioner authorized to prescribe controlled substances shall not prescribe anabolic steroids for the sole purpose of enhancing a patient's athletic ability or performance.\n\n(n) Each pharmacy, as defined in section 20-571, shall accept an electronically transmitted prescription for a controlled substance from a practitioner, as defined in section 21a-316. All records shall be kept on file for three years at the premises of the pharmacy and maintained current and separate from other business records in such form as to be readily available at the pharmacy for inspection by the Commissioner of Consumer Protection, his or her authorized agent or other persons, as authorized in section 21a-265, at reasonable times. Prescription records received from the practitioner electronically may be stored electronically, provided the files are maintained in the pharmacy computer system for not less than three years.

Whenever a prescribing practitioner prescribes a schedule V nonnarcotic controlled substance, for the continuous or prolonged treatment of any patient, such prescribing practitioner, or such prescribing practitioner's authorized agent, shall review, not less than annually, the patient's records in such prescription drug monitoring program. If such electronic prescription drug monitoring program is not operational, such prescribing practitioner may prescribe greater than a seventy-two-hour supply of a controlled substance to a patient during the time of such program's inoperability, provided such prescribing practitioner or such authorized agent reviews the records of such patient in such program not more than twenty-four hours after regaining access to such program.\n\n(10) (A) A prescribing practitioner may designate an authorized agent to review the electronic prescription drug monitoring program and patient controlled substance prescription information on behalf of the prescribing practitioner.

A prescribing practitioner may be subject to disciplinary action for acts of the authorized agent as provided in subsection (a) of section 21a-322.\n\n(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, a prescribing practitioner who is employed by or provides professional services to a hospital shall, prior to designating an authorized agent to review the electronic prescription drug monitoring program and patient controlled substance prescription information on behalf of the prescribing practitioner, (i) submit a request to designate one or more authorized agents for such purposes and a written protocol for oversight of the authorized agent or agents to the commissioner, in the form and manner prescribed by the commissioner, and (ii) receive the commissioner's approval to designate such authorized agent or agents and of such written protocol. Such written protocol shall designate either the hospital's medical director, a hospital department head, who is a prescribing practitioner, or another prescribing practitioner as the person responsible for ensuring that the authorized agent's or agents' access to such program and patient controlled substance prescription information is limited to the purposes described in this section and occurs in a manner that protects the confidentiality of information that is accessed through such program. A hospital medical director, a hospital department head, who is a prescribing practitioner, or another prescribing practitioner designated as the person responsible for overseeing an authorized agent's or agents' access to such program and information in the written protocol approved by the commissioner may be subject to disciplinary action for acts of the authorized agent or agents as provided in subsection (a) of section 21a-322. The commissioner may inspect hospital records to determine compliance with written protocols approved in accordance with this section.\n\n(C) A pharmacist may designate a pharmacy technician to access the electronic prescription drug monitoring program and patient controlled substance prescription information on behalf of the pharmacist only for the purposes of facilitating the pharmacist's review of such patient information.

Defendant's conviction of possession of a narcotic substance with intent to sell under Subsec. must be vacated as a lesser included offense re his conviction of possession of a narcotic substance with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of Sec. 21a-278(b); merger of convictions approach in 216 C. 699 overruled. 308 C. 242.\n\nCited. 7 CA 265; 8 CA 317; Id., 330; Id., 361; 9 CA 667; 10 CA 7; Id., 532; 11 CA 11; Id., 47; Id., 540; judgment reversed, see 209 C. 1; 12 CA 225; Id., 274; Id., 313; 13 CA 288; 14 CA 134; Id., 356; Id., 536; Id., 574; Id., 605; 15 CA 328; Id., 589; 16 CA 89; Id., 142; Id., 148; Id., 245; Id., 272; Id., 518; 17 CA 108; Id., 142; Id., 257; Id., 273; Id., 677; 18 CA 32; Id., 820; 19 CA 640; Id., 668; 20 CA 137; Id., 190; Id., 395; 21 CA 48; Id., 162; Id., 519; Id., 622; 22 CA 458; Id., 557; Id., 601; 23 CA 495; Id., 532; Id., 592; Id., 602; Id., 667; Id., 746; judgment reversed, see 221 C. 595; Id., 823; 24 CA 543; Id., 811; 25 CA 3; Id., 99; Id., 354; 26 CA 94; Id., 103; Id., 259; 27 CA 128; Id., 248; 28 CA 508; Id., 638; 29 CA 359; Id., 584; Id., 843; 30 CA 9; Id., 783; 31 CA 548; 33 CA 253; Id., 409; 34 CA 236; Id., 411; Id., 717; 35 CA 107; Id., 360; 36 CA 161; Id., 488; Id., 546; 37 CA 205; Id., 509; Id., 561; judgment reversed, see 236 C. 216; 38 CA 588; Id., 621; 39 CA 110; Id., 369; Id., 550; 40 CA 288; 41 CA 180; Id., 604; 43 CA 448; Id., 555; 45 CA 110; 46 CA 791. Time not an essential element of the crime but may become material if defendant raises an alibi defense. 49 CA 323. Conviction for both possession and sale of narcotics does not violate prohibition against double jeopardy. 53 CA 661. Section is a lesser included offense of Sec. 21a-278(b), and where two convictions arose out of same act or transaction and were substantially identical, multiple punishments were improper. 60 CA 534. Defendant's conviction for sale of narcotic substance vacated where there was no evidence presented to support finding that the substance transferred was crack cocaine. 64 CA 596. There was sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knowingly entered into conspiracy to possess a narcotic substance with intent to sell; conviction of both possession of at least one-half gram of crack cocaine with intent to sell under Sec. 21a-278 and possession of powder cocaine with intent to sell under this section does not constitute double jeopardy. 75 CA 223. The quantity of drugs is not sole dispositive factor in determining whether defendant had intent to sell; intent is determined from the cumulative weight of circumstantial evidence and reasonable and logical inferences derived therefrom. 78 CA 659. Defendant was in constructive possession of cocaine when it was found in plain view on the floor of backseat of vehicle where defendant's feet had been when police officer first approached vehicle, and there was sufficient evidence of defendant's intent to sell narcotics where he had in his constructive possession 43 individually packaged bags of various forms of cocaine, he was arrested in an area known for drug activity, he did not have any drug paraphernalia on his person to indicate personal use of drugs, and cash in small denominations and a cellular telephone were present in the vehicle. 110 CA 778. There was insufficient evidence that it was defendant who had hidden narcotics and insufficient evidence to buttress an inference of dominion and control by defendant; evidence was insufficient to show that defendant had requisite intent to sell narcotics. 123 CA 690. Defendant's conviction of possession of a narcotic substance with intent to sell in violation of Subsec. must be merged with his conviction of possession of a narcotic substance with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of Sec. 21a-278(b), and his sentence for possession of narcotics with intent to sell must be vacated. 126 CA 323; judgment reversed in part re merger of convictions, see 308 C. 242.

Trial court improperly failed to provide definition of “drug dependency” in accordance with the term's statutory definition or otherwise in its instructions to jury. 69 CA 505. Circumstantial evidence at trial provided adequate evidentiary basis for jury to find that substance at issue was LSD, which evidence included court's definition and description of LSD, defendant's statement re substance and manner of ingestion and effect of substance on person who ingested it. 85 CA 575. Defendant failed to demonstrate that his two convictions under section, resulting from searches on the same day, constituted double jeopardy because defendant was found with one stash of cocaine in his pocket, and a later search of his home found another stash of different purity, reflecting different purposes related to the cocaine; defendant did not demonstrate a due process violation regarding jury instruction on nonexclusive possession of premises where narcotics were found. 93 CA 548. Circumstantial evidence that defendant picked up package and was engaged in illicit activity was insufficient to support conviction of possession of marijuana and possession with the intent to sell marijuana when essential element of offense, knowledge of the character of the illegal substance, was lacking. 98 CA 458. Evidence sufficient to show defendant possessed requisite knowledge for conviction under statute. 110 CA 245. Defendant's conviction of possession of a narcotic substance with intent to sell in violation of Sec. 21a-277(a) must be merged with his conviction of possession of a narcotic substance with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of Subsec., and his sentence for possession of narcotics with intent to sell must be vacated. 126 CA 323; judgment reversed in part re merger of convictions, see 308 C. 242. Proof that defendant knew package contained marijuana, and not a different substance, was an essential element of both the conspiracy count and accessory count; where defendant is charged as an accessory, state must prove defendant possessed 1 kilogram or more of marijuana, but need not prove that defendant knew he possessed 1 kilogram or more of marijuana. 151 CA 154.",

(b) by replacing “in or on, or within one thousand five hundred feet of,” with “with intent to commit such violation at a specific location that the trier of fact determines is (1) in or on”, designating existing language re schools as Subsec. (b)(1)(A), designating existing language re public housing projects as Subsec. (b)(1)(B), designating existing language re licensed child care centers as Subsec. (b)(1)(C), adding Subsecs. (c)(2)(A), (B) and (C) re a specific location within 200 feet of the perimeter of such a property and replacing 1500 feet with 200 feet of the perimeter of the real property.\n\nSee Sec. 21a-283a re authority of court to depart from prescribed mandatory minimum sentence.\n\nCited. 20 CA 694; 25 CA 21; 32 CA 724; Id., 831; 35 CA 609. Evidence that was sufficient to prove violation of Sec. 21a-278 was, in this case, sufficient to prove violation of section. 85 CA 575.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\nCited. 231 C. 941; 235 C. 477; 239 C. 427; 241 C. 650. The state, through the testimony of police officers that the sale of narcotics took place within 1,500 feet of a high school, satisfied its burden of proof that the school was an operating secondary school within the meaning of section. 289 C. 496. Evidence that included large quantity of drugs found in defendant's vehicle, money strewn on passenger seat and fact that officers stopped defendant within 1,500 feet of a public housing project which is known for heavy drug trafficking was insufficient to establish defendant had requisite intent to sell drugs within 1,500 feet of the public housing project. 297 C. 621. Sentence suspending execution of 10-year sentence for violating Sec. 21a-277(a) without imposing a period of probation and adding mandatory 3-year sentence for violating this section for a total effective sentence of 13 years imprisonment, execution suspended after 7 years, with 3 years of probation was not illegal because this section mandates a 3-year nonsuspendable and consecutive sentence and the trial court's only option was to impose the probationary period in conjunction with its decision to partially suspend the execution of the sentence for violating Sec. 21a-277(a) after 4 years of imprisonment. 301 C. 716. A person may be convicted of sale of narcotics once he engages in any conduct set forth in Sec. 21a-240(50), including offering to sell narcotics, and the state is not required to prove that the actual physical transfer of narcotics occurred within 1,500 feet of a school, since it is sufficient to show that an offer to sell occurred within 1,500 feet of a school. 308 C. 43. Cumulative force of the evidence was not sufficient to prove intent to sell drugs within prohibited zone of housing project, and evidence was equally supportive of an inference that defendant intended to sell the drugs outside the prohibited zone or anywhere that the opportunity presented itself. 316 C. 514.\n\nCited. 38 CA 621; 42 CA 500; Id., 537; judgment reversed, see 241 C. 650; Id., 640; 43 CA 339. Is a separate substantive offense from Sec. 21a-278(b). 58 CA 592. Legislature intended possession with intent to sell within 1,500 feet of school and sale within 1,500 feet of school to be separate crimes. 66 CA 118. Evidence presented, i.e. testimony of expert witness that distance between school and boundary line of property on which the sale of narcotics took place was 1,430 feet and a photograph of the property with the point of sale indicated, was sufficient to support jury's finding that sale of narcotics was within 1,500 feet of property on which a public elementary school was located. 67 CA 643. Does not require use of certain language to meet requirement of being “identified as a child day care center by a sign posted in a conspicuous place”; whether a posted sign satisfies statute is a question of fact. 70 CA 255. Conviction for conspiracy to sell a controlled substance within 1,500 feet of a public housing project reversed where trial court instructed that jury must find that conspiracy occurred within 1,500 feet of public housing project; the law is not concerned with where the plan was hatched, but with where the conspirators proposed to carry out its unlawful purpose. 73 CA 386. Trial court properly determined that defendant possessed narcotics with intent to sell within 1,500 feet of a school where defendant, upon being confronted by police, transferred drugs to a passenger in a motor vehicle; defendant's actual transfer of drugs to the passenger was in and of itself evidence of intent to sell. 101 CA 167. In enacting Subsec., the legislature intended to create a separate substantive offense and not merely a penalty enhancement provision. 112 CA 349. Section is not impermissibly vague because it provides adequate notice that the act of agreeing to distribute drugs while in the protected area, even though the drugs might be distributed outside the protected area, is enough for a conviction for either conspiring or attempting to distribute drugs under section. 124 CA 9. Evidence showing that defendant delivered crack cocaine to purchaser during ride in defendant's automobile, which traveled within and in excess of 1,500 feet of a school, was insufficient to fulfill state's burden of proof that the delivery of drugs occurred within the 1,500 foot zone. 127 CA 264; judgment reversed, see 308 C. 43. Definition of “public housing project” not void for vagueness. Id., 654. Mere speculation about the precise location or locations where defendant intended to sell marijuana is insufficient to support a conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell within 1,500 feet of a public school. 134 CA 232.",
