The following statement shall prominently and conspicuously appear, in at least twelve-point font, at the top of the contract:\n\n“BUYER'S RIGHT TO CANCEL\n\nIf you wish to cancel this contract, you may cancel by sending a written notice stating that you do not wish to be bound by this contract. The notice must be delivered or mailed before midnight of the third business day after you sign this contract. The notice must be delivered or mailed to:\n\n(Insert name, electronic mail address and mailing address for cancellation notice.)\n\nYou may also cancel this contract if:\n\n(1) You relocate your residence further than twenty-five (25) miles from any health club operated by the seller or from any other substantially similar health club which would accept the obligation of the seller;\n\n(2) You die; or\n\n(3) The health club ceases operation at the location where you entered into this contract or the location closest to your primary residence.\n\nIf you become disabled, you shall have the option of:\n\n(1) Being relieved of liability for payment on that portion of the contract term for which you are disabled; or\n\n(2) Extending the duration of the original contract at no cost to you for a period equal to the duration of the disability.\n\nYou must send a written notice of disability, which may be sent to the health club in an electronic form. You may be required to prove such disability by submitting documentation from a licensed physician, a licensed physician assistant, a licensed advanced practice registered nurse or another credentialed medical provider. If you cancel, the health club may keep or collect an amount equal to the fair market value of the services or use of facilities you have already received.”\n\n(b) If a buyer cancels a health club contract pursuant to the three-day cancellation provision or as a result of having moved further than twenty-five miles, or as a result of the health club ceasing operation at the location where the buyer entered into the contract or the location closest to the buyer's primary residence as provided by this chapter, the health club shall send the buyer a written confirmation of cancellation within fifteen days after receipt by the health club of the buyer's cancellation notice.

Such form shall provide on it a location where the buyer shall indicate in writing the option such buyer has chosen. Such form shall be signed by the buyer and the health club.\n\n(d) In any cancellation of a health club service contract the buyer shall not be liable for any payment to the seller if the services received by the buyer are as a result of a representation by the health club to the buyer that such services are to be received free or if the buyer received services at a health club as a result of a representation by the health club to the buyer that such services are to be received at a reduced or discount price, the buyer shall only be liable as a result of his cancellation for an amount equal to that which was represented to the buyer that such buyer would have to pay.\n\n(e) Any refund to the buyer as a result of cancellation of the contract shall be delivered by the health club to the buyer within fifteen business days of receipt by the health club of the notice of cancellation.\n\n(P.A. 76-262, S. 3; P.A. 77-585, S. 3; P.A. 84-531, S. 3; P.A. 05-158, S. 3; P.A. 16-39, S. 44; P.A. 21-37, S. 39; 21-196, S. 50; P.A. 24-142, S. 20.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 77-585 changed wording of buyer's rights statement, required that statement be in ten-point bold type and added Subsecs.

Money in the fund may be invested or reinvested in the same manner as funds of the state employees retirement system, and the interest derived from such investments shall be credited to the guaranty fund whenever the fund balance is less than three hundred fifty thousand dollars. Any such payments or interest not deposited in the guaranty fund shall be credited to the General Fund.\n\n(d) If a health club is no longer in operation at the location where the buyer entered into the contract, the buyer having a claim against said health club may apply to the commissioner for payment of such claim from the guaranty fund, if the claim arises from (1) failure to provide services, (2) failure to comply with its contract obligations, (3) failure to remain open for the duration of its contracts, or (4) failure to comply with any provision of this chapter. Such claim may be filed if the health club fails to make payment of such claim.\n\n(e) The commissioner shall provide forms for applications by buyers for payment from the guaranty fund. The application shall include the name and address of the health club, the beginning and ending date of the contract, the price of the contract, the date of the closing of the health club, the amount and the basis of the claim and a copy of the contract or other proof of membership deemed suitable by the commissioner. No application for a payment from the guaranty fund shall be accepted by the commissioner more than six months after the date of the closing of the location of the health club where the buyer entered into the contract.\n\n(f) (1) Before the commissioner may issue any order directing payment out of the guaranty fund to a buyer pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall first notify the health club of the buyer's application for an order directing payment out of the guaranty fund and of the health club's right to a hearing to contest the disbursement in the event that the health club (A) has already paid the buyer, or (B) is complying with a payment schedule in accordance with (i) a written agreement with the buyer, or (ii) a court judgment, order or decree.\n\n(2) If a health club described in subdivision (1) of this subsection requests a hearing, the commissioner shall grant such request and conduct the hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 if the health club submits such request (A) in writing, and (B) not later than fifteen days after the health club receives the notice issued by the commissioner pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection.\n\n(3) If the commissioner does not receive a request from a health club for a hearing within the fifteen-day period set forth in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the commissioner shall (A) determine that the buyer has not been paid, and (B) issue an order directing payment out of the guaranty fund for the amount due.\n\n(4) If multiple buyers submit claims against any health club, the commissioner may hear such buyers' applications in one proceeding.\n\n(g) After hearing, the commissioner shall issue an order requiring payment from the guaranty fund of any sum the commissioner finds to be payable upon such application. The total compensation payable from the guaranty fund on the closing of any one health club location shall not exceed seventy-five thousand dollars.\n\n(h) If the commissioner pays any amount as a result of a claim against a health club pursuant to an order under subsection (g) of this section, the health club shall not be eligible to receive a new or renewed license until the health club has repaid such amount in full, plus interest at a rate to be determined by the commissioner.\n\n(i) If the commissioner pays any amount as a result of a claim against a health club pursuant to an order under subsection (g) of this section, the commissioner shall determine if the health club is possessed of real or personal property or other assets, liable to be sold or applied in satisfaction of the claim on such fund. If the commissioner discovers any such assets, the commissioner may request that the Attorney General take any action necessary for the realization thereof for the reimbursement of the guaranty fund.\n\n(j) The commissioner may, in order to preserve the integrity of the guaranty fund, order payments to be made out of said fund for amounts less than the actual loss incurred by any buyer of a health club contract.\n\n(k) When the commissioner has caused any sum to be paid from the guaranty fund to a buyer who has entered into a health club contract, the commissioner shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the buyer up to the amount paid, and the buyer shall assign all of the buyer's right, title, and interest in the claim up to such amount to the commissioner, and any amount and interest recovered by the commissioner on the claim shall be deposited to the guaranty fund, except as provided in subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(l) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes to the contrary, the commissioner may prohibit a health club from making payments to the Connecticut Health Club Guaranty Fund if, in the opinion of the commissioner, the health club within the past five years has engaged in any unfair or deceptive trade practices under subsection (a) of section 42-110b, has engaged in any conduct of a character likely to mislead, deceive or defraud the buyer, the public or the commissioner, or has violated any of the provisions this chapter. If the commissioner determines that a health club should be prohibited from making payments to the Connecticut Health Club Guaranty Fund, the department shall provide notice to the health club, which notice shall state the grounds for the contemplated action. Not later than fourteen days after the health club receives such notice, the health club may file a written request for a hearing. If a hearing is requested such hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54.\n\n(m) Each health club which has been prohibited from making payments to the Connecticut Health Club Guaranty Fund shall furnish the commissioner with a guaranty bond satisfactory to the commissioner in a sum equal to one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars and shall obtain a certificate from the department that the requirements of this subsection have been met. If a health club is no longer in operation at the location where the buyer entered into the contract, the buyer having a claim against the health club may apply to the commissioner for payment of such claim from the guaranty bond, if the claim arises from (1) failure to provide services, (2) failure to comply with its contract obligations, (3) failure to remain open for the duration of its contracts, or (4) failure to comply with any provision of this chapter. Such claim may be filed if, within thirty days after the buyer gives notice of the claim to the health club, the health club fails to make payment of such claim.\n\n(n) The commissioner may adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 to carry out the purposes of this section.\n\n(P.A. 84-531, S. 8; P.A. 88-179, S. 1–3; P.A. 90-96, S. 1; P.A. 95-135, S. 1; 95-219; P.A. 02-82, S. 4; June 30 Sp.
