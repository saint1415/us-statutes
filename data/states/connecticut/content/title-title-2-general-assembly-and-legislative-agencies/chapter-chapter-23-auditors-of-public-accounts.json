Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, no state agency may deny the auditors access to their records or accounts.\n\n(h) Where there are statutory requirements of confidentiality with regard to such records and accounts or examinations of nongovernmental entities which are maintained by a state agency, such requirements of confidentiality and the penalties for the violation thereof shall apply to the auditors and to their authorized representatives in the same manner and to the same extent as such requirements of confidentiality and penalties apply to such state agency.
