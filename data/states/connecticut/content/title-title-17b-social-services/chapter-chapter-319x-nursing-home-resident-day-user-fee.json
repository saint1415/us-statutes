For purposes of this subdivision, a day of nursing home care service shall be the period of time between the census-taking hour in a nursing home on two successive calendar days. “Resident day” does not include a Medicare day or the day a resident is discharged;\n\n(6) “Nursing home net revenue” means amounts billed by a nursing home for all room, board and ancillary services, minus (A) contractual allowances, (B) payer discounts, (C) charity care, and (D) bad debts; and\n\n(7) “Contractual allowances” means the amount of discounts allowed by a nursing home to certain payers from amounts billed for room, board and ancillary services.\n\n(b) (1) (A) For each calendar quarter commencing on or after July 1, 2005, and prior to July 1, 2017, there is hereby imposed a resident day user fee on each nursing home in this state, which fee shall be the product of the nursing home's total resident days during the calendar quarter multiplied by the user fee, as determined by the Commissioner of Social Services pursuant to subsection (a) of section 17b-321.\n\n(B) Commencing with the calendar quarter in which approval of the waiver of federal requirements for uniform and broad-based user fees in accordance with 42 CFR 433.68 pursuant to section 17b-323 is granted, the resident day user fee shall be the product of the nursing home's total resident days during the calendar quarter multiplied by the user fee, as redetermined by the Commissioner of Social Services pursuant to subsection (b) of section 17b-321.\n\n(2) Each nursing home shall, on or before the last day of January, April, July, and October of each year, render to the commissioner a return, on forms prescribed or furnished by the commissioner, stating the nursing home's total resident days during the calendar quarter ending on the last day of the preceding month and stating such other information as the commissioner deems necessary for the proper administration of this section. The resident day user fee imposed under this section shall be due and payable on the due date of such return. Each nursing home shall be required to file such return electronically with the department and to make such payment by electronic funds transfer in the manner provided by chapter 228g, irrespective of whether the nursing home would have otherwise been required to file such return electronically or to make such payment by electronic funds transfer under the provisions of said chapter 228g.\n\n(c) Whenever such resident day user fee is not paid when due, a penalty of ten per cent of the amount due or fifty dollars, whichever is greater, shall be imposed, and interest at the rate of one per cent per month or fraction thereof shall accrue on such user fee from the due date of such user fee until the date of payment.\n\n(d) The commissioner shall notify the Commissioner of Social Services of any amount delinquent under sections 17b-320 to 17b-323, inclusive, and, upon receipt of such notice, the Commissioner of Social Services shall deduct and withhold such amount from amounts otherwise payable by the Department of Social Services to the delinquent nursing home.\n\n(e) The provisions of section 12-548, sections 12-550 to 12-554, inclusive, and section 12-555a shall apply to the provisions of this section in the same manner and with the same force and effect as if the language of said sections had been incorporated in full into this section and had expressly referred to the user fee imposed under this section, except to the extent that any provision is inconsistent with a provision in this section. For purposes of section 12-39g, the resident day user fee shall be treated as a tax.\n\n(f) The commissioner may enter into an agreement with the Commissioner of Social Services delegating to the Commissioner of Social Services the authority to examine the records and returns of any nursing home subject to the resident day user fee imposed under this section and to determine whether such user fee has been underpaid or overpaid. If such authority is so delegated, examinations of such records and returns by the Department of Social Services and determinations by said department that such user fee has been underpaid or overpaid, shall have the same effect as similar examinations or determinations made by the Department of Revenue Services.\n\n(g) (1) The commissioner shall not collect the resident day user fee pursuant to this section until the Commissioner of Social Services informs the commissioner that all the necessary federal approvals are in effect to secure federal financial participation matching funds associated with the rate increases as described in subdivision (4) of subsection (f) of section 17b-340.\n\n(2) The commissioner shall cease to collect the resident day user fee pursuant to this section if the Commissioner of Social Services informs the commissioner that the federal approvals described in subdivision (1) of this subsection are withheld or withdrawn.\n\n(P.A. 05-251, S. 78; 05-280, S. 47; P.A. 06-196, S. 136–138; June Sp.

      "text": "(a) On or before July 1, 2005, and on or before July first annually or biennially and prior to July 1, 2017, the Commissioner of Social Services shall determine the amount of the user fee and promptly notify the commissioner and nursing homes of such amount. The user fee shall be (1) the sum of each nursing home's anticipated nursing home net revenue, including, but not limited to, its estimated net revenue from any increases in Medicaid payments, during the twelve-month period ending on June thirtieth of the succeeding calendar year, (2) which sum shall be multiplied by a percentage as determined by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, in consultation with the Commissioner of Social Services, provided before January 1, 2008, such percentage shall not exceed six per cent, on and after January 1, 2008, and prior to October 1, 2011, and prior to July 1, 2017, such percentage shall not exceed five and one-half per cent, and on and after October 1, 2011, such percentage shall not exceed the maximum allowed under federal law, and (3) which product shall be divided by the sum of each nursing home's anticipated resident days during the twelve-month period ending on June thirtieth of the succeeding calendar year. The Commissioner of Social Services, in anticipating nursing home net revenue and resident days, shall use the most recently available nursing home net revenue and resident day information. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the Commissioner of Social Services may adjust the user fee as necessary to prevent the state from exceeding the maximum allowed under federal law.\n\n(b) Upon approval of the waiver of federal requirements for uniform and broad-based user fees in accordance with 42 CFR 433.68 pursuant to section 17b-323, the Commissioner of Social Services shall redetermine the amount of the user fee and promptly notify the commissioner and nursing homes of such amount. The user fee shall be (1) the sum of each nursing home's anticipated nursing home net revenue, including, but not limited to, its estimated net revenue from any increases in Medicaid payments, during the twelve-month period ending on June thirtieth of the succeeding calendar year but not including any such anticipated net revenue of any nursing home exempted from such user fee due to waiver of federal requirements pursuant to section 17b-323, (2) which sum shall be multiplied by a percentage as determined by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, in consultation with the Commissioner of Social Services, provided before January 1, 2008, such percentage shall not exceed six per cent, on and after January 1, 2008, and prior to October 1, 2011, such percentage shall not exceed five and one-half per cent, and on and after October 1, 2011, such percentage shall not exceed the maximum allowed under federal law, and (3) which product shall be divided by the sum of each nursing home's anticipated resident days, but not including the anticipated resident days of any nursing home exempted from such user fee due to waiver of federal requirements pursuant to section 17b-323. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the amount of the user fee for each nursing home licensed for more than two hundred thirty beds or owned by a municipality shall be equal to the amount necessary to comply with federal provider tax uniformity waiver requirements as determined by the Commissioner of Social Services. The Commissioner of Social Services may increase retroactively the user fee for nursing homes not licensed for more than two hundred thirty beds and not owned by a municipality to the effective date of waiver of said federal requirements to offset user fee reductions necessary to meet the federal waiver requirements. On or before July 1, 2005, and biennially thereafter, the Commissioner of Social Services shall determine the amount of the user fee in accordance with this subsection. The Commissioner of Social Services, in anticipating nursing home net revenue and resident days, shall use the most recently available nursing home net revenue and resident day information.\n\n(c) (1) Following a redetermination of the resident day user fee by the Commissioner of Social Services pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the Commissioner of Social Services shall notify the commissioner of the identity of (A) any nursing home subsequently exempted from the resident day user fee due to the waiver of federal requirements pursuant to section 17b-323 and the effective date of such waiver, (B) any nursing home licensed for more than two hundred thirty beds or owned by a municipality and the effective date of any change in its user fee, and (C) any nursing home for which the user fee is retroactively increased pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and the effective date of such increase. The Commissioner of Social Services shall provide notice of any such retroactive user fee increase to each nursing home so affected.\n\n(2) Upon being notified by the Commissioner of Social Services, the commissioner shall refund or credit to any nursing home subsequently exempted from the resident day user fee due to the waiver of federal requirements pursuant to section 17b-323 any resident day user fee collected from such home. No interest shall be payable on the amount of such refund or credit. Any such nursing home shall refund any fees paid by or on behalf of any resident to the party making such payment.\n\n(3) Upon being notified by the Commissioner of Social Services, the commissioner shall refund or credit to any nursing home licensed for more than two hundred thirty beds or owned by a municipality any resident day user fee collected from such home in excess of the resident day user fee that would have been payable had the user fee, as redetermined by the Commissioner of Social Services, been used in calculating the nursing home's resident day user fee. No interest shall be payable on the amount of such refund or credit.\n\n(4) Upon being notified by the Commissioner of Social Services, the commissioner shall notify any nursing home for which the user fee is retroactively increased pursuant to subsection (b) of this section of the additional amount of resident day user fee due and owing from such nursing home. Such a notice of additional amount due and owing to the commissioner shall not be treated as a notice of deficiency assessment by the commissioner nor shall the nursing home have, based on such notice of additional amount due, any right of protest or appeal to the commissioner as in the case of such a deficiency assessment. No interest shall be payable on such additional amount to the extent such additional amount is paid on or before the last day of the month next succeeding the month during which the Commissioner of Social Services provided notice of such retroactive user fee increase to such nursing home.\n\n(P.A. 05-251, S. 79; 05-280, S. 48; P.A. 06-188, S. 6, 7; 06-196, S. 139; June Sp.

(a) and (b) by requiring Commissioner of Social Services to determine the user fee “biennially” rather than annually and to report to the General Assembly on the detrimental effects, if any, of such biennial determination, effective July 1, 2006; P.A. 06-196 made technical changes in Subsecs. (a) and (b), effective June 7, 2006; June Sp. Sess. P.A. 07-2 amended Subsecs. (a)(2) and (b)(2) to provide that sum shall be multiplied by percentage determined by Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, in consultation with Commissioner of Social Services, provided before January 1, 2008, percentage shall not exceed 6% and shall not exceed 5.5% after that date, effective July 1, 2007; P.A. 11-6 amended Subsecs. (a) and (b) to change maximum percentage on and after October 1, 2011, from not in excess of 5.5% to not in excess of the maximum allowed under federal law in Subdiv. (2), and to remove provisions re report required on or before July 1, 2007, effective July 1, 2001; P.A. 11-44 amended Subsec. (a) by allowing commissioner to determine user fee annually or biennially and adding provision allowing commissioner to adjust user fee to prevent fee from exceeding the maximum allowed under federal law, effective July 1, 2011; June Sp. Sess. P.A. 17-2 amended Subsec. (a) by deleting “thereafter” and adding prior to July 1, 2017”, re determination and percentage of user fee, effective October 31, 2017.\n\nSee Ch. 211c re nursing home user fee.",

For the purposes of this section, “net gain in revenue” means the difference between the rate in effect June 30, 2005, and the rate in effect on July 1, 2005, multiplied by the number of resident days eligible for state payment for the period between July 1, 2005, and June 30, 2006, less resident day user fees accrued for the period between July 1, 2005, and June 30, 2006.
