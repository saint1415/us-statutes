Each such protocol shall assure that the participants are informed, are competent to understand and agree to an affirmation or acknowledgment of parentage, and that any such affirmation or acknowledgment is voluntary and free from coercion. Each such protocol shall also provide for the training of all staff members involved in the voluntary parentage establishment process so that such staff members will understand their obligations to implement the voluntary parentage establishment program in such a way that the participants are informed, are competent to understand and agree to an affirmation or acknowledgment of parentage, and that any such affirmation or acknowledgment is voluntary and free from coercion. No entity may participate in the program until its protocol has been approved by the commissioner. The commissioner shall make all protocols and proposed protocols available for public inspection.

      "text": "The Interstate Compact on Welfare Services is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this state with any other jurisdiction or jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:\n\nINTERSTATE COMPACT ON WELFARE SERVICES\n\nThe policy of the states party to this compact is to make welfare services available on a reciprocal basis under this compact and to eliminate barriers caused by restrictive residence or settlement requirements of the several states. However, it is recognized that law and policy relating generally to the provision of welfare services by a particular state should not be determined by interstate compact and will remain a matter for determination by that party state and its subdivisions. This compact shall be open for joinder by any state of the United States and the District of Columbia.\n\nAs used in this compact, the phrase “welfare service” shall mean and include: (1) Old age assistance; (2) aid to the blind; (3) temporary family assistance; (4) aid to the permanently and totally disabled; (5) general assistance or home relief, by whatever name known, for persons not eligible under other assistance categories; (6) child welfare services; (7) care of unwed mothers; (8) welfare medical services for those in need; provided that no party state shall be obligated to provide a welfare service which is not made available generally by its laws.\n\nARTICLE III\n\n(a) No person who has removed himself from one party state to another party state shall be ineligible for a welfare service in such other party state because of failure to meet that state's residence or settlement requirements for eligibility. The cost of providing a welfare service to any person made eligible therefor by reason of this compact shall be charged within the state in accordance with the laws of such state.\n\n(b) The appropriate official, department or agency of the state where application for a welfare service is made pursuant to this compact shall be entitled to request and receive any pertinent information available from any other party state with respect to such applicant.\n\n(a) The duly constituted administrative authorities of any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements for the provision of any service or facility in the field of social welfare which may be in addition to those denominated as welfare services in this compact whenever the states concerned shall find that such agreements will improve social welfare, its services or facilities. No such supplementary agreement shall be construed so as to relieve any party state of any obligation which it otherwise would have under other provisions of this compact; nor shall it authorize or require any party state to assume any obligation not otherwise authorized by law.\n\n(b) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to invalidate any reciprocal agreement between a party state and a nonparty state relating to the reciprocal provision of welfare services nor to invalidate any statutory authority for such agreements.\n\nEach party state shall appoint a compact administrator who shall act as general coordinator of activities under the compact in his state, and whose duty it shall be to cooperate with the compact administrators of other party states. The compact administrators of the respective party states shall have power to promulgate reasonable regulations to carry out the terms and provisions of this compact.\n\n(a) This compact shall enter into full force and effect as to any state when enacted by it into law and such state shall thereafter be a party thereto with any and all states legally joining therein.\n\n(b) A state party to this compact may withdraw therefrom by enacting a statute repealing the same. Such withdrawal shall take effect six months after notice thereof has been communicated officially and in writing to the governors and compact administrators of all other party states. However, the withdrawal of any state shall not affect the rights of any person who is receiving a welfare service pursuant to the provisions of this compact.\n\n(c) Withdrawal from any supplementary agreement made pursuant to Article IV shall be in accordance with the terms of such agreement.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nThis compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\n\n(1961, P.A. 372, S. 1; June 18 Sp.
