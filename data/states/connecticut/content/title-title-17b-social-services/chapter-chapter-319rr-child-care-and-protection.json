      "text": "(a)(1) The Superior Court or a family support magistrate may make and enforce orders for payment of support to the Commissioner of Administrative Services or, in IV-D support cases, to the state acting by and through the IV-D agency, directed to the husband or wife and, if the patient or person is under the age of eighteen years or as otherwise provided in this subsection, to any parent of any patient or person being supported by the state, wholly or in part, in a state humane institution, or under any welfare program administered by the Department of Social Services, as the court or family support magistrate finds, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of section 17b-179, or section 17a-90, 17b-81, 17b-223, 46b-129 or 46b-130, to be reasonably commensurate with the financial ability of any such relative. If such person is unmarried and a full-time high school student, such support shall continue according to the parents' respective abilities, if such person is in need of support, until such person completes the twelfth grade or attains the age of nineteen, whichever occurs first. Any court or family support magistrate called upon to make or enforce such an order, including an order based upon a determination consented to by the relative, shall ensure that such order is reasonable in light of the relative's ability to pay.\n\n(2) (A) The court or family support magistrate shall include in each support order in a IV-D support case a provision for the health care coverage of the child. Such provision may include an order for either parent or both parents to provide such coverage under any or all of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph.\n\n(i) The provision for health care coverage may include an order for either parent to name any child as a beneficiary of any medical or dental insurance or benefit plan carried by such parent or available to such parent at a reasonable cost, as described in clause (iv) of this subparagraph. If such order requires the parent to maintain insurance available through an employer, the order shall be enforced using a National Medical Support Notice as provided in section 46b-88.\n\n(ii) The provision for health care coverage may include an order for either parent to: (I) Apply for and maintain coverage on behalf of the child under HUSKY B; or (II) provide cash medical support, as described in clauses (v) and (vi) of this subparagraph. An order under this clause shall be made only if the cost to the parent obligated to maintain coverage under HUSKY B, or provide cash medical support is reasonable as described in clause (iv) of this subparagraph. An order under subclause (I) of this clause shall be made only if insurance coverage as described in clause (i) of this subparagraph is unavailable at reasonable cost to either parent, or inaccessible to the child.\n\n(iii) An order for payment of the child's medical and dental expenses, other than those described in subclause (II) of clause (v) of this subparagraph, that are not covered by insurance or reimbursed in any other manner shall be entered in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a.\n\n(iv) Health care coverage shall be deemed reasonable in cost if: (I) The parent obligated to maintain such coverage would qualify as a low-income obligor under the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a, based solely on such parent's income, and the cost does not exceed five per cent of such parent's net income; or (II) the parent obligated to maintain such coverage would not qualify as a low-income obligor under such guidelines and the cost does not exceed seven and one-half per cent of such parent's net income. In either case, net income shall be determined in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a. If a parent obligated to maintain insurance must obtain coverage for himself or herself to comply with the order to provide coverage for the child, reasonable cost shall be determined based on the combined cost of coverage for such parent and such child.\n\n(v) Cash medical support means: (I) An amount ordered to be paid toward the cost of premiums for health insurance coverage provided by a public entity, including HUSKY A or B, except as provided in clause (vi) of this subparagraph, or by another parent through employment or otherwise, or (II) an amount ordered to be paid, either directly to a medical provider or to the person obligated to pay such provider, toward any ongoing extraordinary medical and dental expenses of the child that are not covered by insurance or reimbursed in any other manner, provided such expenses are documented and identified specifically on the record, or in an affidavit, made under oath, that also states that no restraining order issued pursuant to section 46b-15 or protective order issued pursuant to section 46b-38c, between the parties is in effect or pending before the court. Cash medical support, as described in subclauses (I) and (II) of this clause, may be ordered in lieu of an order under clause (i) of this subparagraph to be effective until such time as health insurance that is accessible to the child and reasonable in cost becomes available, or in addition to an order under clause (i) of this subparagraph, provided the total cost to the obligated parent of insurance and cash medical support is reasonable, as described in clause (iv) of this subparagraph. An order for cash medical support shall be payable to the state or the custodial party, as their interests may appear, provided an order under subclause (I) of this clause shall be effective only as long as health insurance coverage is maintained. Any unreimbursed medical and dental expenses not covered by an order issued pursuant to subclause (II) of this clause are subject to an order for unreimbursed medical and dental expenses pursuant to clause (iii) of this subparagraph.\n\n(vi) Cash medical support to offset the cost of any insurance payable under HUSKY A or B, shall not be ordered against a noncustodial parent who is a low-income obligor, as defined in the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a, or against a custodial parent of children covered under HUSKY A or B.\n\n(B) Whenever an order of the Superior Court or family support magistrate is issued against a parent to cover the cost of such medical or dental insurance or benefit plan for a child who is eligible for Medicaid benefits, and such parent has received payment from a third party for the costs of such services but such parent has not used such payment to reimburse, as appropriate, either the other parent or guardian or the provider of such services, the Department of Social Services may request the court or family support magistrate to order the employer of such parent to withhold from the wages, salary or other employment income of such parent to the extent necessary to reimburse the Department of Social Services for expenditures for such costs under the Medicaid program, except that any claims for current or past-due child support shall take priority over any such claims for the costs of such services.\n\n(3) Said court or family support magistrate shall also have authority to make and enforce orders directed to the conservator or guardian of any such patient or person, or the payee of Social Security or other benefits to which such patient or person is entitled, to the extent of the income or estate held or received by such fiduciary or payee in any such capacity.\n\n(4) For purposes of this section, the term “father” shall include a person who has acknowledged in writing paternity of a child born out of wedlock, and the court or family support magistrate shall have authority to determine, order and enforce payment of any accumulated sums due under a written agreement to support such child in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(5) (A) The court or family support magistrate may also make and enforce orders for the payment by any person named herein of past-due support for which any such person is liable in accordance with the provisions of section 17a-90 or 17b-81, subsection (b) of section 17b-179 or section 17b-223, 46b-129 or 46b-130 and, in IV-D cases, order such person, provided such person is not incapacitated, to participate in work activities that may include, but shall not be limited to, job search, training, work experience and participation in the job training and retraining program established by the Labor Commissioner pursuant to section 31-3t. A parent's liability for past-due support of a child born out of wedlock shall be limited to the three years next preceding the filing of a petition pursuant to this section.\n\n(B) In the determination of child support due based on neglect or refusal to furnish support prior to the action, the support due for periods of time prior to the action shall be based upon the obligor's ability to pay during such prior periods, as determined in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a. The state shall disclose to the court any information in its possession concerning current and past ability to pay. If no information is available to the court concerning past ability to pay, the court may determine the support due for periods of time prior to the action as if past ability to pay is equal to current ability to pay, if current ability is known. If current ability to pay is not known, the court shall determine the past ability to pay based on the obligor's work history if known, or if not known, on the state minimum wage that was in effect during such periods, provided only actual earnings shall be used to determine ability to pay for past periods during which the obligor was a full-time high school student or was incarcerated, institutionalized or incapacitated.\n\n(C) Any finding of support due for periods of time prior to an action in which the obligor failed to appear shall be entered subject to adjustment. Such adjustment may be made upon motion of any party, and the state in IV-D cases shall make such motion if it obtains information that would have substantially affected the court's determination of past ability to pay if such information had been available to the court. Motion for adjustment under this subparagraph may be made not later than twelve months from the date upon which the obligor receives notification of (i) the amount of such finding of support due for periods of time prior to the action, and (ii) the right not later than twelve months from the date of receipt of such notification to present evidence as to such obligor's past ability to pay support for such periods of time prior to the action. A copy of any support order entered, subject to adjustment, that is provided to each party under subsection (c) of this section shall state in plain language the basis for the court's determination of past support, the right to request an adjustment and to present information concerning the obligor's past ability to pay, and the consequences of a failure to request such adjustment.\n\n(6) (A) All payments ordered by the court or family support magistrate under this section shall be made to the Commissioner of Administrative Services or, in IV-D cases, to the state acting by and through the IV-D agency, as the court or family support magistrate may determine, for the period during which the supported person is receiving assistance or care from the state, provided, in the case of beneficiaries of any program of public assistance, upon the discontinuance of such assistance, payments shall be distributed to the beneficiary, beginning with the effective date of discontinuance, and provided further that in IV-D support cases, all payments shall be distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act. Any order of payment made under this section may, at any time after being made, be set aside or altered by the court or a family support magistrate.\n\n(B) In IV-D support cases, the IV-D agency or a support enforcement agency under cooperative agreement with the IV-D agency may, upon notice to the obligor and obligee, redirect payments for the support of any child receiving child support enforcement services either to the state of Connecticut or to the present custodial party, as their interests may appear, provided neither the obligor nor the obligee objects in writing within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice. Any such notice shall be sent by first class mail to the most recent address of such obligor and obligee, as recorded in the state case registry pursuant to section 46b-218, and a copy of such notice shall be filed with the court or family support magistrate if both the obligor and obligee fail to object to the redirected payments within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice.\n\n(7) (A) Proceedings to obtain orders of support under this section shall be commenced by the service on the liable person or persons of a verified petition of the Commissioner of Administrative Services, the Commissioner of Social Services or their designees. The verified petition shall be filed by any of said commissioners or their designees in the judicial district of the court or Family Support Magistrate Division in which the patient, applicant, beneficiary, recipient or the defendant resides. The judge or family support magistrate shall cause a summons, signed by such judge or magistrate, by the clerk of said court, or by a commissioner of the Superior Court to be issued, requiring such liable person or persons to appear before the court or a family support magistrate at a time and place as determined by the clerk but not more than ninety days after the issuance of the summons to show cause, if any, why the request for relief in such petition should not be granted.\n\n(B) Service of process issued under this section may be made by a state marshal, any proper officer or any investigator employed by the Department of Social Services or by the Commissioner of Administrative Services. The state marshal, proper officer or investigator shall make due return of process to the court not less than twenty-one days before the date assigned for hearing. Upon proof of the service of the summons to appear before the court or a family support magistrate, at the time and place named for hearing upon such petition, the failure of the defendant to appear shall not prohibit the court or family support magistrate from going forward with the hearing.\n\n(8) Failure of any defendant to obey an order of the court or Family Support Magistrate Division made under this section may be punished as contempt of court. If the summons and order is signed by a commissioner of the Superior Court, upon proof of service of the summons to appear in court or before a family support magistrate and upon the failure of the defendant to appear at the time and place named for hearing upon the petition, request may be made by the petitioner to the court or family support magistrate for an order that a capias mittimus be issued. Except as otherwise provided, upon proof of the service of the summons to appear in court or before a family support magistrate at the time and place named for a hearing upon the failure of the defendant to obey the court order as contempt of court, the court or the family support magistrate may order a capias mittimus to be issued and directed to a judicial marshal to the extent authorized pursuant to section 46b-225, or any other proper officer to arrest such defendant and bring such defendant before the Superior Court for the contempt hearing. The costs of commitment of any person imprisoned for contempt shall be paid by the state as in criminal cases. When any such defendant is so found in contempt, the court or family support magistrate may award to the petitioner a reasonable attorney's fee and the fees of the officer serving the contempt citation, such sums to be paid by the person found in contempt.\n\n(9) In addition to or in lieu of contempt proceedings, the court or family support magistrate, upon a finding that any person has failed to obey any order made under this section, may issue an order directing that an income withholding order issue against such amount of any debt accruing by reason of personal services due and owing to such person in accordance with section 52-362, or against such lesser amount of such excess as said court or family support magistrate deems equitable, for payment of accrued and unpaid amounts due under such order and all amounts which thereafter become due under such order. On presentation of such income withholding order by the officer to whom delivered for service to the person or persons or corporation from whom such debt accruing by reason of personal services is due and owing, or thereafter becomes due and owing, to the person against whom such support order was issued, such income withholding order shall be a lien and a continuing levy upon such debt to the amount specified therein, which shall be accumulated by the debtor and paid directly to the Commissioner of Administrative Services or, in IV-D cases, to the state acting by and through the IV-D agency, in accordance with section 52-362, until such income withholding order and expenses are fully satisfied and paid, or until such income withholding order is modified.\n\n(10) No entry fee, judgment fee or any other court fee shall be charged by the court to either party in actions under this section.\n\n(11) Written statements from employers as to property, insurance, wages, indebtedness and other information obtained by the Commissioner of Social Services, or the Commissioner of Administrative Services under authority of section 17b-137, shall be admissible in evidence in actions under this section.\n\n(b) Except as provided in sections 46b-301 to 46b-425, inclusive, any court or family support magistrate, called upon to enforce a support order, shall insure that such order is reasonable in light of the obligor's ability to pay. Except as provided in sections 46b-301 to 46b-425, inclusive, any support order entered pursuant to this section, or any support order from another jurisdiction subject to enforcement by the state of Connecticut, may be modified by motion of the party seeking such modification, including Support Enforcement Services in IV-D support cases, as defined in subdivision (13) of subsection (b) of section 46b-231, upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party or upon a showing that the final order for child support substantially deviates from the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a, unless there was a specific finding on the record at a hearing, or in a written judgment, order or memorandum of decision of the court, that the application of the guidelines would be inequitable or inappropriate, provided the court or family support magistrate finds that the obligor or the obligee and any other interested party have received actual notice of the pendency of such motion and of the time and place of the hearing on such motion. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any deviation of less than fifteen per cent from the child support guidelines is not substantial and any deviation of fifteen per cent or more from the guidelines is substantial. Modification may be made of such support order without regard to whether the order was issued before, on or after May 9, 1991. In any hearing to modify any support order from another jurisdiction the court or the family support magistrate shall conduct the proceedings in accordance with sections 46b-384 to 46b-393, inclusive. No such support orders may be subject to retroactive modification except that the court or family support magistrate may order modification with respect to any period during which there is a pending motion for a modification of an existing support order from the date of service of notice of such pending motion upon the opposing party pursuant to section 52-50.\n\n(c) In IV-D support cases, as defined in subdivision (13) of subsection (b) of section 46b-231, a copy of any support order established or modified pursuant to this section or, in the case of a motion for modification of an existing support order, a notice of determination that there should be no change in the amount of the support order, shall be provided to each party and the state case registry within fourteen days after issuance of such order or determination.\n\n(1953, 1955, S. 1445d; 1951, 1953, 1955, S. 1461d; 1957, P.A. 28; 1959, P.A. 42, S. 1; 1963, P.A. 73, S. 2; 1967, P.A. 314, S. 12; 746, S. 5; 1972, P.A. 127, S. 30; 294, S. 22; June, 1972, P.A. 1, S. 11; P.A. 74-183, S. 217, 291; P.A. 75-420, S. 4, 6; P.A. 76-334, S. 7, 12; 76-435, S. 20, 82; 76-436, S. 186, 681; P.A. 77-594, S. 4, 7; 77-614, S. 70, 608, 610; P.A. 79-206; P.A. 80-70, S. 2; 80-149, S. 1, 3; P.A. 84-159, S. 3; 84-205, S. 2; P.A. 86-359, S. 30, 44; P.A. 87-316, S. 9; 87-421, S. 10, 13; P.A. 87-589, S. 32, 87; P.A. 90-188, S. 2; 90-213, S. 19, 56; P.A. 91-76, S. 2, 7; 91-391, S. 1; P.A. 92-253, S. 3; P.A. 93-187, S. 1; 93-262, S. 40, 89; 93-396, S. 1; May Sp.
