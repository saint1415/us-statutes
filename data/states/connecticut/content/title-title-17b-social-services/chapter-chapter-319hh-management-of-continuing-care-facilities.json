A provider may use funds in an account established by or pursuant to a mortgage loan, bond indenture or other long-term financing in its computation of the reserve amounts required to satisfy the provisions of this section, provided such funds are available to make payments when operating funds are insufficient for these purposes. To the extent that a provider is required pursuant to a mortgage loan, bond indenture or other long-term financing to maintain a certain number of days of cash on hand, cash amounts held pursuant to such a requirement may be applied toward the provider's computation of the operating reserve amount required to satisfy the provisions of this subsection. Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection, the commissioner may accept the terms or covenants regarding the establishment or maintenance of reserve or escrow funds or financial ratios associated with a mortgage loan, bond indenture or other long-term financing as an alternative to the reserve provisions set forth in this subsection.
