The commissioner may place a lien against any property to secure the claim of the state for all amounts which it has paid or may thereafter pay to such person or in such person's behalf (1) for cash assistance or medical assistance, provided no such lien shall be placed on real property unless for amounts required to be recovered under federal law, or (2) to or on behalf of any person for whose support he or she is liable, except for property maintained as a home in aid to families of dependent children cases, in which case such lien shall secure the state only for that portion of the assistance grant awarded for amortization of a mortgage or other encumbrance beginning with the fifth month after the original grant for principal payment on any such encumbrance is made, and each succeeding month of such grant thereafter. The claim of the state shall be secured by filing a certificate in the land records of the town or towns in which any such real estate is situated, describing such real estate. Any such lien may, at any time during which the amount secured by such lien remains unpaid, be foreclosed in an action brought in a court of competent jurisdiction by the commissioner on behalf of the state. Any real estate to which title has been taken by foreclosure under this section, or which has been conveyed to the state in lieu of foreclosure, may be sold, transferred or conveyed for the state by the commissioner with the approval of the Attorney General, and the commissioner may, in the name of the state, execute deeds for such purpose. Such lien shall be released by the commissioner upon payment of the amount secured by such lien, or an amount equal to the value of the beneficiary's interest in such property if the value of such interest is less than the amount secured by such lien, at the commissioner's discretion, and with the advice and consent of the Attorney General, upon a compromise of the amount due to the state. At the discretion of the commissioner, the beneficiary, or, in the case of a husband and wife living together, the survivor of them, as long as he or she lives, or a dependent child or children, may be permitted to occupy such real property.\n\n(b) On and after July 1, 2021, the state shall not recover cash assistance or medical assistance from a lien filed on any real property, unless the state is required to recover such assistance under federal law.

Any vendor convicted of vendor fraud under sections 53a-290 to 53a-296, inclusive, shall have such license or franchise revoked. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude any board or commission established under chapters 369 to 376, inclusive, 378 to 381, inclusive, and 383 to 388, inclusive, and the Department of Public Health with respect to professions under its jurisdiction which have no board or commission from taking any action authorized in section 19a-17. Any vendor who is convicted in any state or federal court of a crime involving fraud in the Medicare program or Medicaid program or aid to families with dependent children program or state-administered general assistance program or temporary family assistance program or state supplement to the federal Supplemental Security Income Program or any federal or state energy assistance program or general assistance program or state-funded child care program or the refugee program shall be terminated from such programs, effective upon conviction, except that the Commissioner of Social Services may delay termination for a period he deems sufficient to protect the health and well-being of beneficiaries receiving services from such vendor. A vendor who is ineligible for federal financial participation shall be ineligible for participation in such programs. No vendor shall be eligible for reimbursement for any goods provided or services performed by a person convicted of a crime involving fraud in such programs. The convicted person may request a hearing concerning such ineligibility for reimbursement pursuant to sections 4-176e to 4-180a, inclusive, and 4-181a provided such request is filed in writing with the Commissioner of Social Services within ten days of the date of written notice by the commissioner to the person of such ineligibility. The commissioner shall give notice of such ineligibility to such vendors by means of publication in the Connecticut Law Journal following the expiration of said ten-day hearing request period, if no timely request has been filed, or following the decision on the hearing. The Commissioner of Social Services may take such steps as necessary to inform the public of the conviction and ineligibility for reimbursement. No vendor or person so terminated or denied reimbursement shall be readmitted to or be eligible for reimbursement in such programs. Any sums paid as a result of vendor fraud under sections 53a-290 to 53a-296, inclusive, may be recovered in an action brought by the state against such person.\n\n(b) For the purpose of determining compliance with subsection (a) of this section, all vendors shall notify the commissioner within thirty days after the date of employment or conviction, whichever is later, of the identity, interest and extent of services performed by any person convicted of a crime involving fraud in the Medicare program or Medicaid program or aid to families with dependent children program or state-administered general assistance program or temporary family assistance program or state supplement to the federal Supplemental Security Income Program or any federal or state energy assistance program or general assistance program or state-funded child care program or the refugee program. Prior to the commissioner's acceptance of a provider agreement or at any time upon written request by the commissioner, the vendor shall furnish the commissioner with the identity of any person convicted of a crime involving fraud in such programs who has an ownership or control interest in the vendor or who is an agent or managing employee. The commissioner shall terminate, refuse to enter into or renew an agreement with a vendor, except a vendor providing room and board and services pursuant to section 17b-340, if such convicted person has such interest or is such agent or employee. In the case of a vendor providing room and board and services pursuant to said section 17b-340, the commissioner may terminate, refuse to enter into or renew an agreement after consideration of any adverse impact on beneficiaries of such termination or refusal.\n\n(c) The Department of Social Services shall distribute to all vendors who are providers in the medical assistance program a copy of the rules, regulations, standards and laws governing the program. The Commissioner of Social Services shall adopt by regulation in the manner provided for in sections 4-166 to 4-176, inclusive, administrative sanctions against providers in the Medicare program or Medicaid program or aid to families with dependent children program or state-funded child care program or state-administered general assistance program or temporary family assistance program or state supplement to the federal Supplemental Security Income Program including suspension from the program, for any violations of the rules, regulations, standards or law. The commissioner may adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 to provide for the withholding of payments currently due in order to offset money previously obtained as the result of error or fraud. The department shall notify the proper professional society and licensing agency of any violations of this section.\n\n(d) (1) The Commissioner of Social Services, or any entity with which the commissioner contracts for the purpose of conducting an audit of a service provider that participates as a provider of services in a program operated or administered by the department pursuant to this chapter or chapter 319t, 319v, 319y or 319ff, except a service provider for which rates are established pursuant to section 17b-340, shall conduct any such audit in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.

At the commencement of the audit, the commissioner, or any entity with which the commissioner contracts to conduct an audit of a participating provider, shall disclose (i) the name and contact information of the assigned auditor or auditors, (ii) the audit location, including notice of whether such audit shall be conducted on-site or through record submission, (iii) the manner by which information requested shall be submitted, and (iv) the types of information to be reviewed in the audit. No audit shall include claims paid more than thirty-six months from the date claims are selected for the audit. The commissioner shall not apply an agency policy, guideline, bulletin or manual provision or other criteria, including, but not limited to, updated medical payment codes, to make determinations in an audit unless the policy, guideline, bulletin or manual provision or other criteria, together with the effective date, was promulgated and distributed to a provider prior to provision of a service included in a claim being audited. The commissioner shall accept a scanned copy of documentation supporting a claim when the original documentation is unavailable.\n\n(3) Any clerical error discovered in a record or document produced for any such audit shall not of itself constitute a wilful violation of program rules unless proof of intent to commit fraud or otherwise violate program rules is established. In determining which providers shall be subject to audits, the Commissioner of Social Services may give consideration to the history of a provider's compliance in addition to other criteria used to select a provider for an audit.\n\n(4) A finding of overpayment or underpayment to a provider in a program operated or administered by the department pursuant to this chapter or chapter 319t, 319v, 319y or 319ff, except a provider for which rates are established pursuant to section 17b-340, shall not be based on extrapolation unless the total net amount of extrapolated overpayment calculated from a statistically valid sampling and extrapolation methodology exceeds one and three-quarters per cent of total claims paid to the provider for the audit period.\n\n(5) In conducting any audit pursuant to this subsection, the commissioner, or any entity with which the commissioner contracts to conduct such audit, shall accept (A) as sufficient proof of a written order: A photocopy, facsimile image, an electronically maintained document or original pen and ink document, and (B) as sufficient proof of delivery of a covered item or service: A receipt signed by the recipient of medical assistance or a nursing facility representative or, in the case of delivery of a covered item or service by a shipping or delivery service, a supplier's detailed shipping invoice and the delivery service tracking information substantiating delivery.

A provider, in complying with the requirements of any such audit, shall be allowed not less than thirty days to provide documentation in connection with any discrepancy discovered and brought to the attention of such provider in the course of any such audit. Such documentation may include evidence that errors concerning payment and billing resulted from a provider's transition to a new payment or billing service or accounting system. The commissioner shall not calculate an overpayment based on extrapolation or attempt to recover such extrapolated overpayment when the provider presents credible evidence that an error by the commissioner, or any entity with which the commissioner contracts to conduct an audit pursuant to this subsection, caused the overpayment, provided the commissioner may recover the amount of the original overpayment.\n\n(6) The commissioner, or any entity with which the commissioner contracts, for the purpose of conducting an audit of a provider of any of the programs operated or administered by the department pursuant to this chapter or chapter 319t, 319v, 319y or 319ff, except a service provider for which rates are established pursuant to section 17b-340, shall produce a preliminary written report concerning any audit conducted pursuant to this subsection, and such preliminary report shall be provided to the provider that was the subject of the audit not later than sixty days after the conclusion of such audit.\n\n(7) The commissioner, or any entity with which the commissioner contracts, for the purpose of conducting an audit of a provider of any of the programs operated or administered by the department pursuant to this chapter or chapter 319t, 319v, 319y or 319ff, except a service provider for which rates are established pursuant to section 17b-340, shall, following the issuance of the preliminary report pursuant to subdivision (6) of this subsection, hold an exit conference with any provider that was the subject of any audit pursuant to this subsection for the purpose of discussing the preliminary report. Such provider may present evidence at such exit conference refuting findings in the preliminary report.\n\n(8) The commissioner, or any entity with which the commissioner contracts, for the purpose of conducting an audit of a service provider, shall produce a final written report concerning any audit conducted pursuant to this subsection. Such final written report shall be provided to the provider that was the subject of the audit not later than sixty days after the date of the exit conference conducted pursuant to subdivision (7) of this subsection, unless the commissioner, or any entity with which the commissioner contracts for the purpose of conducting an audit of a service provider, agrees to a later date or there are other referrals or investigations pending concerning the provider.\n\n(9) Any provider aggrieved by a decision contained in a final written report issued pursuant to subdivision (8) of this subsection may, not later than thirty days after the receipt of the final report, request, in writing, a contested case hearing in accordance with chapter 54. Such request shall contain a detailed written description of each specific item of aggrievement. The designee of the commissioner who presides over the hearing shall be impartial and shall not be an employee of the Department of Social Services Office of Quality Assurance or an employee of an entity with which the commissioner contracts for the purpose of conducting an audit of a service provider. A provider shall be permitted to raise during such hearing that a negative audit finding was due to a provider's compliance with a state or federal law or regulation. Following review on all items of aggrievement, the designee of the commissioner who presides over the hearing shall issue a final decision not later than ninety days following the close of evidence or the date on which final briefs are filed, whichever occurs later. When a provider requests a hearing pursuant to this subdivision, and the provider is contesting an overpayment amount based on extrapolation, the Department of Social Services shall not recoup the overpayment amount at issue until a final decision is issued after the hearing.\n\n(10) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any audit conducted by the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit established within the Office of the Chief State's Attorney.\n\n(11) The commissioner shall provide free training to providers on how to enter claims to avoid errors and shall post information on the department's Internet web site concerning the auditing process, standard audit procedures and methods to avoid clerical errors. The commissioner shall establish and publish on the department's Internet web site audit protocols to assist the Medicaid provider community in developing programs to improve compliance with Medicaid requirements under state and federal laws and regulations, provided audit protocols may not be relied upon to create a substantive or procedural right or benefit enforceable at law or in equity by any person, including a corporation. The commissioner shall establish audit protocols for specific providers or categories of service, including, but not limited to: (A) Licensed home health agencies, (B) drug and alcohol treatment centers, (C) durable medical equipment, (D) hospital outpatient services, (E) physician and nursing services, (F) dental services, (G) behavioral health services, (H) pharmaceutical services, (I) emergency and nonemergency medical transportation services, and (J) homemaker companion services.

      "text": "*(a) The Department of Social Services shall administer a temporary family assistance program under which cash assistance shall be provided to eligible families in accordance with the temporary assistance for needy families program, established pursuant to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. The Commissioner of Social Services may operate portions of the temporary family assistance program as a solely state-funded program, separate from the federal temporary assistance for needy families program, if the commissioner determines that doing so will enable the state to avoid fiscal penalties under the temporary assistance for needy families program. Families receiving assistance under the solely state-funded portion of the temporary family assistance program shall be subject to the same conditions of eligibility as those receiving assistance under the federal temporary assistance for needy families program. Under the temporary family assistance program, benefits shall be provided to a family for not longer than twenty-one months, except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. For the purpose of calculating said twenty-one-month time limit, months of assistance received on and after January 1, 1996, pursuant to time limits under the aid to families with dependent children program, shall be included. For purposes of this section, “family” means one or more individuals who apply for or receive assistance together under the temporary family assistance program. If the commissioner determines that federal law allows individuals not otherwise in an eligible covered group for the temporary family assistance program to become covered, such family may also, at the discretion of the commissioner, be composed of (1) a pregnant woman, or (2) a parent, both parents or other caretaker relative and at least one child who is under the age of eighteen, or who is under the age of nineteen and a full-time student in a secondary school or its equivalent. A caretaker relative shall be related to the child or children by blood, marriage or adoption or shall be the legal guardian of such a child or pursuing legal proceedings necessary to achieve guardianship. If the commissioner elects to allow state eligibility consistent with any change in federal law, the commissioner may administratively transfer any qualifying family cases under the cash assistance portion of the state-administered general assistance program to the temporary family assistance program without regard to usual eligibility and enrollment procedures. If such families become an ineligible coverage group under the federal law, the commissioner shall administratively transfer such families back to the cash assistance portion of the state-administered general assistance program without regard to usual eligibility and enrollment procedures to the degree that such families are eligible for the state program.\n\n(b) The Commissioner of Social Services shall exempt a family from such time-limited benefits for circumstances including, but not limited to: (1) A family with a needy caretaker relative who is incapacitated or of an advanced age, as defined by the commissioner, if there is no other nonexempt caretaker relative in the household; (2) a family with a needy caretaker relative who is needed in the home because of the incapacity of another member of the household, if there is no other nonexempt caretaker relative in the household; (3) a family with a caretaker relative who is not legally responsible for the dependent children in the household if such relative's needs are not considered in calculating the amount of the benefit and there is no other nonexempt caretaker relative in the household; (4) a family with a caretaker relative caring for a child who is under one year of age if there is no other nonexempt caretaker relative in the household; (5) a family with a pregnant or postpartum caretaker relative if a physician has indicated that such relative is unable to work and there is no other nonexempt caretaker relative in the household; (6) a family with a caretaker relative determined by the commissioner to be unemployable and there is no other nonexempt caretaker relative in the household; and (7) minor parents attending and satisfactorily completing high school or high school equivalency programs.\n\n*(c) A family who is subject to time-limited benefits may petition the Commissioner of Social Services for six-month extensions of such benefits. The commissioner shall grant not more than two extensions to such family who has made a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of the program and despite such effort has a total family income at a level below the payment standard, or has encountered circumstances preventing employment including, but not limited to: (1) Domestic violence or physical harm to such family's children; or (2) other circumstances beyond such family's control. The commissioner shall disregard ninety dollars of earned income in determining applicable family income. The commissioner may grant a subsequent six-month extension if each adult in the family meets one or more of the following criteria: (A) The adult is precluded from engaging in employment activities due to domestic violence or another reason beyond the adult's control; (B) the adult has two or more substantiated barriers to employment including, but not limited to, the lack of available child care, substance abuse or addiction, severe mental or physical health problems, one or more severe learning disabilities, domestic violence or a child who has a serious physical or behavioral health problem; (C) the adult is working thirty-five or more hours per week, is earning at least the minimum wage and continues to earn less than the family's temporary family assistance payment standard; or (D) the adult is employed and works less than thirty-five hours per week due to (i) a documented medical impairment that limits the adult's hours of employment, provided the adult works the maximum number of hours that the medical condition permits, or (ii) the need to care for a disabled member of the adult's household, provided the adult works the maximum number of hours the adult's caregiving responsibilities permit. Families receiving temporary family assistance shall be notified by the department of the right to petition for such extensions. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the commissioner shall not provide benefits under the state's temporary family assistance program to a family that is subject to the twenty-one month benefit limit and has received benefits beginning on or after October 1, 1996, if such benefits result in that family's receiving more than sixty months of time-limited benefits unless that family experiences domestic violence, as defined in Section 402(a)(7)(B), P.L. 104-193. For the purpose of calculating said sixty-month limit: (I) A month shall count toward the limit if the family receives assistance for any day of the month, provided any months of temporary family assistance received during the public health emergency declared by Governor Ned Lamont related to the COVID-19 pandemic shall not be included, and (II) a month in which a family receives temporary assistance for needy families benefits that are issued from a jurisdiction other than Connecticut shall count toward the limit.\n\n(d) (1) Under said program, no family shall be eligible that has total gross earnings exceeding the federal poverty level, however, in the calculation of the benefit amount for eligible families and previously eligible families that become ineligible temporarily because of receipt of workers' compensation benefits by a family member who subsequently returns to work immediately after the period of receipt of such benefits, earned income shall be disregarded up to the federal poverty level. On and after October 1, 2023, the commissioner shall not deny a family assistance under said program on the basis of such family's assets unless such assets exceed six thousand dollars. Except when determining eligibility for a six-month extension of benefits pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the commissioner shall disregard the first fifty dollars per month of income attributable to current child support that a family receives in determining eligibility and benefit levels for temporary family assistance. Any current child support in excess of fifty dollars per month collected by the department on behalf of an eligible child shall be considered in determining eligibility but shall not be considered when calculating benefits and shall be taken as reimbursement for assistance paid under this section, except that when the current child support collected exceeds the family's monthly award of temporary family assistance benefits plus fifty dollars, the current child support shall be paid to the family and shall be considered when calculating benefits.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, on and after January 1, 2024, in the first month in which a family's total gross earnings exceed one hundred per cent of the federal poverty level and for a period not to exceed six consecutive months, the department shall disregard, for purposes of eligibility, a family's total gross earnings in an amount not to exceed two hundred thirty per cent of the federal poverty level. If a family's total gross earnings are an amount between one hundred seventy-one per cent and two hundred thirty per cent of the federal poverty level, the department shall reduce the household's benefit by twenty per cent for the months in which earnings are between one hundred seventy-one per cent and two hundred thirty per cent of the federal poverty level.\n\n(e) A family receiving assistance under said program shall cooperate with child support enforcement, under title IV-D of the Social Security Act. A family shall be ineligible for benefits for failure to cooperate with child support enforcement.\n\n*(f) A family leaving assistance at the end of (1) said twenty-one-month time limit, including a family with income above the payment standard, or (2) the sixty-month limit shall have an interview for the purpose of being informed of services that may continue to be available to such family, including employment services available through the Labor Department. Such interview shall include (A) a determination of benefits available to the family provided by the Department of Social Services; and (B) a determination of whether such family is eligible for supplemental nutrition assistance or Medicaid. Information and referrals shall be made to such a family for services and benefits including, but not limited to, the earned income tax credit, rental subsidies emergency housing, employment services and energy assistance.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding section 17b-104, commencing on July 1, 2023, the Commissioner of Social Services shall provide an annual cost-of-living adjustment in temporary family assistance benefits equal to the most recent percentage increase in the consumer price index for urban consumers whenever funds appropriated for temporary family assistance lapse at the close of any fiscal year and such adjustment has not otherwise been included in the budget for the assistance program, provided the increase would not create a budget deficiency in succeeding years. The commissioner shall provide a prorated benefit increase from such available lapsed funds in any fiscal year when such funds are not sufficient to cover a cost-of-living adjustment in accordance with this subsection.\n\n(h) An applicant or recipient of temporary family assistance who is adversely affected by a decision of the Commissioner of Social Services may request and shall be provided a hearing in accordance with section 17b-60.\n\n(P.A. 93-262, S. 1, 87; 93-418, S. 16, 41; 93-435, S. 59, 95; P.A. 95-194, S. 1, 33; 95-351, S. 1, 30; P.A. 96-262, S. 2, 11; 96-268, S. 1, 34; P.A. 97-295, S. 20, 25; June 18 Sp.

The Commissioner of Social Services may operate portions of the temporary family assistance program as a solely state-funded program, separate from the federal temporary assistance for needy families program, if the commissioner determines that doing so will enable the state to avoid fiscal penalties under the temporary assistance for needy families program. Families receiving assistance under the solely state-funded portion of the temporary family assistance program shall be subject to the same conditions of eligibility as those receiving assistance under the federal temporary assistance for needy families program. Under the temporary family assistance program, benefits shall be provided to a family for not longer than thirty-six months, except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. For the purpose of calculating said thirty-six-month time limit, months of assistance received on and after January 1, 1996, pursuant to time limits under the aid to families with dependent children program, shall be included. For purposes of this section, “family” means one or more individuals who apply for or receive assistance together under the temporary family assistance program. If the commissioner determines that federal law allows individuals not otherwise in an eligible covered group for the temporary family assistance program to become covered, such family may also, at the discretion of the commissioner, be composed of (1) a pregnant woman, or (2) a parent, both parents or other caretaker relative and at least one child who is under the age of eighteen, or who is under the age of nineteen and a full-time student in a secondary school or its equivalent. A caretaker relative shall be related to the child or children by blood, marriage or adoption or shall be the legal guardian of such a child or pursuing legal proceedings necessary to achieve guardianship. If the commissioner elects to allow state eligibility consistent with any change in federal law, the commissioner may administratively transfer any qualifying family cases under the cash assistance portion of the state-administered general assistance program to the temporary family assistance program without regard to usual eligibility and enrollment procedures. If such families become an ineligible coverage group under the federal law, the commissioner shall administratively transfer such families back to the cash assistance portion of the state-administered general assistance program without regard to usual eligibility and enrollment procedures to the degree that such families are eligible for the state program.”\n\n“(c) A family who is subject to time-limited benefits may petition the Commissioner of Social Services for six-month extensions of such benefits. The commissioner shall grant not more than two extensions to such family who has made a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of the program and despite such effort has a total family income below one hundred per cent of the federal poverty level, or has encountered circumstances preventing employment including, but not limited to: (1) Domestic violence or physical harm to such family's children; or (2) other circumstances beyond such family's control. The commissioner shall disregard ninety dollars of earned income in determining applicable family income. The commissioner may grant a subsequent six-month extension if each adult in the family meets one or more of the following criteria: (A) The adult is precluded from engaging in employment activities due to domestic violence or another reason beyond the adult's control; (B) the adult has two or more substantiated barriers to employment including, but not limited to, the lack of available child care, substance abuse or addiction, severe mental or physical health problems, one or more severe learning disabilities, domestic violence or a child who has a serious physical or behavioral health problem; or (C) the adult is employed and works less than thirty-five hours per week due to (i) a documented medical impairment that limits the adult's hours of employment, provided the adult works the maximum number of hours that the medical condition permits, or (ii) the need to care for a disabled member of the adult's household, provided the adult works the maximum number of hours the adult's caregiving responsibilities permit. Families receiving temporary family assistance shall be notified by the department of the right to petition for such extensions. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the commissioner shall not provide benefits under the state's temporary family assistance program to a family that is subject to the thirty-six-month benefit limit and has received benefits beginning on or after October 1, 1996, if such benefits result in that family's receiving more than sixty months of time-limited benefits unless that family experiences domestic violence, as defined in Section 402(a)(7)(B), P.L. 104-193. For the purpose of calculating said sixty-month limit: (I) A month shall count toward the limit if the family receives assistance for any day of the month, provided any months of temporary family assistance received during the public health emergency declared by Governor Ned Lamont related to the COVID-19 pandemic shall not be included, and (II) a month in which a family receives temporary assistance for needy families benefits that are issued from a jurisdiction other than Connecticut shall count toward the limit.”\n\n“(f) A family leaving assistance at the end of (1) said thirty-six-month time limit, or (2) the sixty-month limit shall have an interview for the purpose of being informed of services that may continue to be available to such family, including employment services available through the Labor Department. Such interview shall include (A) a determination of benefits available to the family provided by the Department of Social Services; and (B) a determination of whether such family is eligible for supplemental nutrition assistance or Medicaid.

The office shall be administered by a director and shall act as the single and separate organizational unit to coordinate, plan and publish the state child support enforcement plan for the implementation of Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, as amended, as required by federal law and regulations. The office shall provide for the development and implementation of all child support services, including the administration of withholding of earnings, in accordance with the provisions of Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, as amended.\n\n(b) (1) The Commissioner of Social Services shall investigate the financial condition of the parent or parents of: (A) Any child applying for or receiving assistance under (i) the temporary family assistance program pursuant to section 17b-112, which may be referred to as “TFA” for the purposes of this section, or (ii) the Medicaid program pursuant to section 17b-261, (B) any child seeking IV-D child support enforcement services pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (h) of this section, and (C) any child committed to the care of the Commissioner of Children and Families who is receiving payments in the foster care program and for whom a referral to the Office of Child Support Services is made under section 46b-130, and shall determine the financial liability of such parent or parents for the child.\n\n(2) The Office of Child Support Services may, upon notice to the obligor and obligee, redirect payments for the support of all such children to either the state of Connecticut or the present custodial party, as their interests may appear, provided neither the obligor nor the obligee objects in writing within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice. Any such notice shall be sent by first class mail to the most recent address of such obligor and obligee, as recorded in the state case registry pursuant to section 46b-218, and a copy of such notice shall be filed with the court or family support magistrate if both the obligor and obligee fail to object to the redirected payments within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice. All payments shall be distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding subdivision (2) of this subsection or subparagraph (F) of subdivision (1) of subsection (u) of section 46b-231, the Office of Child Support Services or a support enforcement agency under cooperative agreement with the Office of Child Support Services shall redirect payments for the support of children described in subparagraphs (A)(i) and (C) of subdivision (1) of this subsection to the state of Connecticut effective on the date of the assistance grant. Upon such redirection, the Office of Child Support Services or support enforcement agency shall notify the obligor and obligee as described in subdivision (2) of this subsection if assistance is being received by a new custodial party on behalf of such child and, if an objection to redirection is received in accordance with said subdivision (2), shall refund to the obligee of the support order any money retained by the state during the period of redirection that is due such obligee.\n\n(c) The Office of Child Support Services shall enter into cooperative agreements with appropriate officials of the Judicial Branch and law enforcement officials to assist in administering the child support enforcement plan and with respect to other matters of common concern in the area of child support enforcement. Officers of the Judicial Branch and law enforcement officials authorized and required to enter into cooperative agreements with the Office of Child Support Services include, but are not limited to, officials of the Superior Court and the office of the Attorney General. Such cooperative agreements shall contain performance standards to address the mandatory provisions of both state and federal laws and federal regulations concerning child support.\n\n(d) The Office of Child Support Services shall have authority to determine on a periodic basis whether any individuals who owe child support obligations are receiving unemployment compensation. In IV-D cases, the office may authorize the collection of any such obligations owed by an individual receiving unemployment compensation through an agreement with the individual or a court order pursuant to section 52-362, under which a portion of the individual's unemployment compensation is withheld and forwarded to the state acting by and through the IV-D agency. As used in this section, “unemployment compensation” means any compensation payable under chapter 567, including amounts payable by the administrator of the unemployment compensation law pursuant to an agreement under any federal law providing for compensation, assistance or allowances with respect to unemployment.\n\n(e) The Office of Child Support Services shall enter into purchase of service agreements with other state officials, departments and agencies which do not have judicial or law enforcement authority, including, but not limited to, the Commissioner of Administrative Services, to assist in administering the child support enforcement plan. The Office of Child Support Services shall have authority to enter into such agreements with the Labor Commissioner and to withhold unemployment compensation pursuant to subsection (d) of this section and section 31-227.\n\n(f) The Office of Child Support Services shall have the sole responsibility to make referrals to the federal Parent Locator Service established pursuant to 88 Stat. 2353 (1975), 42 USC 653, as amended, for the purpose of locating deserting parents.\n\n(g) The Office of Child Support Services shall have the sole responsibility to make recommendations to the Governor and the General Assembly for needed program legislation to ensure implementation of Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, as amended.\n\n(h) (1) The Office of Child Support Services shall provide, or arrange to provide through one or more of the state officials, departments and agencies, the same services for obtaining and enforcing child support orders in cases in which children are not beneficiaries of TFA, Medicaid or foster care as in cases where children are the beneficiaries of TFA, Medicaid or foster care. Such services shall also be made available to residents of other states on the same terms as to residents of this state. Support services in cases other than TFA, Medicaid or foster care will be provided upon application to the Office of Child Support Services by the person seeking to enforce a child support obligation and the payment of an application fee, pursuant to the provisions of subsection (i) of this section.\n\n(2) In addition to the application fee, the Office of Child Support Services may assess costs incurred for the establishment, enforcement or modification of a support order in cases other than TFA, Medicaid or foster care. Such assessment shall be based on a fee schedule adopted by the Department of Social Services pursuant to chapter 54. The fee schedule to be charged in such cases shall be made available to any individual upon request. The Office of Child Support Services shall adopt procedures for the notification of Superior Court judges and family support magistrates when a fee has been assessed upon an obligee for support services and a Superior Court judge or a family support magistrate shall order the obligor to pay any such assessment to the Office of Child Support Services. In cases where such order is not entered, the obligee shall pay an amount based on a sliding scale not to exceed the obligee's ability to pay. The Department of Social Services shall adopt such sliding scale pursuant to chapter 54.\n\n(3) The Office of Child Support Services shall also, in the case of an individual who never received temporary assistance for needy families and for whom the state has collected at least five hundred fifty dollars of support in a one-year period, impose an annual fee of thirty-five dollars for each case in which services are furnished. The annual fee shall be (A) retained by the state from the support collected on behalf of the individual, but not from the first five hundred fifty dollars collected, (B) paid by the individual applying for the services, (C) recovered from the noncustodial parent, or (D) paid by the state.\n\n(i) In child support cases other than TFA, Medicaid or foster care, the state shall impose an application fee in an amount necessary to comply with federal law and regulations under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, which fee shall be paid by the state.

The notice shall be in plain language and in an easily readable and understandable format and shall identify (A) all service and penalty fees and their amounts; (B) the procedure for reporting and replacing a lost or stolen debit card and the allocation of liability for its unauthorized use; (C) the procedure for reporting account errors and the allocation of liability for such errors; (D) the procedure for obtaining funds when a debit card is lost or stolen; (E) the possibility, if any, of overdrafts; and (F) other similar consumer information.\n\n(k) Investigators employed by the Department of Social Services shall, pursuant to authority granted to such investigators by the commissioner, make service of any summons, subpoena or citation in IV-D support cases in the Superior Court or in the Family Support Magistrate Division. Investigators at the time of service shall coordinate with the clerk of the Superior Court and the assistant clerk of the Family Support Magistrate Division in setting a date for appearance before the court.

Such automated system shall include a state case registry which complies with federal law and regulations. The state case registry shall contain information on each support order established or modified in this state.\n\n(m) The Commissioner of Social Services shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, which shall establish performance standards to address the mandatory provisions of both state and federal laws and federal regulations concerning child support as well as establish additional standards that may be deemed necessary in order to enhance child support enforcement.\n\n(n) Each year, on or before April first, the IV-D agency, in accordance with section 11-4a, shall submit to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to the judiciary and human services an assessment report on the administration and performance of the child support enforcement program during the preceding federal fiscal year.
