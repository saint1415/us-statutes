Such cost for the care of persons in facilities operated by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services shall be determined by the Comptroller, in consultation with the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, on a facility-wide, ward-wide or unit-wide basis. The provisions of this section shall not apply to cases eligible for medical assistance or public assistance under Title XVIII or Title XIX of the Social Security Act, and such cases shall be administered as medical or public assistance cases and shall be subject to federal and state law, rules and procedures governing the same.\n\n(b) The maximum rate to be charged for the support of each patient for the ensuing year shall be the per capita cost. The commissioner shall, upon the admission of each patient to a humane institution, and may, upon any subsequent readmission of such patient, cause an investigation to be made of the financial circumstances of each liable person and the estate of each patient and, if any such person or estate is found unable to pay the per capita cost, shall bill such liable person or estate from the date of admission at a rate which he finds such person or estate able to pay, provided the total billing to all persons responsible for the support of any patient, including the patient or patient's estate, shall be based on actual days of attendance at the facility involved and shall not exceed the per capita cost. A complete disclosure for the amount and terms of such monthly billing and continuing liability for costs associated with services provided by the state shall be provided to such liable person or patient prior to admission or if the immediate need or admission precludes such notification, at the earliest possibility thereafter.\n\n(c) Each patient, the husband or wife of such patient and the father and mother of a patient under the age of eighteen years each shall be legally liable from the date of admission for the support of such patient in such institution in accordance with his ability to pay; except that the maximum liability of legally liable relatives as such for a patient in a state humane institution shall be determined by the commissioner in accordance with section 4a-12 and subsection (b) of this section. The guardian, conservator and payee of Social Security or other benefits on behalf of any such patient shall be similarly responsible for the support of such patient, but shall be liable in such capacity only in accordance with the amount of the patient's estate or the benefits received, or both, as the case may be. Said commissioner may bill and accept payment from any other person or agency willing to assume any portion of the cost of support of a person in a state humane institution at such rate as such person or agency is willing to pay. The relatives of any such patient who is a veteran shall not be liable as such for any part of the cost of his care in such institution.\n\n(d) Wherever a rate of billing has been established as the result of a fraud of the patient or a liable person, or where assets of the patient or relative have been concealed so as not to be available to civil process, such patient or liable person, as the case may be, shall be liable for the difference between the amounts actually billed and paid and the amount which would have been billed against such patient or liable person except for such fraud or concealment, which difference may be recovered in a civil action in the same manner as is provided in section 17b-228, together with interest at the rate of twelve per cent from the date of such billing, and no statute of limitations shall apply to such right of action.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 2661; 1953, 1955, S. 1489d; November, 1955, S.

All hospitals receiving state aid shall submit their cost data under oath on forms approved by the commissioner. The commissioner may adopt, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, regulations concerning the submission of data by institutions and agencies to which payments are to be made under sections 17b-239, 17b-243, 17b-244, 17b-340, 17b-341 and section 17b-343, and the defining of policies utilized by the commissioner in establishing rates under said sections, which data and policies are necessary for the efficient administration of said sections. The commissioner shall provide, upon request, a statement of interpretation of the Medicaid cost-related reimbursement system regulations for long-term care facilities reimbursed under section 17b-340 concerning allowable and unallowable costs or expenditures. Such statement of interpretation shall not be construed to constitute a regulation violative of chapter 54. Failure of such statement of interpretation to address a specific unallowable cost or expenditure fact pattern shall in no way prevent the commissioner from enforcing all applicable laws and regulations.\n\n(b) Any institution or agency to which payments are to be made under sections 17b-239 to 17b-246, inclusive, and sections 17b-340 and 17b-343 which is aggrieved by any decision of said commissioner may, within ten days after written notice thereof from the commissioner, obtain, by written request to the commissioner, a rehearing on all items of aggrievement. On and after July 1, 1996, a rehearing shall be held by the commissioner or his designee, provided a detailed written description of all such items is filed within ninety days of written notice of the commissioner's decision. The rehearing shall be held within thirty days of the filing of the detailed written description of each specific item of aggrievement. The commissioner shall issue a final decision within sixty days of the close of evidence or the date on which final briefs are filed, whichever occurs later. Any designee of the commissioner who presides over such rehearing shall be impartial and shall not be employed within the Department of Social Services office of certificate of need and rate setting.

      "text": "(a) Medicaid rates paid to acute care hospitals, including children's hospitals, shall be based on diagnosis-related groups established and periodically rebased by the Commissioner of Social Services in accordance with 42 USC 1396a(a)(30)(A), provided the Department of Social Services completes a fiscal analysis of the impact of such rate payment system on each hospital. The commissioner shall, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a, file a report on the results of the fiscal analysis not later than six months after implementing the rate payment system with the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services and appropriations and the budgets of state agencies. Within available appropriations, the commissioner shall annually determine in-patient payments for each hospital by multiplying diagnosis-related group relative weights by a base rate. Over a period of up to four years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, within available appropriations and at the discretion of the commissioner, the Department of Social Services shall transition hospital-specific, diagnosis-related group base rates to state-wide diagnosis-related group base rates by peer groups determined by the commissioner. For the purposes of this subsection and subsection (c) of this section, “peer group” means a group comprised of one of the following categories of acute care hospitals: Privately operated acute care hospitals, publicly operated acute care hospitals, or acute care children's hospitals licensed by the Department of Public Health. At the discretion of the Commissioner of Social Services, the peer group for privately operated acute care hospitals may be further subdivided into peer groups for privately operated acute care hospitals. For inpatient hospital services that the Commissioner of Social Services determines are not appropriate for reimbursement based on diagnosis-related groups, the commissioner shall reimburse for such services using any other methodology that complies with 42 USC 1396a(a)(30)(A). Within available appropriations, the commissioner may, in his or her discretion, make additional payments to hospitals based on criteria to be determined by the commissioner. Upon the conversion to a hospital payment methodology based on diagnosis-related groups, the commissioner shall evaluate payments for all hospital services, including, but not limited to, a review of pediatric psychiatric inpatient units within hospitals. The commissioner may, within available appropriations, implement a pay-for-performance program for pediatric psychiatric inpatient care. Nothing contained in this section shall authorize Medicaid payment by the state to any such hospital in excess of the charges made by such hospital for comparable services to the general public.\n\n(b) Effective October 1, 1991, the rate to be paid by the state for the cost of special services rendered by such hospitals shall be established annually by the commissioner for each such hospital pursuant to 42 USC 1396a(a)(30)(A) and within available appropriations. Nothing contained in this subsection shall authorize a payment by the state for such services to any such hospital in excess of the charges made by such hospital for comparable services to the general public.\n\n(c) (1) Until such time as subdivision (2) of this subsection is effective, the state shall also pay to such hospitals for each outpatient clinic and emergency room visit a rate established by the commissioner for each hospital pursuant to 42 USC 1396a(a)(30)(A) and within available appropriations.\n\n(2) On or after July 1, 2016, with the exception of publicly operated psychiatric hospitals, hospitals shall be paid for outpatient and emergency room services based on prospective rates established by the commissioner within available appropriations and in accordance with an ambulatory payment classification system, provided the Department of Social Services completes a fiscal analysis of the impact of such rate payment system on each hospital. Such ambulatory payment classification system may include one or more peer groups established by the Department of Social Services. The Commissioner of Social Services shall, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a, file a report on the results of the fiscal analysis not later than six months after implementing the rate payment system with the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services and appropriations and the budgets of state agencies. Nothing contained in this subsection shall authorize a payment by the state for such services to any hospital in excess of the charges made by such hospital for comparable services to the general public. Effective upon implementation of the ambulatory payment classification system, a covered outpatient hospital service that is not being reimbursed using such ambulatory payment classification system shall be paid in accordance with a fee schedule or an alternative payment methodology, as determined by the commissioner. The commissioner may, within available funding for implementation of the ambulatory payment classification methodology, establish a supplemental pool to provide payments to offset losses incurred, if any, by publicly operated acute care hospitals and acute care children's hospitals licensed by the Department of Public Health as a result of the implementation of the ambulatory payment classification system. Prior to the implementation of the ambulatory payment classification system, each hospital's charges shall be based on the charge master in effect as of June 1, 2015. After implementation of such system, annual increases in each hospital's charge master shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the annual increase in the Medicare economic index.\n\n(d) Concurrent with the implementation of the ambulatory payment classification methodology of payment to hospitals, an emergency department physician may enroll separately as a Medicaid provider and qualify for direct reimbursement for professional services provided in the emergency department of a hospital to a Medicaid recipient, including services provided on the same day the Medicaid recipient is admitted to the hospital. The commissioner shall pay to any such emergency department physician the Medicaid rate for physicians in accordance with the applicable physician fee schedule in effect at that time. If the commissioner determines that payment to an emergency department physician pursuant to this subsection results in an additional cost to the state, the commissioner shall adjust such rate in consultation with the Connecticut Hospital Association and the Connecticut College of Emergency Physicians to ensure budget neutrality.\n\n(e) The commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, establishing criteria for defining emergency and nonemergency visits to hospital emergency rooms. All nonemergency visits to hospital emergency rooms shall be paid in accordance with subsection (c) of this section. Nothing contained in this subsection or the regulations adopted under this section shall authorize a payment by the state for such services to any hospital in excess of the charges made by such hospital for comparable services to the general public. To the extent permitted by federal law, the Commissioner of Social Services may impose cost-sharing requirements under the medical assistance program for nonemergency use of hospital emergency room services.\n\n(f) The commissioner shall establish rates to be paid to freestanding chronic disease hospitals within available appropriations.\n\n(g) The Commissioner of Social Services may implement policies and procedures as necessary to carry out the provisions of this section while in the process of adopting the policies and procedures as regulations, provided notice of intent to adopt the regulations is published in accordance with the provisions of section 17b-10 not later than twenty days after the date of implementation.\n\n(h) In the event the commissioner is unable to implement the provisions of subsection (d) of this section by January 1, 2015, the commissioner shall submit written notice, not later than thirty-five days prior to January 1, 2015, to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services and appropriations and the budgets of state agencies indicating that the department will not be able to implement such provisions on or before such date. The commissioner shall include in such notice (1) the reasons why the department will not be able to implement such provisions by such date, and (2) the date by which the department will be able to implement such provisions.\n\n(i) (1) Subject to federal approval, the commissioner shall increase rates effective January 1, 2018, for hospitals, implementing those increases on the earliest available date, as follows: (A) The diagnosis-related group base rate for inpatient hospital services provided by nongovernmental licensed short-term general hospitals shall be increased by thirty-one and sixty-five-hundredths per cent from the level in effect on July 1, 2017, and (B) the ambulatory payment classification base conversion factor for outpatient hospital services provided by licensed short-term general hospitals shall be increased by six and one-half per cent from the level in effect on July 1, 2017.\n\n(2) (A) For the purposes of this subsection and subsection (k) of this section, “settlement agreement” has the same meaning as provided in section 12-263z.\n\n(B) To the extent required by the settlement agreement, including any court order issued in accordance with the provisions of section 12-263z, for dates of service from January 1, 2020, through June 30, 2026, applicable payments to nongovernmental licensed short-term general hospitals located in the state shall be made in accordance with the relevant requirements of said agreement regarding wage index values, the inpatient hospital all-patient refined diagnosis-related group base rate and the outpatient hospital ambulatory payment classification conversion factor.\n\n(3) (A) To the extent required by the settlement agreement, including any court order issued in accordance with the provisions of section 12-263z, effective January 1, 2020, and each January first thereafter until and including January 1, 2026, the commissioner shall increase annually the Medicaid rates payable to nongovernmental licensed short-term general hospitals located in the state as follows: (i) The inpatient hospital all-patient refined diagnosis-related group base rate by two per cent; (ii) the inpatient hospital behavioral health per diem rate, the inpatient psychiatric services and rehabilitation per diem rates and the inpatient behavioral health child discharge delay per diem rate, each by two per cent; (iii) the outpatient hospital ambulatory payment classification conversion factor by two and two-tenths per cent; and (iv) the revenue center codes listed on the hospital outpatient flat fee schedule by two and two-tenths per cent. Each such annual increase shall be calculated against the rates in effect for the calendar year immediately preceding such rate increase.\n\n(B) As soon as practicable after December 19, 2019, the commissioner shall publish public notice of the intent to submit the Medicaid state plan amendments necessary to provide for the rate increases set forth in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision. Not later than fifteen days after the expiration of the thirty-day comment period for such state plan amendments, the commissioner shall submit such state plan amendments to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for approval. The commissioner shall diligently pursue the federal approvals required for such rate increases. The commissioner shall implement such rate increases for the dates of service set forth in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision even if federal approvals are received after such dates of service, provided the implementation of such rate increases remains subject to federal approval to the extent required by the terms of the settlement agreement, including any court order issued in accordance with the provisions of section 12-263z. If federal approvals of such rate increases are not obtained, the payment of such rate increases may later be recovered by the commissioner by recoupment against other Medicaid payments due to a hospital or in any manner authorized by law.\n\n(4) To the extent required by the settlement agreement, including any court order issued in accordance with the provisions of section 12-263z, from July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2026, the commissioner shall not remove, repeal or reduce the rate increases set forth in this subsection and appropriations for any payments to nongovernmental licensed short-term general hospitals based on such rates shall not be subject to rescissions or holdbacks.\n\n(5) Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of the state to recover overpayments and collect unpaid liabilities, as authorized by law. No provision of this subsection shall affect implementation of state-wide diagnosis-related group base rates in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(j) Except as otherwise specifically required in subsection (i) of this section, (1) notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter or regulations adopted thereunder, the Department of Social Services is not required to increase rates paid, or to set any rates to be paid to or adjust upward any method of payment to, any hospital based on inflation or based on any inflationary factor, including, but not limited to, any current payments or adjustments that are being made based on dates of service in previous years, and (2) the Department of Social Services shall not increase or adjust upward any rates or method of payment to hospitals based on inflation or based on any inflationary factor unless the approved state budget includes appropriations for such increases or upward adjustments.\n\n(k) (1) Subject to any court order issued in accordance with the provisions of section 12-263z, the Department of Social Services shall make payments to nongovernmental licensed short-term general hospitals to the extent required by the settlement agreement, including, to the extent applicable, portions of payments for which the federal financial participation may not be available, such as one-time payments and payments using state-only funds above the upper payment limit. For the purposes of this subsection, “upper payment limit” means the limit on aggregate Medicaid payments to specified groups of facilities for which Medicaid federal financial participation is available, in accordance with 42 CFR 447.72 and 42 CFR 447.321, as applicable, each as amended from time to time.\n\n(2) To the extent required by the settlement agreement, including any court order issued in accordance with the provisions of section 12-263z, from July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2026, for nongovernmental licensed short-term general hospitals located in the state, the Department of Social Services shall continue to set Medicaid rates for inpatient hospital services and outpatient hospital services in accordance with the rate-setting rules and methodologies established in the Medicaid state plan in effect as of December 19, 2019, and incorporating changes to said plan as required by the settlement agreement.\n\n(1949, 1953, S. 1586d; 1961, P.A. 474, S. 2; 1967, P.A. 726, S. 1; 1969, P.A. 339, S. 1; P.A. 73-117, S. 23, 31; P.A. 77-574, S. 4, 6; P.A. 79-560, S. 26, 39; P.A. 81-472, S. 111, 159; P.A. 84-367, S. 1, 3; P.A. 85-482, S. 1, 2; P.A. 87-27, S. 1; 87-516, S. 1, 5; P.A. 88-156, S. 19; P.A. 89-296, S. 6, 9; June Sp.

The commissioner shall diligently pursue the federal approvals required for the supplemental pools and payments set forth in this section.\n\n(2) To the extent required by the settlement agreement, including any court order issued in accordance with the provisions of section 12-263z, the Department of Social Services shall pay Medicaid supplemental payments to nongovernmental licensed short-term general hospitals located in the state as follows: (A) For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2020, and June 30, 2021, five hundred forty-eight million three hundred thousand dollars in each such fiscal year; and (B) for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2022, through June 30, 2026, five hundred sixty-eight million three hundred thousand dollars in each such fiscal year. For fiscal years commencing on and after July 1, 2026, the total amount of supplemental payments paid to such hospitals shall continue at the level in effect for the prior fiscal year unless modified through any provision of the general statutes or appropriations act.\n\n(3) From July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2026, the Department of Social Services shall make supplemental payments to the applicable hospitals on or before the last day of the first month of each calendar quarter, except that payments scheduled to be made before December 19, 2019, shall be made not later than thirty days after December 19, 2019.\n\n(4) If a nongovernmental licensed short-term general hospital located in the state merges or consolidates with or is acquired by another hospital, such that the hospital does not continue to maintain a separate short-term general hospital license, the supplemental payments that would have been paid to the hospital that no longer maintains such license shall be paid instead to the surviving hospital, beginning with the first calendar quarter that commences on or after the effective date of the merger, consolidation or acquisition. If a nongovernmental licensed short-term general hospital located in the state dissolves, ceases to operate or otherwise terminates licensed short-term general hospital services, the supplemental payments that would have been paid to such hospital shall not be paid to any other hospital for the remainder of the fiscal year in which such hospital dissolves, ceases operations or otherwise terminates such services. Commencing with the fiscal year after the hospital dissolved, ceased to operate or otherwise terminated such services, the supplemental payments that would have been made to such hospital shall be redistributed to all other nongovernmental licensed short-term general hospitals located in the state in accordance with the distribution methodology set forth in the settlement agreement for each supplemental pool.\n\n(5) Both the state and federal share of supplemental payments set forth in this subsection shall be appropriated to the Department of Social Services.

Such reconciliation shall ensure that, after accounting for such payment adjustments, the actual supplemental payments made to each hospital shall be the amounts due to each hospital pursuant to the settlement agreement, even if federal approvals are received after each applicable date that supplemental payments are required to be made, provided the supplemental payments remain subject to federal approval. If federal approval of such payments is not obtained, such payments may later be recovered by the commissioner by recoupment against other Medicaid payments due to a hospital or in any manner authorized by law.\n\n(P.A. 11-44, S. 112; 11-61, S. 121; Dec.

The Commissioner of Social Services shall establish a fee schedule for home health services to be effective on and after July 1, 1994. The commissioner may annually modify such fee schedule if such modification is needed to ensure that the conversion to an administrative services organization is cost neutral to home health care agencies and home health aide agencies in the aggregate and ensures patient access. Utilization may be a factor in determining cost neutrality. The commissioner shall increase the fee schedule for home health services provided under the Connecticut home-care program for the elderly established under section 17b-342, effective July 1, 2000, by two per cent over the fee schedule for home health services for the previous year. On and after January 1, 2024, the commissioner shall increase the fee schedule for complex care nursing services provided to individuals over the age of eighteen such that the rate of reimbursement is equal to the rate for such services provided to individuals age eighteen and under. There shall be no differential in fees paid for such services based on the age of the patient. The commissioner may increase any fee payable to a home health care agency or home health aide agency upon the application of such an agency evidencing extraordinary costs related to (1) serving persons with AIDS; (2) high-risk maternal and child health care; (3) escort services; or (4) extended hour services. In no case shall any rate or fee exceed the charge to the general public for similar services. A home health care agency or home health aide agency which, due to any material change in circumstances, is aggrieved by a rate determined pursuant to this subsection may, within ten days of receipt of written notice of such rate from the Commissioner of Social Services, request in writing a hearing on all items of aggrievement. The commissioner shall, upon the receipt of all documentation necessary to evaluate the request, determine whether there has been such a change in circumstances and shall conduct a hearing if appropriate. The Commissioner of Social Services shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to implement the provisions of this subsection. The commissioner may implement policies and procedures to carry out the provisions of this subsection while in the process of adopting regulations, provided notice of intent to adopt the regulations is posted on the eRegulations System not later than twenty days after the date of implementing the policies and procedures. Such policies and procedures shall be valid for not longer than nine months. For purposes of this subsection, “complex care nursing services” means intensive, specialized nursing services provided to a patient with complex care needs who requires skilled nursing care at home.\n\n(b) The Department of Social Services shall monitor the rates charged by home health care agencies and home health aide agencies. Such agencies shall file annual cost reports and service charge information with the department.\n\n(c) The home health services fee schedule shall include a fee for the administration of medication, which shall apply when the purpose of a nurse's visit is limited to the administration of medication. Administration of medication may include, but is not limited to, blood pressure checks, glucometer readings, pulse rate checks and similar indicators of health status. The fee for medication administration shall include administration of medications while the nurse is present, the pre-pouring of additional doses that the client will self-administer at a later time and the teaching of self-administration. The department shall not pay for medication administration in addition to any other nursing service at the same visit. The department may establish prior authorization requirements for this service. Before implementing such change, the Commissioner of Social Services shall consult with the chairpersons of the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to public health and human services. The commissioner shall monitor Medicaid home health care savings achieved through the implementation of nurse delegation of medication administration pursuant to section 19a-492e. If, by January 1, 2016, the commissioner determines that the rate of savings is not adequate to meet the annualized savings assumed in the budget for the biennium ending June 30, 2017, the department may reduce rates for medication administration as necessary to achieve the savings assumed in the budget. Prior to any rate reduction, the department shall report to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to appropriations and the budgets of state agencies and human services provider specific cost and utilization trend data for those patients receiving medication administration. Should the department determine it necessary to reduce medication administration rates under this section, it shall examine the possibility of establishing a separate Medicaid supplemental rate or a pay-for-performance program for those providers, as determined by the commissioner, who have established successful nurse delegation programs.\n\n(d) The home health services fee schedule established pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall include rates for psychiatric nurse visits.\n\n(e) The Department of Social Services, when processing or auditing claims for reimbursement submitted by home health care agencies and home health aide agencies shall, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 15, accept electronic records and records bearing the electronic signature of a licensed physician or licensed practitioner of a healthcare profession that has been submitted to the home health care agency or home health aide agency.\n\n(f) If the electronic record or signature that has been transmitted to a home health care agency or home health aide agency is illegible or the department is unable to determine the validity of such electronic record or signature, the department shall review additional evidence of the accuracy or validity of the record or signature, including, but not limited to, (1) the original of the record or signature, or (2) a written statement, made under penalty of false statement, from (A) the licensed physician or licensed practitioner of a health care profession who signed such record, or (B) if such licensed physician or licensed practitioner of a health care profession is unavailable, the medical director of the agency verifying the accuracy or validity of such record or signature, and the department shall make a determination whether the electronic record or signature is valid.\n\n(g) The Department of Social Services, when auditing claims submitted by home health care agencies and home health aide agencies, shall consider any signature from a licensed physician or licensed practitioner of a health care profession that may be required on a plan of care for home health services, to have been provided in timely fashion if (1) the document bearing such signature was signed prior to the time when such agency seeks reimbursement from the department for services provided, and (2) verbal or telephone orders from the licensed physician or licensed practitioner of a health care profession were received prior to the commencement of services covered by the plan of care and such orders were subsequently documented. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as limiting the powers of the Commissioner of Public Health to enforce the provisions of sections 19-13-D73 and 19-13-D74 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies and 42 CFR 484.18(c).\n\n(h) Any order for home health care services covered by the Department of Social Services may be issued by any licensed practitioner authorized to issue such an order pursuant to section 19a-496a. Any Department of Social Services regulation, policy or procedure that applies to a physician who orders such home health care services, including related provisions such as review and approval of care plans for home health care services, shall apply to any licensed practitioner authorized to order such home health care services pursuant to section 19a-496a.\n\n(i) For purposes of this section, “licensed practitioner of a healthcare profession” has the same meaning as “licensed practitioner” in section 21a-244a.\n\n(1957, P.A. 539; P.A. 73-117, S. 24, 31; P.A. 78-264, S. 2, 4; P.A. 91-406, S. 5, 29; June Sp.

For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, and any succeeding fiscal year, the rate of return on real property for property items shall be revised every five years. The commissioner shall, upon submission of a request by such facility, allow actual debt service, comprised of principal and interest, on the loan or loans in lieu of property costs allowed pursuant to section 17-313b-5 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, whether actual debt service is higher or lower than such allowed property costs, provided such debt service terms and amounts are reasonable in relation to the useful life and the base value of the property.

Such protection shall be provided, to the extent approved by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, for any purchaser of a precertified long-term care policy and shall last for the life of the purchaser. Such protection shall be provided under the Medicaid program or its successor program. Any purchaser of a precertified long-term care policy shall be guaranteed coverage under the Medicaid program or its successor program, to the extent the individual meets all applicable eligibility requirements for the Medicaid program or its successor program. Until such time as eligibility requirements are prescribed for Medicaid's successor program, for the purposes of this subsection, the applicable eligibility requirements shall be the Medicaid program's requirements as of the date its successor program was enacted. The Department of Social Services shall count insurance benefit payments toward resource exclusion to the extent such payments (1) are for services paid for by a precertified long-term care policy; (2) are for the lower of the actual charge and the amount paid by the insurance company; (3) are for nursing home care, or formal services delivered to insureds in the community as part of a care plan approved by an access agency approved by the Office of Policy and Management and the Department of Social Services as meeting the requirements for such agency as defined in regulations adopted pursuant to subsection (m) of section 17b-342; and (4) are for services provided after the individual meets the coverage requirements for long-term care benefits established by the Department of Social Services for this program. The Commissioner of Social Services shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to implement the provisions of this subsection and sections 17b-252, 17b-254 and 38a-475 relating to determining eligibility of applicants for Medicaid, or its successor program, and the coverage requirements for long-term care benefits.\n\n(b) The Commissioner of Social Services, after consultation with the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, may enter into reciprocal agreements with other states to extend the resource exclusions under section 17b-252 and subsection (a) of this section to purchasers of qualified long-term care insurance policies issued in states entering into such reciprocal agreements if such purchasers apply to the Medicaid program or its successor program. Such reciprocal agreements shall also allow purchasers of precertified policies under section 38a-475 to receive a Medicaid resource exclusion in states entering into such reciprocal agreements. The provisions of such reciprocal agreements shall be effective for the life of a purchaser of a precertified policy. For the purposes of this subsection, “qualified long-term care insurance policy” means a long-term care insurance policy approved through a program in another state that provides a Medicaid resource exclusion or asset disregard substantially similar to the Medicaid resource exclusion included in precertified policies and includes benefits substantially similar to those included in a precertified policy.\n\n(P.A. 89-352, S. 2, 6; P.A. 91-187, S. 2, 4; P.A. 93-262, S. 1, 87; P.A. 94-167, S. 2, 4; P.A. 95-160, S. 6, 69; P.A. 96-131, S. 2, 3; 96-139, S. 12, 13; P.A. 98-239, S. 21, 35; P.A. 03-19, S. 40; P.A. 13-125, S. 25; P.A. 24-39, S. 11.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 91-187 changed deadline for purchasing policy providing protection under the program from December 31, 1994, to December 31, 1996; P.A. 93-262 authorized substitution of commissioner and department of social services for commissioner and department of income maintenance, effective July 1, 1993; P.A. 94-167 removed deadline for purchasing policy, effective June 7, 1994; Sec. 17-12r transferred to Sec. 17b-253 in 1995; P.A. 95-160 replaced a reference to a coordination, assessment and monitoring agency with access agency, effective July 1, 1995; P.A. 96-131 inserted references to Medicaid's “successor program”, required such successor program to provide protection of resources and income provided by Medicaid, guaranteed coverage under the Medicaid program or its successor program for any purchaser of a precertified long-term care policy, with certain eligibility requirements, amended Subdiv.

Such levels shall be based on the regional differences in such benefit amount, if applicable, unless such levels based on regional differences are not in conformance with federal law. Any income in excess of the applicable amounts shall be applied as may be required by said federal law, and assistance shall be granted for the balance of the cost of authorized medical assistance. The Commissioner of Social Services shall provide applicants for assistance under this section, at the time of application, with a written statement advising them of (A) the effect of an assignment or transfer or other disposition of property on eligibility for benefits or assistance, (B) the effect that having income that exceeds the limits prescribed in this subsection will have with respect to program eligibility, and (C) the availability of, and eligibility for, services provided by the Connecticut Home Visiting System, established pursuant to section 17b-751b. For coverage dates on or after January 1, 2014, the department shall use the modified adjusted gross income financial eligibility rules set forth in Section 1902(e)(14) of the Social Security Act and the implementing regulations to determine eligibility for HUSKY A, HUSKY B and HUSKY D applicants, as defined in section 17b-290. Persons who are determined ineligible for assistance pursuant to this section shall be provided a written statement notifying such persons of their ineligibility and advising such persons of their potential eligibility for one of the other insurance affordability programs as defined in 42 CFR 435.4.\n\n(b) For the purposes of the Medicaid program, the Commissioner of Social Services shall consider parental income and resources as available to a child under eighteen years of age who is living with his or her parents and is blind or disabled for purposes of the Medicaid program, or to any other child under twenty-one years of age who is living with his or her parents.\n\n(c) For the purposes of determining eligibility for the Medicaid program, an available asset is one that is actually available to the applicant or one that the applicant has the legal right, authority or power to obtain or to have applied for the applicant's general or medical support. If the terms of a trust provide for the support of an applicant, the refusal of a trustee to make a distribution from the trust does not render the trust an unavailable asset. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the availability of funds in a trust or similar instrument funded in whole or in part by the applicant or the applicant's spouse shall be determined pursuant to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, 42 USC 1396p. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a special needs trust, as defined in 42 USC 1396p(d)(4)(A), as amended from time to time. For purposes of determining whether a beneficiary under a special needs trust, who has not received a disability determination from the Social Security Administration, is disabled, as defined in 42 USC 1382c(a)(3), the Commissioner of Social Services, or the commissioner's designee, shall independently make such determination. The commissioner shall not require such beneficiary to apply for Social Security disability benefits or obtain a disability determination from the Social Security Administration for purposes of determining whether the beneficiary is disabled.\n\n(d) The transfer of an asset in exchange for other valuable consideration shall be allowable to the extent the value of the other valuable consideration is equal to or greater than the value of the asset transferred.\n\n(e) The Commissioner of Social Services shall seek a waiver from federal law to permit federal financial participation for Medicaid expenditures for families with incomes of one hundred forty-three per cent of the temporary family assistance program payment standard.\n\n(f) To the extent permitted by federal law, Medicaid eligibility shall be extended for one year to a family that becomes ineligible for medical assistance under Section 1931 of the Social Security Act due to income from employment by one of its members who is a caretaker relative or due to receipt of child support income. A family receiving extended benefits on July 1, 2005, shall receive the balance of such extended benefits, provided no such family shall receive more than twelve additional months of such benefits.\n\n(g) An institutionalized spouse applying for Medicaid and having a spouse living in the community shall be required, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to divert income to such community spouse in order to raise the community spouse's income to the level of the minimum monthly needs allowance, as described in Section 1924 of the Social Security Act. Such diversion of income shall occur before the community spouse is allowed to retain assets in excess of the community spouse protected amount described in Section 1924 of the Social Security Act. The Commissioner of Social Services, pursuant to section 17b-10, may implement the provisions of this subsection while in the process of adopting regulations, provided the commissioner prints notice of intent to adopt the regulations in the Connecticut Law Journal within twenty days of adopting such policy. Such policy shall be valid until the time final regulations are effective.\n\n(h) To the extent permissible under federal law, an institutionalized individual, as defined in Section 1917 of the Social Security Act, 42 USC 1396p(h)(3), shall not be determined ineligible for Medicaid solely on the basis of the cash value of a life insurance policy worth less than ten thousand dollars provided the individual is pursuing the surrender of the policy.\n\n(i) Medical assistance shall be provided, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (e) of section 17a-6, to any child under the supervision of the Commissioner of Children and Families who is not receiving Medicaid benefits, has not yet qualified for Medicaid benefits or is otherwise ineligible for such benefits. Medical assistance shall also be provided to any child in the behavioral services program operated by the Department of Developmental Services who is not receiving Medicaid benefits, has not yet qualified for Medicaid benefits or is otherwise ineligible for benefits. To the extent practicable, the Commissioner of Children and Families and the Commissioner of Developmental Services shall apply for, or assist such child in qualifying for, the Medicaid program.\n\n(j) The Commissioner of Social Services shall provide Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment program services, as required and defined as of December 31, 2005, by 42 USC 1396a(a)(43), 42 USC 1396d(r) and 42 USC 1396d(a)(4)(B) and applicable federal regulations, to all persons who are under the age of twenty-one and otherwise eligible for medical assistance under this section.\n\n(k) A veteran, as defined in section 27-103, and any member of his or her family, who applies for or receives assistance under the Medicaid program, shall apply for all benefits for which he or she may be eligible through the United States Department of Veterans Affairs or the United States Department of Defense.\n\n(l) On and after January 1, 2023, and until June 30, 2024, the Commissioner of Social Services shall, within available appropriations, provide state-funded medical assistance to any child twelve years of age and younger, regardless of immigration status, (1) whose household income does not exceed two hundred one per cent of the federal poverty level without an asset limit, and (2) who does not otherwise qualify for Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, or an offer of affordable, employer-sponsored insurance, as defined in the Affordable Care Act, as an employee or a dependent of an employee. On and after July 1, 2024, the commissioner shall, within available appropriations, provide state-funded medical assistance to any child fifteen years of age and younger, regardless of immigration status, who qualifies pursuant to subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection. A child eligible for such assistance under this subsection shall continue to receive such assistance until such child is nineteen years of age, provided the child continues to meet the eligibility requirements prescribed in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection. The provisions of section 17b-265 shall apply with respect to any medical assistance provided pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(1967, P.A. 759, S. 1(b); 1969, P.A. 730, S. 8; P.A. 78-192, S. 4, 7; P.A. 80-50; P.A. 81-214, S. 6; P.A. 85-505, S. 14, 21; 85-527; P.A. 86-363, S. 3; P.A. 87-390, S. 1, 4; P.A. 89-317, S. 1, 2; P.A. 92-233, S. 1; P.A. 93-262, S. 1, 87; 93-289, S. 1–3; 93-435, S. 59, 95; May Sp.

Any such disposition shall be treated in accordance with Section 1917(c) of the Social Security Act, 42 USC 1396p(c). Any disposition of property made on behalf of an applicant or recipient or the spouse of an applicant or recipient by a guardian, conservator, person authorized to make such disposition pursuant to a power of attorney or other person so authorized by law shall be attributed to such applicant, recipient or spouse.

The commissioner shall establish the standards for eligibility for medical assistance at one hundred five per cent of the federal poverty level, after any authorized income disregards. In determining eligibility, the commissioner shall not consider as income Aid and Attendance pension benefits granted to a veteran, as defined in section 27-103, or the surviving spouse of such veteran.

      "text": "(a) Any transfer or assignment of assets resulting in the imposition of a penalty period shall be presumed to be made with the intent, on the part of the transferor or the transferee, to enable the transferor to obtain or maintain eligibility for medical assistance. This presumption may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence that the transferor's eligibility or potential eligibility for medical assistance was not a basis for the transfer or assignment.\n\n(b) Any transfer or assignment of assets resulting in the establishment or imposition of a penalty period shall create a debt, as defined in section 36a-645, that shall be due and owing by the transferor or transferee to the Department of Social Services in an amount equal to the amount of the medical assistance provided to or on behalf of the transferor on or after the date of the transfer of assets, but said amount shall not exceed the fair market value of the assets at the time of transfer. The Commissioner of Social Services, the Commissioner of Administrative Services and the Attorney General shall have the power or authority to seek administrative, legal or equitable relief as provided by other statutes or by common law.\n\n(c) The Commissioner of Social Services may waive the imposition of a penalty period when the transferor (1) in accordance with the provisions of section 3025.25 of the department's Uniform Policy Manual, suffers from dementia at the time of application for medical assistance and cannot explain transfers that would otherwise result in the imposition of a penalty period; or (2) suffered from dementia at the time of the transfer; or (3) was exploited into making such a transfer due to dementia. Waiver of the imposition of a penalty period does not prohibit the establishment of a debt in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(d) (1) For purposes of this subsection, an “institutionalized individual” means an individual who has applied for or is receiving (A) services from a long-term care facility, (B) services from a medical institution that are equivalent to those services provided in a long-term care facility, or (C) home and community-based services under a Medicaid waiver.\n\n(2) An institutionalized individual shall not be penalized for the transfer of an asset if the entire amount of the transferred asset is returned to the institutionalized individual. A transferee may return any portion of a transferred asset to the transferor. If any transferred asset is returned to the transferor, the Department of Social Services shall adjust the penalty period to the extent permitted by federal law, provided the ending date of the penalty period as originally determined by the department shall not change. The department shall consider the entire amount of the returned asset to be available to the transferor only from the date of return of the transferred asset, and shall not determine the transferor to be ineligible in the month the transferred asset is returned, provided the transferor reduced the returned asset in accordance with federal law.\n\n(3) If there are multiple transfers of assets to the same or different transferees, a return of anything less than the total amount of the transferred assets from all of the separate transferees shall not constitute a return of the entire amount of the transferred assets and shall represent a partial return.\n\n(4) The conveyance and subsequent return of an asset for the purpose of shifting costs to the Medicaid program shall be regarded as a trust-like device. Such asset shall be considered available for the purpose of determining Medicaid eligibility. The conveyance and subsequent return of an asset made exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for the payment of long-term care services under the Medicaid program shall not be regarded as a trust-like device.\n\n(e) The Commissioner of Social Services, pursuant to section 17b-10, shall implement the policies and procedures necessary to carry out the provisions of this section while in the process of adopting such policies and procedures in regulation form, provided notice of intent to adopt regulations is published in the Connecticut Law Journal not later than twenty days after implementation.

      "text": "(a) In accordance with 42 USC 1396k, the Department of Social Services shall be subrogated to any right of recovery or indemnification that an applicant or recipient of medical assistance or any legally liable relative of such applicant or recipient has against an insurer or other legally liable third party including, but not limited to, a self-insured plan, group health plan, as defined in Section 607(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, service benefit plan, managed care organization, health care center, pharmacy benefit manager, dental benefit manager, third-party administrator or other party that is, by statute, contract or agreement, legally responsible for payment of a claim for a health care item or service, for the cost of all health care items or services furnished to the applicant or recipient, including, but not limited to, hospitalization, pharmaceutical services, physician services, nursing services, behavioral health services, long-term care services and other medical services, not to exceed the amount expended by the department for such care and treatment of the applicant or recipient. In the case of such a recipient who is an enrollee in a care management organization under a Medicaid care management contract with the state or a legally liable relative of such an enrollee, the department shall be subrogated to any right of recovery or indemnification which the enrollee or legally liable relative has against such a private insurer or other third party for the medical costs incurred by the care management organization on behalf of an enrollee. Whenever funds owed to a person are collected pursuant to this section and the person who otherwise would have been entitled to such funds is subject to a court-ordered current or arrearage child support payment obligation in an IV-D support case, such funds shall first be paid to the state for reimbursement of Medicaid funds paid on behalf of such person for medical expenses incurred for injuries related to a legal claim by such person that was the subject of the state's right of subrogation, and remaining funds, if any, shall then be paid to the Office of Child Support Services for distribution pursuant to the federally mandated child support distribution system implemented pursuant to subsection (j) of section 17b-179. Any additional claim of the state to the remainder of such funds, if any, shall be paid in accordance with state law.\n\n(b) An applicant or recipient or legally liable relative, by the act of the applicant's or recipient's receiving medical assistance, shall be deemed to have made a subrogation assignment and an assignment of claim for benefits to the department. The department shall inform an applicant of such assignments at the time of application. Any entitlements from a contractual agreement with an applicant or recipient, legally liable relative or a state or federal program for such medical services, not to exceed the amount expended by the department, shall be so assigned. Such entitlements shall be directly reimbursable to the department by third-party payors. The Department of Social Services may assign its right to subrogation or its entitlement to benefits to a designee or a health care provider participating in the Medicaid program and providing services to an applicant or recipient, in order to assist the provider in obtaining payment for such services. In accordance with subsection (b) of section 38a-472, a provider that has received an assignment from the department shall notify the recipient's health insurer or other legally liable third party including, but not limited to, a self-insured plan, group health plan, as defined in Section 607(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, service benefit plan, managed care organization, health care center, pharmacy benefit manager, dental benefit manager, third-party administrator or other party that is, by statute, contract or agreement, legally responsible for payment of a claim for a health care item or service, of the assignment upon rendition of services to the applicant or recipient. Failure to so notify the health insurer or other legally liable third party shall render the provider ineligible for payment from the department. The provider shall notify the department of any request by the applicant or recipient or legally liable relative or representative of such applicant or recipient for billing information. This subsection shall not be construed to affect the right of an applicant or recipient to maintain an independent cause of action against such third-party tortfeasor.\n\n(c) Claims for recovery or indemnification submitted by the department, or the department's designee, shall not be denied solely on the basis of the date of the submission of the claim, the type or format of the claim, the lack of prior authorization or the failure to present proper documentation at the point-of-service that is the basis of the claim, if (1) the claim is submitted by the state within the three-year period beginning on the date on which the item or service was furnished; and (2) any action by the state to enforce its rights with respect to such claim is commenced within six years of the state's submission of the claim.\n\n(d) (1) A party to whom a claim for recovery or indemnification is submitted for an item or service furnished under the Medicaid state plan, or a waiver of such plan, who requires prior authorization for such item or service shall accept authorization provided by the Department of Social Services that the item or service is covered under such plan or waiver as if such authorization were the prior authorization made by such party for the item or service.\n\n(2) The provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection shall not apply with respect to a claim for recovery or indemnification submitted to Medicare, a Medicare Advantage plan or a Medicare Part D plan.\n\n(e) When a recipient of medical assistance has personal health insurance in force covering care or other benefits provided under such program, payment or part-payment of the premium for such insurance may be made when deemed appropriate by the Commissioner of Social Services. The commissioner shall limit reimbursement to medical assistance providers for coinsurance and deductible payments under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to assure that the combined Medicare and Medicaid payment to the provider shall not exceed the maximum allowable under the Medicaid program fee schedules.\n\n(f) No self-insured plan, group health plan, as defined in Section 607(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, service benefit plan, managed care plan, or any plan offered or administered by a health care center, pharmacy benefit manager, dental benefit manager, third-party administrator or other party that is, by statute, contract or agreement, legally responsible for payment of a claim for a health care item or service, shall contain any provision that has the effect of denying or limiting enrollment benefits or excluding coverage because services are rendered to an insured or beneficiary who is eligible for or who received medical assistance under this chapter. No insurer, as defined in section 38a-497a, shall impose requirements on the state Medicaid agency, which has been assigned the rights of an individual eligible for Medicaid and covered for health benefits from an insurer, that differ from requirements applicable to an agent or assignee of another individual so covered.\n\n(g) The Commissioner of Social Services shall not pay for any services provided under this chapter if the individual eligible for medical assistance has coverage for the services under an accident or health insurance policy.\n\n(h) An insurer or other legally liable third party, upon receipt of a claim submitted by the department or the department's designee, in accordance with the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, for payment of a health care item or service covered under a state medical assistance program administered by the department, shall, not later than sixty days after receipt of the claim or not later than November 30, 2023, whichever is later, (1) make payment on the claim, (2) request information necessary to determine its legal obligation to pay the claim, or (3) issue a written reason for denial of the claim. Failure to pay, request information necessary to determine legal obligation to pay or issue a written reason for denial of a claim not later than one hundred twenty days after receipt of the claim, or not later than January 30, 2024, whichever is later, creates an uncontestable obligation to pay the claim. The provisions of this subsection shall apply to all claims, including claims submitted by the department or the department's designee prior to July 1, 2021.\n\n(i) On and after July 1, 2021, an insurer or other legally liable third party who has reimbursed the department for a health care item or service paid for and covered under a state medical assistance program administered by the department shall, upon determining it is not liable and at risk for cost of the health care item or service, request any refund from the department not later than twelve months from the date of its reimbursement to the department.\n\n(1967, P.A. 759, S. 1(f); P.A. 75-420, S. 4, 6; P.A. 77-614, S. 608, 610; P.A. 83-145; P.A. 84-367, S. 2, 3; P.A. 90-283, S. 1; June Sp.
