The standard of assistance paid for individuals residing in rated boarding facilities shall remain at the level in effect on August 31, 2003. No person shall be eligible for cash assistance under the program if eligible for cash assistance under any other state or federal cash assistance program. The standards of assistance set forth in this subsection shall be subject to annual increases, as described in subsection (b) of section 17b-104.\n\n(c) To be eligible for cash assistance under the program, a person shall (1) be (A) eighteen years of age or older; (B) a minor found by a court to be emancipated pursuant to section 46b-150; or (C) under eighteen years of age and the commissioner determines good cause for such person's eligibility, and (2) not have assets exceeding five hundred dollars or, if such person is married, such person and his or her spouse shall not have assets exceeding one thousand dollars. In determining eligibility, the commissioner shall not consider as income (A) Aid and Attendance pension benefits granted to a veteran, as defined in section 27-103, or the surviving spouse of such veteran; and (B) any tax refund or advance payment with respect to a refundable credit to the same extent such refund or advance payment would be disregarded under 26 USC 6409 in any federal program or state or local program financed in whole or in part with federal funds.
