      "text": "(a) There shall be established a Long-Term Care Planning Committee for the purpose of exchanging information on long-term care issues, coordinating policy development and establishing a long-term care plan for all persons in need of long-term care. Such policy and plan shall provide that individuals with long-term care needs have the option to choose and receive long-term care and support in the least restrictive, appropriate setting. Such plan shall integrate the three components of a long-term care system including home and community-based services, supportive housing arrangements and nursing facilities. Such plan shall include: (1) A vision and mission statement for a long-term care system; (2) the current number of persons receiving services; (3) the current number of persons receiving long-term care supports and services in the community and the number receiving such supports and services in institutions; (4) demographic data concerning such persons by service type; (5) the current aggregate cost of such system of services; (6) forecasts of future demand for services; (7) the type of services available and the amount of funds necessary to meet the demand; (8) projected costs for programs associated with such system; (9) strategies to promote the partnership for long-term care program; (10) resources necessary to accomplish goals for the future; (11) funding sources available; and (12) the number and types of providers needed to deliver services. The plan shall address how changes in one component of such long-term care system impact other components of such system.\n\n(b) The Long-Term Care Planning Committee shall, within available appropriations, study issues relative to long-term care including, but not limited to, the case-mix system of Medicaid reimbursement, community-based service options, access to long-term care and geriatric psychiatric services. The committee shall evaluate issues relative to long-term care in light of the United States Supreme Court decision, Olmstead v. L.C., 119 S. Ct. 2176 (1999), requiring states to place persons with disabilities in community settings rather than in institutions when such placement is appropriate, the transfer to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by such persons and such placement can be reasonably accommodated. The committee, within available appropriations, shall evaluate available data on the average net actual Medicaid expenditures for nursing homes, in comparison to average net actual Medicaid expenditures for home and community-based services waiver participants who require a nursing home level of care, including the number of individuals served, to assist in short-term and long-term Medicaid expenditure forecasting.\n\n(c) The Long-Term Care Planning Committee shall consist of: (1) The chairpersons and ranking members of the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services, public health, elderly services and long-term care; (2) the Commissioner of Social Services, or the commissioner's designee; (3) one member of the Office of Policy and Management appointed by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management; (4) one member from the Department of Public Health appointed by the Commissioner of Public Health; (5) one member from the Department of Housing appointed by the Commissioner of Housing; (6) one member from the Department of Developmental Services appointed by the Commissioner of Developmental Services; (7) one member from the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services appointed by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services; (8) one member from the Department of Transportation appointed by the Commissioner of Transportation; (9) one member from the Department of Children and Families appointed by the Commissioner of Children and Families; (10) one member from the Health Systems Planning Unit of the Office of Health Strategy appointed by the Commissioner of Health Strategy; and (11) one member from the Department of Aging and Disability Services appointed by the Commissioner of Aging and Disability Services.

The chairperson shall be elected from among the members of the committee. The committee shall seek the advice and participation of any person, organization or state or federal agency it deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.\n\n(d) Not later than January 1, 2018, and annually thereafter, the Long-Term Care Planning Committee shall submit a report to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to aging and human services on the number of persons receiving (1) long-term care supports and services in the community; and (2) long-term care supports and services in institutions.\n\n(e) Not later than January 1, 1999, and every three years thereafter, the Long-Term Care Planning Committee shall submit a long-term care plan pursuant to subsection (a) of this section to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services, public health, elderly services and long-term care, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a, and such plan shall serve as a guide for the actions of state agencies in developing and modifying programs that serve persons in need of long-term care.\n\n(f) Any state agency, when developing or modifying any program that, in whole or in part, provides assistance or support to persons with long-term care needs, shall, to the maximum extent feasible, include provisions that support care-giving provided by family members and other informal caregivers and promote consumer-directed care.\n\n(P.A. 98-175, S. 1, 2; 98-239, S. 27, 35; P.A. 99-28, S. 1, 2; P.A. 01-119, S. 1, 2; P.A. 03-19, S. 44; P.A. 05-14, S. 1; P.A. 07-73, S. 2(a), (b); Sept.

      "text": "(a) For purposes of this subsection, (1) a “related party” includes, but is not limited to, any company related to a chronic and convalescent nursing home through family association, common ownership, control or business association with any of the owners, operators or officials of such nursing home; (2) “company” means any person, partnership, association, holding company, limited liability company or corporation; (3) “family association” means a relationship by birth, marriage or domestic partnership; and (4) “profit and loss statement” means the most recent annual statement on profits and losses finalized by a related party before the annual report mandated under this subsection. The rates to be paid by or for persons aided or cared for by the state or any town in this state to licensed chronic and convalescent nursing homes, to chronic disease hospitals associated with chronic and convalescent nursing homes, to rest homes with nursing supervision, to licensed residential care homes, as defined by section 19a-490, and to residential facilities for persons with intellectual disability that are licensed pursuant to section 17a-227 and certified to participate in the Title XIX Medicaid program as intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities, for room, board and services specified in licensing regulations issued by the licensing agency shall be determined annually, except as otherwise provided in this subsection by the Commissioner of Social Services, to be effective July first of each year except as otherwise provided in this subsection. Such rates shall be determined on a basis of a reasonable payment for such necessary services, which basis shall take into account as a factor the costs of such services. Cost of such services shall include reasonable costs mandated by collective bargaining agreements with certified collective bargaining agents or other agreements between the employer and employees, provided “employees” shall not include persons employed as managers or chief administrators or required to be licensed as nursing home administrators, and compensation for services rendered by proprietors at prevailing wage rates, as determined by application of principles of accounting as prescribed by said commissioner. Cost of such services shall not include amounts paid by the facilities to employees as salary, or to attorneys or consultants as fees, where the responsibility of the employees, attorneys, or consultants is to persuade or seek to persuade the other employees of the facility to support or oppose unionization. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit inclusion of amounts paid for legal counsel related to the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements, the settlement of grievances or normal administration of labor relations. The commissioner may, in the commissioner's discretion, allow the inclusion of extraordinary and unanticipated costs of providing services that were incurred to avoid an immediate negative impact on the health and safety of patients. The commissioner may, in the commissioner's discretion, based upon review of a facility's costs, direct care staff to patient ratio and any other related information, revise a facility's rate for any increases or decreases to total licensed capacity of more than ten beds or changes to its number of licensed rest home with nursing supervision beds and chronic and convalescent nursing home beds. The commissioner may, in the commissioner's discretion, revise the rate of a facility that is closing. An interim rate issued for the period during which a facility is closing shall be based on a review of facility costs, the expected duration of the close-down period, the anticipated impact on Medicaid costs, available appropriations and the relationship of the rate requested by the facility to the average Medicaid rate for a close-down period. The commissioner may so revise a facility's rate established for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, and thereafter for any bed increases, decreases or changes in licensure effective after October 1, 1989. Effective July 1, 1991, in facilities that have both a chronic and convalescent nursing home and a rest home with nursing supervision, the rate for the rest home with nursing supervision shall not exceed such facility's rate for its chronic and convalescent nursing home. All such facilities for which rates are determined under this subsection shall report on a fiscal year basis ending on September thirtieth. Such report shall be submitted to the commissioner by February fifteenth. Each chronic and convalescent nursing home that receives state funding pursuant to this section shall include in such annual report a profit and loss statement from each related party that receives from such chronic and convalescent nursing home thirty thousand dollars or more per year for goods, fees and services. No cause of action or liability shall arise against the state, the Department of Social Services, any state official or agent for failure to take action based on the information required to be reported under this subsection. The commissioner may reduce the rate in effect for a facility that fails to submit a complete and accurate report on or before February fifteenth by an amount not to exceed ten per cent of such rate. If a licensed residential care home fails to submit a complete and accurate report, the department shall notify such home of the failure and the home shall have thirty days from the date the notice was issued to submit a complete and accurate report. If a licensed residential care home fails to submit a complete and accurate report not later than thirty days after the date of notice, such home may not receive a retroactive rate increase, in the commissioner's discretion. The commissioner shall, annually, on or before April first, report the data contained in the reports of such facilities on the department's Internet web site. For the cost reporting year commencing October 1, 1985, and for subsequent cost reporting years, facilities shall report the cost of using the services of any nursing personnel supplied by a temporary nursing services agency by separating said cost into two categories, the portion of the cost equal to the salary of the employee for whom the nursing personnel supplied by a temporary nursing services agency is substituting shall be considered a nursing cost and any cost in excess of such salary shall be further divided so that seventy-five per cent of the excess cost shall be considered an administrative or general cost and twenty-five per cent of the excess cost shall be considered a nursing cost, provided if the total costs of a facility for nursing personnel supplied by a temporary nursing services agency in any cost year are equal to or exceed fifteen per cent of the total nursing expenditures of the facility for such cost year, no portion of such costs in excess of fifteen per cent shall be classified as administrative or general costs. The commissioner, in determining such rates, shall also take into account the classification of patients or boarders according to special care requirements or classification of the facility according to such factors as facilities and services and such other factors as the commissioner deems reasonable, including anticipated fluctuations in the cost of providing such services. The commissioner may establish a separate rate for a facility or a portion of a facility for traumatic brain injury patients who require extensive care but not acute general hospital care. Such separate rate shall reflect the special care requirements of such patients. If changes in federal or state laws, regulations or standards adopted subsequent to June 30, 1985, result in increased costs or expenditures in an amount exceeding one-half of one per cent of allowable costs for the most recent cost reporting year, the commissioner shall adjust rates and provide payment for any such increased reasonable costs or expenditures within a reasonable period of time retroactive to the date of enforcement. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the Department of Social Services to adjust rates and provide payment for any increases in costs resulting from an inspection of a facility by the Department of Public Health. Such assistance as the commissioner requires from other state agencies or departments in determining rates shall be made available to the commissioner at the commissioner's request. Payment of the rates established pursuant to this section shall be conditioned on the establishment by such facilities of admissions procedures that conform with this section, section 19a-533 and all other applicable provisions of the law and the provision of equality of treatment to all persons in such facilities. The established rates shall be the maximum amount chargeable by such facilities for care of such beneficiaries, and the acceptance by or on behalf of any such facility of any additional compensation for care of any such beneficiary from any other person or source shall constitute the offense of aiding a beneficiary to obtain aid to which the beneficiary is not entitled and shall be punishable in the same manner as is provided in subsection (b) of section 17b-97. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the Commissioner of Social Services may, within available appropriations, provide an interim rate increase for a licensed chronic and convalescent nursing home or a rest home with nursing supervision for rate periods no earlier than April 1, 2004, only if the commissioner determines that the increase is necessary to avoid the filing of a petition for relief under Title 11 of the United States Code; imposition of receivership pursuant to sections 19a-542 and 19a-543; or substantial deterioration of the facility's financial condition that may be expected to adversely affect resident care and the continued operation of the facility, and the commissioner determines that the continued operation of the facility is in the best interest of the state. The commissioner shall consider any requests for interim rate increases on file with the department from March 30, 2004, and those submitted subsequently for rate periods no earlier than April 1, 2004. When reviewing an interim rate increase request the commissioner shall, at a minimum, consider: (A) Existing chronic and convalescent nursing home or rest home with nursing supervision utilization in the area and projected bed need; (B) physical plant long-term viability and the ability of the owner or purchaser to implement any necessary property improvements; (C) licensure and certification compliance history; (D) reasonableness of actual and projected expenses; and (E) the ability of the facility to meet wage and benefit costs. No interim rate shall be increased pursuant to this subsection in excess of one hundred fifteen per cent of the median rate for the facility's peer grouping, established pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of section 17b-340d, unless recommended by the commissioner and approved by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management after consultation with the commissioner. Such median rates shall be published by the Department of Social Services not later than April first of each year. In the event that a facility granted an interim rate increase pursuant to this section is sold or otherwise conveyed for value to an unrelated entity less than five years after the effective date of such rate increase, the rate increase shall be deemed rescinded and the department shall recover an amount equal to the difference between payments made for all affected rate periods and payments that would have been made if the interim rate increase was not granted. The commissioner may seek recovery of such payments from any facility with common ownership. With the approval of the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, the commissioner may waive recovery and rescission of the interim rate for good cause shown that is not inconsistent with this section, including, but not limited to, transfers to family members that were made for no value. The commissioner shall provide written quarterly reports to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to aging, human services and appropriations and the budgets of state agencies, that identify each facility requesting an interim rate increase, the amount of the requested rate increase for each facility, the action taken by the commissioner and the secretary pursuant to this subsection, and estimates of the additional cost to the state for each approved interim rate increase. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the commissioner from increasing the rate of a licensed chronic and convalescent nursing home or a rest home with nursing supervision for allowable costs associated with facility capital improvements or increasing the rate in case of a sale of a licensed chronic and convalescent nursing home or a rest home with nursing supervision if receivership has been imposed on such home. For purposes of this section, “temporary nursing services agency” and “nursing personnel” have the same meaning as provided in section 19a-118.\n\n(b) The Commissioner of Social Services may implement policies and procedures as necessary to carry out the provisions of this section while in the process of adopting the policies and procedures as regulations, provided notice of intent to adopt the regulations is published in accordance with the provisions of section 17b-10 not later than twenty days after the date of implementation.\n\n(c) No facility subject to the requirements of this section shall accept payment in excess of the rate set by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for any medical assistance patient from this or any other state. No facility shall accept payment in excess of the reasonable and necessary costs of other allowable services as specified by the commissioner pursuant to the regulations adopted under subsection (b) of this section for any public assistance patient from this or any other state. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the commissioner may authorize a facility to accept payment in excess of the rate paid for a medical assistance patient in this state for a patient who receives medical assistance from another state.\n\n(d) In any instance where the Commissioner of Social Services finds that a facility subject to the requirements of this section is accepting payment for a medical assistance beneficiary in violation of subsection (c) of this section, the commissioner shall proceed to recover through the rate set for the facility any sum in excess of the stipulated per diem and other allowable costs, as provided for in regulations adopted pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section. The commissioner shall make the recovery prospectively at the time of the next annual rate redetermination.\n\n(e) Except as provided in this subsection, the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section shall not apply to any facility subject to the requirements of this section, which on October 1, 1981, (1) was accepting payments from the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, (2) was accepting medical assistance payments from another state for at least twenty per cent of its patients, and (3) had not notified the commissioner of any intent to terminate its provider agreement, in accordance with section 17b-271, provided no patient residing in any such facility on May 22, 1984, shall be removed from such facility for purposes of meeting the requirements of this subsection. If the commissioner finds that the number of beds available to medical assistance patients from this state in any such facility is less than fifteen per cent the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section shall apply to that number of beds which is less than said percentage.\n\n(f) For the fiscal years ending on or before June 30, 2022, rates for nursing home facilities shall be set in accordance with this subsection. On and after July 1, 2022, such rates shall be set in accordance with section 17b-340d. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992, the rates paid by or for persons aided or cared for by the state or any town in this state to facilities for room, board and services specified in licensing regulations issued by the licensing agency, except intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities and residential care homes, shall be based on the cost year ending September 30, 1989. For the fiscal years ending June 30, 1993, and June 30, 1994, such rates shall be based on the cost year ending September 30, 1990. Such rates shall be determined by the Commissioner of Social Services in accordance with this section and the regulations of Connecticut state agencies promulgated by the commissioner and in effect on April 1, 1991, except that:\n\n(1) Allowable costs shall be divided into the following five cost components: (A) Direct costs, which shall include salaries for nursing personnel, related fringe benefits and costs for nursing personnel supplied by a temporary nursing services agency; (B) indirect costs, which shall include professional fees, dietary expenses, housekeeping expenses, laundry expenses, supplies related to patient care, salaries for indirect care personnel and related fringe benefits; (C) fair rent, which shall be defined in accordance with subsection (f) of section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies; (D) capital-related costs, which shall include property taxes, insurance expenses, equipment leases and equipment depreciation; and (E) administrative and general costs, which shall include (i) maintenance and operation of plant expenses, (ii) salaries for administrative and maintenance personnel, and (iii) related fringe benefits. The commissioner may provide a rate adjustment for nonemergency transportation services required by nursing facility residents. Such adjustment shall be a fixed amount determined annually by the commissioner based upon a review of costs and other associated information. Allowable costs shall not include costs for ancillary services payable under Part B of the Medicare program.\n\n(2) Two geographic peer groupings of facilities shall be established for each level of care, as defined by the Department of Social Services for the determination of rates, for the purpose of determining allowable direct costs. One peer grouping shall be comprised of those facilities located in Fairfield County. The other peer grouping shall be comprised of facilities located in all other counties.\n\n(3) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992, per diem maximum allowable costs for each cost component shall be as follows: For direct costs, the maximum shall be equal to one hundred forty per cent of the median allowable cost of that peer grouping; for indirect costs, the maximum shall be equal to one hundred thirty per cent of the state-wide median allowable cost; for fair rent, the amount shall be calculated utilizing the amount approved by the Office of Health Care Access pursuant to section 19a-638; for capital-related costs, there shall be no maximum; and for administrative and general costs, the maximum shall be equal to one hundred twenty-five per cent of the state-wide median allowable cost.

For each facility not having an interim rate for the period ending June 30, 2005, the rate for the period ending June 30, 2006, shall be determined beginning with the higher of the computed rate based upon its 2003 cost report filing or the rate in effect for the period ending June 30, 2005.

Such adjustment shall provide a pro-rata increase based on direct and indirect care employee salaries reported in the 2014 annual cost report, and adjusted to reflect subsequent salary increases, to reflect reasonable costs mandated by collective bargaining agreements with certified collective bargaining agents, or otherwise provided by a facility to its employees. For purposes of this subsection, “employee” shall not include a person employed as a facility's manager, chief administrator, a person required to be licensed as a nursing home administrator or any individual who receives compensation for services pursuant to a contractual arrangement and who is not directly employed by the facility. The commissioner may establish an upper limit for reasonable costs associated with salary adjustments beyond which the adjustment shall not apply. Nothing in this section shall require the commissioner to distribute such adjustments in a way that jeopardizes anticipated federal reimbursement. Facilities that receive such adjustment but do not provide increases in employee salaries as described in this subsection on or before July 31, 2015, may be subject to a rate decrease in the same amount as the adjustment by the commissioner. Of the amount appropriated for this purpose, no more than nine million dollars shall go to increases based on reasonable costs mandated by collective bargaining agreements. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, and section 17b-340d, effective July 1, 2019, October 1, 2020, January 1, 2021, July 1, 2021, and July 1, 2022, the commissioner shall, within available appropriations, increase rates for the purpose of wage and benefit enhancements for facility employees. The commissioner shall adjust the rate paid to the facility in the form of a rate adjustment to reflect any rate increases paid after the cost report year ending September 30, 2018. Facilities that receive a rate adjustment for the purpose of wage and benefit enhancements but do not provide increases in employee salaries as described in this subsection on or before September 30, 2019, October 31, 2020, January 31, 2021, July 31, 2021, and July 31, 2022, respectively, may be subject to a rate decrease in the same amount as the adjustment by the commissioner.\n\n(5) For the purpose of determining allowable fair rent, a facility with allowable fair rent less than the twenty-fifth percentile of the state-wide allowable fair rent shall be reimbursed as having allowable fair rent equal to the twenty-fifth percentile of the state-wide allowable fair rent, provided for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1996, and June 30, 1997, the reimbursement may not exceed the twenty-fifth percentile of the state-wide allowable fair rent for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1995. On and after July 1, 1998, the Commissioner of Social Services may allow minimum fair rent as the basis upon which reimbursement associated with improvements to real property is added. Beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, any facility with a rate of return on real property other than land in excess of eleven per cent shall have such allowance revised to eleven per cent. Any facility or its related realty affiliate which finances or refinances debt through bonds issued by the State of Connecticut Health and Education Facilities Authority shall report the terms and conditions of such financing or refinancing to the Commissioner of Social Services within thirty days of completing such financing or refinancing. The Commissioner of Social Services may revise the facility's fair rent component of its rate to reflect any financial benefit the facility or its related realty affiliate received as a result of such financing or refinancing, including but not limited to, reductions in the amount of debt service payments or period of debt repayment. The commissioner shall allow actual debt service costs for bonds issued by the State of Connecticut Health and Educational Facilities Authority if such costs do not exceed property costs allowed pursuant to subsection (f) of section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, provided the commissioner may allow higher debt service costs for such bonds for good cause. For facilities which first open on or after October 1, 1992, the commissioner shall determine allowable fair rent for real property other than land based on the rate of return for the cost year in which such bonds were issued. The financial benefit resulting from a facility financing or refinancing debt through such bonds shall be shared between the state and the facility to an extent determined by the commissioner on a case-by-case basis and shall be reflected in an adjustment to the facility's allowable fair rent.\n\n(6) A facility shall receive cost efficiency adjustments for indirect costs and for administrative and general costs if such costs are below the state-wide median costs. The cost efficiency adjustments shall equal twenty-five per cent of the difference between allowable reported costs and the applicable median allowable cost established pursuant to this subdivision.\n\n(7) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992, allowable operating costs, excluding fair rent, shall be inflated using the Regional Data Resources Incorporated McGraw-Hill Health Care Costs: Consumer Price Index (all urban)-All Items minus one and one-half per cent. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, allowable operating costs, excluding fair rent, shall be inflated using the Regional Data Resources Incorporated McGraw-Hill Health Care Costs: Consumer Price Index (all urban)-All Items minus one and three-quarters per cent. For the fiscal years ending June 30, 1994, and June 30, 1995, allowable operating costs, excluding fair rent, shall be inflated using the Regional Data Resources Incorporated McGraw-Hill Health Care Costs: Consumer Price Index (all urban)-All Items minus two per cent. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, allowable operating costs, excluding fair rent, shall be inflated using the Regional Data Resources Incorporated McGraw-Hill Health Care Costs: Consumer Price Index (all urban)-All Items minus two and one-half per cent. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1997, allowable operating costs, excluding fair rent, shall be inflated using the Regional Data Resources Incorporated McGraw-Hill Health Care Costs: Consumer Price Index (all urban)-All Items minus three and one-half per cent. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992, and any succeeding fiscal year, allowable fair rent shall be those reported in the annual report of long-term care facilities for the cost year ending the immediately preceding September thirtieth. The inflation index to be used pursuant to this subsection shall be computed to reflect inflation between the midpoint of the cost year through the midpoint of the rate year. The Department of Social Services shall study methods of reimbursement for fair rent and shall report its findings and recommendations to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services on or before January 15, 1993.\n\n(8) On and after July 1, 1994, costs shall be rebased no more frequently than every two years and no less frequently than every four years, as determined by the commissioner. The commissioner shall determine whether and to what extent a change in ownership of a facility shall occasion the rebasing of the facility's costs.\n\n(9) The method of establishing rates for new facilities shall be determined by the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of this subsection until June 30, 2022.\n\n(10) Rates determined under this section shall comply with federal laws and regulations.\n\n(11) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, interim rates issued for facilities on and after July 1, 1991, shall be subject to applicable fiscal year cost component limitations established pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection.\n\n(12) A chronic and convalescent nursing home having an ownership affiliation with and operated at the same location as a chronic disease hospital may request that the commissioner approve an exception to applicable rate-setting provisions for chronic and convalescent nursing homes and establish a rate for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1992, and June 30, 1993, in accordance with regulations in effect June 30, 1991. Any such rate shall not exceed one hundred sixty-five per cent of the median rate established for chronic and convalescent nursing homes established under this section for the applicable fiscal year.\n\n(13) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, and any succeeding fiscal year, for purposes of computing minimum allowable patient days, utilization of a facility's certified beds shall be determined at a minimum of ninety per cent of capacity, except for new facilities and facilities which are certified for additional beds which may be permitted a lower occupancy rate for the first three months of operation after the effective date of licensure.\n\n(14) The Commissioner of Social Services shall adjust facility rates from April 1, 1999, to June 30, 1999, inclusive, by a per diem amount representing each facility's allocation of funds appropriated for the purpose of wage, benefit and staffing enhancement. A facility's per diem allocation of such funding shall be computed as follows: (A) The facility's direct and indirect component salary, wage, nursing pool and allocated fringe benefit costs as filed for the 1998 cost report period deemed allowable in accordance with this section and applicable regulations without application of cost component maximums specified in subdivision (3) of this subsection shall be totalled; (B) such total shall be multiplied by the facility's Medicaid utilization based on the 1998 cost report; (C) the resulting amount for the facility shall be divided by the sum of the calculations specified in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this subdivision for all facilities to determine the facility's percentage share of appropriated wage, benefit and staffing enhancement funding; (D) the facility's percentage share shall be multiplied by the amount of appropriated wage, benefit and staffing enhancement funding to determine the facility's allocated amount; and (E) such allocated amount shall be divided by the number of days of care paid for by Medicaid on an annual basis including days for reserved beds specified in the 1998 cost report to determine the per diem wage and benefit rate adjustment amount. The commissioner may adjust a facility's reported 1998 cost and utilization data for the purposes of determining a facility's share of wage, benefit and staffing enhancement funding when reported 1998 information is not substantially representative of estimated cost and utilization data for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, due to special circumstances during the 1998 cost report period including change of ownership with a part year cost filing or reductions in facility capacity due to facility renovation projects. Upon completion of the calculation of the allocation of wage, benefit and staffing enhancement funding, the commissioner shall not adjust the allocations due to revisions submitted to previously filed 1998 annual cost reports. In the event that a facility's rate for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1999, is an interim rate or the rate includes an increase adjustment due to a rate request to the commissioner or other reasons, the commissioner may reduce or withhold the per diem wage, benefit and staffing enhancement allocation computed for the facility. Any enhancement allocations not applied to facility rates shall not be reallocated to other facilities and such unallocated amounts shall be available for the costs associated with interim rates and other Medicaid expenditures. The wage, benefit and staffing enhancement per diem adjustment for the period from April 1, 1999, to June 30, 1999, inclusive, shall also be applied to rates for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2000, and June 30, 2001, except that the commissioner may increase or decrease the adjustment to account for changes in facility capacity or operations. Any facility accepting a rate adjustment for wage, benefit and staffing enhancements shall apply payments made as a result of such rate adjustment for increased allowable employee wage rates and benefits and additional direct and indirect component staffing. Adjustment funding shall not be applied to wage and salary increases provided to the administrator, assistant administrator, owners or related party employees. Enhancement payments may be applied to increases in costs associated with staffing purchased from staffing agencies provided such costs are deemed necessary and reasonable by the commissioner. The commissioner shall compare expenditures for wages, benefits and staffing for the 1998 cost report period to such expenditures in the 1999, 2000 and 2001 cost report periods to verify whether a facility has applied additional payments to specified enhancements. In the event that the commissioner determines that a facility did not apply additional payments to specified enhancements, the commissioner shall recover such amounts from the facility through rate adjustments or other means. The commissioner may require facilities to file cost reporting forms, in addition to the annual cost report, as may be necessary, to verify the appropriate application of wage, benefit and staffing enhancement rate adjustment payments. For the purposes of this subdivision, “Medicaid utilization” means the number of days of care paid for by Medicaid on an annual basis including days for reserved beds as a percentage of total resident days.\n\n(g) The established interim rate to become effective upon sale of any licensed chronic and convalescent home or rest home with nursing supervision for which a receivership has been imposed pursuant to sections 19a-541 to 19a-549, inclusive, shall not exceed the rate in effect for the facility at the time of the imposition of the receivership, subject to any annual increases permitted by this section, provided the Commissioner of Social Services may, in the commissioner's discretion and after consultation with the receiver, establish an increased rate for the facility if the commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, determines that such higher rate is needed to keep the facility open and to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the residents at such facility.\n\n(h) (1) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, any intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities with an operating cost component of its rate in excess of one hundred forty per cent of the median of operating cost components of rates in effect January 1, 1992, shall not receive an operating cost component increase. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, any intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities with an operating cost component of its rate that is less than one hundred forty per cent of the median of operating cost components of rates in effect January 1, 1992, shall have an allowance for real wage growth equal to thirty per cent of the increase determined in accordance with subsection (q) of section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, provided such operating cost component shall not exceed one hundred forty per cent of the median of operating cost components in effect January 1, 1992. Any facility with real property other than land placed in service prior to October 1, 1991, shall, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1995, receive a rate of return on real property equal to the average of the rates of return applied to real property other than land placed in service for the five years preceding October 1, 1993. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, and any succeeding fiscal year, the rate of return on real property for property items shall be revised every five years. The commissioner shall, upon submission of a request, allow actual debt service, comprised of principal and interest, in excess of property costs allowed pursuant to section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, provided such debt service terms and amounts are reasonable in relation to the useful life and the base value of the property. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1995, and any succeeding fiscal year, the inflation adjustment made in accordance with subsection (p) of section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies shall not be applied to real property costs. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, and any succeeding fiscal year, the allowance for real wage growth, as determined in accordance with subsection (q) of section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, shall not be applied. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, and any succeeding fiscal year, no rate shall exceed three hundred seventy-five dollars per day unless the commissioner, in consultation with the Commissioner of Developmental Services, determines after a review of program and management costs, that a rate in excess of this amount is necessary for care and treatment of facility residents. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002, rate period, the Commissioner of Social Services shall increase the inflation adjustment for rates made in accordance with subsection (p) of section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies to update allowable fiscal year 2000 costs to include a three and one-half per cent inflation factor. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2003, rate period, the commissioner shall increase the inflation adjustment for rates made in accordance with subsection (p) of section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies to update allowable fiscal year 2001 costs to include a one and one-half per cent inflation factor, except that such increase shall be effective November 1, 2002, and such facility rate in effect for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002, shall be paid for services provided until October 31, 2002, except any facility that would have been issued a lower rate effective July 1, 2002, than for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002, due to interim rate status or agreement with the department shall be issued such lower rate effective July 1, 2002, and have such rate updated effective November 1, 2002, in accordance with applicable statutes and regulations. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2004, rates in effect for the period ending June 30, 2003, shall remain in effect, except any facility that would have been issued a lower rate effective July 1, 2003, than for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2003, due to interim rate status or agreement with the department shall be issued such lower rate effective July 1, 2003. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2005, rates in effect for the period ending June 30, 2004, shall remain in effect until September 30, 2004. Effective October 1, 2004, each facility shall receive a rate that is five per cent greater than the rate in effect September 30, 2004. Effective upon receipt of all the necessary federal approvals to secure federal financial participation matching funds associated with the rate increase provided in subdivision (4) of subsection (f) of this section, but in no event earlier than October 1, 2005, and provided the user fee imposed under section 17b-320 is required to be collected, each facility shall receive a rate that is four per cent more than the rate the facility received in the prior fiscal year, except any facility that would have been issued a lower rate effective October 1, 2005, than for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2005, due to interim rate status or agreement with the department, shall be issued such lower rate effective October 1, 2005. Such rate increase shall remain in effect unless: (A) The federal financial participation matching funds associated with the rate increase are no longer available; or (B) the user fee created pursuant to section 17b-320 is not in effect. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2007, rates in effect for the period ending June 30, 2006, shall remain in effect until September 30, 2006, except any facility that would have been issued a lower rate effective July 1, 2006, than for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006, due to interim rate status or agreement with the department, shall be issued such lower rate effective July 1, 2006.

Facilities that receive a rate adjustment for the purpose of wage and benefit enhancements but do not provide increases in employee salaries as described in this subsection on or before July 31, 2021, and July 31, 2022, respectively, may be subject to a rate decrease in the same amount as the adjustment by the commissioner.\n\n(2) The Commissioner of Social Services shall determine whether and to what extent a change in ownership of a facility shall occasion the rebasing of the facility's costs. There shall be no inflation adjustment during a year in which a facility's rates are rebased.\n\n(i) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, any residential care home with an operating cost component of its rate in excess of one hundred thirty per cent of the median of operating cost components of rates in effect January 1, 1992, shall not receive an operating cost component increase.

For purposes of this subdivision, a day of care shall be the period of time between the census-taking hour in a facility on two successive calendar days. “Resident day” does not include the day a resident is discharged;\n\n(5) “Intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities net revenue” means amounts billed by an intermediate care facility for all services provided, including room, board and ancillary services, minus (A) contractual allowances, (B) payer discounts, (C) charity care, and (D) bad debts; and\n\n(6) “Contractual allowances” means the amount of discounts allowed by an intermediate care facility to certain payers from amounts billed for room, board and ancillary services.\n\n(b) (1) For each calendar quarter commencing on or after July 1, 2011, and prior to July 1, 2017, there is hereby imposed a resident day user fee on each intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities in this state, which fee shall be the product of the facility's total resident days during the calendar quarter multiplied by the user fee, as determined by the Commissioner of Social Services pursuant to section 17b-340b.\n\n(2) Each intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities shall, on or before the last day of January, April, July and October of each year, render to the commissioner a return, on forms prescribed or furnished by the commissioner, stating the intermediate care facility's total resident days during the calendar quarter ending on the last day of the preceding month and stating such other information as the commissioner deems necessary for the proper administration of the provisions of this section. The resident day user fee imposed under this section shall be due and payable on the due date of such return. Each intermediate care facility shall be required to file such return electronically with the department and to make such payment by electronic funds transfer in the manner provided by chapter 228g, irrespective of whether such facility would have otherwise been required to file such return electronically or to make such payment by electronic funds transfer under the provisions of chapter 228g.\n\n(c) Whenever such resident day user fee is not paid when due, a penalty of ten per cent of the amount due or fifty dollars, whichever is greater, shall be imposed, and interest at the rate of one per cent per month or a fraction thereof shall accrue on such user fee from the due date of such user fee until the date of payment.\n\n(d) The commissioner shall notify the Commissioner of Social Services of any amount delinquent under section 17b-340b and, upon receipt of such notice, the Commissioner of Social Services shall deduct and withhold such amount from amounts otherwise payable by the Department of Social Services to the delinquent facility.\n\n(e) The provisions of section 12-548, sections 12-550 to 12-554, inclusive, and section 12-555a shall apply to the provisions of this section in the same manner and with the same force and effect as if the language of said sections had been incorporated in full into this section and had expressly referred to the user fee imposed under this section, except to the extent that any provision is inconsistent with a provision in this section. For purposes of section 12-39g, the resident day user fee shall be treated as a tax.\n\n(f) The commissioner may enter into an agreement with the Commissioner of Social Services delegating to the Commissioner of Social Services the authority to examine the records and returns of any intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities in this state subject to the resident day user fee imposed under this section and to determine whether such user fee has been underpaid or overpaid. If such authority is so delegated, examinations of such records and returns by the Commissioner of Social Services and determinations by the Commissioner of Social Services that such user fee has been underpaid or overpaid shall have the same effect as similar examinations or determinations made by the Commissioner of Revenue Services.\n\n(g) (1) The commissioner shall not collect the resident day user fee pursuant to this section until the Commissioner of Social Services informs the commissioner that all the necessary federal approvals are in effect to secure federal financial participation matching funds associated with any authorized facility rate increases.\n\n(2) The commissioner shall cease to collect the resident day user fee pursuant to this section if the Commissioner of Social Services informs the commissioner that the federal approvals described in subdivision (1) of this subsection are withheld or withdrawn.\n\n(P.A. 11-6, S. 151; P.A. 13-139, S. 10; June Sp.

      "text": "(a) The Commissioner of Social Services shall implement an acuity-based methodology for Medicaid reimbursement of nursing home services effective July 1, 2022. Notwithstanding section 17b-340, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, and annually thereafter, the Commissioner of Social Services shall establish Medicaid rates paid to nursing home facilities based on cost years ending on September thirtieth in accordance with the following:\n\n(1) Case-mix adjustments to the direct care component, which will be based on Minimum Data Set resident assessment data as well as cost data reported for the cost year ending September 30, 2019, shall be made effective beginning July 1, 2022, and updated every quarter thereafter. After modeling such case-mix adjustments, the Commissioner of Social Services shall evaluate impact on a facility by facility basis and, not later than October 1, 2021, (A) make recommendations to the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, and (B) submit a report on the recommendations, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a, to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to appropriations and the budgets of state agencies and human services on any adjustments needed to facilitate the transition to the new methodology on July 1, 2022. This evaluation may include a review of inflationary allowances, case mix and budget adjustment factors and stop loss and stop gain corridors and the ability to make such adjustments within available appropriations.\n\n(2) Beginning July 1, 2022, facilities will be required to comply with collection and reporting of quality metrics as specified by the Department of Social Services, after consultation with the nursing home industry, consumers, employees and the Department of Public Health. Rate adjustments based on performance on quality metrics will be phased in, beginning July 1, 2022, with a period of reporting only. Effective July 1, 2023, the Department of Social Services shall issue individualized reports annually to each nursing home facility showing the impact to the Medicaid rate for such home based on the quality metrics program. A nursing home facility receiving an individualized quality metrics report may use such report to evaluate the impact of the quality metrics program on said facility's Medicaid reimbursement. Not later than June 30, 2025, the department shall submit a report, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a, to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to appropriations and the budgets of state agencies and human services on the quality metrics program. Such report shall include information regarding individualized reports and the anticipated impact on nursing homes if the state were to implement a rate withhold on nursing homes that fail to meet certain quality metrics.\n\n(3) Geographic peer groupings of facilities shall be established by the Department of Social Services pursuant to regulations adopted in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(4) Allowable costs shall be divided into the following five cost components: (A) Direct costs, which shall include salaries for nursing personnel, related fringe benefits and costs for nursing personnel supplied by a temporary nursing services agency; (B) indirect costs, which shall include professional fees, dietary expenses, housekeeping expenses, laundry expenses, supplies related to patient care, salaries for indirect care personnel and related fringe benefits; (C) fair rent, which shall be defined in regulations adopted in accordance with subsection (b) of this section; (D) capital-related costs, which shall include property taxes, insurance expenses, equipment leases and equipment depreciation; and (E) administrative and general costs, which shall include maintenance and operation of plant expenses, salaries for administrative and maintenance personnel and related fringe benefits. For (i) direct costs, the maximum cost shall be equal to one hundred thirty-five per cent of the median allowable cost of that peer grouping; (ii) indirect costs, the maximum cost shall be equal to one hundred fifteen per cent of the state-wide median allowable cost; (iii) fair rent, the amount shall be calculated utilizing the amount approved pursuant to section 17b-353; (iv) capital-related costs, there shall be no maximum; and (v) administrative and general costs, the maximum shall be equal to the state-wide median allowable cost. For purposes of this subdivision, “temporary nursing services agency” and “nursing personnel” have the same meaning as provided in section 19a-118.\n\n(5) Costs in excess of the maximum amounts established under this subsection shall not be recognized as allowable costs, except that the commissioner may establish rates whereby allowable costs may exceed such maximum amounts for beds which are restricted to use by patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, traumatic brain injury or other specialized services.\n\n(6) On or after June 30, 2022, the commissioner may, in the commissioner's discretion and within available appropriations, provide pro rata fair rent increases to facilities which have documented fair rent additions placed in service in the most recently filed cost report that are not otherwise included in the rates issued. The commissioner may provide, within available appropriations, pro rata fair rent increases, which may, at the discretion of the commissioner, include increases for facilities which have undergone a material change in circumstances related to fair rent additions in the most recently filed cost report. The commissioner may allow minimum fair rent as the basis upon which reimbursement associated with improvements to real property is added.\n\n(7) For the purpose of determining allowable fair rent, a facility with allowable fair rent less than the twenty-fifth percentile of the state-wide allowable fair rent shall be reimbursed as having allowable fair rent equal to the twenty-fifth percentile of the state-wide allowable fair rent. Any facility with a rate of return on real property other than land in excess of eleven per cent shall have such allowance revised to eleven per cent. Any facility or its related realty affiliate which finances or refinances debt through bonds issued by the Connecticut Health and Education Facilities Authority shall report the terms and conditions of such financing or refinancing to the Commissioner of Social Services not later than thirty days after completing such financing or refinancing. The commissioner may revise the facility's fair rent component of its rate to reflect any financial benefit the facility or its related realty affiliate received as a result of such financing or refinancing. The commissioner shall determine allowable fair rent for real property other than land based on the rate of return for the cost year in which such bonds were issued. The financial benefit resulting from a facility financing or refinancing debt through such bonds shall be shared between the state and the facility to an extent determined by the commissioner on a case-by-case basis and shall be reflected in an adjustment to the facility's allowable fair rent.\n\n(8) A facility shall receive cost efficiency adjustments for indirect costs and for administrative and general costs if such costs are below the state-wide median costs. The cost efficiency adjustments shall equal twenty-five per cent of the difference between allowable reported costs and the applicable median allowable cost established pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection.\n\n(9) On and after July 1, 2025, costs shall be rebased no more frequently than every two years and no less frequently than every four years, as determined by the commissioner. There shall be no inflation adjustment during a year in which a facility's rates are rebased. The commissioner shall determine whether and to what extent a change in ownership of a facility shall occasion the rebasing of the facility's costs.\n\n(10) The method of establishing rates for new facilities shall be determined by the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(11) There shall be no increase to rates based on inflation or any inflationary factor for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, unless otherwise authorized under subdivision (1) of this subsection. Notwithstanding section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2024, and June 30, 2025, there shall be no inflationary increases to rates beyond those already factored into the model for the transition to an acuity-based reimbursement system. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, any subsequent increase to allowable operating costs, excluding fair rent, shall be inflated by the gross domestic product deflator when funding is specifically appropriated for such purposes in the enacted budget. The rate of inflation shall be computed by comparing the most recent rate year to the average of the gross domestic product deflator for the previous four fiscal quarters ending April thirtieth. Any increase to rates based on inflation shall be applied prior to the application of any other budget adjustment factors that may impact such rates.\n\n(12) For purposes of computing minimum allowable patient days, utilization of a facility's certified beds shall be determined at a minimum of ninety per cent of capacity, except for facilities that have undergone a change in ownership, new facilities, and facilities which are certified for additional beds which may be permitted a lower occupancy rate for the first three months of operation after the effective date of licensure.\n\n(13) Rates determined under this section shall comply with federal laws and regulations.\n\n(14) The Commissioner of Social Services may authorize an interim rate for a facility demonstrating circumstances particular to that individual facility impacting facility finances or costs not reflected in the underlying rates.\n\n(b) The Commissioner of Social Services may implement policies as necessary to carry out the provisions of this section while in the process of adopting the policies as regulations, provided that prior to implementation the policies are posted (1) on the eRegulations System established pursuant to section 4-173b, and (2) the Department of Social Services' Internet web site.\n\n(June Sp.

Each such facility that does have such a provider agreement, each such facility that did not have a provider agreement in effect as of January 1, 1991, or had entered into a limited provider agreement before January 1, 1991, and each residential care home shall determine its own self-pay rates. Rates determined pursuant to this section shall be effective July 1, 1991, and on July first of each year thereafter through June 30, 1993, and shall be determined for each facility individually, on the basis of payment for the reasonable costs of providing all services. All self-pay patients shall be given notice of a rate increase at least thirty days prior to the effective date of such rate increase. In determining rates to be charged to self-pay patients the commissioner shall: (A) Consider the quality of care provided by each facility, based on information which the Department of Public Health shall provide to the commissioner, and any testimony or information received from other interested parties; and (B) take into account the relevant cost considerations set forth in section 17b-340 and in the regulations adopted in accordance with subsection (a) of section 17b-238. Such regulations shall include, but not be limited to, the establishment of a formula for allowing profit or an operating surplus, and a fair rate of return on invested capital or equity. Nothing in this section shall authorize the commissioner to set a rate lower than the rate set under section 17b-340 for comparable services. Each facility determining its own self-pay rates shall report such rates to the commissioner upon determination and upon any modification. The commissioner shall document each rate so reported and each rate determined for a facility by the commissioner pursuant to this section. Each facility shall charge any self-pay patient who is insured under a long-term care insurance policy which is precertified pursuant to section 38a-475 a rate which is at least five per cent less than the rate charged other self-pay patients. On and after April 1, 2008, each facility shall charge self-pay patients a per diem rate and not a monthly rate.\n\n(b) Any hospital, home or any self-pay patient or his guardian or conservator aggrieved by said commissioner's decision regarding the rates to be charged to self-pay patients may obtain, by written request to said commissioner, a hearing on all items of aggrievement in accordance with sections 4-176e to 4-181a, inclusive, if the request is made not later than ten days after written notice of the decision is provided by said commissioner to such home or hospital. Upon receipt of such notice concerning the rate decision, the home or hospital shall immediately give written notice of said commissioner's decision to any patient affected or his guardian or conservator.\n\n(c) In the event of an unforeseen or material change in circumstances such hospital or home may submit an application for a rate increase at any time in a form and manner prescribed by the commissioner by regulations adopted in accordance with subsection (a) of section 17b-238. All self-pay patients shall be given notice of an application for a rate increase as soon as possible after receipt of such application by the commissioner, but in no case shall such notice be provided less than ten days prior to the effective date of such increase. The commissioner may approve, modify, or deny such rate increase request with or without a public hearing thereon not less than ten nor more than thirty days after receipt of such request.

      "heading": "(Formerly Sec. 17-314b). - Connecticut home-care program for the elderly.",
      "text": "(a) The Commissioner of Social Services shall administer the Connecticut home-care program for the elderly state-wide in order to prevent the institutionalization of elderly persons who (1) are recipients of medical assistance, (2) are eligible for such assistance, (3) would be eligible for medical assistance if residing in a nursing facility, or (4) meet the criteria for the state-funded portion of the program under subsection (j) of this section. For purposes of this section, “long-term care facility” means a facility that has been federally certified as a skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility. The commissioner shall make any revisions in the state Medicaid plan required by Title XIX of the Social Security Act prior to implementing the program. The program shall be structured so that the net cost to the state for long-term facility care in combination with the services under the program shall not exceed the net cost the state would have incurred without the program. The commissioner shall investigate the possibility of receiving federal funds for the program and shall apply for any necessary federal waivers. A recipient of services under the program, and the estate and legally liable relatives of the recipient, shall be responsible for reimbursement to the state for such services to the same extent required of a recipient of assistance under the state supplement program, medical assistance program, temporary family assistance program or supplemental nutrition assistance program. Only a United States citizen or a noncitizen who meets the citizenship requirements for eligibility under the Medicaid program shall be eligible for home-care services under this section, except a qualified alien, as defined in Section 431 of Public Law 104-193, admitted into the United States on or after August 22, 1996, or other lawfully residing immigrant alien determined eligible for services under this section prior to July 1, 1997, shall remain eligible for such services. Qualified aliens or other lawfully residing immigrant aliens not determined eligible prior to July 1, 1997, shall be eligible for services under this section subsequent to six months from establishing residency. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, any qualified alien or other lawfully residing immigrant alien or alien who formerly held the status of permanently residing under color of law who is a victim of domestic violence or who has intellectual disability shall be eligible for assistance pursuant to this section. Qualified aliens, as defined in Section 431 of Public Law 104-193, or other lawfully residing immigrant aliens or aliens who formerly held the status of permanently residing under color of law shall be eligible for services under this section provided other conditions of eligibility are met.\n\n(b) The commissioner shall solicit bids through a competitive process and shall contract with an access agency, approved by the Office of Policy and Management and the Department of Social Services as meeting the requirements for such agency as defined by regulations adopted pursuant to subsection (m) of this section, that submits proposals that meet or exceed the minimum bid requirements. In addition to such contracts, the commissioner may use department staff to provide screening, coordination, assessment and monitoring functions for the program.\n\n(c) The community-based services covered under the program shall include, but not be limited to, services not otherwise available under the state Medicaid plan: (1) Occupational therapy, (2) homemaker services, (3) companion services, (4) meals on wheels, (5) adult day care, (6) transportation, (7) mental health counseling, (8) care management, (9) elderly foster care, (10) minor home modifications, and (11) assisted living services provided in state-funded congregate housing and in other assisted living pilot or demonstration projects established under state law. Personal care assistance services shall be covered under the program to the extent that (A) such services are not available under the Medicaid state plan and are more cost effective on an individual client basis than existing services covered under such plan, and (B) the provision of such services is approved by the federal government. Recipients of state-funded services, pursuant to subsection (i) of this section, and persons who are determined to be functionally eligible for community-based services who have an application for medical assistance pending, or are determined to be presumptively eligible for Medicaid pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, shall have the cost of home health and community-based services covered by the program, provided they comply with all medical assistance application requirements. Access agencies shall not use department funds to purchase community-based services or home health services from themselves or any related parties.\n\n(d) Physicians, hospitals, long-term care facilities and other licensed health care facilities may disclose, and, as a condition of eligibility for the program, elderly persons, their guardians, and relatives shall disclose, upon request from the Department of Social Services, such financial, social and medical information as may be necessary to enable the department or any agency administering the program on behalf of the department to provide services under the program. Long-term care facilities shall supply the Department of Social Services with the names and addresses of all applicants for admission. Any information provided pursuant to this subsection shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed by the department or administering agency.\n\n(e) (1) The Commissioner of Social Services shall, subject to the provisions of subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection, establish a presumptive Medicaid eligibility system under which the state shall fund services under the Connecticut home-care program for the elderly for a period of not longer than ninety days for applicants who require a skilled level of nursing care and who are determined to be presumptively eligible for Medicaid coverage. The system shall include, but need not be limited to: (A) The development of a preliminary screening tool by the Department of Social Services to be used by representatives of the access agency selected pursuant to subsection (b) of this section to determine whether an applicant is functionally able to live at home or in a community setting and is likely to be financially eligible for Medicaid; (B) a requirement that the applicant complete a Medicaid application on the date such applicant is preliminarily screened for functional eligibility or not later than ten days after such screening; (C) a determination of presumptive eligibility for eligible applicants by the department and approval of a care plan authorizing home care services not later than ten days after an applicant is successfully screened for eligibility; and (D) a written agreement to be signed by the applicant (i) attesting to the accuracy of financial and other information such applicant provides, (ii) acknowledging that the state shall solely fund services not longer than ninety days after the date on which home care services begin, and (iii) waiving any right to receive continued coverage while awaiting a hearing that is requested in response to the department's determination during or at the end of the presumptive period of eligibility that (I) the applicant is not eligible for Medicaid or (II) the applicant failed to provide information necessary to allow the department to make an eligibility determination. The department shall make a final determination as to Medicaid eligibility for applicants determined to be presumptively eligible for Medicaid coverage not later than the end of the ninety-day period of presumptive eligibility. The department may make such determination prior to the end of such ninety-day period if it receives information indicating that the applicant is not eligible for Medicaid.\n\n(2) To the extent permitted by federal law, the commissioner shall seek any federal waiver or amend the Medicaid state plan as necessary to attempt to secure federal reimbursement for the costs of providing coverage to persons determined to be presumptively eligible for Medicaid coverage. The provisions of this subsection and any other provision of this section relating to the establishment of a presumptive Medicaid eligibility system, including, but not limited to, such provisions located in subsections (c), (g) and (m), shall not be effective until the commissioner secures such federal reimbursement through a federal waiver or Medicaid state plan amendment.\n\n(3) Not less than two years after the date of the establishment of a presumptive Medicaid eligibility system pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, the commissioner may, in the commissioner's discretion, discontinue the system if the commissioner determines that the system is not cost effective.\n\n(f) The commissioner may require long-term care facilities to inform applicants for admission of the Connecticut home-care program for the elderly established under this section and to distribute such forms as the commissioner prescribes for the program. Such forms shall be supplied by and be returnable to the department.\n\n(g) The commissioner shall report annually, by June first, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a, to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services on the Connecticut home-care program for the elderly in such detail, depth and scope as said committee requires to evaluate the effect of the program on the state and program participants.

For program applications received by the Department of Social Services for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2016, and June 30, 2017, only persons who require the level of care provided in a nursing home shall be eligible for the state-funded portion of the program, except for persons residing in affordable housing under the assisted living demonstration project established pursuant to section 17b-347e who are otherwise eligible in accordance with this section.\n\n(2) Except for persons residing in affordable housing under the assisted living demonstration project established pursuant to section 17b-347e, as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection, any person whose income is at or below two hundred per cent of the federal poverty level and who is ineligible for Medicaid shall contribute three per cent of the cost of his or her care. Any person whose income exceeds two hundred per cent of the federal poverty level shall contribute three per cent of the cost of his or her care in addition to the amount of applied income determined in accordance with the methodology established by the Department of Social Services for recipients of medical assistance. Any person who does not contribute to the cost of care in accordance with this subdivision shall be ineligible to receive services under this subsection. Notwithstanding any provision of sections 17b-60 and 17b-61, the department shall not be required to provide an administrative hearing to a person found ineligible for services under this subsection because of a failure to contribute to the cost of care.\n\n(3) Any person who resides in affordable housing under the assisted living demonstration project established pursuant to section 17b-347e and whose income is at or below two hundred per cent of the federal poverty level, shall not be required to contribute to the cost of care. Any person who resides in affordable housing under the assisted living demonstration project established pursuant to section 17b-347e and whose income exceeds two hundred per cent of the federal poverty level, shall contribute to the applied income amount determined in accordance with the methodology established by the Department of Social Services for recipients of medical assistance. Any person whose income exceeds two hundred per cent of the federal poverty level and who does not contribute to the cost of care in accordance with this subdivision shall be ineligible to receive services under this subsection. Notwithstanding any provision of sections 17b-60 and 17b-61, the department shall not be required to provide an administrative hearing to a person found ineligible for services under this subsection because of a failure to contribute to the cost of care.\n\n(4) The annualized cost of services provided to an individual under the state-funded portion of the program shall not exceed fifty per cent of the weighted average cost of care in nursing homes in the state, except an individual who received services costing in excess of such amount under the Department of Social Services in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992, may continue to receive such services, provided the annualized cost of such services does not exceed eighty per cent of the weighted average cost of such nursing home care. The commissioner may allow the cost of services provided to an individual to exceed the maximum cost established pursuant to this subdivision in a case of extreme hardship, as determined by the commissioner, provided in no case shall such cost exceed that of the weighted cost of such nursing home care.\n\n(j) The Commissioner of Social Services shall collect data on services provided under the program, including, but not limited to, the: (1) Number of participants before and after any adjustment in copayments, (2) average hours of care provided under the program per participant, and (3) estimated cost savings to the state by providing home care to participants who may otherwise receive care in a nursing home facility. The commissioner shall, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a, report on the results of the data collection to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to aging, appropriations and the budgets of state agencies and human services not later than July 1, 2022. The commissioner may implement revised criteria for the operation of the program while in the process of adopting such criteria in regulation form, provided the commissioner publishes notice of intention to adopt the regulations in accordance with section 17b-10. Such criteria shall be valid until the time final regulations are effective.\n\n(k) The commissioner shall notify any access agency or area agency on aging that administers the program when the department sends a redetermination of eligibility form to an individual who is a client of such agency.\n\n(l) In determining eligibility for the program described in this section, the commissioner shall not consider as income (1) Aid and Attendance pension benefits granted to a veteran, as defined in section 27-103, or the surviving spouse of such veteran, and (2) any tax refund or advance payment with respect to a refundable credit to the same extent such refund or advance payment would be disregarded under 26 USC 6409 in any federal program or state or local program financed in whole or in part with federal funds.\n\n(m) The commissioner shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to (1) define “access agency”, (2) implement and administer the program, (3) implement and administer the presumptive Medicaid eligibility system described in subsection (e) of this section, (4) establish uniform state-wide standards for the program and uniform assessment tools for use in the screening process for the program and the prescreening for presumptive Medicaid eligibility, and (5) specify conditions of eligibility.\n\n(P.A. 85-556, S. 1, 2; P.A. 86-374, S. 4, 6; P.A. 87-363, S. 1, 2; P.A. 89-296, S. 7, 9; P.A. 90-182, S. 1, 3; P.A. 91-176; May Sp.

      "text": "(a) The rates paid by the state to community health centers participating in the Medicaid program may be adjusted annually on the basis of the cost reports submitted to the Commissioner of Social Services. The Department of Social Services may develop an alternative payment methodology to replace the encounter-based reimbursement system. Such methodology shall be approved by the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services and appropriations and the budgets of state agencies. Until such methodology is implemented, the Department of Social Services shall distribute supplemental funding, within available appropriations, to federally qualified health centers based on cost, volume and quality measures as determined by the Commissioner of Social Services. (1) Beginning with the one-year rate period commencing on October 1, 2012, and annually thereafter, the Commissioner of Social Services may add to a community health center's rates, if applicable, a capital cost rate adjustment that is equivalent to the center's actual or projected year-to-year increase in total allowable depreciation and interest expenses associated with major capital projects divided by the projected service visit volume. For the purposes of this subsection, “capital costs” means expenditures for land or building purchases, fixed assets, movable equipment, capitalized financing fees and capitalized construction period interest and “major capital projects” means projects with costs exceeding two million dollars. The commissioner may revise such capital cost rate adjustment retroactively based on actual allowable depreciation and interest expenses or actual service visit volume for the rate period. (2) The commissioner shall establish separate capital cost rate adjustments for each Medicaid service provided by a center. (3) The commissioner shall not grant a capital cost rate adjustment to a community health center for any depreciation or interest expenses associated with capital costs that were disapproved by the federal Department of Health and Human Services or another federal or state government agency with capital expenditure approval authority related to health care services. (4) The commissioner may allow actual debt service in lieu of allowable depreciation and interest expenses associated with capital items funded with a debt obligation, provided debt service amounts are deemed reasonable in consideration of the interest rate and other loan terms. (5) The commissioner shall implement policies and procedures necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection while in the process of adopting such policies and procedures in regulation form, provided notice of intent to adopt such regulations is posted on the eRegulations System prior to adopting the policies and procedures. Such policies and procedures shall be valid until the time final regulations are effective.\n\n(b) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1998, any grant awards made to a community health center or its successor for the purpose of supporting the community health center infrastructure services to the uninsured or expansion initiative projects shall be equivalent to base grant awards made in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1997, provided, if any portion of the amount is not required by a given community health center, the differential shall be distributed among all the other health centers according to their share of total funding.\n\n(c) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1999, any grant awards made to a community health center or its successor for the purpose of supporting the community health center infrastructure services to the uninsured or expansion initiative projects shall be equivalent to base grant awards made in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1997, provided, if any portion of the amount is not required by a given community health center, the differential shall be distributed among all the other health centers according to their share of total funding.\n\n(d) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, any grant awards made to a community health center or its successor for the purpose of supporting the community health center infrastructure services to the uninsured or expansion initiative projects shall be equivalent to base grant awards made in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1999, provided, if any portion of the amount is not required by a given community health center, the differential shall be distributed among all the other health centers according to their share of total funding.\n\n(e) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2001, any grant awards made to a community health center or its successor for the purpose of supporting the community health center infrastructure services to the uninsured or expansion initiative projects shall be equivalent to base grant awards made in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1999, provided, if any portion of the amount is not required by a given community health center, the differential shall be distributed among all the other health centers according to their share of total funding.\n\n(f) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002, any grant awards made to a community health center or its successor for the purpose of supporting the community health center infrastructure services to the uninsured or expansion initiative projects shall be in the same proportion to its grant award made in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2001, as the total appropriation for such grant awards for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002, is to the total appropriation for such grant awards for the prior fiscal year, provided, if any portion of the amount is not required by a given community health center, the differential shall be distributed among all the other health centers according to their share of total funding.\n\n(g) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2003, any grant awards made to a community health center or its successor for the purpose of supporting the community health center infrastructure services to the uninsured or expansion initiative projects shall be in the same proportion to its grant award made in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002, as the total appropriation for such grant awards for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2003, is to the total appropriation for such grant awards for the prior fiscal year, provided, if any portion of the amount is not required by a given community health center, the differential shall be distributed among all the other health centers according to their share of total funding.\n\n(h) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2004, any grant awards made to a community health center or its successor for the purpose of supporting the community health center infrastructure services to the uninsured or expansion initiative projects

the purpose of supporting the community health center infrastructure services to the uninsured or expansion initiative projects shall be in the same proportion to its grant award made in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2004, as the total appropriation for such grant awards for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2005, is to the total appropriation for such grant awards for the prior fiscal year, provided, if any portion of the amount is not required by a given community health center, the differential shall be distributed among all the other health centers according to their share of total

Bed need shall be based on the recent occupancy percentage of area nursing facilities and the projected bed need for no more than five years into the future at ninety-seven and one-half per cent occupancy using the latest official population projections by town and age as published by the Office of Policy and Management and the latest available state-wide nursing facility utilization statistics by age cohort from the Department of Public Health.

The summary order which the Department of Social Services may issue shall include termination of the facility's participation in Medicaid or appointment of a temporary manager to oversee the operation of the facility and may include transfer of patients to other participating facilities; denial of payment under Medicaid for new admissions; imposition of a directed plan of correction of the facility's deficiencies; imposition of civil monetary penalties; or imposition of other remedies authorized by regulations adopted by the Department of Social Services in accordance with chapter 54.\n\n(c) If the Department of Public Health finds, through the results of a survey, that a nursing facility is not in compliance with one or more of the requirements of Subsections (b), (c) and (d) of 42 USC 1396r, or the requirements of applicable state statutes or regulations, but that such noncompliance does not pose an immediate and obvious threat to patient health or safety, the Department of Public Health shall issue a statement of charges to the facility and shall file a copy of the charges with the Department of Social Services with a request for an order imposing one or more alternative remedies under this subsection. If the Department of Social Services finds, based on a statement of charges filed by the Department of Public Health, that a nursing facility is not in compliance with one or more of the requirements of Subsections (b), (c) and (d) of 42 USC 1396r, or the requirements of applicable state statutes or regulations, but does not issue a summary order, it may impose one or more of the following alternative remedies: Termination of the facility's participation in Medicaid; appointment of a temporary manager to oversee the operation of the facility; transfer of patients to other participating facilities; denial of payment under Medicaid for new admissions; imposition of a directed plan of correction of the facility's deficiencies; imposition of civil monetary penalties; or imposition of other remedies authorized by regulations adopted by the Department of Social Services in accordance with chapter 54. The civil monetary penalties imposed may be in the range of three thousand two hundred fifty dollars to ten thousand dollars per day for each day the facility is found to be out of compliance with one or more requirements of Subsections (b), (c) and (d) of 42 USC 1396r if the failure to comply with such requirements is found to constitute an immediate and serious threat to resident health or safety, or in the range of two hundred dollars to three thousand dollars per day for each day the facility is found to be out of compliance with a requirement of Subsections (b), (c) and (d) of 42 USC 1396r that is found not to constitute an immediate and serious threat to resident health or safety. The exact civil monetary penalty will be set depending on such factors as the existence of repeat deficiencies or uncorrected deficiencies and the overall compliance history of the provider. The remedies available to the Department of Social Services for violations of the requirements of Subsections (b), (c) and (d) of 42 USC 1396r are cumulative and are in addition to the remedies available to the Department of Public Health under chapter 368v for violations of state licensure requirements.

If the facility does not request a hearing within ten days and no summary order has been issued, the Department of Social Services shall automatically adopt the Department of Public Health's findings and shall issue an order incorporating one or more of the remedies authorized by subsection (c) of this section. If the facility timely requests a hearing or the Department of Social Services issues a summary order, the Department of Social Services shall issue a notice of hearing. At such hearing the facility shall be given the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If the individual requires such level of services, the Department of Developmental Services shall also determine whether the individual requires specialized services for such condition. An individual who is determined by the Department of Developmental Services to have intellectual disability or to have a related condition and is determined not to require nursing facility level of services shall not be admitted to a nursing facility. In order to implement the preadmission review requirements of this section, and to identify applicants for admission who may have intellectual disability or have conditions related to intellectual disability and subject to the requirements of this section, nursing facilities may not admit any individual irrespective of source of payment, unless an identification screen developed, or in the case of out-of-state residents approved, by the Department of Social Services has been completed for the applicant and filed in accordance with federal law.\n\n(c) No payment from any source shall be due to a nursing facility that admits a resident in violation of the preadmission screening requirements of this section.\n\n(d) A nursing facility shall notify the Department of Developmental Services when a resident who has intellectual disability undergoes a change in condition or when a resident who has not previously been diagnosed as having intellectual disability undergoes a significant change in condition that may require specialized services. Upon such notification, the Department of Developmental Services, under the auspices of the Department of Social Services, shall perform an evaluation to determine whether the resident requires the level of services provided by a nursing facility or requires specialized services for intellectual disability.\n\n(e) In the case of a resident who is determined under subsection (d) of this section not to require the level of services provided by a nursing facility but to require specialized services for intellectual disability or a condition related to intellectual disability and who has continually resided in a nursing facility for at least thirty months before the date of the determination, the resident may elect to remain in the facility or to receive services covered by Medicaid in an alternative appropriate institutional or noninstitutional setting in accordance with the terms of the alternative disposition plan submitted by the Department of Social Services and approved by the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n(f) In the case of a resident with intellectual disability or a related condition who is determined under subsection (d) of this section not to require the level of services provided by a nursing facility but to require specialized services for intellectual disability or a related condition and who has not continuously resided in a nursing facility for at least thirty months before the date of the determination, the nursing facility, in consultation with the Department of Developmental Services, shall arrange for the safe and orderly discharge of the resident from the facility. If the department determines that the provision of specialized services requires an alternative residential placement, the discharge and transfer of the patient shall be in accordance with the alternative disposition plan submitted by the Department of Social Services and approved by the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, except if an alternative residential facility is not available, the resident shall not be transferred.\n\n(g) In the case of a resident who is determined under subsection (d) of this section not to require the level of services provided by a nursing facility and not to require specialized services, the nursing facility shall arrange for the safe and orderly discharge of the resident from the facility.\n\n(h) The Department of Developmental Services shall be the agency responsible for making the determinations required by this section on behalf of individuals who have intellectual disability and on behalf of individuals with conditions related to intellectual disability and may provide services to such individuals to the extent required by federal law.\n\n(i) Any person seeking admittance to a nursing facility or any resident of a nursing facility who is adversely affected by a determination of the Department of Developmental Services under this section may appeal such determination to the Department of Social Services within fifteen days of the receipt of the notice of a determination by the Department of Developmental Services. If an appeal is taken to the Department of Social Services, the determination of the Department of Developmental Services shall be stayed pending determination by the Department of Social Services.\n\n(P.A. 89-348, S. 9, 10; P.A. 93-262, S. 1, 87; June 18 Sp.

Such project shall be designed to achieve the objectives set forth in Section 6071(a) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. Services available under the demonstration project shall include, but need not be limited to, personal care assistance services. The commissioner may apply for a Medicaid research and demonstration waiver under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act, if such waiver is necessary to implement the demonstration project. The commissioner may, if necessary, modify any existing Medicaid home or community-based waiver if such modification is required to implement the demonstration project.\n\n(b) (1) The Commissioner of Social Services shall submit, in accordance with this subdivision, a copy of any report on the Money Follows the Person demonstration project that the commissioner is required to submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and that pertains to (A) the status of the implementation of the Money Follows the Person demonstration project, (B) the anticipated date that the first eligible person or persons will be transitioned into the community, or (C) information concerning when and how the Department of Social Services will transition additional eligible persons into the community. The commissioner shall submit such copy to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to aging and human services, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a. Copies of reports prepared prior to October 1, 2009, shall be submitted by said date and copies of reports prepared thereafter shall be submitted semiannually.\n\n(2) After October 1, 2009, if the commissioner has not prepared any new reports for submission to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for any six-month submission period under subdivision (1) of this subsection, the commissioner shall prepare and submit a written report in accordance with this subdivision to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to aging and human services, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a. Such report shall include (A) the status of the implementation of the Money Follows the Person demonstration project, (B) the anticipated date that the first eligible person or persons will be transitioned into the community, and (C) information concerning when and how the Department of Social Services will transition additional eligible persons into the community.\n\n(c) The Commissioner of Social Services shall develop a strategic plan, consistent with the long-term care plan established pursuant to section 17b-337, to rebalance Medicaid long-term care supports and services, including, but not limited to, those supports and services provided in home, community-based settings and institutional settings. The commissioner shall include home, community-based and institutional providers in the development of the strategic plan. In developing the strategic plan the commissioner shall consider topics that include, but are not limited to: (1) Regional trends concerning the state's aging population; (2) trends in the demand for home, community-based and institutional services; (3) gaps in the provision of home and community-based services which prevent community placements; (4) gaps in the provision of institutional care; (5) the quality of care provided by home, community-based and institutional providers; (6) the condition of institutional buildings; (7) the state's regional supply of institutional beds; (8) the current rate structure applicable to home, community-based and institutional services; (9) the methods of implementing adjustments to the bed capacity of individual nursing facilities; and (10) a review of the provisions of subsection (a) of section 17b-354.\n\n(d) The Commissioner of Social Services shall, within available resources, maintain a data collection system, in accordance with the federal reporting requirements pursuant to Section 6071 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, as amended from time to time, to guide the development of the strategic plan for long-term care. In maintaining the data collection system, the commissioner shall, as applicable: (1) Establish a process to identify and report on individuals participating in the Money Follows the Person demonstration project who signed an informed consent agreement to participate; (2) ensure that persons and agencies identifying persons as candidates for the Money Follows the Person demonstration project have access to information regarding plans to transition persons from institutional to community living and options for persons not eligible for the demonstration project; (3) ensure that Money Follows the Person demonstration project participants are counted only once for reporting purposes regardless of how many times they have been referred to the demonstration project; (4) establish a benchmark length of time that Money Follows the Person demonstration project participants may hold a status of “transition in process” before they are placed in a home in the community; and (5) identify steps to reduce the post-transition outcome of premature death for participants with chronic diseases or health conditions, including cardiac, pulmonary and endocrinal conditions or diabetes.\n\n(e) The Commissioner of Social Services may contract with nursing facilities, as defined in section 17b-357, and home and community-based providers for the purpose of carrying out the strategic plan. In addition, the commissioner may revise a rate paid to a nursing facility pursuant to section 17b-340 in order to effectuate the strategic plan. The commissioner may fund strategic plan initiatives with federal grant-in-aid resources available to the state pursuant to the Money Follows the Person demonstration project pursuant to Section 6071 of the Deficit Reduction Act, P.L. 109-171, and the State Balancing Incentive Payments Program under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, P.L. 111-148.\n\n(f) If a nursing facility has reason to know that a resident is likely to become financially eligible for Medicaid benefits within one hundred eighty days, the nursing facility shall notify the resident or the resident's representative and the department. The department may (1) assess any such resident to determine if the resident prefers and is able to live appropriately at home or in some other community-based setting, and (2) develop a care plan and assist the resident in his or her transition to the community.\n\n(g) The Commissioner of Public Health, or the commissioner's designee, may waive the requirements of sections 19-13-D8t, 19-13-D6 and 19-13-D105 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, if a provider requires such a waiver for purposes of effectuating the strategic plan developed pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, determines that such waiver will not endanger the health and safety of the provider's residents or clients. The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, may impose conditions on the granting of any waiver which are necessary to ensure the health and safety of the provider's residents or clients. The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, may revoke any waiver granted pursuant to this subsection upon a finding that the health or safety of a resident or client of a provider has been jeopardized.\n\n(P.A. 06-188, S. 44; June Sp.
