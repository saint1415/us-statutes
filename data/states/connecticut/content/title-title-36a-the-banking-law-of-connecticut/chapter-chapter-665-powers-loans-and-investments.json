      "text": "(a) As used in this section, the term “mortgage loan” means a loan, line of credit or letter of credit secured wholly or substantially by a lien on or interest in real estate, including a leasehold interest, for which the lien or interest is central to the extension of credit, but does not include the following loan transactions:\n\n(1) Loans that are to be sold by the Connecticut bank promptly after origination by such bank, without extended recourse for payment default, to a financially responsible third party, provided such loans shall be considered mortgage loans for purposes of purchases and participations by a Connecticut bank if such loans otherwise qualify as mortgage loans under this subsection.\n\n(2) Loans for which a lien on or interest in real estate is taken as additional collateral through an abundance of caution by the Connecticut bank, including loans pursuant to which the bank takes a blanket lien on all or substantially all of the assets of the borrower, and the value of the real estate is low relative to the aggregate value of all collateral.\n\n(3) Loans made to manufacturing, industrial or commercial borrowers with a lien or interest in real estate taken as all or a portion of the collateral to directly or indirectly secure such loans, when the bank looks for repayment out of the operations of the borrower's business, relying on the borrower's general credit standing and the borrower's forecast of operations.\n\n(b) (1) The assets of Connecticut banks may be invested in mortgage loans, subject to the general limitations set forth in this section.\n\n(2) Any such mortgage loan shall be secured either by (A) a first mortgage which is a first lien or (B) a mortgage which is subordinate to another mortgage or other mortgages, provided, in the case of a loan secured by a mortgage which is subordinate to another mortgage or other mortgages, which other mortgage or mortgages are held by a person other than the Connecticut bank, the real estate securing such loan is (i) residential real estate, or (ii) nonresidential real estate provided the loan does not exceed, at the time of origination, a loan-to-value ratio of fifty per cent, or (iii) nonresidential real estate in a loan transaction which, at the time of origination, exceeds a loan-to-value ratio of fifty per cent, provided the aggregate amount of all such loans made pursuant to this subparagraph (B)(iii) does not exceed, at the time of origination, twenty-five per cent of the capital and surplus of the Connecticut bank. A loan which was included within the aggregate limit of subparagraph (B)(iii) of this subdivision subsequently may be excluded if the loan is repaid or if the applicable loan-to-value ratio is reduced to fifty per cent or below because of a reduction in principal or senior liens, additional contributions of real estate collateral, or an increase in equity value substantiated by a current suitable appraisal or evaluation.\n\n(c) “Real estate”, as used in this section, includes refrigerating equipment, dishwashing equipment, stoves and clothes washing machines, hereinafter called “household equipment”, used on the premises at the time of execution of the mortgage or substituted after the mortgage is executed if such equipment is specifically declared in the mortgage deed to be used as a part of the mortgaged realty, and if such mortgage declares that household equipment substituted for the original household equipment mentioned in such mortgage shall be part of the mortgaged realty.\n\n(d) The real estate shall be unencumbered, except to the extent that prior mortgages are permitted by subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of this section. A satisfactory certificate of title or other suitable form of title review issued by a suitable person approved by such Connecticut bank, or a satisfactory policy of title insurance, shall be filed with the lending bank until the loan is paid or until the loan is sold. The following are not encumbrances within the meaning of this section: (1) Reservations to the United States of America of fissionable materials, (2) leases, provided the impact of the lease is adequately reflected in the appraisal or evaluation required by subsection (e) of this section, and (3) easements, restrictions, interests and other rights (A) which do not materially adversely affect the marketability of the real estate, (B) which are otherwise adequately reflected in the appraisal or evaluation required by subsection (e) of this section, (C) where the attendant risks are satisfactorily insured under an acceptable policy of title insurance, or (D) which the bank otherwise reasonably determines do not present a material adverse risk after consideration of the relevant underwriting risks for the loan or class of loans. Connecticut banks shall adopt and implement a real estate lending policy which reflects, in accordance with safe and sound banking principles, consideration of acceptable standards for title review and title insurance.\n\n(e) The real estate shall be appraised or otherwise suitably evaluated, before any loan is made on its security, by one or more suitable persons who are familiar with real estate values in the community where the real estate is located. Such persons shall be approved by the governing board of the Connecticut bank making the loan, or by a management committee, board committee or agent appropriately designated by such governing board in accordance with the appraisal policy required by this subsection, provided, if the loan under consideration is a loan to be insured or guaranteed by a governmental agency, the appraiser may be one who appraised the property for the governmental agency. Such appraisal or evaluation shall be in writing, shall state the amount at which the property has been appraised or evaluated and shall be filed with the Connecticut bank until the loan is paid or until the loan is sold. Connecticut banks shall adopt and implement an appraisal policy which reflects, in accordance with safe and sound banking principles, consideration of appraiser qualifications, procedures for the approval and selection of appraisers, appraisal and evaluation standards, and the bank's administration of the appraisal and evaluation process.\n\n(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (2) of subsection (h) of this section, the Connecticut bank, in its discretion and for such a period as it deems advisable, may excuse the borrower on a mortgage loan from amortization of the principal of such loan, provided the governing board of the Connecticut bank, or a management committee or board committee appropriately designated by such governing board, has reviewed the particular mortgage loan and has determined such action to be prudent under the circumstances.\n\n(g) Loans not exceeding fifty per cent of the value of the real estate may be made without further restriction than is set forth in subsections (a) to (f), inclusive, of this section. The requirements of this section relating to the relationship between the loan amount and the value of the real estate shall be calculated on the basis of the aggregate amount of such loan plus the unpaid amount of any obligation secured by any prior mortgages or liens and the amount of any advancements permissible under any loan secured by such prior mortgage or mortgages in relation to the value of the real estate interest.\n\n(h) Loans not exceeding ninety per cent of the value of the real estate may be made subject to the following additional limitations set forth in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection. (1) No loan shall be made until the person or persons liable on the note have filed with the bank a satisfactory financial statement which shall be kept on file. (2) All such loans shall require repayment of principal and payment of interest in at least consecutive semiannual installments of principal and interest, such payments to be sufficient to pay the loan in full not later than forty-two years from the date of the first payment and the first payment to be made within twenty-four months of the date of the note. The requirements for semiannual principal payments pursuant to this subdivision are not applicable to: (A) Consumer revolving loan agreements made pursuant to subsection (c) of section 49-2, (B) alternative mortgage loans made pursuant to section 36a-265, (C) loans which may be demanded at any time and which are secured by residential real estate, and (D) any other loan or class of loans determined by the commissioner not to be subject to such requirements.\n\n(i) The following mortgage loans may be made without regard to the ninety per cent loan-to-value limit set forth in subsection (h) of this section:\n\n(1) Loans guaranteed or insured by the United States government or its agencies, provided the amount of the guaranty or insurance is at least equal to the portion of the loan that exceeds the applicable loan-to-value limit.\n\n(2) Loans backed by the full faith and credit of a state government, provided the amount of the assurance is at least equal to the portion of the loan that exceeds the applicable loan-to-value limit.\n\n(3) Loans guaranteed or insured by a state, municipal or local government, or its agency, provided (A) the amount of the guaranty or insurance is at least equal to the portion of the loan that exceeds the applicable loan-to-value limit, and (B) the bank has determined that the guarantor or insurer has the financial capacity and willingness to perform under the terms of the guaranty or insurance agreement.\n\n(4) Loans that are renewed, refinanced, or restructured without the advancement of new funds or an increase in a line of credit, except for reasonable closing costs.\n\n(5) Loans that are renewed, refinanced, or restructured in connection with a workout situation, either with or without the advancement of new funds, where such action is consistent with safe and sound banking practices and is a part of a clearly defined and well documented program to achieve orderly liquidation of the debt, reduce risk of loss or maximize recovery of the loan.\n\n(6) Loans that facilitate the sale of real estate acquired by the Connecticut bank in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted in good faith.\n\n(7) Loans where the Connecticut bank does not rely principally on the real estate as security.\n\n(8) Loans where all or part of such loan is made in primary reliance upon the mortgage insurance policy of a private mortgage guaranty company, licensed by the Insurance Commissioner to do business in this state and approved by the commissioner.\n\n(9) Loans or loan programs which are determined by the governing board of the Connecticut bank, or by a management committee or board committee appropriately designated by such governing board, to be prudent under the circumstances after consideration of the relevant underwriting risks, provided (A) the aggregate amount of all such loans, calculated at the time of origination of each such loan, does not exceed one hundred per cent of the bank's capital and surplus, (B) the aggregate amount of all such loans, calculated at the time of origination of each such loan, other than loans secured by one-to-four-family residential property, does not exceed thirty per cent of the bank's capital and surplus, (C) the aggregate amount of all such loans is included in the percentage of assets limitation specified in subsection (s) of this section, and (D) the bank makes a notation of such determination and the reasons therefor in the applicable loan file. A loan which is included within the aggregate limits of this subsection may subsequently be excluded if the applicable loan-to-value limit is satisfied because of a reduction in principal or senior liens, additional contribution of real estate collateral or increases in equity value substantiated by a current suitable appraisal or evaluation.\n\n(j) Loans made under this section may be for the purpose of building upon or improving the property of the borrower, and may be made in installments advanced at the discretion of the lending institution as the work progresses; provided at no time shall the ratio of the amount loaned to the then total value exceed the ratio the final loan is to bear to the value of the completed property. Loans made to finance the construction of buildings and having a maturity of not more than twenty-four months or having a maturity of not more than thirty-six months if approved by the commissioner are not subject to the limitations imposed by this subsection.\n\n(k) Connecticut banks are authorized to make and invest in any mortgage loan, including construction and improvement loans, insured by the Federal Housing Administrator without regard to the limitations and restrictions of this section, except that such loans are subject to the following limitations: (1) In the case of loans secured by a first mortgage on real estate, the contract of insurance shall contain a provision that the debentures to be issued by the Federal Housing Administrator in settlement of such insurance, in the event of the foreclosure or default of any such loan or mortgage, shall be fully guaranteed as to payment of principal and interest by the government of the United States, (2) if the bank has a commitment for such insurance, issued by the Federal Housing Administration, it may grant a loan to a borrower for the purpose of building upon or improving the property of the borrower, the money so borrowed to be advanced at the discretion of the bank in installments as the work progresses, provided the total of all advances made does not exceed eighty per cent of the value of the property on the date of each advance or the proportion that the final loan is to bear to the final estimated value of the property, whichever is greater, except that the final advance may be in such an amount that the total of all advances made may equal but not exceed the amount of such commitment. The final advance shall not be made until the buildings or improvements have been inspected and approved by the Federal Housing Administration for an insured loan.\n\n(l) Subject to such regulations and restrictions as the commissioner finds necessary and proper, and subject to the limitations, restrictions and privileges contained in this subsection, Connecticut banks are authorized to make and invest in any loan which the Administrator of Veterans Affairs guarantees, makes a commitment to guarantee, or insures pursuant to Title III of an Act of Congress entitled “Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944”, as amended, without regard to the limitations and restrictions of this title. (1) Each such loan shall be subject to the provisions of this title prescribing the maximum limits, in amount, of: (A) A loan or loans to or total liability of any one individual, and (B) a loan upon the security of real estate, with relation to the appraised value of such real estate. (2) Each such loan shall be secured by a mortgage on real estate, except that a loan pursuant to Section 501, 502 or 503 of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, as amended, for the purpose of repairing, altering or improving a building or buildings, and a loan pursuant to Section 505(a) of said act, need not be secured by a lien on real property.\n\n(m) (1) Additional sums, as evidenced by a note or notes signed by the then owner of record of the mortgaged premises, may be advanced by a Connecticut bank to such owner and shall be a part of the mortgage debt due the mortgagee, provided (A) such advancements shall not exceed the difference between the indebtedness at the time of the advance and the original mortgage debt, (B) the original mortgage deed shall have been recorded after October 1, 1951, and shall contain specific provisions granting this right, and (C) the terms of repayment of such advancements shall not extend the time of repayment beyond the maturity of the original mortgage debt. If the then owner of record is other than the original mortgagor, neither the original mortgagor nor any other former owner of the mortgaged premises is liable on such advancements.\n\n(2) Advancements may also be made by writing open-end mortgages in accordance with the provisions of section 49-2.\n\n(n) (1) Connecticut banks may participate with other lenders, which may be corporations, business trusts, pension trusts, governments or government agencies, in mortgage loans which Connecticut banks are permitted to invest in under this section, but the amount of the participating interest of any Connecticut bank in any one such loan shall not exceed the amount which such bank would be permitted to invest individually in any one loan of the same class under this section, and the amount of the participating interests shall be included in determining whether or not such bank is exceeding its loan limits.\n\n(2) Connecticut banks may participate in mortgage loans only pursuant to a written agreement between all the participating lenders and the servicing agent for such loan and the servicing agent may impose a service charge therefor.\n\n(o) Any Connecticut bank may grant a loan secured by a first mortgage on property of the borrower without regard to the limitations and restrictions on loans imposed by this section, if the borrower has an agreement with a housing authority created under section 8-40, secured by a commitment of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, pursuant to which the borrower is to construct housing upon the property and the housing authority is to purchase the property upon completion of construction, the money so borrowed to be advanced at the discretion of the bank as construction progresses, provided the ratio of the total of all advances made to the amount of the agreed purchase price at no time exceeds ninety per cent of the ratio of the value of the property to the expected value of the property upon completion of construction.\n\n(p) If a loan made under this section is secured by a mortgage on income-producing real estate and if the Connecticut bank relies upon such real estate or income production as primary security for the loan, the bank need not require that any person be personally liable on the note, in which case the bank shall retain in its files, in lieu of the financial statements required by subdivision (1) of subsection (h) of this section, such income projection statements, tenants' financial statements and other credit information as the bank deems necessary.\n\n(q) Subject to such regulations as the commissioner may adopt, Connecticut banks may make mortgage loans secured by leasehold interests, provided the leasehold estate securing such mortgage loan has a remaining term at the time such mortgage loan is originated by the bank which does not expire prior to the maturity of the mortgage loan obligation. The term of the leasehold estate shall not include any period for which the lease may grant an option of renewal.\n\n(r) Any Connecticut bank may, in connection with any mortgage loan made by it, contract with the mortgagor for interest to be paid currently or to accrue, and, if such interest is to accrue, for the interest to be added to the mortgage debt on which interest may be charged and collected. Accrued interest which is added to the mortgage debt shall be secured by the mortgage to the same extent as the principal of the mortgage debt.\n\n(s) The assets of a Connecticut bank may be invested in mortgage loans which do not conform to the requirements of this section, provided the governing board of the Connecticut bank, or a management committee or board committee appropriately designated by such governing board, has reviewed the nonconforming aspects of the particular mortgage loan or mortgage loan program and has determined such mortgage loan or mortgage loan program to be prudent under the circumstances and all such mortgage loans outstanding at the time of origination when combined with the loans made pursuant to subdivision (9) of subsection (i) of this section, do not exceed eight per cent of the assets of the bank. The bank shall make a notation of the prudence determination and the reasons for such determination in the applicable loan file. A loan which was included within the percentage of assets limitation of this subsection subsequently may be excluded if the loan is repaid or if the nonconforming aspects are eliminated or otherwise cease to exist.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 5818, 5819; 1949, S. 516a–519a; 1951, 1953, 1955, S. 2679d; 1957, P.A. 89; 1959, P.A. 11, S. 1; 14; 74, S. 1; 1961, P.A. 81; 82; 93; 101, S. 1–3; 1963, P.A. 70; 94; 119, S. 1, 2; February, 1965, P.A. 76, S. 1; 99; 135; 163, S. 1; 209, S. 1; 222; 359, S. 1; 1967, P.A. 67, S. 1; 357; 427, S. 2; 434, S. 2; 461, S. 22; 1969, P.A. 87; 223, S. 1–3; 255; 265, S. 2; 504, S. 13–15; 1971, P.A. 310, S. 1; 1972, P.A. 114, S. 2; P.A. 73-167, S. 1, 2; 73-224, S. 1, 2; 73-669, S. 1, 2; P.A. 74-62, S. 1, 2; 74-101, S. 1, 2; P.A. 75-56, S. 2, 3; 75-200, S. 1–4; P.A. 76-28, S. 1, 2; 76-33, S. 2, 3; P.A. 77-74, S. 2, 3; 77-614, S. 161, 163, 610; P.A. 78-121, S. 97, 98, 113; P.A. 79-75; 79-126; P.A. 80-482, S. 247, 345, 348; P.A. 81-120, S. 6–10, 13; 81-391, S. 4; P.A. 85-368, S. 1–3, 5; 85-379, S. 20, 53; P.A. 86-268, S. 2, 7; P.A. 87-9, S. 2, 3; P.A. 90-21; P.A. 91-357, S. 24, 78; P.A. 92-12, S. 37; P.A. 94-122, S. 118, 340; P.A. 95-70, S. 2, 8; P.A. 96-44, S. 3; P.A. 11-50, S. 5; P.A. 12-96, S. 22; P.A. 16-167, S. 41; P.A. 23-126, S. 18.)\n\nHistory: 1959 acts made the following changes: In Subsec.

      "heading": "(Formerly Sec. 36-98b). - Limitations on liabilities of any one obligor. Exemptions.",
      "text": "(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the total direct or indirect liabilities of any one obligor that are not fully secured, however incurred, to any Connecticut bank, exclusive of such bank's investment in the investment securities of such obligor, shall not exceed at the time incurred fifteen per cent of the capital and surplus of such bank. The total direct or indirect liabilities of any one obligor that are fully secured, however incurred, to any Connecticut bank, exclusive of such bank's investment in the investment securities of such obligor, and except as otherwise provided in subsection (l) of this section, shall not exceed at the time incurred ten per cent of the capital and surplus of such bank, provided this limitation shall be separate from and in addition to the limitation on liabilities that are not fully secured. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the limitation on the liabilities of any one obligor shall take into account the credit exposure to such obligor arising from a derivative transaction. The commissioner shall have the authority to establish the method for determining the credit exposure and the extent to which the credit exposure shall be taken into account. As used in this section, an obligor shall not include any person who is a guarantor or indemnitor of a direct or indirect liability when (1) in the case of a liability where the primary obligor is not a natural person, the bank seeks repayment of any such liability out of the operations of the business of the primary obligor, (2) the bank relies primarily on the primary obligor's general credit standing and, in the case of a liability where the primary obligor is not a natural person, the forecast of operation of the primary obligor's business, (3) there is no aspect of the loan that is being made as an exception to the bank's lending policies, and (4) such guarantor or indemnitor is not an obligor with respect to such liability pursuant to the direct benefit or common enterprise tests set forth in subsection (b) of this section. As used in this subsection, (A) “primary obligor” means a person who is named as a borrower or debtor, but not a guarantor or indemnitor, in a direct or indirect liability, (B) “guarantor” means a person who is obligated to pay a direct or indirect liability when the primary obligor has defaulted on such liability pursuant to the terms of the liability, (C) “indemnitor” means a person who becomes obligated to pay a direct or indirect liability pursuant to an indemnity agreement, and (D) “derivative transaction” includes any transaction that is a contract, agreement, swap, warrant, note or option that is based, in whole or in part, on the value of any interest in, or any quantitative measure or the occurrence of any event relating to, one or more commodities, securities, currencies, interest or other rates, indices or other assets. The commissioner may adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 establishing the method for determining credit exposure to derivative transactions and the extent to which the credit exposure shall be taken into account. For purposes of this section, a liability shall be considered to be fully secured if it is secured by readily marketable collateral, as defined in 12 CFR 32.2, at least equal to the amount of the liability. For purposes of determining the limitations of this section, in computing the liabilities of an obligor, a liability is incurred at the time of the closing of the transaction, unless such closing is preceded by a legally binding written commitment to enter into the transaction, in which case such liability is incurred at the time of commitment and is net of any liabilities of the obligor to such bank that will be paid with the proceeds of the commitment at the time of closing. The limitations provided for in this section may be exceeded for a period of time not to exceed six hours if at the closing of any transaction at which such obligor incurs such liabilities to a Connecticut bank in excess of such limitations, such bank immediately assigns or participates out to one or more other persons an amount that constitutes not less than the excess over the applicable limitation. Obligations as endorser or guarantor of negotiable or nonnegotiable installment consumer paper which carry an agreement to repurchase on default, unless the bank's sole recourse is to an agreed reserve held by it, in which case the liability shall be excluded, a full recourse endorsement or an unconditional guarantee by the person, partnership, association or corporation transferring the same, shall, except as otherwise provided in subsection (l) of this section, be subject under this section to a limitation of fifteen per cent of the bank's capital and surplus in addition to the applicable limitations of this section with respect to the makers of such obligations; provided, upon certification by an officer of the bank designated for that purpose by the governing board that the responsibility of each maker of such obligations has been evaluated and the bank is relying primarily upon each such maker for the payment of such obligations, the limitations of this section as to the obligations of each maker shall be the sole applicable loan limitation; and provided such certification shall be in writing and shall be retained as part of the records of such bank.\n\n(b) Liabilities of one obligor shall be attributed to another person and each such person shall be deemed to be an obligor when proceeds of a loan are to be used for the direct benefit of the other person, to the extent of the proceeds to be so used, or a common enterprise is deemed to exist between such persons. For purposes of this section, the proceeds of a loan to an obligor shall be deemed to be used for the direct benefit of another person and shall be attributed to the person when the proceeds, or assets purchased with the proceeds, are transferred to another person, other than in a bona fide arm's length transaction where the proceeds are used to acquire property, goods or services. For purposes of this section, a common enterprise shall be deemed to exist and liabilities of separate obligors shall be aggregated:\n\n(1) When the expected source of repayment for each liability is the same for each obligor and neither obligor has another source of income from which the liability, together with the obligor's other liabilities, may be fully repaid. An employer shall not be treated as a source of repayment under this subdivision because of wages and salaries paid to an employee, unless the standards of subdivision (2) of this subsection are met;\n\n(2) When loans are made (A) to obligors who are related directly or indirectly through common control, including where one obligor is directly or indirectly controlled by another obligor; and (B) substantial financial interdependence exists between or among the obligors. Substantial financial interdependence is deemed to exist when fifty per cent or more of one obligor's gross receipts or gross expenditures, on an annual basis, are derived from transactions with the other obligor. Gross receipts and expenditures include gross revenues, expenses, intercompany loans, dividends, capital contributions, and similar receipts or payments;\n\n(3) When separate persons borrow from a Connecticut bank to acquire a business enterprise of which such obligors will own more than fifty per cent of the voting securities or voting interests, in which case a common enterprise is deemed to exist between the obligors for purposes of combining the acquisition loans; or\n\n(4) When the commissioner determines, based upon an evaluation of the facts and circumstances of particular transactions, that a common enterprise exists.\n\n(c) Loans to an obligor and its subsidiary, or to different subsidiaries of an obligor shall not be aggregated unless either the direct benefit or the common enterprise test is met. For purposes of this subsection, a corporation or a limited liability company is a subsidiary of an obligor if the obligor owns or beneficially owns directly or indirectly more than fifty per cent of the voting securities or voting interests of the corporation or company.\n\n(d) Loans to a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or association shall be deemed to be loans to each member of the partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or association. This provision shall not apply to limited partners in limited partnerships or to members of joint ventures, limited liability companies or associations unless the partners or members, by the terms of the partnership or membership agreement, are held generally liable for the debts or actions of the partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or association, and such terms are valid under applicable law. Loans to partners or members of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or association are not attributed to the partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or association unless either the direct benefit or the common enterprise test is met. Both the direct benefit and common enterprise tests are met between a partner or member of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or association and such partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or association, when loans are made to the partner or member to purchase an interest in the partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or association. Loans to partners or members of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or association are not attributed to other members of the partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or association unless either the direct benefit or the common enterprise test is met.\n\n(e) Loans to foreign governments and their agencies and instrumentalities shall be aggregated only if the loans fail to meet either the means test or the purpose test at the time the loan is made. The means test is met if the obligor has resources or revenue of its own sufficient to service its debt obligations. If the government's support, excluding guarantees by a central government of the obligor's debt, exceeds the obligor's annual revenues from other sources, it shall be presumed that the means test has not been satisfied. The purpose test is met if the purpose of the loan is consistent with the purposes of the obligor's general business. In order to show that the means test or the purpose test has been satisfied, a Connecticut bank shall, at a minimum, retain in its files the following items:\n\n(1) A statement, accompanied by supporting documentation, describing the legal status and the degree of financial and operational autonomy of the borrowing entity;\n\n(2) Financial statements for the borrowing entity for a minimum of three years prior to the date the loan or extension of credit was made or for each year that the borrowing entity has been in existence, if less than three;\n\n(3) Financial statements for each year the loan is outstanding;\n\n(4) The bank's assessment of the obligor's means of servicing the loan, including specific reasons in support of that assessment. The assessment shall include an analysis of the obligor's financial history, its present and projected economic and financial performance, and the significance of any financial support provided to the obligor by third parties, including the obligor's central government; and\n\n(5) A loan agreement or other written statement from the obligor which clearly describes the purpose of the loan. The written representation shall ordinarily constitute sufficient evidence that the purpose test has been satisfied. However, when, at the time the funds are disbursed, the bank knows or has reason to know of other information suggesting the obligor will use the proceeds in a manner inconsistent with the written representation, it may not, without further inquiry, accept the representation.\n\n(f) Obligations of the United States or this state, or of any town, city, borough or legally established district in this state which has the power to levy taxes for the payment of such obligations, shall not be subject to any limitation based upon such capital and surplus.\n\n(g) Obligations of any one obligor, with the exception of loans secured by mortgage of real estate and insured by the Federal Housing Administrator, which are secured or covered by guaranties, or by commitments or agreements to take over or to purchase, made by the United States or the Federal Reserve Bank or by any department, bureau, board, commission or establishment of the United States, including any corporation wholly owned, directly or indirectly by the United States, which, at the time of making such guaranty or commitment or agreement to take over or purchase, is authorized by law to enter into contracts with any financing institution guaranteeing such financing institution against loss of principal and interest on loans, taxes or advances or agreeing to take over or purchase the same, shall not be subject to any limitation based upon such capital and surplus.\n\n(h) Obligations of any one obligor secured by the pledge of direct or fully guaranteed obligations of the United States, except as otherwise provided in subsection (l) of this section, shall be limited to fifty per cent of such capital and surplus; except that obligations secured by the pledge of direct or fully guaranteed obligations of the United States which will mature in not more than eighteen months shall not be subject under this section to any limitation based upon such capital and surplus, except as otherwise provided in subsection (l) of this section.\n\n(i) Any Connecticut bank may accept drafts or bills of exchange drawn upon it having not more than six months' sight to run, exclusive of days of grace, which grow out of transactions involving the importation or exportation of goods, or which grow out of transactions involving the domestic shipment of goods, provided shipping documents conveying or securing title are attached at the time of acceptance, or which are secured at the time of acceptance by a warehouse receipt or other such document conveying or securing title covering readily marketable staples. No Connecticut bank shall accept such bills to an amount equal at any time in the aggregate to more than one-half of its capital and surplus, except as otherwise provided in subsection (l) of this section; provided the commissioner may authorize any Connecticut bank to accept such bills to an amount not exceeding at any time in the aggregate one hundred per cent of its capital and surplus, except as otherwise provided in subsection (l) of this section; provided further, the aggregate of acceptances growing out of domestic transactions shall in no event exceed fifty per cent of such capital and surplus, except as otherwise provided in subsection (l) of this section.\n\n(j) The following, except as otherwise provided in subsection (l) of this section, shall not be subject under this section to any limitation based upon such capital and surplus: (1) Obligations in the form of bankers' acceptances of other banks, provided such acceptances have at the time of discount not more than six months' sight, exclusive of days of grace, and are endorsed by at least one other bank; (2) obligations resulting from the purchase of securities subject to a resale agreement; and (3) the rental obligation of a lessee of real or personal property under a lease made or held by such bank.\n\n(k) Obligations of any one obligor which are secured by a first mortgage on real estate, except as otherwise provided in subsection (l) of this section, shall be limited to fifty per cent of such capital and surplus, provided the total obligations to any one obligor to which this subsection and subsection (a) of this section apply, except as otherwise provided in subsection (l) of this section, shall not exceed fifty per cent of such capital and surplus. Loans made to manufacturing, industrial or commercial borrowers when the bank looks for repayment out of the operations of the borrowers' business, relying primarily on the borrowers' general credit standing and forecast of operation, shall not be considered to be secured by a mortgage on real estate for purposes of this subsection, even though such loan may be secured by a mortgage on real estate.\n\n(l) (1) Not later than January 1, 2024, a Connecticut bank may, provided the Connecticut bank notifies the commissioner of such election, in writing, not later than said date, elect to use equity capital and adjusted allowances for credit losses, instead of capital and surplus, for the purposes of: (A) Calculating the limitations established in subsection (a) of this section on liabilities of any one obligor; (B) calculating the limitations established in subsection (a) of this section on obligations as endorser or guarantor of negotiable or nonnegotiable installment consumer paper which carry an agreement to repurchase on default;

(B) calculating the limitations established in subsection (a) of this section on obligations as endorser or guarantor of negotiable or nonnegotiable installment consumer paper which carry an agreement to repurchase on default;

The notice of such meeting shall be given at least thirty days prior to the date of the meeting and shall be otherwise in accordance with any bylaws governing the calling of special meetings of the governing board. Statements of such vote, certified and sworn to by the president or vice president of the savings bank, shall be filed with the commissioner and the Insurance Commissioner within thirty days after the adoption thereof; and, if the commissioners find that such vote is in conformity with law, and that such savings bank has entered into a reinsurance agreement as required by subsection (c) of this section, the commissioners shall issue a joint certificate declaring such insurance department established.\n\n(c) Each insurance bank and each savings bank proposing to establish an insurance department, as one party, and The Savings Bank Life Insurance Company, as the other party, shall enter into and comply with the terms of a reinsurance agreement providing substantially as follows:\n\n(1) The company shall reinsure the mortality and morbidity risk of each life insurance policy and annuity contract issued or to be issued by such bank.\n\n(2) The company shall prepare and furnish to such bank such forms of life insurance policies and annuity contracts as may from time to time be desirable, and such forms shall be the exclusive forms used for their intended purposes by such bank.\n\n(3) The company shall prepare and furnish to such bank forms of blanks for applications for life insurance policies and annuity contracts and for proofs of loss, all forms of books of record and of account, all schedules and reports not otherwise provided for, and all other forms necessary or appropriate for the efficient conduct of the business of the insurance department of such bank, and those forms, blanks, books, schedules and reports shall be the exclusive ones used for their intended purposes by such bank.\n\n(4) The company shall, in accordance with law, and with the approval of the Insurance Commissioner, determine, prepare or procure and furnish to such bank, tables of: (A) Premium rates for all life insurance policies; (B) purchase rates for all annuities; (C) surrender charges; (D) collection fees; (E) amounts which may be loaned on life insurance policies; (F) reinsurance premiums to be charged by the company; and (G) reserves to be held under life insurance policies and annuity contracts. Such rates, charges, fees, loan amounts and reserves shall be the exclusive ones used for their intended purposes by such bank.\n\n(5) The company shall prescribe the standards of health or acceptability of applicants for insurance and annuity contracts to be issued by such bank and shall have the right to decline any class or classes of risk or reject any particular application or applications.\n\n(6) No life insurance policy or annuity contract shall be delivered or issued for delivery by such bank without the prior approval of the company.\n\n(7) Such bank shall not make any payment of any death or disability claim without the prior approval of the company unless such payment shall be made pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n(8) The company shall defend any legal or equitable action or proceeding involving or arising out of any life insurance policy or annuity contract issued by such bank, and the company in its discretion may institute and prosecute in the name of such bank any legal or equitable action or proceeding to rescind any life insurance policy or annuity contract. Such bank shall cooperate with the company in its defense, or institution and prosecution, as the case may be, of any such action or proceeding, the expense of which shall be borne by the company.\n\n(9) The company shall furnish to such bank the services of an actuary and of a medical director.\n\n(d) (1) An insurance department, after the issue of the certificate provided for in subsection (b) of this section, shall be entitled to exercise all the powers conferred, and shall be subject to all the limitations imposed by this section, and may make and issue policies upon the lives of persons and grant or sell annuities, with all the rights, powers and privileges and subject to all duties, liabilities and restrictions in respect to the conduct of the business of life insurance conferred or imposed by the general statutes relating to domestic legal reserve life insurance companies, so far as the same are applicable and except as is otherwise provided in this section, and such insurance department shall be exempt from the provisions of section 38a-41. An insurance department shall, in all respects, except as is otherwise provided in this section, be managed as savings banks are managed under the laws of this state.\n\n(2) The assets of a savings department shall be liable only for and applicable only to the payment and satisfaction of the liabilities, obligations and expenses of such department. The assets of an insurance department shall be liable only for and applicable only to the payment and satisfaction of the liabilities, obligations and expenses of such department. Every insurance policy and annuity contract issued by an insurance bank shall contain on its face the following statement: “The only assets of this bank which are liable for and applicable to the payment and satisfaction of the liabilities, obligations and expenses of the insurance department of this bank are the assets of the insurance department of this bank.” A savings department and an insurance department shall be kept distinct in matters of accounting and of investment, and no assets of either department, except as otherwise provided in this section, shall be transferred to the other. Expenses pertaining to the conduct of both departments shall be apportioned by the governing board equitably between the two departments. The business of an insurance department may be carried on in the same building as that of the savings department, or, with the approval of the Insurance Commissioner, in a different building.\n\n(3) Any savings bank may act as an agent of an insurance bank or as agent of The Savings Bank Life Insurance Company. No savings bank or employee of a savings bank may solicit, negotiate or effect coverage of savings bank life insurance unless such savings bank or employee is licensed by the Insurance Commissioner in accordance with the provisions of section 38a-769 to sell savings bank life insurance. Except as otherwise permissible under applicable law, no savings bank or employee of a savings bank may sell any other type of insurance. Any other party licensed to sell life insurance under section 38a-769 may be authorized to sell savings bank life insurance by The Savings Bank Life Insurance Company.\n\n(4) No policy or annuity contract shall be issued except upon the life of a resident of this state or of a person regularly employed therein, or of the spouse or children residing in the household of a person regularly employed within this state; but any policy or contract so issued may be continued in force by the payment of premiums notwithstanding the termination of such residence or employment.\n\n(5) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the assets of an insurance department shall be invested or loaned, in the same manner and to the same extent as the assets of Connecticut banks are permitted to be invested or loaned, but such assets shall not be invested in the surplus fund of any insurance department. The assets of an insurance department may also be loaned upon policies of insurance or annuity contracts issued by such insurance department or by another insurance department or by any legal reserve life insurance company authorized to do business in this state. Uninvested assets may be deposited with any bank, provided such bank shall have been designated as a depository by vote of a majority of all the directors, excluding any director who is an officer or director of the depository so designated.\n\n(6) (A) The surplus of any insurance department, whether created from net profits or advances, shall be maintained and held or used, so far as necessary, to meet losses occasioned by unexpectedly great mortality, depreciation in securities or other causes. Such surplus shall also be maintained and held or used for the maintenance of a stable dividend scale, and for the payment of settlement or maturity dividends or both, in such manner and in such amounts as may, from time to time, be directed by the governing board subject to the approval of the Insurance Commissioner. (B) Upon the thirty-first day of December in each year, or as soon thereafter as may be practicable, each insurance department shall ascertain the net profits earned by such insurance department during such year. After setting aside such sums as are deemed advisable for the accumulation of a surplus, each such department shall annually distribute the remainder, if any, of such net profits equitably among the holders of its policies and annuity contracts, such distribution to be made at the option of the policyholder in accordance with the terms of such policyholder's policy or annuity contract.\n\n(7) Any insurance bank may, at any time, discontinue the issuance of insurance policies and annuity contracts, if its governing board, at a meeting specially called for the purpose, has voted so to do by a two-thirds vote of the directors present at such meeting and voting. The notice of such meeting shall be given at least thirty days prior to the date thereof and shall be otherwise in accordance with any bylaws governing the calling of special meetings of the governing board. A copy of the vote to discontinue such business, certified to by the secretary of the bank and sworn to by its president or vice president and its treasurer or assistant treasurer, shall be filed with the Insurance Commissioner and with The Savings Bank Life Insurance Company within five days after the meeting at which such vote was cast. A bank which has so voted shall reinsure all of its outstanding policies and annuity contracts either in another insurance bank or in The Savings Bank Life Insurance Company, in either case upon terms and conditions which the Insurance Commissioner shall deem satisfactory to assure the carrying out of the provisions of such policies and annuity contracts. If the insurance bank's savings department is declared insolvent or acquired by a bank that is not permitted to issue savings bank life insurance, the company shall arrange to transfer all affected outstanding policies to another insurance bank or to the company with the approval of the commissioner and the Insurance Commissioner.\n\n(e) (1) No policy of life or endowment insurance issued by any insurance bank shall become forfeit or void for nonpayment of premiums after six months' premiums have been paid thereon; and, in case of default in the payment of any subsequent premium, then, without any further stipulation or act, such policy shall be binding upon such bank at the option of the insured, either (A) for the cash surrender value, which shall be equal to the reserve less a surrender charge of not more than one per cent of the face amount of the policy, and which shall be increased by the value of any dividend additions or dividends then standing to the credit of the policy, and which shall be decreased by any indebtedness; or (B) for the amount of paid-up insurance which the cash surrender value, as defined in subparagraph (A), will purchase as a net single premium for the life or endowment insurance, as the case may be, provided by the policy; or (C) for an amount of paid-up term insurance which the cash surrender value, as defined in subparagraph (A), will purchase as a net single premium, but if such cash value is greater than the net single premium for such term insurance to the original date of maturity of the policy, the excess shall be used to purchase a paid-up pure endowment maturing at the original date of maturity of the policy. If no election is made, the option contained in subparagraph (C) shall be deemed to be elected by such insured. If the policy provides for both insurance and annuity, the provisions of this subdivision shall apply only to that part of the policy providing insurance. Said provisions shall not apply to annuity or pure endowment contracts, with or without return of premiums or of premiums and interest, whether simple or compound, or to survivorship annuity contracts or survivorship insurance contracts, but each policy providing for a deferred annuity on the life of the insured alone shall, unless paid for by a single premium, provide that, in the event of the nonpayment of any premium after six months' premiums have been paid, the annuity shall automatically become converted into a paid-up annuity for such proportion of the original annuity as the period for which premiums have been paid bears to the total period for which premiums are required to be paid under the policy.\n\n(2) Policies and annuity contracts may be signed on behalf of an insurance bank by such officer or employee thereof as the governing board may, from time to time, determine.\n\n(f) Any savings bank may invest not more than five per cent of its capital and surplus in stocks, obligations or other securities of The Savings Bank Life Insurance Company. Such investment may include advances to the surplus of the company.\n\n(g) (1) The Insurance Commissioner shall, and the commissioner may, at least once every five years and whenever they deem it expedient, either alone or together, personally or by deputy or assistant, examine each insurance department. During such examination, they shall have free access to the vaults, books and papers and shall thoroughly inspect and examine the affairs of any such department in order to ascertain its condition, its transactions and its ability to fulfill its obligations and whether it has complied with all the provisions of law applicable to it. Insurance departments shall be subject to the provisions of the insurance law concerning examinations, and copies of all reports on examinations shall be forwarded by the Insurance Commissioner to the commissioner and The Savings Bank Life Insurance Company.\n\n(2) The Insurance Commissioner or such commissioner's deputy may summon the directors, officers or agents of any insurance bank and such other witnesses as the Insurance Commissioner thinks proper, and examine them relative to the affairs, transactions and conditions of the insurance department and, for such purpose, may administer oaths. Any person who, without justifiable cause, refuses to appear and testify when so required, or who obstructs the Insurance Commissioner in the performance of the Insurance Commissioner's duty, shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than one year.\n\n(3) If upon examination, any insurance department appears to the commissioner and to the Insurance Commissioner to be insolvent, or if they find its condition to be such as to render the continuance of its business hazardous to the public or to the holders of its policies or contracts, or if such insurance department appears to such commissioners to have exceeded its powers or to have failed to comply with any provision of law, such commissioners, jointly, but not separately, may apply to the Superior Court, which shall have jurisdiction in equity of such applications, for an injunction to restrain such insurance department, in whole or in part, from further proceeding with its business. The court may appoint one or more receivers to take possession of the property of the insurance department, subject to such direction as may, from time to time, be prescribed by the court without in any respect affecting the operations of the savings department of such insurance bank.\n\n(4) The Insurance Commissioner shall prepare, annually, from such reports concerning insurance departments, and submit to the Governor in the annual report of his department, a statement of the condition of each insurance department and shall make such suggestions as the Insurance Commissioner considers expedient relative to the condition of each such insurance department visited by the Insurance Commissioner and to the manner in which the same is conducted.\n\n(h) Each insurance department shall annually, on or before the first day of March, file with the Insurance Commissioner a statement showing its financial condition on the last business day of December. Such annual statement shall be in the form required by the Insurance Commissioner and shall contain such information as the Insurance Commissioner prescribes.
