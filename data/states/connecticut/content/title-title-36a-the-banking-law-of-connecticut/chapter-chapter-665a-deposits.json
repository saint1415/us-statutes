For purposes of this subsection, the depository's tier one leverage ratio and risk-based capital ratio or net worth ratio shall be determined, in accordance with applicable federal regulations and regulations adopted by the commissioner in accordance with chapter 54, based on the most recent quarterly call report, provided if, during any calendar quarter after the issuance of such report, the depository experiences a decline in its tier one leverage ratio, risk-based capital ratio or net worth ratio to a level that would require the depository to maintain a higher amount of eligible collateral under subdivision (1) or (3) of this subsection, the depository shall increase the amount of eligible collateral maintained by it to the minimum required under subdivision (1) or (3) of this subsection, as applicable, based on such lower tier one leverage ratio, risk-based capital ratio or net worth ratio and shall notify the commissioner of its actions. The commissioner may, at any time, require the depository to increase its eligible collateral to an amount greater than that required by subdivision (1) or (3) of this subsection, as applicable, up to a maximum amount of one hundred twenty per cent, if the commissioner reasonably determines that such increase is necessary for the protection of public deposits. If the commissioner determines that such increase in eligible collateral is no longer necessary for the protection of public deposits, the commissioner may allow the depository to adjust the amount downward, as the circumstances warrant, to an amount not less than the minimum amount required by subdivision (1) or (3) of this subsection, as applicable.\n\n(5) For purposes of this subsection, “formal regulatory order” means a written agreement related to enforcement, including a letter of understanding or agreement or a written order, that a supervisory agency is required to publish or publishes on its web site, but does not include any written agreement or written order under which the sole obligation of the depository is to pay a civil money penalty, fine or restitution.\n\n(b) (1) Each qualified public depository that is a bank or out-of-state bank (a) having a tier one leverage ratio of five per cent or greater and a risk-based capital ratio of ten per cent or greater, or (B) having elected to use the community bank leverage ratio framework pursuant to 12 CFR 324.12, as amended from time to time, and having a tier one leverage ratio greater than nine per cent shall transfer eligible collateral maintained under subsection (a) of this section to its own trust department, provided such trust department is located in this state unless the commissioner approves otherwise, to the trust department of another financial institution, provided such eligible collateral shall be maintained in such other financial institution's trust department located in this state unless the commissioner approves otherwise, or to a federal reserve bank or federal home loan bank. Each qualified public depository that is (i) a bank or out-of-state bank having a tier one leverage ratio of less than five per cent or a risk-based capital ratio of less than ten per cent, (ii) a bank or out-of-state bank having elected to use the community bank leverage ratio framework pursuant to 12 CFR 324.12, as amended from time to time, and having a tier one leverage ratio of nine per cent or less, or (iii) a credit union or federal credit union shall transfer eligible collateral maintained under subsection (a) of this section to the trust department of a financial institution that is not owned or controlled by the depository or by a holding company owning or controlling the depository, provided such eligible collateral shall be maintained in such other financial institution's trust department located in this state unless the commissioner approves otherwise, or to a federal reserve bank or federal home loan bank. Such transfers of eligible collateral shall be made in a manner prescribed by the commissioner. The qualified public depository shall determine and adjust the market value of such eligible collateral on a monthly basis. Without the requirement of any further action, the commissioner shall have, for the benefit of public depositors, a perfected security interest in all such eligible collateral held in such segregated trust accounts. Such security interest shall have priority over all other perfected security interests and liens. The commissioner may, at any time, require the depository to value the collateral more frequently than monthly if the commissioner reasonably determines that such valuation is necessary for the protection of public deposits. Each holder of eligible collateral shall file with the commissioner, at the end of each calendar quarter, a report with the CUSIP number, description and par value of each investment it holds as eligible collateral.\n\n(2) No qualified public depository shall maintain eligible collateral in its own trust department pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection unless such depository is authorized under law to exercise fiduciary powers in this state.\n\n(3) No financial institution shall accept a transfer of eligible collateral from a qualified public depository pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection unless such financial institution is (a) authorized under law to exercise fiduciary powers in this state, and (B) federally insured or receives approval of the commissioner. If a financial institution ceases to meet such requirements, it shall give immediate notice to the qualified public depository and the commissioner who shall thereupon instruct such institution with respect to the disposition of eligible collateral.\n\n(4) Each qualified public depository shall enter into a written trust agreement with the financial institution, federal reserve bank or federal home loan bank serving as trustee. Such agreement shall include a statement by the financial institution that such institution shall be subject to and comply with the applicable requirements of sections 36a-330 to 36a-338, inclusive.\n\n(c) The depository shall have the right to make substitutions of eligible collateral at any time without notice. The depository shall have the right to reduce the amount of eligible collateral maintained by it that is in excess of the amount required under subsection (a) of this section. The income from the assets which constitute segregated eligible collateral shall belong to the depository without restriction.\n\n(d) Any qualified public depository that ceases to be a qualified public depository or no longer wishes to be a qualified public depository shall no longer receive public deposits and shall give immediate notice to the commissioner, who shall thereupon instruct such qualified public depository of the procedures to be followed with respect to the return of public deposits and eligible collateral.\n\n(1967, P.A. 517, S. 5; P.A. 77-614, S. 156, 587, 610; P.A. 78-303, S. 85, 136; P.A. 87-9, S. 2, 3; P.A. 91-245, S. 4; P.A. 94-122, S. 158, 340; P.A. 95-155, S. 23, 29; P.A. 03-196, S. 9; P.A. 04-136, S. 34; P.A. 05-39, S. 7; P.A. 06-10, S. 5; P.A. 11-50, S. 9; P.A. 12-96, S. 37–39; P.A. 13-135, S. 14; P.A. 14-187, S. 49, 50; P.A. 16-65, S. 3; P.A. 21-138, S. 2; June Sp.
