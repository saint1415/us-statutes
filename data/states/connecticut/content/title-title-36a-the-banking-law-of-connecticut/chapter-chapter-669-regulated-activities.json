As part of an application, the commissioner may (1) in accordance with section 29-17a, conduct a state or national criminal history records check of the applicant, any control person of the applicant, the qualified individual and any branch manager, and (2) in accordance with section 36a-24b (a) require the submission of fingerprints of the applicant, any control person of the applicant, the qualified individual and any branch manager to the Federal Bureau of Investigation or other state, national or international criminal databases, and (B) investigate the financial condition of any such person and require authorization from any such person for the system and the commissioner to obtain an independent credit report from a consumer reporting agency, as described in Section 603(p) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 USC 1681a, as amended from time to time.\n\n(c) (1) If the commissioner finds, upon the filing of an application for a debt adjuster license, that: (a) The financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity and general fitness of the applicant and any control person, qualified individual and branch manager of the applicant are such as to warrant belief that the business will be operated soundly and efficiently, in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of sections 36a-655 to 36a-665, inclusive, (B) the applicant is solvent and no proceeding in bankruptcy, receivership or assignment for the benefit of creditors has been commenced against the applicant, and (C) the applicant has the bond required pursuant to section 36a-664, the commissioner may thereupon issue the applicant a debt adjuster license. If the commissioner fails to make such findings, the commissioner shall not issue a license and shall notify the applicant of the reasons for such denial. The commissioner may deny an application if the commissioner finds that the applicant or any control person, qualified individual or branch manager of the applicant has been convicted of any misdemeanor involving any aspect of the debt adjuster business, or any felony or has made a material misstatement in the application. Any denial of an application by the commissioner shall, when applicable, be subject to the provisions of section 46a-80.\n\n(2) The minimum standards for renewal of a debt adjuster license shall include the following: (a) The applicant continues to meet the minimum standards under subdivision (1) of this subsection; (B) the applicant has paid all required fees for renewal of the license; and (C) the applicant has paid any outstanding examination fees or other moneys due to the commissioner.

An application for renewal of a license shall be filed between November first and December thirty-first of the year in which the license expires. Each applicant for renewal of a debt adjuster license shall pay to the system any required fees or charges and, if not a bona fide nonprofit organization, a license fee of eight hundred dollars.\n\n(e) In accordance with section 36a-24b, the commissioner may automatically suspend any license if such person receives a deficiency on the system indicating that a required payment was Returned-ACH or returned pursuant to any other term as may be utilized by the system to indicate that payment was not accepted. After a license has been automatically suspended pursuant to this subsection, the commissioner shall (1) give the licensee notice of the automatic suspension pending proceedings for revocation or refusal to renew pursuant to section 36a-657 and an opportunity for a hearing on such action in accordance with section 36a-51, and (2) require such licensee to take or refrain from taking such action as the commissioner deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section.\n\n(f) No abatement of the license fee shall be made if the application is denied or withdrawn prior to the issuance of the license or if the license is surrendered, revoked or suspended prior to the expiration of the period for which it was issued. All fees required by subsection (d) of this section shall be nonrefundable.\n\n(g) The commissioner may deem an application for a license to engage in the business of debt adjustment abandoned if the applicant fails to respond to any request for information required under sections 36a-655 to 36a-665, inclusive, or any regulations adopted pursuant to said sections 36a-655 to 36a-665, inclusive. The commissioner shall notify the applicant on the system that if the applicant fails to submit such information not later than sixty days after the date on which such request for information was made, the application shall be deemed abandoned. In the event an application is deemed abandoned, any application filing fee paid prior to the date on which the application was filed is deemed abandoned and shall not be refunded. Abandonment of an application pursuant to this subsection shall not preclude the applicant from submitting a new application for a license under sections 36a-655 to 36a-665, inclusive.\n\n(h) Every debt adjuster license shall remain in force and effect until the license has been surrendered, revoked or suspended or has expired in accordance with the provisions of sections 36a-655 to 36a-665, inclusive. Not later than fifteen days after the date a licensee ceases to engage in the business of a debt adjuster in this state for any reason, including a business decision to terminate operations in this state, license revocation, bankruptcy or voluntary dissolution, such licensee shall surrender to the commissioner its license for each location in which such licensee has ceased to engage in such business in accordance with subsection (c) of section 36a-51.\n\n(1967, P.A. 882, S. 2; P.A. 79-160, S. 2; P.A. 94-122, S. 296, 340; P.A. 02-111, S. 41; P.A. 04-69, S. 24; P.A. 09-208, S. 24; P.A. 11-216, S. 38; P.A. 18-173, S. 63.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 79-160 made provisions applicable to bona fide nonprofit organizations rather than to persons, firms or corporations generally, replaced detailed provisions re contents of application with statement re information required by commissioner, added provisions re notification of changes in business, location, number of offices, etc. and specified that license continues in effect as long as licensee continues in debt adjustment business, deleting former Subsecs.

      "text": "(a)(1) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, no such license, and no renewal thereof, shall be granted unless the applicant has filed a surety bond with the commissioner written by a surety authorized to write such bonds in this state, provided any applicant that files applications for licenses for more than one location shall file a single bond. Except as provided in this subdivision, for every applicant, the principal amount of the bond shall be the greater of (a) forty thousand dollars, or (B) (i) twice the amount of the average daily balance of the payments received by the applicant from Connecticut debtors in connection with the applicant's debt adjustment activity during the preceding twelve months ending June thirtieth of each year, or (ii) in the case of an applicant that has acquired the business of a predecessor debt adjuster, the lesser of the amount of the predecessor's debt adjustment activity during such preceding period or one million dollars. The commissioner may require a larger bond if the commissioner determines that a licensee has engaged in a pattern of conduct resulting in bona fide consumer complaints of misconduct and that such increased bond is necessary for the protection of consumers, or may increase or decrease the amount of the bond based upon the applicant's or licensee's financial condition, business plan and the actual or estimated aggregate amount of payments and fees paid by Connecticut debtors to such applicant. To the extent not captured on a required report of condition on the system, each licensee shall submit to the commissioner, by September first of each year, in a form and manner as may be prescribed by the commissioner, a report containing information on the average daily balance of the payments received by the licensee from Connecticut debtors during the preceding twelve months ending June thirtieth of each such year.\n\n(2) If a licensee or applicant for renewal of a license establishes that such licensee or applicant is unable to comply with the bond required by subdivision (1) of this subsection, it shall file a bond for the highest principal amount it can obtain, provided such amount shall be a minimum of forty thousand dollars, and the licensee or applicant for renewal shall, in lieu of the balance of the required amount of the bond, deposit a sum equal to the amount of the bond required by subdivision (1) of this subsection, less the amount of the bond filed with the commissioner, in cash or cash equivalents, with such bank, out-of-state bank that has a branch in this state, Connecticut credit union or federal credit union as such applicant or licensee may designate and the commissioner may approve, and subject to such conditions as the commissioner deems necessary for the protection of consumers and in the public interest. No licensee or applicant shall make such deposit until the depository institution and the licensee or applicant executes a deposit agreement satisfactory to the commissioner. The deposit agreement shall pledge the amount deposited to the commissioner and provide that the depository institution shall not release any of the moneys pledged without the authorization of the commissioner. The amount deposited shall secure the same obligation as would a surety bond filed under this section and shall be held at such banks or credit unions to cover claims during the period the license remains in full force and effect and the succeeding two years after such license has been surrendered, revoked or suspended or has expired. The licensee or applicant may collect interest on such deposit in accordance with its deposit agreement. The deposits made pursuant to this section shall be deemed, by operation of law, to be held in trust for the benefit of any debtor, who may be damaged by failure of a licensee or applicant to perform any written agreements or by the wrongful conversion of funds paid to a licensee in the event of the bankruptcy of the licensee, and shall be immune from attachment by creditors or judgment creditors.\n\n(3) The form of any surety bond submitted pursuant to this section shall be approved by the Attorney General. Any surety bond filed under this section shall be conditioned upon the licensee faithfully performing any and all written agreements with debtors, truly and faithfully accounting for all funds received by the licensee in the licensee's capacity as a debt adjuster, and conducting such business consistent with the provisions of sections 36a-655 to 36a-665, inclusive. Any debtor who may be damaged by failure to perform any written agreements, or by the wrongful conversion of funds paid to a licensee, may proceed on any such surety bond against the principal or surety thereon, or both, to recover damages. The commissioner may proceed on any such surety bond against the principal or surety thereon, or both, to collect any civil penalty imposed upon the licensee pursuant to subsection (a) of section 36a-50. On and after April 1, 2019, the commissioner may also proceed on any restitution imposed pursuant to subsection (c) of section 36a-50, and any unpaid costs of examination of a license as determined pursuant to section 36a-65. The proceeds of any bond, even if commingled with other assets of the licensee, shall be deemed by operation of law to be held in trust for the benefit of such claimants against the licensee in the event of bankruptcy of the licensee and shall be immune from attachment by creditors and judgment creditors. Any bond required by this section shall be maintained during the entire period of the license granted to the applicant, and the aggregate liability under any such bond shall not exceed the principal amount of the bond or the limit of liability.\n\n(b) The surety shall have the right to cancel any bond filed under subsection (a) of this section at any time by a written notice to the licensee and the commissioner, stating the date cancellation shall take effect. If such bond is issued electronically on the system, written notice of cancellation may be provided by the surety to the principal and the commissioner through the system at least thirty days prior to the date of cancellation. Any notice of cancellation not provided through the system shall be sent by certified mail to the licensee and the commissioner at least thirty days prior to the date of cancellation. No such bond shall be cancelled unless the surety notifies the commissioner in writing not less than thirty days prior to the effective date of cancellation. After receipt of such notification from the surety, the commissioner shall give written notice to the licensee of the date such bond cancellation shall take effect. The commissioner shall automatically suspend the license on such date, unless prior to such date the licensee submits a letter of reinstatement of the bond from the surety or a new bond or the licensee has surrendered the license. After a license has been automatically suspended, the commissioner shall (1) give the licensee notice of the automatic suspension pending proceedings for revocation or refusal to renew and an opportunity for a hearing on such actions in accordance with section 36a-51, and (2) require the licensee to take or refrain from taking such action as the commissioner deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section.\n\n(c) No licensee shall use, attempt to use or make reference to, either directly or indirectly, any word or phrase which states or implies that the licensee is endorsed, sponsored, recommended or bonded by the state.\n\n(1967, P.A. 882, S. 17; P.A. 94-122, S. 302, 340; P.A. 02-111, S. 45; P.A. 04-69, S. 25; P.A. 06-35, S. 10; P.A. 09-23, S. 1; P.A. 09-208, S. 28; P.A. 11-216, S. 39; P.A. 18-173, S. 66.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 94-122 changed “he” to “the licensee”, effective January 1, 1995; Sec. 36-380 transferred to Sec. 36a-664 in 1995; P.A. 02-111 added new Subsec.

Each debt negotiation licensee shall, to the extent required by the system, timely submit to the system accurate reports of condition that shall be in such form and shall contain such information as the system may require. Failure by a licensee to submit a timely and accurate report of condition shall constitute a violation of this provision.\n\n(n) The unique identifier of any person licensed under section 36a-671 shall be clearly shown on all solicitations and advertisements, including business cards and Internet web sites, and any other documents as established by rule, regulation or order of the commissioner, and shall be clearly stated in all audio solicitations and advertisements.

Any notice of cancellation not provided through the system shall be sent by certified mail to the licensee and the commissioner at least thirty days prior to the date of cancellation.

The commissioner shall, in addition to other powers granted by said sections or by other provisions of law, receive and act on complaints, take action designed to obtain voluntary compliance with said sections or commence proceedings on the commissioner's own initiative pursuant to sections 36a-50 to 36a-53, inclusive.\n\n(b) In order to accomplish the purposes of the Connecticut Truth-in-Lending Act and the provisions of the general statutes referred to in subsection (a) of this section, the commissioner may (1) counsel persons and groups on their rights and duties under said act and provisions, (2) establish programs for the education of consumers with respect to credit and leasing practices and problems, and (3) make studies appropriate to effectuate the purposes and policies of said act and provisions and make the results available to the public.\n\n(c) The commissioner may by regulation require the maintenance of records related to consumer credit sales, loans and leases sufficient to evidence the adoption of policies calculated to produce compliance with the Connecticut Truth-in-Lending Act and the provisions of the general statutes referred to in subsection (a) of this section which shall be in addition to the record retention requirements imposed under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.\n\n(d) (1) In carrying out enforcement activities under this section, the commissioner, in cases where an annual percentage rate or finance charge was inaccurately disclosed, shall notify the creditor of such disclosure error and may require the creditor to make an adjustment to the account of the person to whom credit was extended, to assure that such person will not be required to pay a finance charge in excess of the finance charge actually disclosed or the dollar equivalent of the annual percentage rate actually disclosed, whichever is lower. For the purposes of this subsection, except where such disclosure error resulted from a wilful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, in determining whether a disclosure error has occurred and in calculating any adjustment, the commissioner shall apply the tolerances set forth in 15 USC 1607(e)(1), as amended from time to time.\n\n(2) The commissioner shall require such an adjustment when the commissioner determines that such disclosure error resulted from a clear and consistent pattern or practice of violations, from gross negligence, or from a wilful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom the credit was extended. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except where such disclosure error resulted from a wilful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, the commissioner need not require such an adjustment if the commissioner determines that such disclosure error: (a) Resulted from an error involving the disclosure of a fee or charge that would otherwise be excludable in computing the finance charge, including but not limited to, violations involving the disclosures described in 15 USC 1605(b), (c) and (d), as amended from time to time, in which event the commissioner may require such remedial action as the commissioner determines to be equitable, except that for transactions consummated after March 31, 1982, such an adjustment shall be ordered for violations of 15 USC 1605(b), as amended from time to time; (B) involved a disclosed amount which was ten per cent or less of the amount that should have been disclosed and (i) in cases where the error involved a disclosed finance charge, the annual percentage rate was disclosed correctly, and (ii) in cases where the error involved a disclosed annual percentage rate, the finance charge was disclosed correctly; in which event the commissioner may require such adjustment as the commissioner determines to be equitable; (C) involved a total failure to disclose either the annual percentage rate or the finance charge, in which event the commissioner may require such adjustment as the commissioner determines to be equitable; or (D) resulted from any other unique circumstance involving clearly technical and nonsubstantive disclosure violations that do not adversely affect information provided to the consumer and that have not misled or otherwise deceived the consumer. In the case of other such disclosure errors, the commissioner may require such an adjustment.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding subdivision (2) of this subsection, no adjustment shall be ordered: (a) If it would have a significantly adverse impact upon the safety or soundness of the creditor, but in any such case, the commissioner may require a partial adjustment in an amount which does not have such an impact except that with respect to any transaction consummated after May 18, 1981, the commissioner shall require the full adjustment, but permit the creditor to make the required adjustment in partial payments over an extended period of time which the commissioner considers to be reasonable, if the commissioner determines that a partial adjustment or making partial adjustments over an extended period is necessary to avoid causing the creditor to become undercapitalized pursuant to 12 USC 1831o, as amended from time to time, (B) if the amount of the adjustment would be less than one dollar, except that if more than one year has elapsed since the date of the violation, the commissioner may require that such amount be paid to the commissioner, or (C) except where such disclosure error resulted from a wilful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, in the case of an open-end credit plan, more than two years after the violation, or in the case of any other extension of credit, as follows: (i) With respect to creditors that have been examined by the commissioner, except in connection with violations arising from practices identified in the current examination and only in connection with transactions that are consummated after the date of the immediately preceding examination, except that where practices giving rise to violations identified in earlier examinations have not been corrected, adjustments for those violations shall be required in connection with transactions consummated after the date of the examination in which such practices were first identified; (ii) with respect to creditors that have not been examined by the commissioner, except in connection with transactions that are consummated after May 10, 1978; and (iii) in no event after the later of (I) the expiration of the life of the credit extension, or (II) two years after the agreement to extend credit was consummated.\n\n(4) In addition to the enforcement powers authorized by the provisions of this section, the commissioner may order any creditor to make an adjustment as provided in this subsection. After such an order is issued, the persons named therein may, within fourteen days after receipt of the order, file a written request for a hearing. The hearing shall be held in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54.\n\n(5) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this subsection and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commissioner may not require a creditor to make dollar adjustments for errors in any requirements under the Consumer Credit Protection Act, except with regard to the requirements of 15 USC 1666d, as amended from time to time.\n\n(6) A creditor shall not be subject to an order to make an adjustment, if within sixty days after discovering a disclosure error, whether pursuant to a final written examination report or through the creditor's own procedures, the creditor notifies the person concerned of the error and adjusts the account so as to assure that such person will not be required to pay a finance charge in excess of the finance charge actually disclosed or the dollar equivalent of the annual percentage rate actually disclosed, whichever is lower.\n\n(1969, P.A. 454, S. 22; P.A. 74-254, S. 7; P.A. 78-280, S. 6, 127; P.A. 81-158, S. 9, 10, 17; P.A. 82-18, S. 2, 4; 82-174, S. 7, 14; P.A. 88-65, S. 46; 88-230, S. 1, 12; P.A. 90-98, S. 1, 2; P.A. 93-142, S. 4, 7, 8; P.A. 94-122, S. 308, 340; P.A. 96-109, S. 15; P.A. 03-61, S. 7; P.A. 15-235, S. 10; P.A. 16-193, S. 15.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 74-254 substituted reference to chapter 54 for reference to chapter 637 in Subsec.

The prior presence of the blocked information in the credit rating agency's file on the consumer is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that he or she obtained possession of any goods, services or moneys.\n\n(d) A credit rating agency shall accept the consumer's version of the disputed information and correct the disputed item when the consumer submits to the credit rating agency documentation obtained from the source of the item in dispute or from public records confirming that the report was inaccurate or incomplete, unless the credit rating agency, in the exercise of good faith and reasonable judgment, has substantial reason based on specific, verifiable facts to doubt the authenticity of the documentation submitted and notifies the consumer in writing of that decision, explaining its reasons for unblocking the information and setting forth specific, verifiable facts on which the decision is based.\n\n(e) A credit rating agency shall delete from a credit report inquiries for credit reports based upon credit requests that the credit rating agency verifies were initiated as a result of a violation of section 53a-129a of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2003, or section 53a-129b, 53a-129c or 53a-129d.\n\n(f) The provisions of this section do not apply to: (1) A credit rating agency that acts as a reseller of credit information by assembling and merging information contained in the databases of other credit rating agencies, and that does not maintain a permanent database of credit information from which new credit reports are produced, (2) a check services or fraud prevention services company that issues reports on incidents of fraud or authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic funds transfers or similar payment methods, or (3) a demand deposit account information service company that issues reports regarding account closures due to fraud, substantial overdrafts, automated teller machine abuse or similar negative information regarding a consumer to inquiring banks or other financial institutions for use only in reviewing a consumer request for a demand deposit account at the inquiring bank or financial institution.\n\n(P.A. 03-156, S. 9; P.A. 05-288, S. 224.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 05-288 made a technical change in Subsec.

Sections 36a-695 to 36a-699, inclusive, of the Connecticut general statutes gives you the right to receive an actual copy of your credit report. You will be required to identify yourself to the credit rating agency and you may be charged a small fee. There is no fee, however, if you have been turned down for credit, employment or insurance because of information contained in a report within the preceding thirty days.\n\nINCORRECT INFORMATION\n\nIf you notify the credit rating agency that you dispute the accuracy of information, the agency must reinvestigate and modify or remove inaccurate data. The credit rating agency may not charge any fee for this investigation or for modifying or removing inaccurate data. If reinvestigation does not resolve the dispute, you may enter a statement of one hundred words or less in your file, explaining why you dispute the accuracy of your record or file. This statement or a coded version of it must be included with all reports which the credit rating agency issues on you. If the error is corrected, the credit rating agency must notify any person who requested a report on you during the previous two years for employment purposes and the previous six months for any other purpose.\n\nTIME LIMITS ON ADVERSE DATA\n\nMost kinds of information in your file may be reported for a period of seven years. If you have declared personal bankruptcy, however, that fact may be reported for ten years. After seven or ten years, the information cannot be disclosed by a credit rating agency unless you are being investigated for a credit application of fifty thousand dollars or more, for an application to purchase life insurance of fifty thousand dollars or more, or for employment at an annual salary of twenty thousand dollars or more.\n\n(c) In addition to statements required in subsection (b) of this section, each contract shall contain a complete, detailed list of services to be performed by the credit clinic and the results to be achieved by the credit clinic. A copy of the consumer's current credit report shall be attached to the contract with the adverse entries to be modified clearly marked.\n\n(d) Any contract which does not comply with the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be void and the credit clinic shall return to the consumer any payments made by the consumer to the credit clinic under the voided contract.\n\n(e) No credit clinic may charge a fee or receive any money or other valuable consideration for the performance of any service the credit clinic has agreed to perform for any consumer until the credit clinic has fully performed such service.\n\n(f) A violation of any provision of this section shall be deemed an unfair or deceptive trade practice pursuant to section 42-110b.\n\n(P.A. 87-146, S. 1; P.A. 91-357, S. 57, 78; P.A. 97-22, S. 2; P.A. 99-40.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 91-357 made a technical change in Subsec.

Such credit rating agency shall place a security freeze on a consumer's credit report as soon as practicable, but not later than five business days after receipt of such request. Not later than ten business days after placing a security freeze on a consumer's credit report, such credit rating agency shall send a written confirmation of such security freeze to such consumer that provides the consumer with a unique personal identification number or password to be used by the consumer when providing authorization for the release of such consumer's report to a third party or for a period of time. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to require a consumer reporting agency to provide to a minor child or the parent or legal guardian of a minor child, on behalf of the minor child, a unique personal identification number, password or similar device to be used to authorize the consumer reporting agency to release such minor child's credit report.\n\n(b) In the event such consumer, other than a minor child or the parent or legal guardian of a minor child, wishes to authorize the disclosure of such consumer's credit report to a third party, or for a period of time, while such security freeze is in effect, such consumer shall contact such credit rating agency and provide: (1) Proper identification, (2) the unique personal identification number or password described in subsection (a) of this section, and (3) proper information regarding the third party who is to receive the credit report or the time period for which the credit report shall be available. Any credit rating agency that receives a request from a consumer pursuant to this section shall lift such security freeze not later than three business days after receipt of such request.\n\n(c) Except for the temporary lifting of a security freeze as provided in subsection (b) of this section, any security freeze authorized pursuant to the provisions of this section shall remain in effect until such time as such consumer requests such security freeze to be removed. A credit rating agency shall remove such security freeze as soon as practicable, but not later than three business days after receipt of such request provided such consumer provides proper identification to such credit rating agency and the unique personal identification number or password described in subsection (a) of this section at the time of such request for removal of the security freeze. In the case of a minor child, the credit rating agency shall remove such security freeze not later than fifteen business days after receipt of such request, provided the minor child or the parent or legal guardian of the minor child uses the unique personal identification number, password or similar device provided under subsection (a) of this section at the time of such request, if applicable.\n\n(d) Any credit rating agency may develop procedures to receive and process such request from a consumer to temporarily lift or remove a security freeze on a credit report pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Such procedures, at a minimum, shall include, but not be limited to, the ability of a consumer to send such temporary lift or removal request by electronic means, letter or facsimile.\n\n(e) In the event that a third party requests access to a consumer's credit report that has such a security freeze in place and such third party request is made in connection with an application for credit or any other use and such consumer has not authorized the disclosure of such consumer's credit report to such third party, such third party may deem such credit application as incomplete.\n\n(f) Any credit rating agency may refuse to implement or may remove such security freeze if such agency believes, in good faith, that: (1) The request for a security freeze was made as part of a fraud that the consumer participated in, had knowledge of, or that can be demonstrated by circumstantial evidence, or (2) the consumer credit report was frozen due to a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer. In the event any such credit rating agency refuses to implement or removes a security freeze pursuant to this subsection, such credit rating agency shall promptly notify such consumer in writing of such refusal not later than five business days after such refusal or, in the case of a removal of a security freeze, prior to removing the freeze on the consumer's credit report.\n\n(g) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit disclosure of a consumer's credit report to: (1) A person, or the person's subsidiary, affiliate, agent or assignee with which the consumer has or, prior to assignment, had an account, contract or debtor-creditor relationship for the purpose of reviewing the account or collecting the financial obligation owing for the account, contract or debt; (2) a subsidiary, affiliate, agent, assignee or prospective assignee of a person to whom access has been granted under subsection (b) of this section for the purpose of facilitating the extension of credit or other permissible use; (3) any person acting pursuant to a court order, warrant or subpoena; (4) any person for the purpose of using such credit information to prescreen as provided by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act; (5) any person for the sole purpose of providing a credit file monitoring subscription service to which the consumer has subscribed; (6) a credit rating agency for the sole purpose of providing a consumer with a copy of his or her credit report upon the consumer's request; or (7) a federal, state or local governmental entity, including a law enforcement agency, or court, or their agents or assignees pursuant to their statutory or regulatory duties. For purposes of this subsection, “reviewing the account” includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases and account upgrades and enhancements.\n\n(h) The following persons shall not be required to place a security freeze on a consumer's credit report, provided such persons shall be subject to any security freeze placed on a credit report by another credit rating agency: (1) A check services or fraud prevention services company that reports on incidents of fraud or issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers or similar methods of payment; (2) a deposit account information service company that issues reports regarding account closures due to fraud, substantial overdrafts, automated teller machine abuse, or similar information regarding a consumer to inquiring banks or other financial institutions for use only in reviewing a consumer request for a deposit account at the inquiring bank or financial institution; or (3) a credit rating agency that: (a) Acts only to resell credit information by assembling and merging information contained in a database of one or more credit reporting agencies; and (B) does not maintain a permanent database of credit information from which new credit reports are produced.\n\n(i) (1) A credit rating agency shall not (a) charge a fee to a consumer for a security freeze, removal of such freeze, temporary lift of such freeze for a period of time or a temporary lift of such freeze for a specific party, or (B) require as a condition for placing a security freeze that a consumer enter into an agreement that limits any claim the consumer may have against such credit rating agency.\n\n(2) No credit rating agency shall charge a fee to a consumer for a personal identification number.\n\n(j) The parent or legal guardian of a minor child may place a security freeze on the credit report of a minor child by submitting a written request to the credit rating agency in the manner described in this section and subject to the same conditions and by providing the credit rating agency with proper identification and sufficient proof of authority to act on behalf of the minor child. The credit rating agency shall place the security freeze on the credit report of a minor child as soon as practicable, but not later than five business days after receipt of such request. If the credit rating agency does not have any information in its files pertaining to the minor child at the time the credit rating agency receives a request pursuant to this subsection, the credit rating agency shall create a record for the minor child and place a security freeze on such record. Such record shall consist of a compilation of information created by a credit rating agency that identifies a minor child. A credit rating agency shall not create or use such record to consider the minor child's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics or mode of living. A credit rating agency shall not release a minor child's credit report, any information derived from a minor child's credit report or any record created for a minor child.\n\n(k) The parent or legal guardian of a minor child may request the removal of a security freeze placed on the credit report or record of a minor child by submitting a written request to the credit rating agency in the manner described in this section and subject to the same conditions and by providing the credit rating agency with proper identification and sufficient proof of authority to act on behalf of the minor child. The credit rating agency shall remove the security freeze on the credit report or record of a minor child not later than fifteen business days after receipt of such request.\n\n(l) An insurer, as defined in section 38a-1, may deny an application for insurance if an applicant has placed a security freeze on such applicant's credit report and fails to authorize the disclosure of such applicant's credit report to such insurer pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(m) Any security freeze in a credit report in effect as of October 1, 2016, shall continue to be in effect until the consumer or the parent or legal guardian of a minor child requests the removal of the security freeze.\n\n(P.A. 05-148, S. 2; 05-288, S. 230; P.A. 15-53, S. 9; 15-62, S. 2; P.A. 16-65, S. 56; P.A. 18-90, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 05-148 effective January 1, 2006; P.A. 05-288 made a technical change in Subsec.

      "text": "(a)Duration.(1) No mortgage lender shall commit to a first mortgage loan applicant or the applicant's representative that the lender will make the loan at a specified rate if the loan is closed by the expiration of a specified period of time except by issuing a mortgage rate lock-in, and the period for which the terms are locked in is at least as long as the mortgage lender's good faith estimate of the anticipated time from when the mortgage loan application is submitted to the lender to the time when such lender will be ready to close such loan, taking into consideration current market conditions and the processing requirements for the type of first mortgage loan in question. (2) In the event a mortgage rate lock-in is issued after the mortgage loan application is submitted to the lender, the minimum period for which the terms may be locked in shall be the period determined in accordance with subdivision (1) of this subsection, less the number of days elapsed since the application was submitted to the lender.\n\n(b)Closing required in accordance with lock-in. Exceptions.Any first mortgage loan application for which a mortgage rate lock-in has been issued shall, unless it is denied in accordance with the mortgage lender's standards of creditworthiness, be closed at the terms specified in the mortgage rate lock-in regardless of whether the specified lock-in date has expired, unless the failure to close the first mortgage loan is the result of the following: (1) The applicant has failed to provide information or documentation required by the lender in a timely manner; (2) the applicant or the applicant's attorney has failed to close the first mortgage loan on or before the date specified by the mortgage lender; (3) the applicant has failed to produce, at or before the closing, all of the documentation specified by the mortgage loan commitment as being required for closing; or (4) the applicant has provided or omitted any information, in the application or subsequently, which upon verification proves to be significantly inaccurate causing the need for review or further investigation by the lender. Information is significantly inaccurate if the information as verified would cause the applicant to be disqualified for the type of first mortgage loan for which the applicant has applied or would cause the secondary market source for which the first mortgage loan is being originated to refuse to purchase the loan.\n\n(c)Refund of fees.In any case where a first mortgage loan has not been closed, and the application has not been rejected in accordance with the mortgage lender's standards of creditworthiness, ninety days after the filing of an application for a first mortgage loan with an initial loan to value ratio of eighty per cent or less or one hundred twenty days after filing an application for a first mortgage loan with an initial loan to value ratio of more than eighty per cent, or a first mortgage loan to be insured or guaranteed by any agency of the federal government, or any state or municipal government, or any quasi-governmental agency, whether or not there has been a mortgage rate lock-in, the applicant shall be entitled upon written request, which shall be made not later than thirty days after the expiration of the ninety or one-hundred-twenty-day period, as applicable, to a full refund of all funds paid to the mortgage lender unless the failure to close was caused by the applicant for one of the reasons set forth in subdivisions (1) to (4), inclusive, of subsection (b) of this section or the applicant has requested a closing date which is later than ninety days after application for a first mortgage loan with an initial loan to value ratio of eighty per cent or less or one hundred twenty days for a first mortgage loan with an initial loan to value ratio of more than eighty per cent or which is to be insured or guaranteed by any agency of the federal government, or any state or municipal government, or any quasi-governmental agency.\n\n(d)Mortgage rate lock-in generally. Information requested by lender.For the purposes of subsections (b) and (c) of this section:\n\n(1) An applicant shall be deemed to have provided information or documentation in a timely manner if such information or documentation is delivered to the mortgage lender or a representative of the mortgage lender not later than seven calendar days after it is requested.\n\n(2) If a written first mortgage loan commitment issued by a mortgage lender contains any conditions to be satisfied by the applicant, the mortgage lender shall specify a closing date no sooner than seven calendar days after the issuance of such commitment unless an earlier date is requested by the applicant.\n\n(3) Any new information or documentation requested by the mortgage lender within seven calendar days before the expiration of any rate lock-in period shall serve to extend the rate lock-in period by seven calendar days from the date of such request. Information or documentation is not new if the request is made necessary by inaccuracies in or omissions from previously provided information, by changes in the information previously provided by the applicant, or questions raised as the result of appraisals, pest inspections, water or sewer tests, engineering reports or reports of a similar nature.\n\n(4) If an applicant chooses to change the type or amount of a first mortgage loan for which application is made, or does not qualify for a particular type or amount of first mortgage loan and chooses to apply for another, any mortgage rate lock-in shall be void and any subsequent rate lock-in shall be evidenced by a new mortgage rate lock-in and the application shall be considered a new application for the purposes of sections 36a-705 to 36a-707, inclusive.\n\n(5) A mortgage rate lock-in shall not be binding on the mortgage lender in connection with the application for any first mortgage loan which is to be insured or guaranteed by any agency of the federal government or any state or municipal government or quasi-governmental agency in the event the loan program for which the applicant has applied becomes unavailable subsequent to filing an application because of actions taken by that governmental agency. In such cases the applicant shall be entitled to a refund of all funds paid by the applicant which have not actually been expended by the mortgage lender.\n\n(6) If the mortgage lender requires that the closing of the first mortgage loan be conducted by a particular attorney or law firm, and that attorney or law firm is not available to conduct the closing before a first mortgage loan commitment period or rate lock-in period expires, the mortgage lender shall extend the first mortgage loan commitment or rate lock-in period until the designated attorney is available to conduct the closing.\n\n(P.A. 87-73, S. 2; P.A. 88-364, S. 54, 123; P.A. 04-105, S. 2.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 88-364 made a technical change; Sec. 36-442a transferred to Sec. 36a-706 in 1995; P.A. 04-105 amended Subsec.

The mortgage servicer shall not charge or collect interest on such shortage during the one-year period.\n\n(d) Whenever a mortgage servicer licensee receives funds from a mortgagor to be held in escrow for the payment of taxes and insurance, the mortgage servicer licensee shall deposit or invest such funds in one or more segregated deposit or trust accounts maintained at a federally insured bank, Connecticut credit union, federal credit union or out-of-state bank, which account or accounts shall be reconciled monthly. Such reconciliation may be evidenced by a monthly account statement or statements furnished by the depository institution, provided (1) such account or accounts shall be maintained with the depository institution in a manner that reasonably reflects the fact that the funds held therein are being maintained for escrow purposes, (2) such funds shall not be commingled with funds belonging to the mortgage servicer licensee and may not be used to pay business operating expenses of the mortgage servicer licensee, and (3) the mortgage servicer licensee shall adopt, implement and maintain internal accounting controls that are reasonably designed to ensure compliance with this section.

If the commissioner fails to make such findings, the commissioner shall not issue a license, and shall notify the applicant of the denial and the reasons for such denial. The commissioner may waive the requirements of subdivision (1) of this subsection relating to the supervision and experience of (A) a qualified individual where the applicant establishes to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the applicant (i) will not conduct any activity subject to licensure under sections 36a-715 to 36a-719l, inclusive, at the main office, and (ii) has designated a qualified individual who is responsible for the actions of the applicant; and (B) a qualified individual or a branch manager where the applicant establishes to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the applicant (i) holds only mortgage servicing rights at the main office or branch office and conducts no other activity at such office, and (ii) has designated a qualified individual or branch manager at such main office or branch office who is responsible for the actions of the application. No person licensed as a mortgage servicer and granted a waiver by the commissioner shall engage in any activity that would have precluded the issuance of such waiver without first designating a qualified individual or branch manager, as the case may be, who meets all applicable requirements of subdivision (1) of this subsection and is approved by the commissioner. For purposes of this subsection, the level of offense of the crime and the status of any conviction, pardon or expungement shall be determined by reference to the law of the jurisdiction where the case was prosecuted. In the event such jurisdiction does not use the term “felony”, “pardon” or “expungement”, such terms shall include legally equivalent events. For purposes of subdivision (1) of this subsection, “experience in the mortgage servicing business” means paid experience in the (I) servicing of mortgage loans, (II) accounting, receipt and processing of payments on behalf of mortgagees or creditors, or (III) supervision of such activities, or any other relevant experience as determined by the commissioner.\n\n(b) An application for a license as a mortgage servicer or renewal of such license shall be made and processed on the system pursuant to section 36a-24b in a form prescribed by the commissioner and accompanied by the fees required by section 36a-719b.

The applicant shall, at a minimum, furnish to the system information concerning the identity of the applicant, any control person of the applicant, the qualified individual and any branch manager, including personal history and experience in a form prescribed by the system and information related to any administrative, civil or criminal findings by any governmental jurisdiction. For the purpose of this subsection, evidence of experience of the qualified individual and any branch manager shall include: (1) A statement specifying the duties and responsibilities of such person's employment, the term of employment, including month and year, and the name, address and telephone number of a supervisor, employer or, if self-employed, a business reference; and (2) if required by the commissioner, copies of W-2 forms, 1099 tax forms or, if self-employed, 1120 corporate tax returns, signed letters from the employer on the employer's letterhead verifying such person's duties and responsibilities and term of employment including month and year, and, if such person is unable to provide such letters, other proof satisfactory to the commissioner that such person meets the experience requirement. As part of an application, the commissioner may (A) in accordance with section 29-17a, conduct a state or national criminal history records check of the applicant, any control person of the applicant, the qualified individual and any branch manager, and (B) in accordance with section 36a-24b (i) require the submission of fingerprints of the applicant, any control person of the applicant, the qualified individual and any branch manager to the Federal Bureau of Investigation or other state, national or international criminal databases, and (ii) investigate the financial condition of any such person and require authorization from any such person for the system and the commissioner to obtain an independent credit report from a consumer reporting agency, as described in Section 603(p) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 USC 1681a, as amended from time to time.\n\n(c) (1) The minimum standards for license renewal for a mortgage servicer shall include the following: (A) The applicant continues to meet the minimum standards under subsection (a) of this section; (B) the mortgage servicer has paid all required fees for renewal of the license; and (C) the applicant has paid any outstanding examination fees or other moneys due to the commissioner.\n\n(2) The license of a mortgage servicer failing to satisfy the minimum standards for license renewal shall expire. The commissioner may adopt procedures for the reinstatement of expired licenses consistent with the standards established by the system. The commissioner may automatically suspend a mortgage servicer license if the licensee receives a deficiency on the system indicating that the payment required by section 36a-719b was Returned-ACH or returned pursuant to such other term as may be utilized by the system to indicate that the payment was not accepted. After a license has been automatically suspended pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall (A) give the licensee notice of the automatic suspension, pending proceedings for revocation or refusal to renew pursuant to section 36a-719j and an opportunity for a hearing on such action in accordance with section 36a-51, and (B) require such licensee to take or refrain from taking such action as the commissioner deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section.\n\n(d) The commissioner may deem an application for a license under this section abandoned if the applicant fails to respond to any request for information required under sections 36a-715 to 36a-719l, inclusive, or the regulations adopted pursuant to said sections. The commissioner shall notify the applicant on the system that if such information is not submitted not later than sixty days from the date of such request, the application shall be deemed abandoned. An application filing fee paid prior to the date an application is deemed abandoned pursuant to this subsection shall not be refunded. Abandonment of an application pursuant to this subsection shall not preclude the applicant from submitting a new application for a license.\n\n(e) As part of its application and upon a change to such information, a mortgage servicer shall file with the commissioner a current schedule of the ranges of costs and fees it charges mortgagors for its servicing-related activities.\n\n(f) Any person making any filing or submission of any information on the system shall do so in accordance with the procedures and requirements of the system and shall pay the applicable fees or charges to the system. Each mortgage servicer licensee shall, to the extent required by the system, timely submit to the system accurate reports of condition that shall be in such form and shall contain such information as the system may require. Failure by a licensee to submit a timely and accurate report of condition shall constitute a violation of this provision. At least annually, a licensee shall file with the commissioner a report in a form and format acceptable to the commissioner detailing the mortgage servicer's activities in the state, including (1) the number of residential mortgage loans the mortgage servicer is servicing, (2) the type and characteristics of the residential mortgage loans in this state, (3) the number of serviced residential mortgage loans in default, along with a breakdown of thirty-day, sixty-day and ninety-day delinquencies, (4) information on loss mitigation activities, and (5) information on foreclosures commenced in this state.\n\n(g) The unique identifier of any person licensed under this section shall be clearly shown on all solicitations and advertisements, including business cards and Internet web sites, and any other documents as established by rule, regulation or order of the commissioner, and shall be clearly stated in all audio solicitations and advertisements. The solicitations and advertisements of any person licensed under this section: (1) Shall not include any statement that such person is endorsed in any way by this state, except that such solicitations and advertisements may include a statement that such person is licensed in this state; (2) shall not include any statement or claim that is deceptive, false or misleading; (3) shall otherwise conform to the requirements of sections 36a-715 to 36a-719l, inclusive, any regulations issued thereunder and any other applicable law; and (4) shall be retained for two years from the date of use of such solicitation or advertisement.\n\n(P.A. 14-89, S. 5; P.A. 17-38, S. 15, 17-233, S. 26; P.A. 18-173, S. 72; P.A. 23-126, S. 11.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 17-38 amended Subsec.

      "text": "(a) Each mortgage servicer applicant or licensee and any person exempt from mortgage servicer licensure pursuant to subdivision (4) of subsection (b) of section 36a-718 shall file with the commissioner (1) a surety bond, written by a surety authorized to write such bonds in this state, covering its main office and any branch office from which it acts as mortgage servicer, in a penal sum of one hundred thousand dollars per office location in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, (2) a fidelity bond, written by a surety authorized to write such bonds in this state, in accordance with the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, and (3) evidence of errors and omissions coverage, written by a surety authorized to write such coverage in this state, in accordance with the requirements of subsection (c) of this section. No mortgage servicer licensee and no person otherwise exempt from mortgage servicer licensure pursuant to subdivision (4) of subsection (b) of section 36a-718 shall act as a mortgage servicer in this state without maintaining the surety bond, fidelity bond and errors and omissions coverage required by this section.\n\n(b) The surety bond required by subsection (a) of this section shall be (1) in a form approved by the Attorney General; and (2) conditioned upon the mortgage servicer licensee or person exempt from mortgage servicer licensure pursuant to subdivision (4) of subsection (b) of section 36a-718 faithfully performing any and all written agreements or commitments with or for the benefit of mortgagors and mortgagees, truly and faithfully accounting for all funds received from a mortgagor or mortgagee in such person's capacity as a mortgage servicer, and conducting such mortgage business consistent with the provisions of sections 36a-715 to 36a-719l, inclusive. Any mortgagor that may be damaged by the failure of a mortgage servicer licensee or person exempt from mortgage servicer licensure pursuant to subdivision (4) of subsection (b) of section 36a-718 to perform any written agreements or commitments, or by the wrongful conversion of funds paid by a mortgagor to such licensee or person, may proceed on such bond against the principal or surety thereon, or both, to recover damages. The commissioner may proceed on such bond against the principal or surety on such bond, or both, to collect any civil penalty imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of section 36a-50, any restitution imposed pursuant to subsection (c) of section 36a-50 and any unpaid costs of examination of a licensee as determined pursuant to section 36a-65. The proceeds of the bond, even if commingled with other assets of the principal, shall be deemed by operation of law to be held in trust for the benefit of such claimants against the principal in the event of bankruptcy of the principal and shall be immune from attachment by creditors and judgment creditors. The surety bond shall run concurrently with the period of the license for the main office of the mortgage servicer or mortgage lender and the aggregate liability under the bond shall not exceed the penal sum of the bond. The principal shall notify the commissioner of the commencement of an action on the bond. When an action is commenced on a principal's bond, the commissioner may require the filing of a new bond and immediately on recovery on any action on the bond, the principal shall file a new bond.\n\n(c) The fidelity bond and errors and omissions coverage required by subsection (a) of this section shall name the commissioner as an additional loss payee on drafts the surety issues to pay for covered losses directly or indirectly incurred by mortgagors of residential mortgage loans serviced by the mortgage servicer. The fidelity bond shall cover losses arising from dishonest and fraudulent acts, embezzlement, misplacement, forgery and similar events committed by employees of the mortgage servicer. The errors and omissions coverage shall cover losses arising from negligence, errors and omissions by the mortgage servicer with respect to the payment of real estate taxes and special assessments, hazard and flood insurance or the maintenance of mortgage and guaranty insurance. The fidelity bond and errors and omissions coverage shall each be in the following principal amounts based on the mortgage servicer's volume of servicing activity most recently reported to the commissioner:\n\n(1) If the amount of the residential mortgage loans serviced is one hundred million dollars or less, the principal amount shall be at least three hundred thousand dollars; or\n\n(2) If the amount of such loans exceeds one hundred million dollars, the principal amount shall be at least three hundred thousand dollars plus (a) three-twentieths of one per cent of the amount of residential mortgage loans serviced greater than one hundred million dollars but less than or equal to five hundred million dollars; (B) plus one-eighth of one per cent of the amount of residential mortgage loans serviced greater than five hundred million dollars but less than or equal to one billion dollars; and (C) plus one-tenth of one per cent of the amount of residential mortgage loans serviced greater than one billion dollars.\n\nThe fidelity bond and errors and omissions coverage may provide for a deductible amount not to exceed the greater of one hundred thousand dollars or five per cent of the face amount of such bond or coverage.\n\n(d) A surety shall have the right to cancel the surety bond, fidelity bond and errors and omissions coverage required by this section at any time by a written notice to the principal and the commissioner stating the date cancellation shall take effect. If the surety bond required by this section was issued electronically on the system, written notice of cancellation may be provided by the surety company to the principal and the commissioner through the system at least thirty days prior to the date of cancellation. Any notice of cancellation not provided through the system shall be sent by certified mail to the principal and the commissioner at least thirty days prior to the date of cancellation. A surety bond, fidelity bond or errors and omissions coverage shall not be cancelled unless the surety notifies the commissioner, in writing, not less than thirty days prior to the effective date of cancellation. After receipt of such notification from the surety, the commissioner shall give written notice to the principal of the date such cancellation shall take effect. The commissioner shall automatically suspend the license of a mortgage servicer on such date or on any date when a fidelity bond or errors and omissions coverage expires or is no longer in effect. No automatic suspension or inactivation shall occur if, prior to the date that such bond or errors and omissions coverage cancellation or expiration shall take effect, (1) the principal submits a letter of reinstatement of the bond or errors and omissions coverage, or a new bond or errors and omissions policy; or (2) the mortgage servicer licensee has ceased business in this state and has surrendered all licenses in accordance with section 36a-51 and section 36a-719a. After a mortgage servicer license has been automatically suspended pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall (a) give the licensee notice of the automatic suspension, pending proceedings for revocation or refusal to renew pursuant to section 36a-719j and an opportunity for a hearing on such action in accordance with section 36a-51, and (B) require such licensee to take or refrain from taking such action as the commissioner deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section. A person licensed as a mortgage lender in this state acting as a mortgage servicer from a location licensed as a main office or branch office under sections 36a-485 to 36a-498e, inclusive, 36a-534a and 36a-534b shall cease to be exempt from mortgage servicer licensing requirements in this state upon cancellation or expiration of any surety bond, fidelity bond or errors and omissions coverage required by this section.\n\n(e) If the commissioner finds that the financial condition of a mortgage servicer or mortgage lender licensee so requires, as evidenced by the reduction of tangible net worth, financial losses or potential losses as a result of a violation of sections 36a-715 to 36a-719k, inclusive, the commissioner may require one or more additional bonds meeting the standards set forth in this section. The licensee shall file any such additional bonds not later than ten days after receipt of the commissioner's written notice of such requirement. A mortgage servicer or mortgage lender licensee shall file, as the commissioner may require, any bond rider or endorsement or addendum, as applicable, to any bond or evidence of errors and omissions coverage on file with the commissioner to reflect any changes necessary to maintain the surety bond, fidelity bond and errors and omissions coverage required by this section.\n\n(P.A. 14-89, S. 8; P.A. 15-53, S. 2; P.A. 18-173, S. 74.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 15-53 amended Subsec. (c) by adding “at least” re principal amount of bond and replacing “principal amount” with “face amount of such bond or coverage”, effective June 19, 2015; P.A. 18-173 amended Subsec.

A lender or mortgage broker shall not take any action that recommends or encourages a default on an existing mortgage or other debt prior to and in connection with the closing or planned closing of a new nonprime home loan that refinances all or any portion of the existing loan or debt.\n\n(c) A lender may not finance, directly or indirectly in connection with a mortgage, any credit life, credit disability, credit unemployment or credit property insurance, or any other life or health insurance or any payments directly or indirectly for any debt cancellation or suspension agreement or contract, except that insurance premiums or debt cancellation or suspension fees calculated and paid on a monthly basis or through regularly scheduled periodic payments shall not be considered financed by the lender for the purposes of this subsection.\n\n(d) If all defaults in connection with a nonprime home loan are cured after the initiation of any action to foreclose, but prior to the entry of judgment, the lender shall take steps as necessary to terminate the foreclosure proceeding or other action. The lender may require that the borrower pay any reasonable costs actually incurred by the lender in connection with the default and protecting its rights in the property, including any costs related to collection, foreclosure and termination of the proceeding or other action. Cure of default reinstates the borrower to the same position as if the default had not occurred and nullifies, as of the date of the cure, any acceleration of any obligation under the security instrument or note arising from the default. The borrower's right to reinstatement, as described in this subsection, may not be exercised by the borrower on more than two occasions over the course of twenty-four consecutive months.\n\n(P.A. 08-176, S. 28.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 08-176 effective July 1, 2008.",

Subject to the provisions of section 36a-690, the amount of such rebate on a retail installment contract other than any such contract for the sale of a commercial vehicle, shall represent at least as great a proportion of the total finance charge less an acquisition cost or minimum finance charge of fifteen dollars, as the sum of the periodical time balances, after the date of prepayment, bears to the sum of all the periodical time balances under the schedule of payments in the original retail installment contract.

      "text": "(a)Repossession.When the retail buyer is in default in the payment of any sum due under the retail installment contract or installment loan contract, or in the performance of any other condition that such contract requires the retail buyer to perform, or in the performance of any promise, the breach of which is by such contract expressly made a ground for the retaking of the goods, the holder of the contract may retake possession of such goods, provided the filing of a petition in bankruptcy under 11 USC Chapter 7 by a retail buyer of a motor vehicle, or such retail buyer's status as a debtor in bankruptcy, shall not be considered a default of a retail installment contract or ground for repossession of such motor vehicle. Unless the goods can be retaken without breach of the peace, the goods shall be retaken by legal process, provided nothing contained in this section shall be construed to authorize a violation of the criminal law. In the case of repossession of any motor vehicle without the knowledge of the retail buyer, the local police department shall be notified of such repossession not later than two hours after repossession. In the absence of a local police department or if the local police department cannot be reached for notification, the state police shall be promptly notified of such repossession.\n\n(b)Notice of intention to repossess.Not less than ten days prior to the retaking, the holder of such contract may serve upon the retail buyer, personally or by registered or certified mail, a notice of intention to retake the goods on account of the retail buyer's default. The notice shall state that the retail buyer is in default and the period at the end of which such goods will be retaken, and designate (1) the obligations required to be performed in order to cure the default, including the dollar amount of any required payment, and (2) the date by which such obligations must be performed. The notice shall briefly and clearly state the retail buyer's rights under this subsection in the event such goods are retaken. In the case of repossession of any motor vehicle, the notice shall inform the retail buyer that he or she is responsible for removing all of his or her personal property from the motor vehicle prior to the date such repossession can take place. If the notice is so served and the retail buyer does not perform the conditions and provisions required under the contract to cure the default before the day set for retaking, the holder of the contract may retake such goods and hold such goods subject to the provisions of subsections (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) of this section regarding resale, but without any right of redemption.\n\n(c)Redemption.If the holder of such contract does not give the notice of intention to retake, described in subsection (b) of this section, the holder shall retain such goods for fifteen days after the retaking within the state in which such goods were located when retaken. During such period the retail buyer, upon payment or tender of the unaccelerated amount due under such contract at the time of retaking and interest, or upon performance or tender of performance of such other condition as may be named in such contract as precedent to the retail buyer's continued possession of such goods, or upon performance or tender of performance of any other promise for the breach of which such goods were retaken, and upon payment of the actual and reasonable expenses of any retaking and storing, may redeem such goods and become entitled to take possession of such goods and to continue in the performance of such contract as if no default had occurred. The holder of such contract shall, not later than three days after the date of the retaking, furnish or mail, by registered or certified mail, to the last-known address of the retail buyer, a written statement indicating (1) the unaccelerated sum due under such contract and the actual and reasonable expense of any retaking and storing, and (2) in the case of repossession of any motor vehicle, the holder of such contract shall also, not later than three days after the date of the retaking, and without regard to whether notice of intention to retake was given to the buyer, send a written notice (a) that the buyer is responsible for retrieving items of personal property that may have been left in the motor vehicle, other than items that may have been turned over to law enforcement, (B) that such property, if any, will be available for retrieval for at least sixty days after the date on which the motor vehicle was repossessed, unless the holder of the contract specifies, or the terms of the contract specify a date at least sixty days after the repossession after which the buyer may no longer retrieve the property, and (C) the contact and business hours information that the buyer can use to make arrangements for retrieval of the property. If the buyer retrieves some or all of the personal property more than fifteen days after the date on which the motor vehicle was repossessed, the holder of the contract, or an agent thereof maintaining custody of the personal property, may charge the buyer a reasonable storage fee not to exceed twenty-five dollars. Failure to furnish or mail such statement as required by this section shall result in forfeiture of the holder's right to claim payment for the actual and reasonable expenses of retaking and storage, and the holder shall be liable for the actual damages suffered because of such failure. If such goods are perishable so that retention for fifteen days under this subsection would result in their destruction or substantial injury, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply and the holder of the contract may resell the goods immediately upon such retaking.\n\n(d)Compulsory resale.If the retail buyer does not redeem such goods within fifteen days after the holder of the contract has retaken possession, the holder of the contract shall sell such goods at public or private sale not less than fifteen days and not more than one hundred eighty days after the retaking. When the holder of the contract retakes possession by legal process, and an answer is interposed, the holder of the contract may, at the holder's election, hold such retaken goods for a period not to exceed thirty days after the entry of final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction entitling the holder of the contract to possession of such goods before holding such resale. The holder of the contract shall give the retail buyer not less than ten days' written notice of the time and place of any public sale, or the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition is to be made, either personally or by registered mail or by certified mail, return receipt requested, directed to the retail buyer at such retail buyer's last-known place of business or residence. The holder of the contract may bid for such goods at any public sale. The proceeds of the resale shall be considered to be either the amount paid for such goods at such sale or the fair cash retail market value of such goods at the time of repossession, whichever is the greater, except as otherwise provided in subsection (g) of this section.\n\n(e)Proceeds of resale.Proceeds of the resale shall be applied in the following order of priority: (1) First, to the payment of the actual and reasonable expenses of such resale, (2) if, after application pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection, there are proceeds remaining, then to the payment of the actual and reasonable expenses of any retaking and storing of said goods, and (3) if, after application pursuant to subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection, there are proceeds remaining, then to the satisfaction of the balance due under the contract. Not later than thirty days after the resale, the holder of the contract shall give the retail buyer a written statement itemizing the disposition of the proceeds. Any sum remaining after the satisfaction of such claims shall be paid to the retail buyer.\n\n(f)Deficiency on resale.Even if the proceeds of the resale are insufficient to defray the actual and reasonable expenses of such resale, and such actual and reasonable expenses of any retaking and storing of such goods and the balance due under the contract, the holder of the contract may not recover the deficiency from the retail buyer or any surety or guarantor for the retail buyer, or from anyone who has succeeded to the obligations of such retail buyer, except as provided in subsection (g) of this section.\n\n(g)Fair market value.If the goods retaken consist of a motor vehicle the aggregate cash price of which was more than four thousand dollars, the prima facie fair market value of such motor vehicle shall be calculated by adding together the average trade-in value for such motor vehicle and the highest-stated retail value for such motor vehicle and dividing the sum of such values by two. Such average trade-in value and highest-stated retail value shall be determined by the values as stated in the National Automobile Dealers Association Used Car Guide, Eastern Edition, as of the date of repossession. If an average trade-in value is not stated in said guide, the highest-stated trade-in value stated in said guide for the motor vehicle shall be used. If the goods retaken consist of a boat the aggregate cash price of which was more than four thousand dollars, the prima facie fair market value of such boat shall be calculated by adding together the average trade-in value for such boat and the highest-stated retail value for such boat and dividing the sum of such values by two. Such average trade-in value and highest-stated retail value shall be determined by the values as stated in the National Automobile Dealers Association Appraisal Guide for Boats, Eastern Edition, as of the date of repossession. If an average trade-in value is not stated in said guide, the highest-stated trade-in value stated in said guide for the boat shall be used. In the event that the value of such motor vehicle or boat is not stated in such publication, the fair market value at retail minus the reasonable costs of resale shall be determined by the court. The prima facie evidence of fair market value of such motor vehicle or boat so determined may be rebutted only by direct in-court testimony. If such value of the motor vehicle or boat is less than the balance due under the contract, plus the actual and reasonable expenses of the retaking of possession, the holder of the contract may recover from the retail buyer, or from anyone who has succeeded to such retail buyer's obligations, as a deficiency, the amount by which such liability exceeds such fair market value, as defined in this subsection. If the actual resale price received by the holder exceeds such fair market value, as defined in this subsection, the actual resale price shall govern.\n\n(h)Election of remedies.After the holder retakes possession as provided in subsection (a) of this section, or if the holder obtains a prejudgment remedy against the goods under chapter 903a, the retail buyer or anyone who has succeeded to such retail buyer's obligations shall not be liable for any balance due, except to the extent permitted by subsection (g) of this section. The holder may seek a monetary judgment on the contract against the retail buyer unless the goods have been repossessed, with or without judicial process. Goods purchased under the contract shall not be executed upon to satisfy such judgment. When such judgment becomes final, the holder's security interest in the goods shall be extinguished. If the contract covers a retail sale of a motor vehicle required to be registered, the holder shall comply with section 14-188.\n\n(i)Recovery of part payments.If the holder of the contract fails to comply with the provisions of subsections (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) of this section, after retaking the goods, the retail buyer may recover from the holder of the contract such retail buyer's actual damages, if any, and in no event less than one-fourth of the sum of all payments which have been made under the contract.\n\n(j)Waiver of statutory protection.No act or agreement of the retail buyer before or at the time of the making of a retail installment contract or installment loan contract nor any agreement or statement by the retail buyer in such contract shall constitute a valid waiver of the provisions of subsections (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i) of this section.\n\n(k)Loss.After the delivery of the goods to the retail buyer and prior to any retaking of such goods by the holder of the contract, the risk of injury and loss shall rest upon the retail buyer.\n\n(l)Regulations.The commissioner may adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 to implement the provisions of this section.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 6700; 1957, P.A. 357, S. 2, 3; 1959, P.A. 301; 1961, P.A. 116, S. 22, 23; P.A. 76-258, S. 1, 2; P.A. 77-506; 77-614, S. 486, 587, 610; P.A. 78-303, S. 85, 136; P.A. 94-134, S. 2, 3; May 25 Sp.

(h) is applicable where holder obtains a prejudgment remedy and made minor language changes in Subsecs.

Any activity subject to licensure pursuant to sections 36a-800 to 36a-814, inclusive, shall be conducted from an office located in a state, as defined in section 36a-2.\n\n(b) An application for a license as a consumer collection agency or for renewal of such license shall be made and processed on the system pursuant to section 36a-24b, in the form prescribed by the commissioner. Each such form shall contain content as set forth by instruction or procedure of the commissioner and may be changed or updated as necessary by the commissioner in order to carry out the purposes of sections 36a-800 to 36a-814, inclusive. The applicant shall, at a minimum, furnish to the system information concerning the identity of the applicant, any control person of the applicant, the qualified individual and any branch manager responsible for the actions of the licensee, including, but not limited to, information related to such person's personal history and experience, and any administrative, civil or criminal findings by any governmental jurisdiction. As part of the application, the commissioner may (1) in accordance with section 29-17a, conduct a state or national criminal history records check of the applicant, any control person of the applicant, the qualified individual or any branch manager, and (2) in accordance with section 36a-24b (a) require the submission of fingerprints of the applicant, any control person of the applicant, the qualified individual or any branch manager to the Federal Bureau of Investigation or other state, national or international criminal databases, and (B) investigate the financial condition of any such person and require authorization from any such person for the system and the commissioner to obtain an independent credit report from a consumer reporting agency, as described in Section 603(p) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 USC 1681a, as amended from time to time. Such application shall be accompanied by a financial statement prepared by a certified public accountant and shall evidence that the applicant has a tangible net worth of more than zero dollars if the applicant is engaged solely in the business of debt buying, and a tangible net worth of at least fifty thousand dollars if the applicant is not engaged solely in the business of debt buying. The commissioner shall cause to be made such inquiry and examination as to the qualifications of each such applicant or any control person, qualified individual or branch manager of the applicant as the commissioner deems necessary. Each applicant shall furnish satisfactory evidence to the commissioner that the applicant is a person of good moral character and is financially responsible.\n\n(c) (1) Each applicant for a consumer collection agency license shall pay to the system any required fees or charges and a license fee of five hundred dollars. Each such license shall expire at the close of business on December thirty-first of the year in which the license was approved, unless such license is renewed, except that any such license approved on or after November first shall expire at the close of business on December thirty-first of the year following the year in which it is approved. An application for renewal of a license shall be filed between November first and December thirty-first of the year in which the license expires. Each applicant for renewal of a consumer collection agency license shall pay to the system any required fees or charges and a renewal fee of four hundred dollars.\n\n(2) If the commissioner finds, upon the filing of an application for a consumer collection agency, that (a) the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity and general fitness of the applicant, the control persons of the applicant, the qualified individual and any branch manager are such as to warrant belief that the business will be operated soundly and efficiently, in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of sections 36a-800 to 36a-814, inclusive, and (B) the applicant meets the applicable tangible net worth requirement in subsection (b) of this section and no proceeding in bankruptcy, receivership or assignment for the benefit of creditors has been commenced against the applicant, the commissioner may thereupon issue the applicant a consumer collection agency license. If the commissioner fails to make such findings, the commissioner shall not issue a license and shall notify the applicant of the reasons for such denial. The commissioner may deny an application if the commissioner finds that the applicant or any control person, qualified individual or branch manager of such applicant has been convicted of any misdemeanor involving any aspect of the consumer collection agency business, or any felony. Any denial of an application by the commissioner shall, when applicable, be subject to the provisions of section 46a-80.\n\n(3) The minimum standards for renewal of a consumer collection agency license shall include the following: (a) The applicant continues to meet the minimum standards under this section; (B) the applicant has paid all required fees for renewal of the license; and (C) the applicant has paid all outstanding examination fees or other moneys due to the commissioner. The license of a consumer collection agency licensee failing to satisfy the minimum standards for license renewal shall expire. The commissioner may adopt procedures for the reinstatement of expired licenses consistent with the standards established by the system. Every license shall remain in force and effect until the license has been surrendered, revoked or suspended or has expired in accordance with the provisions of sections 36a-800 to 36a-814, inclusive.\n\n(d) To further the enforcement of this section and to determine the eligibility of any person holding a license, the commissioner may, as often as the commissioner deems necessary, examine the licensee's books and records, and may, at any time, require the licensee to submit such a financial statement for the examination of the commissioner, so that the commissioner may determine whether the licensee is financially responsible to carry on a consumer collection agency business within the intents and purposes of sections 36a-800 to 36a-814, inclusive. Any financial statement submitted by a licensee shall be confidential and shall not be a public record unless introduced in evidence at a hearing conducted by the commissioner.\n\n(e) The commissioner may deem an application for a license to act as a consumer collection agency abandoned if the applicant fails to respond to any request for information required under sections 36a-801 to 36a-814, inclusive, or any regulations adopted pursuant to said sections 36a-801 to 36a-814, inclusive. The commissioner shall notify the applicant on the system that if the applicant fails to submit such information not later than sixty days after the date on which such request for information was made, the application shall be deemed abandoned. An application filing fee paid prior to the date an application is deemed abandoned pursuant to this subsection shall not be refunded. Abandonment of an application pursuant to this subsection shall not preclude the applicant from submitting a new application for a license under sections 36a-801 to 36a-814, inclusive.\n\n(f) (1) Not later than thirty days before a licensee ceases to engage in the business of a consumer collection agency for any reason, including, but not limited to, a business decision to terminate operations in this state, bankruptcy or voluntary dissolution, such licensee shall request surrender of the license on the system in accordance with subsection (c) of section 36a-51 for each location in which such licensee has ceased to engage in such business.\n\n(2) Except as otherwise specified in subsection (i) of this section, each consumer collection agency applicant or licensee, and each individual designated as a control person, qualified individual or branch manager of such applicant or licensee, shall file on the system any change in the information such applicant, licensee, control person, qualified individual or branch manager most recently submitted to the system in connection with the application or license, or, if the information cannot be filed on the system, notify the commissioner of such change, in writing, not later than fifteen days after the date the applicant, licensee, control person, qualified individual or branch manager had reason to know of the change.\n\n(3) A consumer collection agency licensee shall file on the system or, if the information cannot be filed on the system, notify the commissioner, in writing, of the occurrence of any of the following developments not later than fifteen days after the date the licensee had reason to know of the occurrence of any of the following developments:\n\n(A) Filing for bankruptcy or the consummation of a corporate restructuring of the licensee;\n\n(B) Filing of a criminal indictment against the licensee in any way related to the consumer collection activities of the licensee, or receiving notification of the filing of any criminal felony indictment or felony conviction of any control person, branch manager or qualified individual of the licensee;\n\n(C) Receiving notification of the institution of license denial, cease and desist, suspension or revocation procedures, or other formal or informal action by any governmental agency against the licensee or any control person, branch manager or qualified individual of the licensee and the reasons therefor;\n\n(D) Receiving notification of the initiation of any action against the licensee or any control person, branch manager or qualified individual of the licensee by the Attorney General or the attorney general of any other state and the reasons therefor;\n\n(E) Receiving notification of filing for bankruptcy of any control person, branch manager or qualified individual of the licensee; or\n\n(F) Any decrease in tangible net worth from the minimum amount required pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(g) The commissioner may automatically suspend a license if the licensee receives a deficiency on the system indicating that a required payment was Returned-ACH or returned pursuant to such other term as may be utilized by the system to indicate that the payment was not accepted. After a license has been automatically suspended pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall (1) give the licensee notice of the automatic suspension, pending proceedings for revocation or refusal to renew pursuant to section 36a-804 and an opportunity for a hearing on such action in accordance with section 36a-51, and (2) require such licensee to take or refrain from taking such action as the commissioner deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section.\n\n(h) No abatement of the license fee shall be made if the application is denied or withdrawn prior to issuance of the license or if the license is surrendered, revoked or suspended prior to the expiration of the period for which it was issued. All fees required by this section shall be nonrefundable.\n\n(i) No person licensed to act within this state as a consumer collection agency shall do so under any other name or at any other place of business than that named in the license. No licensee may use any name other than its legal name or a fictitious name approved by the commissioner, provided such licensee may not use its legal name if the commissioner disapproves use of such name. A licensee may change the name of the licensee or address of the office specified on the most recent filing with the system if, at least thirty calendar days prior to such change, (1) the licensee files such change with the system and provides a bond rider, endorsement or addendum, as applicable, to the surety bond on file with the commissioner that reflects the new name or address, and (2) the commissioner does not disapprove such change, in writing, or request further information from the licensee within such thirty-day period. Not more than one place of business shall be maintained under the same license but the commissioner may issue more than one license to the same licensee upon compliance with the provisions of sections 36a-800 to 36a-814, inclusive, as to each new licensee. A license shall not be transferable or assignable. Any change in any control person of the licensee, except a change of a director, general partner or executive officer that is not the result of an acquisition or change of control of the licensee, shall be the subject of an advance change notice filed on the system at least thirty days prior to the effective date of such change and no such change shall occur without the commissioner's approval. For purposes of this section, “change of control” means any change causing the majority ownership, voting rights or control of a licensee to be held by a different control person or group of control persons. The commissioner may automatically suspend a license for any violation of this subsection.

The surrender of a license does not reduce or eliminate the licensee's civil or criminal liability arising from acts or omissions occurring prior to the surrender of the license, including any administrative actions undertaken by the commissioner to revoke or suspend a license, assess a civil penalty, order restitution or exercise any other authority provided to the commissioner.\n\n(e) If an application for a renewal license has been filed with the commissioner on or before the date the license expires, the license sought to be renewed shall continue in full force and effect until the issuance by the commissioner of the renewal license applied for or until the commissioner has notified the licensee in writing of the commissioner's refusal to issue such renewal license together with the grounds upon which such refusal is based. The commissioner may refuse to issue a renewal license (1) on any ground on which the commissioner might refuse to issue an initial license, or (2) if the applicant has not paid any required fee for renewal or has not paid any outstanding examination fees or other moneys due to the commissioner. The license of a private student loan servicer failing to satisfy the minimum standards for license renewal shall expire. The commissioner may adopt procedures for the reinstatement of expired licenses consistent with the standards established by the system.\n\n(f) The commissioner may automatically suspend a license if the licensee receives a deficiency on the system indicating that a required payment was Returned-ACH or returned pursuant to such other term as may be utilized by the system to indicate that the payment was not accepted. After a license has been automatically suspended pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall (1) give the licensee notice of the automatic suspension, pending proceedings for revocation or refusal to renew pursuant to section 36a-852 and an opportunity for a hearing on such action in accordance with section 36a-51, and (2) require such licensee to take or refrain from taking such action as the commissioner deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section.\n\n(g) Except as specified in section 36a-848, the applicant or licensee, and each individual designated as a control person, qualified individual or branch manager, shall file on the system any change in the information such applicant, licensee, control person, qualified individual or branch manager most recently submitted to the system in connection with the application or license, or, if the information cannot be filed on the system, notify the commissioner of such change, in writing, not later than fifteen days after the date the applicant, licensee, control person, qualified individual or branch manager had reason to know of the change.\n\n(h) The commissioner may deem an application for a license abandoned if the applicant fails to respond to any request for information required under sections 36a-846 to 36a-854, inclusive, or any regulations adopted pursuant to said sections. The commissioner shall notify the applicant on the system that if the applicant fails to submit such information not later than sixty days after the date on which such request for information was made, the application shall be deemed abandoned. An application filing fee paid prior to the date an application is deemed abandoned pursuant to this subsection shall not be refunded. Abandonment of an application pursuant to this subsection shall not preclude the applicant from submitting a new application for a license under the provisions of sections 36a-846 to 36a-854, inclusive.\n\n(P.A. 15-162, S. 3; P.A. 18-173, S. 85; P.A. 21-130, S. 2.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 15-162 effective July 1, 2016; P.A. 18-173 amended Subsec.
