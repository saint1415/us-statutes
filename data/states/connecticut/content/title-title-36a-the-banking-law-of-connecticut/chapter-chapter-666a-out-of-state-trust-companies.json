Such approved out-of-state trust company shall be deemed to transact business in this state for the purposes of section 33-920, subsection (a) of section 33-1210, sections 34-275 and 34-275a or section 34-429 and shall comply with the applicable requirements of said sections.

The out-of-state trust company shall pay to the commissioner, at the time of making such application, a nonrefundable fee of one thousand five hundred dollars.
