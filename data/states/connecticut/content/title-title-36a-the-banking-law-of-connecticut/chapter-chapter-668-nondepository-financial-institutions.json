For the purpose of participating in the system, the commissioner may waive or modify, in whole or in part, by regulation or order, any requirement of this section and sections 36a-485 to 36a-498e, inclusive, 36a-498h, and 36a-534a and establish new requirements as reasonably necessary to participate in the system.

For previously licensed individuals, the commissioner may establish expedited review and licensing procedures.\n\n(2) The commissioner shall report regularly to the system violations of and enforcement actions under sections 36a-485 to 36a-498e, inclusive, 36a-498h, 36a-534a and 36a-534b and other relevant information.\n\n(3) The commissioner may establish relationships or enter into contracts with the system or other entities designated by the system to collect and maintain records and process transaction fees or other fees related to licensees or other persons subject to sections 36a-485 to 36a-498e, inclusive, 36a-498h, 36a-534a and 36a-534b.\n\n(4) For the purposes of sections 36a-485 to 36a-498e, inclusive, 36a-498h, 36a-534a and 36a-534b, and to reduce the points of contact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation may have to maintain for purposes of subsections (b) to (d), inclusive, of section 36a-488, the commissioner may use the system as a channeling agent for requesting information from and distributing information to the United States Department of Justice or any governmental agency.\n\n(5) For the purposes of sections 36a-485 to 36a-498e, inclusive, 36a-498h, 36a-534a and 36a-534b, and to reduce the points of contact that the commissioner may have to maintain for purposes of subsections (b) to (d), inclusive, of section 36a-488, and section 36a-498h, the commissioner may use the system as a channeling agent for requesting and distributing information to and from any source, as directed by the commissioner.\n\n(6) Mortgage lenders, mortgage correspondent lenders, mortgage brokers, lead generators, mortgage loan originators and loan processors or underwriters may challenge information entered into the system by the commissioner.

Upon cancellation, the licensee shall, at the licensee's option, either refund the insurance charges to the borrower or apply them to the unpaid balance of the loan.\n\n(c) For the purposes of this section, in the case of an open-end small loan, the additional charge for credit life insurance or credit accident and health insurance shall be calculated in each billing cycle by applying the current monthly premium rate for such insurance, as such rate may be determined by the Insurance Commissioner, to the unpaid balances in the account, using any of the methods for the calculation of loan charges specified in subdivision (4) of subsection (f) of section 36a-558. No credit life insurance or credit accident and health insurance written in connection with an open-end small loan shall be cancelled by the licensee because of delinquency of the borrower in the making of the required minimum payments on the loan unless (1) one or more of such payments is past due for a period of ninety days or more, and (2) the licensee advances to the insurer the amounts required to keep the insurance in force during such period, which amounts may be debited from the borrower's account.

The bond shall be conditioned upon the licensee and the licensee's authorized delegates faithfully performing all obligations with respect to the licensee's money transmission business in this state and conducting such business in this state consistent with the provisions of sections 36a-595 to 36a-612, inclusive. The bond shall be in favor of the commissioner and run concurrently with the period of the license. For applicants and licensees who will not be engaged in the business of transmitting monetary value in the form of virtual currency, such bond shall be in the principal sum of not less than: (1) Three hundred thousand dollars for any applicant and any licensee with an average weekly amount of money transmissions in this state of less than three hundred thousand dollars for the most recent twelve-month period ending June thirtieth, (2) five hundred thousand dollars for any licensee with an average weekly amount of money transmissions in this state equal to or greater than three hundred thousand dollars but less than or equal to five hundred thousand dollars for the most recent twelve-month period ending June thirtieth, or (3) one million dollars for any licensee with an average weekly amount of money transmissions in this state exceeding five hundred thousand dollars for the most recent twelve-month period ending June thirtieth. For purposes of this section, “money transmissions” includes (a) money or monetary value received or transmitted in this state, and (B) stored value and payment instruments issued or sold in this state. For applicants and licensees who will or may engage in the business of transmitting monetary value in the form of virtual currency, such bond shall be in a principal sum as determined by the commissioner and shall be calculated reasonably to address the current and prospective volatility of the market in such currency or currencies.\n\n(b) The proceeds of the bond, even if commingled with other assets of the licensee, shall be deemed by operation of law to be held in trust for the benefit of any claimants against the licensee to serve the faithful performance of the obligations of the licensee and the licensee's authorized delegates with respect to the licensee's money transmission business in this state in the event of the bankruptcy of the licensee, and shall be immune from attachment by creditors or judgment creditors. Any person who may be damaged as a result of the failure by the licensee or the licensee's authorized delegates to perform obligations with respect to the licensee's money transmission business in this state may proceed against the licensee's bond to recover damages. The commissioner may proceed on such bond against the principal or surety thereon, or both, to collect any civil penalty imposed upon the licensee pursuant to subsection (a) of section 36a-50, any restitution imposed pursuant to subsection (c) of section 36a-50, and any unpaid costs of examination of the licensee as determined pursuant to subdivision (6) of subsection (c) of section 36a-65. The bond shall cover claims for damages arising from the licensee's money transmission business in this state made not later than two years from the date of the act, error or omission that allegedly caused or resulted in such damages. When an action is commenced on a licensee's bond, the commissioner may require the filing of a new bond and, immediately upon recovery on any action on the bond, the licensee shall file a new bond. If the commissioner finds that the financial condition of a licensee so requires, as evidenced by the reduction of tangible net worth, financial losses or potential losses as a result of a violation of sections 36a-595 to 36a-612, inclusive, the commissioner may require one or more additional bonds meeting the standards set forth in this section. The licensee shall file any such additional bonds not later than ten days after receipt of the commissioner's written notice of such requirement.\n\n(c) The surety company may cancel the bond at any time by a written notice to the licensee and the commissioner, stating the date cancellation shall take effect. If the bond is issued electronically on the system, such written notice may be provided by the surety company to the licensee and the commissioner through the system at least thirty days prior to the date of cancellation. Any notice of cancellation not provided through the system shall be sent by certified mail to the licensee and the commissioner at least thirty days prior to the date of cancellation. A surety bond shall not be cancelled unless the surety company notifies the commissioner in writing not less than thirty days prior to the effective date of cancellation. After receipt of such notification from the surety company, the commissioner shall give written notice to the licensee of the date such bond cancellation shall take effect. The commissioner shall automatically suspend the license on such date, unless the licensee, prior to such date, submits (1) a letter of reinstatement of the bond from the surety company, (2) a new bond, (3) evidence that all of the principal sum of such surety bond has been invested as provided in subsection (d) of this section, (4) a new bond that replaces the surety bond in part and evidence that the remaining part of the principal sum of such surety bond has been invested as provided in subsection (d) of this section, or (5) evidence that the licensee has ceased business and has surrendered the license. After a license has been automatically suspended, the commissioner shall (a) give the licensee notice of the automatic suspension pending proceedings for revocation or refusal to renew such license and an opportunity for a hearing on such actions in accordance with section 36a-51, and (B) require the licensee to take or refrain from taking such action as the commissioner deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section.\n\n(d) In lieu of all or part of the principal sum of such surety bonds, applicants for a license and licensees may invest such sum as provided in this subsection. The book or market value, whichever is lower, of such investments shall be equal to the amount of the bond required by subsection (a) of this section less the amount of the bond filed with the commissioner by the applicant or licensee. Such applicants and licensees shall keep such investments with such banks, Connecticut credit unions or federal credit unions as such applicants or licensees may designate and the commissioner may approve, and subject to such conditions as the commissioner deems necessary for the protection of consumers and in the public interest. As used in this subsection, “investments” means: (1) Dollar deposits; and (2) interest-bearing bills, notes, bonds, debentures or other obligations issued or guaranteed by (a) the United States or any of its agencies or instrumentalities, or (B) any state, or any agency, instrumentality, political subdivision, school district or legally constituted authority of any state if such investment is of prime quality. The investments shall secure the same obligation as would a surety bond filed under this section. The investments shall be held at such banks or credit unions to cover claims during the period the license remains in full force and effect and the succeeding two years after such license has been surrendered, revoked or suspended or has expired in accordance with the provisions of sections 36a-595 to 36a-612, inclusive. The licensee shall be permitted to collect interest on such investments and at any time to exchange, examine and compare such investments. The investments made pursuant to this section, even if commingled with other assets of the licensee, shall be deemed by operation of law to be held in trust for the benefit of any claimants against the licensee to serve the faithful performance of the obligations of the licensee and the licensee's authorized delegates with respect to the licensee's money transmission business in this state in the event of the bankruptcy of the licensee, and shall be immune from attachment by creditors or judgment creditors.\n\n(P.A. 81-264, S. 9; P.A. 91-306, S. 1; P.A. 94-122, S. 280, 340; P.A. 98-192, S. 6; P.A. 01-56, S. 9; P.A. 02-111, S. 39; P.A. 03-61, S. 4; P.A. 04-14, S. 7; P.A. 06-35, S. 9; P.A. 07-91, S. 9; P.A. 09-208, S. 17; P.A. 13-253, S. 8; P.A. 15-53, S. 8; P.A. 18-173, S. 55.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 91-306 amended Subsec.
