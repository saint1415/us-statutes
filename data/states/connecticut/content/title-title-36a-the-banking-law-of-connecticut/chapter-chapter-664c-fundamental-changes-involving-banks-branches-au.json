      "heading": "(Formerly Sec. 36-193u). - Merger and consolidation of Connecticut banks.",
      "text": "(a) Except as provided in subsection (i) of this section, any two or more Connecticut banks may, with the approval of the commissioner, merge or consolidate into a single Connecticut bank. As used in this section, a “constituent temporary bank” means a constituent Connecticut bank that has a temporary certificate of authority but does not have a final certificate of authority to commence business, and a “constituent final bank” means a constituent Connecticut bank that has a final certificate of authority to commence business. Any plan of merger or consolidation approved by the commissioner shall specify whether the resulting bank shall operate as a bank and trust company, or a capital stock or mutual savings bank or savings and loan association.\n\n(b) The governing board of each constituent final bank and the organizers of each constituent temporary bank proposing to merge or consolidate shall enter into an agreement, approved and executed by a majority of the governing board or all of the organizers, as the case may be, of each bank, prescribing the terms and conditions of such proposed merger or consolidation. Such agreement shall include the proposed certificate of incorporation of the resulting bank and shall state the name and corporate form of the resulting bank, the town in which its main office is located, the minimum and maximum number of directors and any other details necessary to effectuate such proposed merger or consolidation. In the case of a capital stock resulting bank, the agreement shall include the amount of capital stock with which the resulting bank shall commence business, the number of shares into which the capital stock is to be divided and the manner of converting the shares of the capital stock of the constituent banks into shares of the capital stock of the resulting bank and, if any shares of the capital stock of any of the constituent banks are not to be converted solely into shares of the capital stock of the resulting bank, the amount of cash, property or other securities of the resulting bank or the shares or other securities of any other corporation which the holders of such shares are to receive in exchange for or upon the conversion of such shares, which cash, property or other securities of the resulting bank, or shares or other securities of any other corporation, may be in addition to or in lieu of the shares of the resulting bank. In the case of a merger or consolidation involving a mutual constituent bank and a capital stock constituent bank, if the resulting bank is to be a mutual bank, the agreement shall include the amount of cash or property of the resulting mutual bank which the holders of the shares of the capital stock constituent bank are to receive in exchange for such shares.\n\n(c) Such agreement may provide for the effective date of the proposed merger or consolidation, which shall not be earlier than the filing of the agreement and the commissioner's approval in the office of the Secretary of the State. If the agreement does not provide an effective date, the merger or consolidation shall become effective on the first business day following the filing of the agreement and approval in the office of the Secretary of the State. In the case of capital stock constituent banks, the merger or consolidation agreement may provide that no new certificates of stock need be issued to holders of stock of the constituent bank which continues its corporate existence and that the certificates of stock of any other constituent bank may be deemed to be the certificates of stock of the resulting bank or any other corporation, provided that holders of certificates of stock of such other constituent bank shall be entitled to exchange their certificates of stock for certificates of stock of the resulting bank or such other corporation.\n\n(d) In addition to the vote of the governing board or organizers as required by subsection (b) of this section, in the case of a capital stock constituent final bank, the merger or consolidation shall be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the issued and outstanding shares of each class of the capital stock. Such vote shall be taken at separate meetings of the shareholders called for the purpose of considering the proposed merger or consolidation, and not less than ten days' notice of the time, place and purpose of such meeting shall be mailed to the last-known address of each shareholder. Any person entitled to notice under this subsection may waive such notice in accordance with section 33-700. The vote may approve the merger or consolidation either upon the terms of the agreement as approved and executed by the governing board or organizers or with such additions or amendments as may be so approved at such shareholders' or incorporators' meetings of each of the constituent banks.\n\n(e) In the case of a merger or consolidation involving at least one mutual constituent bank, after adoption of the merger or consolidation agreement, notice thereof shall be published once each week for two consecutive weeks in one or more newspapers having a circulation in the town in which the main office of each such mutual constituent bank is located. Copies of the record of the meetings adopting the agreement of merger or consolidation, and setting forth the agreement in full, attested by the secretary and president of the respective meetings, shall be certified to and filed in the office of each such mutual constituent bank, there to remain, subject to public inspection, for fifteen days.\n\n(f) Upon application by the constituent banks, and upon receipt of a copy of the agreement of merger or consolidation, certified by the secretaries of the respective constituent final banks and certified by the agents for the organizers of the respective constituent temporary banks as having been duly approved in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, the commissioner shall determine whether such merger or consolidation will promote public convenience, whether benefits to the public clearly outweigh possible adverse effects, including, but not limited to, an undue concentration of resources and decreased or unfair competition, and whether the terms thereof are reasonable and in accordance with law and sound public policy. The commissioner, if the commissioner so determines, shall approve the merger or consolidation. The commissioner shall not approve such merger or consolidation: (1) If it involves the acquisition of a Connecticut bank that has not been in existence and continuously operating for at least five years, unless the commissioner waives this requirement; (2) if the resulting bank including all insured depository institutions which are affiliates of the resulting bank, upon consummation of the merger or consolidation, would control thirty per cent or more of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in this state, unless the commissioner permits a greater percentage of such deposits; or (3) if the programs, policies and procedures relating to anti-money-laundering activities of the constituent banks, or the proposed programs, policies and procedures of the resulting bank relating to anti-money-laundering activities, are inadequate, or the constituent banks do not have a record of compliance with anti-money-laundering laws and regulations. In addition, the commissioner shall not approve such merger or consolidation unless the commissioner considers whether: (a) The investment and lending policies of the constituent banks, or the proposed investment and lending policies of the resulting bank, are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and will benefit the economy of this state; (B) the services or proposed services of the resulting bank are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and will benefit the economy of this state; (C) the constituent banks have sufficient capital to ensure, and agree to ensure, that the resulting bank will comply with applicable minimum capital requirements; (D) the constituent banks have sufficient managerial resources to operate the resulting bank in a safe and sound manner; and (E) the proposed merger or consolidation will not substantially lessen competition in the banking industry of this state. The commissioner shall not approve such merger or consolidation unless the commissioner makes the findings required by section 36a-34 and, in the case of a merger or consolidation of a mutual banking institution, determines that the interests of depositors are protected or served by the agreement of merger or consolidation. After approval of the merger or consolidation by the commissioner, a copy of the agreement and a copy of the commissioner's approval shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of the State. The resulting bank shall not commence business unless its insurable accounts and deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or its successor agency.\n\n(g) Upon the completion of a merger or consolidation (1) the constituent banks shall become a Connecticut bank by the name provided in the certificate of incorporation of the resulting bank; (2) the corporate existence of the constituent banks shall be continued by and in the resulting bank; (3) the resulting bank shall possess all the rights, privileges and franchises of each of the constituent banks including the authority to exercise fiduciary powers without further express authority of the commissioner, except that the resulting bank shall be empowered to exercise only those powers that are provided by the laws of this state to the resulting bank and trust company, savings bank or savings and loan association, as the case may be; (4) the entire assets, business, good will and franchises of each of the constituent banks shall be vested in the resulting bank without any deed or transfer, provided the constituent banks may execute such deeds or instruments of conveyance as may be convenient to confirm the same; (5) the resulting bank shall assume and be liable for all debts, accounts, undertakings, contractual obligations and liabilities of the constituent banks and shall exercise and be subject to all the duties, relations, obligations, trusts and liabilities of each of the constituent banks, whether as debtor, depository, registrar, transfer agent, executor, administrator, trustee or otherwise, and shall be liable to pay and discharge all such debts and liabilities, to perform all such duties and to administer all such trusts in the same manner and to the same extent as if the resulting bank had itself incurred the obligation or liability or assumed the duty, relation or trust; (6) all rights of creditors and all liens upon the property of any of such constituent banks shall be preserved unimpaired; and (7) the resulting bank shall be entitled to receive, accept, collect, hold and enjoy any and all gifts, bequests, devises, conveyances, trusts and appointments in favor of or in the name of any of such constituent banks whether made or created to take effect prior to or after such merger or consolidation, and the same shall inure to and vest in such resulting bank. No suit, action or other proceeding pending at the time of the merger or consolidation before any court or tribunal in which any of such constituent banks is a party shall be abated or discontinued because of such merger or consolidation but may be continued and prosecuted to final effect by or against the resulting bank. The resulting bank shall have the right to use the name of any of the constituent banks whenever it can do any act or discharge any duty or obligation or endorse any right under such name more conveniently or with greater advantage to itself or to any person to whom it holds any relation of trust or owes any duty under any contract or conveyance, and no other corporation shall take or use the name of any of such constituent banks.\n\n(h) Upon the effectiveness of the agreement of merger or consolidation, the shareholders, if any, of the constituent banks, except to the extent that they have received cash, property or other securities of the resulting bank or shares or other securities of any other corporation in exchange for or upon conversion of their shares, shall be shareholders of a capital stock resulting bank. Unless such agreement otherwise provides, the resulting bank may require each shareholder to surrender such shareholder's certificates of stock in the constituent bank and in that event no shareholder, until such surrender of that shareholder's certificates, shall be entitled to receive a certificate of stock of the resulting bank or to vote thereon or to collect dividends declared thereon, or to receive cash, property or other securities of the resulting bank, or shares or other securities of any other corporation. Any shareholder of any such constituent bank is entitled to assert appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of such shareholder's shares under sections 33-855 to 33-872, inclusive. The rights and obligations of shareholders who assert appraisal rights and the bank shall be determined in accordance with said sections. The stock of a capital stock resulting bank up to an amount of the combined stock of the constituent banks shall be exempt from any franchise tax.\n\n(i) A mutual savings bank or a mutual savings and loan association and a capital stock bank shall not merge or consolidate if the resulting bank is to be a capital stock bank, unless prior to or as part of such merger or consolidation, the mutual savings bank or mutual savings and loan association first converts to a capital stock bank in accordance with section 36a-136, provided the commissioner may waive any of the provisions of section 36a-136 if the commissioner certifies in writing that the protection of depositors and other creditors of one of the merging or consolidating banks or associations requires that the merger or consolidation proceed without delay. No such conversion shall be required if the resulting bank is to be a mutual savings bank or a mutual savings and loan association.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 5811; 1955, S. 2663d; 1963, P.A. 74, S. 5; 251, S. 2; 1969, P.A. 598, S. 5, 6; 1971, P.A. 327, S. 1–3; P.A. 77-614, S. 587, 610; P.A. 78-95, S. 1–5; 78-303, S. 42–44, 85, 136; P.A. 83-411, S. 11, 12, 20; P.A. 87-9, S. 2, 3; P.A. 88-65, S. 32; P.A. 91-189, S. 4, 13; 91-357, S. 43, 78; P.A. 92-12, S. 58; P.A. 94-122, S. 61, 340; P.A. 95-155, S. 10, 29; P.A. 96-20, S. 1., 2; 96-54, S. 1, 9; 96-271, S. 198, 199, 254; P.A. 98-260, S. 2; P.A. 02-47, S. 5; P.A. 03-259, S. 8.)\n\nHistory: 1963 acts deleted provisions re change in name, amount of stock, etc. by corporation following merger or consolidation in Subsec.

In the case of a converting savings and loan association, the plan of conversion shall also require the favorable vote of not less than fifty-one per cent of the votes cast by depositors of such association at a special meeting called to consider such conversion. In the case of a federal savings bank or federal savings and loan association, the plan of conversion shall require any vote of depositors or members prescribed by federal law.\n\n(e) The plan of conversion for a mutual savings bank shall also require approval by (1) unless a greater percentage is required by the charter or certificate of incorporation of the converting bank, a majority of all the corporators of the converting bank, provided the converting bank shall, at the time of such vote, have no fewer than twenty-five corporators unless otherwise permitted by the commissioner based on restrictions contained in the charter or certificate of incorporation of the converting bank, and (2) a majority of the independent corporators of the converting bank, provided the total number of independent corporators shall at the time of such vote constitute no less than sixty per cent of all corporators.

Each converting institution shall, at the time of conversion, establish a liquidation account for the benefit of such account holders and such liquidation account shall establish a priority upon liquidation. The requirement concerning the establishment of a liquidation account shall not apply to the formation of a mutual holding company or a reorganized savings institution of such mutual holding company under sections 36a-192 and 36a-193 or to the issuance of capital stock by such reorganized savings institution under sections 36a-195 and 36a-196.\n\n(j) The commissioner shall adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 to govern the conversion of mutual institutions to capital stock institutions. Such regulations shall be similar in scope and content to the regulations of the Office of Thrift Supervision, 12 CFR Part 563b, as from time to time amended, for the conversion of mutual savings institutions into stock savings institutions. The commissioner may waive any provision of the regulations adopted pursuant to this section that is inconsistent with the regulations of the Office of Thrift Supervision or if such waiver is necessary to comply with the requirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or its successor agency.\n\n(k) If the commissioner certifies in writing that the protection of depositors or other creditors of such converting institution requires that the conversion proceed without delay, the commissioner may waive any provision of the regulations adopted pursuant to subsection (j) of this section that the commissioner determines will cause such delay.\n\n(l) The commissioner may approve a conversion under this section only if the commissioner determines that: (1) The converting institution has complied with all applicable provisions of law; (2) the conversion would not result in any reduction of the converting institution's amount of equity capital, less any subordinated debt recognized as bona fide capital; (3) the conversion would not result in a taxable reorganization of the converting institution under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended; (4) the programs, policies and procedures of the converting institution relating to anti-money-laundering activity are adequate, and the converting institution has a record of compliance with anti-money-laundering laws and regulations; and (5) the plan of conversion is fair to depositors.

Such Connecticut bank shall submit to the commissioner a written plan of organization pursuant to which all of the outstanding shares of voting securities of the Connecticut bank will be acquired by a corporation having capital stock divided into shares, referred to in this section as the “parent corporation”, and the holders of such securities of the Connecticut bank immediately prior to the consummation of the plan, except for dissenting shareholders, will become holders of the voting securities of the parent corporation. Such plan shall be in form satisfactory to the commissioner and shall prescribe the terms and conditions of the acquisition and the mode of carrying it into effect, including the manner of exchanging the shares of the Connecticut bank for shares or other securities of the parent corporation. Any such plan may provide for the payment of cash in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares of the parent corporation. Such plan may further provide that the certificates of stock of the Connecticut bank may be deemed to be certificates of stock of the parent corporation, provided the holders of certificates of stock of the Connecticut bank shall be entitled to receive certificates of stock of the parent corporation in exchange for certificates of stock of the Connecticut bank.\n\n(b) There shall be submitted to the commissioner with the plan of organization, a certificate of the secretary of the parent corporation, certifying that such plan has been approved by the governing board by vote of a majority of all the directors, and a certificate of the secretary of the Connecticut bank certifying that such plan has been submitted to the holders of the voting securities of such bank at a meeting held upon at least five days' notice, specifying the time, place and object of such meeting and addressed to each such shareholder at the address appearing upon the books of the bank and that at such shareholders' meeting at least two-thirds of each class of voting securities of the bank voted to approve such plan. The commissioner shall determine whether the terms of such plan of organization are reasonable and in accordance with law and sound public policy. The commissioner, if the commissioner so determines, shall thereupon certify the commissioner's findings and approval upon such plan. Such plan, when filed in the office of the Secretary of the State, shall evidence the terms and conditions of the organization. The commissioner shall not approve such plan of organization unless the commissioner considers whether: (1) The investment and lending policies of the Connecticut bank are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and will benefit the economy of this state; (2) the services or proposed services of the Connecticut bank are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and will benefit the economy of this state; (3) the parent corporation has sufficient capital to ensure, and agrees to ensure, that the Connecticut bank will comply with applicable minimum capital requirements; and (4) the parent corporation has sufficient managerial resources to operate the Connecticut bank in a safe and sound manner. The commissioner shall not approve such plan of organization unless the commissioner makes the findings required pursuant to section 36a-34. Upon such filing in the office of the Secretary of the State, the plan and the organization provided for therein shall become effective, unless a later date is specified in the plan, in which event the plan and organization shall become effective upon such later date.\n\n(c) Upon the effective date of the plan and the organization provided for therein, the shareholders of the Connecticut bank shall, except to the extent that they have received other securities of the parent corporation or cash in lieu of fractional shares, be holders of the voting securities of the parent corporation. Unless such plan otherwise provides, the Connecticut bank may require each shareholder to surrender such shareholder's certificates of stock in the Connecticut bank and, in that event, no shareholder, until such surrender of the shareholder's certificates, shall be entitled to vote thereon or to collect dividends declared thereon or to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares or the shares or other securities of the parent corporation. Any shareholder of the Connecticut bank whose stock has been so acquired who, on or before the date of such shareholders' meeting, gave written notice to the Connecticut bank of such shareholder's objection thereto, may, within ten days after the plan of organization has been filed in the office of the Secretary of the State, demand in writing from the Connecticut bank payment for such shareholder's stock and the Connecticut bank shall, within three months thereafter, pay such shareholder the value of such shareholder's stock at the date upon which such organization became effective. In case of disagreement as to the value of the stock of the Connecticut bank to be acquired, such value shall be ascertained by three disinterested persons to be chosen one by the shareholder, one by the Connecticut bank and the third by the two thus selected, and, if their award is not paid within sixty days from its date, it shall become a debt of the Connecticut bank and may be collected as such and such shareholder, upon receiving payment therefor, shall transfer such shareholder's stock to the Connecticut bank.\n\n(1969, P.A. 598, S. 3; 1971, P.A. 322, S. 2; P.A. 82-194, S. 2, 14; P.A. 83-406, S. 8, 11; P.A. 91-189, S. 5, 13; P.A. 92-12, S. 83; P.A. 93-24, S. 1, 9; P.A. 94-122, S. 74, 340; P.A. 95-155, S. 14, 29; P.A. 96-54, S. 3, 9.)\n\nHistory: 1971 act referred to “common” stockholders and “common capital” stock in Subsec.

      "text": "(a)(1) With the approval of the commissioner, a Connecticut bank may transfer all or a significant part of its assets or business to a bank. The transferring bank shall have been in existence and continuously operating for at least five years unless the commissioner waives this requirement. The commissioner shall not approve such transfer if (a) the acquiring bank, including all insured depository institutions which are affiliates of such bank, upon consummation of the transfer, would control thirty per cent or more of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in this state, unless the commissioner permits a greater percentage of such deposits, or (B) the programs, policies and procedures relating to anti-money-laundering activities of the acquiring institution are inadequate, or the acquiring institution does not have a record of compliance with anti-money-laundering laws and regulations. The transferring and acquiring banks shall file with the commissioner a written agreement approved and executed by a majority of the governing board of each bank prescribing the terms and conditions of the transaction. In the case of a transfer of all of the assets and business of the transferring bank, the terms of the agreement shall at least provide for full payment of the amounts due depositors and creditors of the transferring bank. Payment for all or part of the assets and business of the transferring bank may be made in cash or by making available on demand to depositors and other creditors thereof funds on deposit with the acquiring bank. Prior to the transfer of all or substantially all of the assets and business of a Connecticut bank pursuant to this section, such bank shall obtain authorization for the transfer by the affirmative vote of at least: (i) Two-thirds of the voting power of the outstanding shares of each class of stock, whether or not otherwise entitled to vote, in the case of a capital stock Connecticut bank; (ii) two-thirds of the voting power of the depositors, in the case of a mutual savings and loan association; and (iii) two-thirds of the governing board and two-thirds of the voting power of the corporators, in the case of mutual savings bank, which voting power shall, in any event, be no less than twenty-five corporators. In lieu of such vote, the commissioner may certify in writing that the protection of depositors or creditors of the transferring bank requires that the transfer proceed without delay.\n\n(2) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the liquidation of all of the retail deposits of a Connecticut bank pursuant to subsection (e) of section 36a-139b.\n\n(3) When a Connecticut bank has transferred or arranged to transfer all of its assets and business in accordance with this section, the governing board of such bank shall, after receiving the approval of the commissioner as provided in subdivision (1) of this subsection, send a written notice of such transfer or proposed transfer to each of its depositors and other known creditors and shall cause a copy of such notice to be published in a newspaper published in this state and having a circulation in the town in which the main office of such institution is located. Such notice shall inform the depositors and creditors of such bank of the transfer and of the terms thereof with reference to payment of depositors and creditors. Such notice may provide that creditors other than depositors who fail to present their claims to such bank within four months of the date of the notice shall be forever barred, and that creditors whose claims are presented within the time limited but which are disallowed by such bank shall commence an action to enforce their claims within three months of receipt of written notice disallowing their claims or be forever barred. Depositors shall not be required to present claims for deposits as shown by the records of such bank. At any time during the liquidation of the affairs of such bank, the governing board may have the privileges of a business corporation in voluntary dissolution as provided by law. After the claims of depositors and creditors have been fully paid either by transfer to the acquiring bank or in cash, or barred, the liability of the transferring bank for such claims shall cease. Any surplus remaining in the hands of the transferring Connecticut bank, after it has transferred all its assets and business, shall, after payment of the expenses of liquidation, be distributed to those entitled by law to receive such surplus in the manner provided in the agreement of transfer. Thereupon the governing board shall file a certificate with the commissioner stating that the affairs of such bank have been fully liquidated. Upon verifying the certificate as to the facts stated therein, the commissioner shall endorse the certificate “approved” and shall file a copy in the office of the Secretary of the State. Upon the finding by the Secretary of the State that the certificate complies with law, the secretary shall endorse the same “approved” and record the certificate. Thereupon the corporate existence of such bank shall cease.\n\n(b) No Connecticut bank may acquire all or a significant part of the assets or business of a federal bank, a federal credit union or an out-of-state bank without the approval of the commissioner. Such Connecticut bank shall file with the commissioner an application that includes a copy of any notice, application and other information filed with any federal or state banking regulator in connection with such acquisition and such additional information as may be required by the commissioner. The commissioner shall not approve such acquisition if: (1) It involves the acquisition of a federal bank or out-of-state bank that has not been in existence and continuously operating for at least five years, unless the commissioner waives this requirement; (2) the acquiring bank, including all insured depository institutions which are affiliates of such institution, upon consummation of the purchase, would control thirty per cent or more of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in this state, unless the commissioner permits a greater percentage of such deposits; or (3) the programs, policies and procedures relating to anti-money-laundering activities of the purchasing institution are inadequate, or the purchasing institution does not have a record of compliance with anti-money-laundering laws and regulations.\n\n(c) No bank or out-of-state bank may acquire all or a significant part of the assets or business of a Connecticut bank or Connecticut credit union from the receiver of such bank or credit union without the approval of the commissioner.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 5755; 1963, P.A. 189; 1967, P.A. 461, S. 7; 1969, P.A. 124, S. 1, 2, 3; P.A. 78-121, S. 21, 113; P.A. 81-207, S. 4; P.A. 82-194, S. 9, 14; P.A. 83-377, S. 1–3; 83-411, S. 17, 20; P.A. 84-62, S. 1–3; P.A. 91-357, S. 5, 78; P.A. 92-12, S. 19; P.A. 93-59, S. 2, 8; P.A. 94-122, S. 89, 340; P.A. 95-155, S. 17, 29; P.A. 96-54, S. 7, 9; 96-109, S. 2; 96-180, S. 116, 166; P.A. 00-2, S. 2, 3; P.A. 03-196, S. 6; 03-259, S. 16; P.A. 04-136, S. 36.)\n\nHistory: 1963 act required authorization of sale and purchase by two-thirds vote of incorporators of selling institution rather than of “each party to the transaction” in cases involving savings banks under Subsec.

If an independent receiver or conservator is appointed, the commissioner shall be a party to the receivership proceeding or conservatorship with standing to initiate or contest any motion, and the views of the commissioner shall be entitled to deference unless they are inconsistent with the plain meaning of sections 36a-215 to 36a-239, inclusive.\n\n(b) The commissioner may organize a separate division within the Department of Banking for liquidating or administering the affairs of the banks or credit unions for which the commissioner is acting as receiver or conservator, and the commissioner may appoint such employees and retain such consultants as the commissioner deems necessary for the liquidation or administration of the affairs of such banks or credit unions. The commissioner may appoint an agent, who shall be an employee of the Department of Banking and who, in the absence or incapacity of the commissioner and of the commissioner's deputy, shall have authority to act for or represent the commissioner in all matters pertaining to the duties of the commissioner as the receiver or conservator of any Connecticut bank or Connecticut credit union. Such agent may execute and sign for the commissioner as the receiver or conservator any documents, instruments or reports necessary in the administration of the receivership or conservatorship. All legal services required by the commissioner as receiver or conservator or the commissioner's deputy, agent or employees in connection with such receivership proceedings or the administration or reorganization of any such Connecticut bank or Connecticut credit union shall be performed by the Attorney General. The commissioner shall keep on file in the commissioner's office an executed copy of each report required to be filed by the commissioner as receiver or conservator with the clerk of the Superior Court and shall include a report of each bank or credit union for which the commissioner is acting as receiver or conservator in the commissioner's annual report to the Governor.\n\n(c) (1) If the commissioner is appointed receiver or conservator, any salaries and expenses incurred in the liquidation, reorganization or administration of the bank or credit union shall be paid out of the funds of the bank or credit union, subject to the approval of the Superior Court.

Any such costs or expenses so collected shall be deposited with the State Treasurer and shall be credited to the State Banking Fund. Any salaries and expenses for legal services provided by the Attorney General shall be paid out of the funds of the estate in receivership or conservatorship with the approval of the court. Such salaries and expenses shall be allocated by the commissioner as nearly as possible to the estate in receivership or conservatorship for which the services were rendered, and the funds in payment of the same shall be deposited with the State Treasurer and shall be credited to the appropriation for the Attorney General.\n\n(2) If an independent person is appointed receiver or conservator, the cost and expenses incurred in the liquidation, reorganization or administration of the bank or credit union, including any funds paid by the commissioner to the receiver or conservator before the bank or credit union was placed in receivership or conservatorship, shall be paid out of the funds of the bank or credit union, subject to the approval of the court.\n\n(d) Upon the appointment of a receiver pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, possession of and title to all assets, business and property of the Connecticut bank or Connecticut credit union shall pass to and vest in the receiver without the execution of any instruments of conveyance, assignment, transfer or endorsement.\n\n(e) (1) Except as otherwise provided by this subdivision, the superior court in which a receivership proceeding against a Connecticut bank or Connecticut credit union is pending has exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all actions or proceedings instituted by or against the bank, credit union or receiver after the receivership proceeding begins. The receiver may file in any jurisdiction an ancillary suit to obtain jurisdiction or venue over a person or property.\n\n(2) A record of a Connecticut bank or Connecticut credit union obtained by the receiver and held in the course of the receivership proceeding or a certified copy of the record under the official seal of the receiver is admissible as evidence in all cases without proof of correctness or other proof, except the certificate of the receiver that the record was received from the custody of the bank or credit union or found among its effects. The receiver may certify the correctness of such record and a record of the receiver's office, and may certify any fact contained in the record. The record is admissible as evidence in all cases in which the original would be evidence.

      "text": "(a) To receive payment of a claim against the estate of a trust bank or innovation bank in receivership, a person who has a claim, other than a shareholder acting in that capacity, including a claimant with a secured claim or a fiduciary claimant ordered by the receiver to file a proof of claim under subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of section 36a-225, shall present proof of the claim to the receiver at a place specified by the receiver, within the period specified by the receiver. Receipt of the required proof of claim by the receiver is a condition precedent to the payment of the claim. A claim that is not filed within the period or at the place specified by the receiver may not participate in a distribution of the assets by the receiver, except that, subject to court approval, the receiver may accept a claim filed not later than the one-hundred-eightieth day after the date notice of the claimant's right to file a proof of claim is mailed to the claimant, provided such claim shall be subordinate to an approved claim of a general creditor. Interest does not accrue on any claim after the date the bank is placed in receivership. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a fiduciary claimant or depositor where the records of the bank in receivership are sufficient to identify the fiduciary claimant's or depositor's interest.\n\n(b) (1) The proof of claim against a trust bank or an innovation bank shall be in writing, be signed by the claimant, and include: (a) A statement of the claim; (B) a description of the consideration for the claim; (C) a statement of whether collateral is held or a security interest is asserted against the claim and, if so, a description of the collateral or security interest; (D) a statement of any right of priority of payment for the claim or other specific right asserted by the claimant; (E) a statement of whether a payment has been made on the claim and, if so, the amount and source of the payment, to the extent known by the claimant; (F) a statement that the amount claimed is justly owed by the bank to the claimant; and (G) any other matter that is required by the Superior Court.\n\n(2) The receiver may designate the form of the proof of claim. A proof of claim shall be filed under oath unless the oath is waived by the receiver. If a claim is founded on a written instrument, the original instrument, unless lost or destroyed, shall be filed with the proof of claim. After the instrument is filed, the receiver may permit the claimant to substitute a copy of the instrument until the final disposition of the claim. If the instrument is lost or destroyed, a statement of that fact and of the circumstances of the loss or destruction shall be filed under oath with the claim.\n\n(c) A judgment against a trust bank or innovation bank in receivership taken by default or by collusion before the date the bank was placed in receivership may not be considered as conclusive evidence of the liability of the bank to the judgment creditor or of the amount of damages to which the judgment creditor is entitled. A judgment against the bank entered after the date the bank was placed in receivership may not be considered as evidence of liability or of the amount of damages.\n\n(d) (1) The owner of secured trust funds on deposit may file a claim as a creditor against a trust bank or innovation bank in receivership. The value of the security shall be determined under supervision of the Superior Court by converting the security into money.\n\n(2) The owner of a secured claim against a trust bank or innovation bank in receivership may surrender the security and file a claim as a general creditor or apply the security to the claim and discharge the claim.\n\n(3) If the owner applies the security and discharges the claim under subdivision (2) of this subsection, any deficiency shall be treated as a claim against the general assets of the bank on the same basis as a claim of an unsecured creditor. The amount of the deficiency shall be determined as provided by subsection (e) of this section, except that if the amount of the deficiency has been adjudicated by a court in a proceeding in which the receiver has had notice and an opportunity to be heard, the court's decision is conclusive as to the amount.\n\n(4) The value of security held by a secured creditor shall be determined under supervision of the court by converting the security into money according to the terms of the agreement under which the security was delivered to the creditor or by agreement, arbitration, compromise or litigation between the creditor and the receiver.\n\n(e) (1) A claim against a trust bank or innovation bank in receivership based on an unliquidated or undetermined demand shall be filed within the period for the filing of the claim. The claim may not share in any distribution to claimants until the claim is definitely liquidated, determined and allowed. After the claim is liquidated, determined and allowed, the claim shares ratably with the claims of the same class in all subsequent distributions.\n\n(2) If the receiver in all other respects is in a position to close the receivership proceeding, the proposed closing is sufficient grounds for the rejection of any remaining claim based on an unliquidated or undetermined demand. The receiver shall notify the claimant of the intention to close the proceeding. If the demand is not liquidated or determined before the sixty-first day after the date of the notice, the receiver may reject the claim.\n\n(3) For the purposes of this subsection, a demand is considered unliquidated or undetermined if the right of action on the demand accrued while the trust bank or innovation bank was placed in receivership and the liability on the demand has not been determined or the amount of the demand has not been liquidated.\n\n(f) (1) Mutual credits and mutual debts shall be set off and only the balance allowed or paid, except that a set-off may not be allowed in favor of a person if: (a) The obligation of a trust bank or innovation bank to the person on the date the bank was placed in receivership did not entitle the person to share as a claimant in the assets of the bank; (B) the obligation of the bank to the person was purchased by or transferred to the person after the date the bank was placed in receivership or for the purpose of increasing set-off rights; or (C) the obligation of the person or the bank is as a trustee or fiduciary.\n\n(2) Upon request, the receiver shall provide a person with an accounting statement identifying each debt that is due and payable. A person who owes a trust bank or innovation bank an amount that is due and payable against which the person asserts set-off of mutual credits that may become due and payable from the bank in the future shall promptly pay to the receiver the amount due and payable. The receiver shall promptly refund, to the extent of the person's prior payment, mutual credits that become due and payable to the person by the bank in receivership.\n\n(g) (1) Not later than six months after the last day permitted for the filing of claims or a later date allowed by the Superior Court, the receiver shall accept or reject in whole or in part each claim filed against a trust bank or an innovation bank in receivership, except for an unliquidated or undetermined claim governed by subsection (e) of this section. The receiver shall reject a claim if the receiver doubts its validity.\n\n(2) The receiver shall mail written notice to each claimant, specifying the disposition of the person's claim. If a claim is rejected in whole or in part, the receiver in the notice shall specify the basis for rejection and advise the claimant of the procedures and deadline for appeal.\n\n(3) The receiver shall send each claimant a summary schedule of approved and rejected claims by priority class and notify the claimant: (a) That a copy of a schedule of claims disposition, including only the name of the claimant, the amount of the claim allowed, and the amount of the claim rejected, is available upon request; and (B) of the procedure and deadline for filing an objection to an approved claim.\n\n(h) The receiver of a trust bank or innovation bank, with the approval of the superior court, shall set a deadline for an objection to an approved claim. On or before that date, a depositor, creditor, other claimant or shareholder of a trust bank or innovation bank may file an objection to an approved claim. The objection shall be heard and determined by the court. If the objection is sustained, the court shall direct an appropriate modification of the schedule of claims.\n\n(i) The receiver's rejection of a claim may be appealed to the superior court in which the receivership proceeding of a trust bank or innovation bank is pending. The appeal shall be filed within three months after the date of service of notice of the rejection. If the appeal is timely filed, review is de novo as if it were an action originally filed in the court, and is subject to the rules of procedure and appeal applicable to civil cases. An action to appeal rejection of a claim by the receiver is separate from the receivership proceeding, and may not be initiated by a claimant intervening in the receivership proceeding. If the action is not timely filed, the action of the receiver is final and not subject to review.\n\n(j) (1) The commissioner shall deposit all money available for the benefit of persons who have not filed a claim and are, according to the bank's records, depositors and creditors of a trust bank or innovation bank in receivership in a bank, Connecticut credit union, federal credit union, out-of-state bank that maintains in this state a branch, as defined in section 36a-410, or out-of-state credit union that maintains in this state a branch, as defined in section 36a-435b. The commissioner shall pay the nonclaiming depositors and creditors on demand the undisputed amount, based on the bank's records, held for their benefit.\n\n(2) The receiver may periodically make a partial distribution to the holders of approved claims if: (a) All objections have been heard and decided as provided by subsection (h) of this section; (B) the time for filing appeals has expired as provided by subsection (i) of this section; (C) money has been made available to provide for the payment of all nonclaiming depositors and creditors in accordance with subdivision (1) of this subsection; and (D) a proper reserve is established for the pro rata payment of: (i) Rejected claims that have been appealed, and (ii) any claims based on unliquidated or undetermined demands governed by subsection (e) of this section.\n\n(3) As soon as practicable after all objections, appeals and claims based on previously unliquidated or undetermined demands governed by subsection (e) of this section have been determined and money has been made available to provide for the payment of all nonclaiming depositors and creditors in accordance with subdivision (1) of this subsection, the receiver shall distribute the assets of a trust bank or innovation bank in satisfaction of approved claims other than claims asserted in a person's capacity as a shareholder.\n\n(P.A. 04-136, S. 30; P.A. 05-288, S. 202; P.A. 07-72, S. 6; June Sp.
