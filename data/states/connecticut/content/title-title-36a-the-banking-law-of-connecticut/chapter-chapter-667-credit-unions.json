The application shall be in writing and shall include (1) a proposed certificate of incorporation on a standard form provided by the commissioner, signed and acknowledged by the organizers either individually or collectively before an officer competent to administer oaths. The proposed certificate of incorporation shall specifically state: (a) The name of the Connecticut credit union; (B) the town in which the main office is to be located; (C) the name, occupation and residence, post office or business address of each organizer, proposed director, proposed appointed director and proposed member of senior management, provided the organizers, proposed directors, proposed appointed directors and proposed senior management shall separately file with the commissioner the notice of the residence of each organizer, proposed director, proposed appointed director and proposed member of senior management whose residence address is not included in the proposed certificate of incorporation; and (D) a statement that the purpose of the Connecticut credit union is to conduct the business of and to engage in any act or activity lawful for a Connecticut credit union, or, in the case of a Connecticut credit union that is organized to provide basic services, a statement that the purpose of such credit union is to offer basic services; (2) the proposed bylaws prescribing the manner in which the business of the Connecticut credit union shall be conducted on a standard form provided without charge by the commissioner, signed and acknowledged by the organizers either individually or collectively before an officer competent to administer oaths; (3) a business plan, including a three-year financial forecast; (4) a potential member survey; (5) in the case of a proposed Connecticut credit union the membership of which is limited to persons within a well-defined community, neighborhood or rural district, evidence to support a finding of such community, neighborhood or rural district; and (6) any other information that the commissioner may require.\n\n(c) In connection with an application to organize and at any other time the commissioner requests, each organizer, director, appointed director and member of senior management of a Connecticut credit union shall provide fingerprints to the commissioner for use in conducting criminal history records checks. Such criminal history records checks shall be conducted in accordance with section 29-17a.\n\n(d) (1) Upon the filing of the required application, the commissioner shall investigate the facts and shall determine whether: (a) The proposed field of membership is favorable to the success of the Connecticut credit union; (B) the organizers, proposed directors, proposed appointed directors and proposed members of senior management are of such character, general fitness and experience as to warrant belief that the business of the proposed Connecticut credit union will be conducted honestly and efficiently in accordance with the provisions of sections 36a-435a to 36a-472a, inclusive; (C) the proposed certificate of incorporation meets the requirements of this section; and (D) the proposed credit union provides reasonable promise of successful operation. In addition to the determinations under this subdivision, the commissioner shall consider the effect of overlapping fields of membership on the proposed credit union and existing Connecticut credit unions and federal credit unions. As a condition of approval of the application, the commissioner may require the proposed Connecticut credit union to limit or eliminate overlaps to achieve the purposes of sections 36a-435a to 36a-472a, inclusive, and promote the welfare and stability of those credit unions doing business in this state.\n\n(2) The commissioner shall not issue a certificate of authority to engage in the business of a Connecticut credit union if, in the opinion of the commissioner, the name selected would tend to confuse the public.\n\n(3) If the commissioner determines that the foregoing requirements are satisfied, and that the proposed Connecticut credit union will have its shares and deposits insured by the National Credit Union Administration, or its successor agency, the commissioner shall issue a certificate of authority to engage in the business of a Connecticut credit union. One original of the certificate of incorporation and one original of the certificate of authority shall be filed by the Connecticut credit union with the Secretary of the State. When the certificate of incorporation and certificate of authority are filed with the Secretary of the State in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, the Connecticut credit union shall become a corporation and its corporate existence shall continue perpetually unless otherwise expressly provided by law.\n\n(e) Within a reasonable time after issuance of the certificate of authority by the commissioner, the organizers shall hold an organization meeting at which they shall elect directors, who thereafter shall elect officers, appoint committee members and appointed directors, adopt the bylaws, and conduct any other business necessary to complete the organization of the Connecticut credit union. The Connecticut credit union shall complete such organization and shall commence business within six months from the issuance of the certificate of authority by the commissioner or such certificate of authority shall be void. The commissioner may, upon the application of the organizers and for good cause shown, grant a Connecticut credit union a reasonable extension of time to complete such organization and commence business. A Connecticut credit union shall not commence business until its shares and deposits are insured by the National Credit Union Administration or its successor agency, and it has been bonded by a surety company authorized to do business in this state to the same extent such bonding is required by 12 CFR Part 713, as from time to time amended.\n\n(f) Seven or more individuals may organize a Connecticut credit union that provides basic services in accordance with this section, except a Connecticut credit union the membership of which is limited to persons within a well-defined community, neighborhood or rural district. In order to expedite the issuance of a certificate of authority, the commissioner shall provide, without charge, to such organizers: (1) A model business plan for basic services; (2) policy guidelines concerning shares, lending, investments and other credit union business activities; and (3) sample letters for sponsor support, grants and nonmember deposits, where applicable. If the commissioner makes the determinations required by subsection (d) of this section, the commissioner shall issue a certificate of authority to engage in the business of a Connecticut credit union, with the express restriction that such credit union may offer only basic services. Any credit union organized pursuant to this subsection may upon the approval of the commissioner, convert to a Connecticut credit union operating without the restrictions provided in its certificate of authority. A credit union that proposes to convert shall file with the commissioner a proposed plan of conversion, including a new business plan, an original certificate of amendment to its certificate of incorporation and a certificate by the secretary of the converting credit union that the proposed plan of conversion and proposed certificate of amendment to its certificate of incorporation have been approved by a majority of the governing board of the converting credit union. The commissioner shall approve a conversion under this subsection if the commissioner determines that: (a) The converting credit union has complied with all applicable provisions of law; (B) the converting credit union has net worth in the amount required by the commissioner; (C) the converting credit union has received satisfactory ratings in its most recent safety and soundness examination; and (D) the proposed conversion will serve the necessity and convenience of the members of the converting credit union. After receipt of the commissioner's approval, the converting credit union shall promptly file such approval and the certificate of amendment to its certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of the State. Upon such filing, the converting credit union shall be a Connecticut credit union subject to all the requirements and limitations and possessed of all rights, privileges and powers granted to it by its certificate of incorporation and by the provisions of sections 36a-435a to 36a-472a, inclusive, and shall be subject to all of the duties, relations, obligations, trusts and liabilities of a Connecticut credit union. As used in this section, “basic services” means the issuance of regular shares, the making of signature loans not exceeding amounts predetermined by the commissioner, the making of participation loans as a participant in an amount specified by the commissioner, the sale of money orders and travelers checks, and the issuance and redemption of savings bonds.\n\n(g) (1) The certificate of incorporation of a Connecticut credit union may, with the approval of the commissioner, be amended at any time by the adoption at a meeting of an amendment resolution by two-thirds of the directors of the credit union. Written notice of such meeting, together with the text of the proposed amendment shall be given to each director at least seven days prior to the meeting.\n\n(2) A copy of the certificate of amendment shall be filed with the commissioner. The certificate of amendment shall set forth: (a) The name of the Connecticut credit union; (B) the amendment; and (C) a statement of the number of directors' votes required to take such action and the number of votes cast in favor of the amendment.\n\n(3) The commissioner, upon determining that the certificate of incorporation, as amended, meets the requirements of sections 36a-435a to 36a-472a, inclusive, shall approve the amendment. Upon receipt of the approval of such amendment, the Connecticut credit union shall file the original certificate of amendment with the Secretary of the State, and such amendment shall become effective upon filing.\n\n(h) (1) The bylaws of a Connecticut credit union shall specify at least the following: (a) The name of the credit union; (B) the field of membership of the credit union and the qualifications for membership; (C) the par value of shares; (D) the number and terms of directors and appointed directors, if applicable, and procedures for their election or appointment; (E) the duties of the members of senior management; (F) the manner in which a credit committee, credit manager, loan officer or any combination thereof shall be responsible for the credit functions of the credit union; (G) the manner of conducting the annual meeting and the provisions for voting; (H) conditions for payment on, receipt of or withdrawal of shares and deposits; and (I) such other matters as the governing board deems necessary.\n\n(2) The bylaws of a Connecticut credit union may not be amended without the written approval of the commissioner for a period of three years following issuance by the commissioner of the certificate of authority to engage in the business of a Connecticut credit union. Thereafter, the bylaws of a Connecticut credit union may be amended in accordance with subdivision (3) of this subsection, provided the bylaws comply with this subdivision, and any such amendment changing the name of the credit union or the field of membership of the credit union shall require the written approval of the commissioner in accordance with subdivision (3) of this subsection. The commissioner's approval shall not be required to amend the field of membership of a Connecticut credit union with a multiple common bond membership to add a group of less than five hundred potential members, excluding members of the immediate family or household of a potential member.\n\n(3) The bylaws of a Connecticut credit union may be amended by the adoption at a meeting of an amendment resolution by two-thirds of the directors of the credit union. Written notice of the meeting and text of the proposed amendment shall be given to each director at least seven days prior to the meeting. The Connecticut credit union shall file with the commissioner, within ten days after its adoption, one copy of any proposed amendment. In the case of a proposed amendment requiring the commissioner's approval, the commissioner shall, within thirty days after such filing, determine whether such proposed amendment is consistent with the provisions and purposes of sections 36a-435a to 36a-472a, inclusive. The thirty-day period may be extended by the commissioner, in writing, if the commissioner determines that the proposed amendment raises issues that require additional information or additional time for analysis.\n\n(4) Any amendment to the bylaws of a Connecticut credit union shall become effective when adopted except amendments requiring the approval of the commissioner which shall become effective upon such approval.\n\n(P.A. 02-73, S. 38; P.A. 03-35, S. 2; 03-84, S. 47; P.A. 04-136, S. 38; P.A. 06-10, S. 6; P.A. 11-50, S. 12; P.A. 17-236, S. 3; P.A. 21-138, S. 3, 4.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 03-35 amended Subsec.

The commissioner shall, in determining whether to approve the inclusion of an association in the field of membership of a Connecticut credit union, consider the public interest and benefit of such inclusion and, in determining whether an association was formed to serve a purpose other than expanding the field of membership of a Connecticut credit union, consider the totality of the circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following factors: (i) Whether the association provides opportunities for members to participate in furthering the goals of the association; (ii) whether the association maintains a membership list; (iii) whether the association sponsors activities; (iv) whether the association's membership eligibility requirements are limited to the association's stated purpose; (v) whether the members of the association pay dues; (vi) whether the members of the association have voting rights in the association; (vii) the extent of meetings and member engagement on topics related to the association's core purposes; and (viii) the degree of separation between the association and the credit union.\n\n(3) The field of membership of a Connecticut credit union under subparagraph (C) of subdivision (1) of this subsection may include groups located outside of the well-defined community, neighborhood or rural district such credit union serves that were within such credit union's field of membership at the time it converted from a field of membership specified in subparagraph (A) or (B) of said subdivision (1), provided such credit union's continuing relationships with such groups are not exclusive and, if authorized under this chapter, other Connecticut credit unions may also provide services to such groups. The commissioner may not approve an amendment to the bylaws of such a credit union under this subdivision unless the commissioner determines in writing that any potential harm that the expansion of the field of membership of such credit union may have on any other Connecticut credit union and its members is clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable beneficial effect of the expansion in meeting the convenience and needs of the members of the group proposed to be included in the field of membership.\n\n(b) The commissioner may authorize a Connecticut credit union with a multiple common bond membership to include in its field of membership any person within a well-defined community, neighborhood or rural district if:\n\n(1) The commissioner determines that the well-defined community, neighborhood or rural district is: (A) An investment area, as defined in Section 103(16) of the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994, 12 USC Section 4702(16), and meets any additional requirements that the commissioner may impose; and (B) underserved by other depository institutions, as defined in Section 19(b)(1)(A) of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 USC Section 461(b), based on data of the commissioner and federal supervisory agencies; and\n\n(2) The Connecticut credit union establishes and maintains a main office or branch in the well-defined community, neighborhood or rural district at which credit union services are available.\n\n(c) Any Connecticut credit union that is so authorized to expand its field of membership under subsection (b) of this section continues as a Connecticut credit union whose field of membership is limited to a multiple common bond membership.\n\n(d) (1) The commissioner may not approve an amendment to the bylaws of a Connecticut credit union with a multiple common bond membership to expand its field of membership to add a group of five hundred or more potential members, excluding individuals who are potentially eligible as members of the immediate family or household of a potential member, or persons within a well-defined community, neighborhood or rural district, unless the commissioner determines in writing that: (A) The Connecticut credit union has not engaged in any material unsafe or unsound practice during the one-year period preceding the date on which the proposed amendment is filed with the commissioner; (B) the Connecticut credit union is adequately capitalized; (C) the Connecticut credit union has the administrative capability to serve the proposed membership group and the financial resources to meet the need for additional staff and assets to serve the new membership group; (D) any potential harm that the expansion of the field of membership of the Connecticut credit union may have on any other Connecticut credit union and its members is clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable beneficial effect of the expansion in meeting the convenience and needs of the members of the group proposed to be included in the field of membership; and (E) formation of a separate credit union by the group proposed to be included is not practicable and consistent with reasonable safety and soundness standards. A Connecticut credit union whose field of membership is limited to a single common bond membership or multiple common bond membership that acquires as potential members persons within a well-defined community, neighborhood or rural district, other than the well-defined community, neighborhood or rural district specified in subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of this section, by merger, expansion or otherwise, shall become a Connecticut credit union whose field of membership is limited to persons within a well-defined community, neighborhood or rural district.\n\n(2) The commissioner may withhold or condition an approval of an amendment to the bylaws sought by a community credit union, as defined in section 36a-37, under this subsection pursuant to the provisions of section 36a-37d.\n\n(3) The commissioner may approve an amendment to the bylaws of a Connecticut credit union to change the field of membership without regard for the common bond whenever the commissioner determines that continued operation of the Connecticut credit union without the proposed amendment may result in liquidation or merger of such credit union.\n\n(P.A. 02-73, S. 39; P.A. 03-35, S. 3; 03-84, S. 48; 03-278, S. 93; P.A. 05-27, S. 1; P.A. 23-126, S. 24.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 03-35 amended Subsec.

The initial governing board shall be elected at the organization meeting of the Connecticut credit union as provided in subsection (e) of section 36a-437a, and thereafter by the members of the Connecticut credit union at the annual meeting as provided in section 36a-440a. The commissioner shall approve the election, appointment or employment of any director or potential member of the senior management of a troubled Connecticut credit union prior to such director or member taking such position. For the purposes of this subsection, “troubled Connecticut credit union” means any Connecticut credit union that, in the written opinion of the commissioner is (1) in danger of becoming insolvent, (2) not likely to be able to meet the demands of its members, or pay its obligations in the normal course of business or is likely to incur losses that may deplete all or substantially all of its capital, or (3) being operated in an unsafe and unsound manner.\n\n(c) Each director shall hold office for the term provided in the bylaws, except that the term may not exceed three years as long as the director is qualified to serve under subsection (e) of this section and until the director's successor has qualified. A director may serve more than one term. If directors are elected for terms in excess of one year, their terms of office shall be staggered so that, insofar as possible, an equal number of such terms shall expire each year.\n\n(d) Each director, upon such director's election, shall take and subscribe to an oath or affirmation that the director (1) will diligently and honestly perform the duties of director in administering the affairs of the Connecticut credit union; (2) will remain responsible for the performance of the duties of director even if the director delegates the performance of such duties; and (3) will not knowingly or wilfully permit the violation of any law or regulation applicable to credit unions. Each such oath or affirmation shall be recorded in the minutes of the governing board, and the Connecticut credit union shall promptly file a copy of such minutes with the commissioner.\n\n(e) No person shall be qualified to serve as a director of a Connecticut credit union if such person (1) is not a member in good standing; (2) has been found liable on any claim or convicted of any offense involving dishonesty or breach of trust; (3) has been removed by any state or federal regulatory agency from office as a director, officer or employee of a financial institution; (4) is not eligible for coverage under the surety bond required by subsection (a) of this section and section 36a-442a; or (5) has habitually neglected to pay debts or has become insolvent or bankrupt, unless the governing board of such credit union determines in writing that it would be in the best interests of the credit union for such person to be so qualified to serve as director.\n\n(f) No director of a Connecticut credit union may receive compensation for services as a member of the governing board and no member of a board-appointed committee of such Connecticut credit union shall receive compensation for services as a member of such committee, except a member of the supervisory committee may be compensated for the time actually spent performing audits and verifications.\n\n(g) In accordance with the bylaws of a Connecticut credit union, the officers of such credit union shall be members of the governing board who are elected by members of the governing board. The chairperson and vice chairperson shall not hold more than one office at a time. The duties of the officers shall be set forth in the bylaws.\n\n(h) (1) The governing board of a Connecticut credit union may fix the compensation of the employees of such credit union.\n\n(2) The directors, board-appointed committee members and members of senior management of a Connecticut credit union may be reimbursed for reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred and paid in the performance of their official duties.\n\n(i) (1) The governing board of a Connecticut credit union shall remove, by a two-thirds vote of its members at a regular or special meeting, a director or a board-appointed committee member who fails, without good cause, to attend three consecutive meetings of the governing board or committee or one-half of such meetings held during a calendar year, who is no longer qualified under subsection (e) of this section, or for any of the causes enumerated and in accordance with subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n(2) The governing board of a Connecticut credit union shall have the power to suspend at any time, by a two-thirds vote of its members, at a regular or special meeting, any director or member of a board-appointed committee for good cause, including, but not limited to, (a) a violation of any statute, regulation or order applicable to such credit union; (B) participation in any unsafe or unsound practice in connection with such credit union; (C) commission of or participation in a crime which is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year under state or federal law, as charged in any information, indictment or complaint, and if continued service or participation by such director or member may pose a threat to the interests of members of such credit union; (D) failure to perform such director's or member's duties or breach of such director's or member's fiduciary duty; (E) use of such director's or member's official position in a manner contrary to the interests of such credit union or its members; and (F) breach of a written agreement with the commissioner. The suspension shall take effect immediately and the commissioner shall be notified promptly of such suspension. Within seven business days after the effective date of the suspension, the governing board shall cause notice to be given to all members of the Connecticut credit union of a special meeting of members to be held for the purpose of hearing the report of the governing board regarding the suspension and voting on removal, provided such notice shall not be given if the director or member of a board-appointed committee who is subject to suspension resigns. The special meeting shall be held no more than twenty-one business days after the effective date of the suspension. The membership of the Connecticut credit union shall have, by majority vote, the authority to accept or reject the report of the governing board. The governing board shall take any action with respect thereto as the members deem necessary. If such action involves removal, the credit union shall promptly notify the commissioner of such removal.\n\n(j) (1) A vacancy on the governing board that exists due to the death, resignation or removal of a director shall be filled by majority vote of the remaining directors, regardless of whether the remaining directors constitute a quorum. A director elected by the governing board to fill a vacancy shall hold office until the next annual meeting, at which time the members of the credit union shall vote to fill the remainder of the unexpired term.\n\n(2) A vacancy on the governing board that exists due to the expiration of the term of a director shall be filled by the appointment of a successor director by the secretary unless there are a greater number of candidates than vacancies to be filled, in which case the vacancies shall be filled by a vote of the members of the Connecticut credit union.\n\n(k) (1) If the bylaws so provide, the governing board may appoint advisory directors and directors emeritus to serve as appointed directors without compensation. Appointed directors shall serve at the pleasure of the governing board to advise and consult with the board in carrying out the board's duties and responsibilities.\n\n(2) An advisory director need not be eligible for membership in the credit union, shall not be a member of the governing board, and shall not be entitled to vote on any matter before the board. An advisory director may participate in any governing board or committee deliberation, but shall not make any motions.\n\n(3) A director emeritus shall be a member of the credit union and shall not be an officer of the credit union, participate in any governing board or committee deliberations, make motions or vote on any matter before the governing board.\n\n(4) The number of appointed directors and their qualifications shall be specified in the bylaws.\n\n(P.A. 02-73, S. 45; P.A. 03-35, S. 4; 03-84, S. 52; 03-259, S. 23; P.A. 04-8, S. 6; P.A. 16-65, S. 1; P.A. 18-117, S. 2.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 03-35 amended Subsec.

The loan policy shall require written applications for all extensions of credit and address the categories and types of secured and unsecured extensions of credit offered by the credit union, the manner in which mortgage loans, member business loans and insider loans will be made and approved, underwriting guidelines and collateral requirements, and, in accordance with safety and soundness, acceptable standards for title review, title insurance and appraiser qualifications, procedures for the approval and selection of appraisers, appraisal and evaluation standards, and the credit union's administration of the appraisal and evaluation process.

      "text": "(a) Subject to the requirements of this section, a Connecticut credit union may make one or more mortgage loans to its members. As used in this section, the term “mortgage loan” means a closed-end loan or line of credit secured wholly or substantially by a lien on or interest in real estate, including a leasehold interest, and which is secured by a one-to-four family residence that is used as a personal residence of a member. As used in this section and section 36a-458a, the term “real estate” includes land and any structure and other improvement or equipment that is permanently attached to such land or structure. The term “mortgage loan” shall not include a member business loan, as defined in section 36a-458a.\n\n(b) A satisfactory certificate of title issued by a qualified person approved by the Connecticut credit union, or a satisfactory policy of title insurance, shall be filed with the lending Connecticut credit union until the mortgage loan is paid or sold.\n\n(c) The real estate shall be appraised or otherwise suitably evaluated before any mortgage loan is made on its security, by one or more suitable persons who are familiar with real estate values in the community where the real estate is located. Such persons shall be approved by the governing board of the Connecticut credit union making the loan, or any board-appointed committee or person appropriately designated by such governing board in accordance with the loan and insider policies of the Connecticut credit union, provided if the loan under consideration is a loan to be insured or guaranteed by a governmental agency, the appraiser may be one who appraised the real estate for the governmental agency. Such appraisal or evaluation shall be in writing, state the amount at which the real estate has been appraised or evaluated and be filed with the lending Connecticut credit union until the loan is paid or sold.\n\n(d) For the purposes of this subsection, the net equity value of real estate is the appraised value determined pursuant to this subsection, reduced by the value of any prior liens or encumbrances with the exception of leases, easements and reservations to the United States of fissionable materials. A mortgage loan made by a Connecticut credit union may not exceed in amount ninety per cent of the net equity value of the real estate except:\n\n(1) Loans guaranteed or insured by the United States government or its agencies, provided the amount of the guaranty or insurance is at least equal to the portion of the loan that exceeds the loan-to-value limit;\n\n(2) Loans backed by the full faith and credit of a state government, provided the amount of the assurance is at least equal to the portion of the loan that exceeds the loan-to-value limit;\n\n(3) Loans guaranteed or insured by a state, municipal or local government, or its agency, provided (a) the amount of the guaranty or insurance is at least equal to the portion of the loan that exceeds the loan-to-value limit, and (B) the Connecticut credit union has determined that the guarantor or insurer has the financial capacity and willingness to perform under the terms of the guaranty or insurance agreement;\n\n(4) Loans that are renewed, refinanced or restructured without the advancement of new funds or an increase in a line of credit, except for reasonable closing costs;\n\n(5) Loans that are renewed, refinanced or restructured in connection with workout situations involving existing loans from the Connecticut credit union to its members, either with or without the advancement of new funds, where such action is consistent with safe and sound lending practices and is a part of a clearly defined and well documented program to achieve orderly liquidation of the debt, reduce risk of loss or maximize recovery of the loan;\n\n(6) Loans that facilitate the sale of real estate acquired by the Connecticut credit union in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted in good faith; and\n\n(7) Loans where all or part of such loan is made in primary reliance upon the mortgage insurance policy of a private mortgage guaranty company, licensed by the Insurance Commissioner to do business in this state and approved by the commissioner.\n\n(e) A mortgage loan made by a Connecticut credit union secured by a first lien or interest shall have a maturity not exceeding forty-two years from the date of its making, and a mortgage loan to finance a manufactured home or secured by a subordinate lien shall have a maturity not exceeding twenty-five years from the date of its making. For purposes of this subsection, the term “manufactured home” means a movable dwelling containing living facilities suitable for year-round occupancy by one family, including permanent provision for eating, sleeping, cooling and sanitation, provided such dwelling is to be maintained as a residence of the purchaser and will, within ninety days after purchase, be located at a manufactured housing community or other semipermanent site within this state.\n\n(f) A mortgage loan made by a Connecticut credit union shall require repayment of principal and payment of interest in at least consecutive semiannual installments of principal and interest, such payments to be sufficient to pay the loan in full not later than forty-two years from the date of the first payment and the first payment to be made within twenty-four months from the date of the note. The requirements for semiannual principal payments pursuant to this subsection are not applicable to: (1) Consumer revolving loan agreements made pursuant to subsection (c) of section 49-2, (2) alternative mortgage loans made pursuant to section 36a-265, (3) loans that may be demanded at any time and that are secured by residential real estate, and (4) any other loan or class of loans determined by the commissioner not to be subject to such requirements.\n\n(g) A Connecticut credit union may make a mortgage loan secured by a first lien or interest for the construction or repair of buildings or other improvements on the property of the borrower, which loan may be made in installments advanced at the discretion of the credit union as the work progresses, provided at no time shall the ratio of the amount loaned to the then total value exceed fifty per cent or the ratio the final loan is to bear to the value of the completed real estate, whichever is the greater. Loans made to finance the construction of buildings and having a maturity of not more than twenty-four months or having a maturity of not more than thirty-six months, if approved by the commissioner, are not subject to the limitations imposed by subsection (f) of this section.\n\n(h) Attorneys' fees in connection with any mortgage loan made by a Connecticut credit union, including preparation of the mortgage deed and note, title search, waivers and closing fees or recording fees, shall be paid by the borrower unless otherwise determined by the credit union.\n\n(i) A Connecticut credit union may make and invest in any mortgage loan, including construction and improvement loans, insured by the Federal Housing Administration without regard to the limitations and restrictions of this section, except that such loans are subject to the following limitations: (1) In the case of loans secured by a first mortgage on real estate, the contract of insurance shall contain a provision that the debentures to be issued by the Federal Housing Administration in settlement of such insurance, in the event of the foreclosure or default of any such loan or mortgage, shall be fully guaranteed as to payment of principal and interest by the government of the United States, (2) if the credit union has a commitment for such insurance, issued by the Federal Housing Administration, it may grant a loan to a borrower for the purpose of building upon or improving the real estate of the borrower, the money so borrowed to be advanced at the discretion of the credit union in installments as the work progresses, provided the total of all advances made does not exceed eighty per cent of the value of the real estate on the date of each advance or the proportion that the final loan is to bear to the final estimated value of the real estate, whichever is the greater, except that the final advance may be in such an amount that the total of all advances made may equal but not exceed the amount of such commitment. The final advance shall not be made until the buildings or improvements have been inspected and approved by the Federal Housing Administration for an insured loan.\n\n(j) Without regard to the limitations and restrictions of this section, a Connecticut credit union may make and invest in any mortgage loan which the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs guarantees, makes a commitment to guarantee or insures.\n\n(k) A Connecticut credit union may make a mortgage loan secured by a leasehold interest, provided the leasehold estate has a term which does not expire prior to the maturity of the mortgage loan. The term of the leasehold estate shall not include any period for which the lease may grant an option of renewal.\n\n(l) A Connecticut credit union may invest its funds in mortgage loans which do not conform to the requirements of this section, provided the governing board or a board-appointed committee has reviewed the nonconforming aspects of the particular mortgage loan or mortgage loan program and has determined such loan or program to be prudent under the circumstances and all such mortgage loans outstanding at the time of origination do not exceed eight per cent of the total assets of the Connecticut credit union. The Connecticut credit union shall make a notation of the determination of whether such loan or program is prudent and the reasons for such determination in the applicable loan file. A loan which was included within the percentage of total assets limitation of this subsection subsequently may be excluded if the loan is repaid or if the nonconforming aspects are eliminated or otherwise cease to exist.\n\n(P.A. 02-73, S. 58; P.A. 03-84, S. 60; P.A. 17-236, S. 2; P.A. 18-117, S. 5.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 03-84 changed “Commissioner of Banking” to “commissioner” in Subsecs.

      "text": "(a)(1) Any Connecticut credit union or federal credit union may convert into a mutual savings bank, a mutual savings and loan association, or a mutual community bank, as defined in subsection (r) of section 36a-70, in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(2) Any conversion of a federal credit union pursuant to this section shall be authorized only if permitted by federal law and shall be subject to all requirements prescribed by federal law.\n\n(3) The converting credit union shall file with the commissioner: (a) A proposed plan of conversion which shall include current financial reports, current delinquent loan schedules, a combined financial report if applicable, a proposed business plan, a three-year financial forecast prepared by a certified public accounting firm or other professional firm approved by the commissioner, analyses of the regulatory effect of the conversion brought about by a change in the regulator, a method and schedule for terminating any nonconforming activities that would result from such conversion; (B) a copy of the proposed certificate of incorporation and proposed bylaws; and (C) a certificate by the secretary of the converting credit union that the proposed conversion has been approved by the governing board and the members, in accordance with subdivision (4) of this subsection in the case of a converting Connecticut credit union, and in accordance with federal law in the case of a converting federal credit union.\n\n(4) In the case of a converting Connecticut credit union, the plan of conversion shall require the approval of a majority of the governing board. After approving the plan of conversion, the governing board of the converting Connecticut credit union shall establish the date and time of a regular or special meeting of members for vote on the proposal. Written notice of the meeting at which the proposal is to be considered together with a mail ballot and a disclosure statement shall be hand-delivered or mailed to each member, at such member's last-known address as shown on the records of the converting Connecticut credit union, not more than thirty days or less than fourteen days prior to the date of the meeting. The disclosure statement shall include, at a minimum, a description of (a) the reasons for the proposed conversion; (B) the differences between membership rights in the converting credit union and depositor rights in the proposed mutual savings bank, mutual savings and loan association or mutual community bank; and (C) the significant differences between the authorized powers of the converting credit union and those of the proposed mutual savings bank, mutual savings and loan association or mutual community bank. The notice, disclosure statement and mail ballot shall be submitted to the commissioner for approval prior to distribution to members. Each member of the converting Connecticut credit union may cast one vote on the proposal. The affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members voting, including those votes cast in person and those ballots properly completed and received by the converting Connecticut credit union prior to the time of the meeting, shall be required for approval of the conversion.\n\n(b) The commissioner shall not approve the conversion unless the commissioner makes the considerations, determinations and findings required by subsections (c), (d) and (e) of this section.\n\n(c) The commissioner shall not approve the conversion unless the commissioner considers the following factors: (1) The population of the area to be served by the proposed mutual Connecticut bank; (2) the adequacy of existing banking facilities in the area to be served by the proposed mutual Connecticut bank; and (3) the character and experience of the proposed directors and officers.\n\n(d) The commissioner shall not approve the conversion unless the commissioner determines that: (1) The converting credit union has complied with all applicable provisions of law; (2) the converting credit union has equity capital at least equal to the minimum equity capital required for the organization of the type of mutual Connecticut bank to which it is converting; (3) the proposed conversion will serve the public necessity and convenience; (4) conditions in the locality in which the proposed mutual Connecticut bank will transact business afford reasonable promise of successful operation; (5) the proposed directors and executive officers possess capacity and fitness for the duties and responsibilities with which they will be charged; and (6) the programs, policies and procedures of the converting credit union relating to anti-money-laundering activity are adequate, and the converting credit union has a record of compliance with anti-money-laundering laws and regulations. If the commissioner cannot make such determination with respect to any such proposed director or proposed executive officer, the commissioner may refuse to allow such proposed director or proposed executive officer to serve in such capacity in the proposed mutual Connecticut bank. As used in this subsection, “executive officer” means every officer of the proposed mutual Connecticut bank who participates or has authority to participate, other than in the capacity of a director, in major policy-making functions of the proposed mutual Connecticut bank, regardless of whether such officer has an official title or whether such officer's title contains a designation of assistant or whether such officer serves without salary or other compensation. The vice president, the chief financial officer, secretary and treasurer of the proposed mutual Connecticut bank are presumed to be executive officers, unless, by resolution of the governing board or by the proposed mutual Connecticut bank's bylaws, any such officer is excluded from participation in major policy-making functions, other than in the capacity of a director of the proposed mutual Connecticut bank, and such officer does not actually participate in major policy-making functions.\n\n(e) The commissioner shall not approve the conversion unless the commissioner finds that the proposed mutual Connecticut bank will provide adequate services to meet the banking needs of all community residents, including low-income residents and moderate-income residents in accordance with a plan submitted by the converting credit union to the commissioner, in such form and containing such information as the commissioner may require. Upon receiving any such plan, the commissioner shall make the plan available for public inspection and comment at the Department of Banking and cause notice of its submission and availability for inspection and comment to be published in the department's weekly bulletin. With the concurrence of the commissioner, the converting credit union shall publish, in the form of a legal advertisement in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the area, notice of such plan's submission and availability for public inspection and comment. The notice shall state that the inspection and comment period will last for a period of thirty days from the date of publication. The commissioner shall not make such finding until the expiration of such thirty-day period. In making such finding, the commissioner shall consider, among other factors, whether the plan identifies specific unmet credit and consumer banking needs in the local community and specifies how such needs will be satisfied, provides for sufficient distribution of banking services among branches or satellite devices, or both, located in low-income neighborhoods, contains adequate assurances that banking services will be offered on a nondiscriminatory basis and demonstrates a commitment to extend credit for housing, small business and consumer purposes in low-income neighborhoods.\n\n(f) If the conversion is approved by the commissioner and the commissioner receives notification from the converting credit union that all approvals required under federal law, including approvals needed for deposit insurance by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or its successor agency have been obtained and that any waiting period prescribed by federal law has expired, a certificate of authority to commence business shall be issued by the commissioner. After receipt of the certificate of authority, the converting credit union shall promptly file such certificate of authority and its certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of the State and with the town clerk of the town in which its principal office is located. Upon such filing, the license of the converting credit union shall automatically lapse and the converting credit union shall cease to be a credit union and shall become a mutual savings bank, mutual savings and loan association or mutual community bank, as the case may be. Upon such conversion, the converted mutual Connecticut bank shall possess all of the rights, privileges and powers granted to it by its certificate of incorporation and by the provisions of the general statutes applicable to the type of institution into which it converted, and all of the assets and business of the converting credit union shall be transferred to and vested in it without any deed or instrument of conveyance, provided the converting credit union may execute any deed or instrument of conveyance as is convenient to confirm such transfer. The converted mutual Connecticut bank shall be subject to all of the duties, relations, obligations and liabilities of the converting credit union, whether as debtor, depository or otherwise, and shall be liable to pay and discharge all such debts and liabilities, to perform all such duties in the same manner and to the same extent as if the converted mutual Connecticut bank had itself incurred the obligation or liability or assumed the duty or relation. All rights of creditors of the converting credit union and all liens upon the property of such credit union shall be preserved unimpaired and the converted mutual Connecticut bank shall be entitled to receive, accept, collect, hold and enjoy any and all gifts, bequests, devises, conveyances and appointments in favor of or in the name of the converting credit union and whether made or created to take effect prior to or after the conversion.\n\n(g) Within ninety days after the conversion, the converted mutual Connecticut bank shall record a certificate, signed by the secretary and stating that the conversion is effective, in the office of the town clerk in each town in this state where the converted mutual Connecticut bank owns real property.\n\n(h) The converted mutual Connecticut bank may not exercise any of the fiduciary powers granted to Connecticut banks by law until express authority therefor has been given by the commissioner.\n\n(P.A. 02-73, S. 70; P.A. 03-84, S. 72; 03-196, S. 17; 03-259, S. 27; P.A. 04-257, S. 59.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 03-84 changed “Commissioner of Banking” to “commissioner”, effective June 3, 2003; P.A. 03-196 deleted requirement in Subsec.

The plan of dissolution shall be approved at an annual or special meeting of the members.
