      "text": "(a) No insurance company or health care center shall do any insurance business or health care center business within this state until and except while it is permitted to do so under the terms of a license issued by the commissioner. Any such company desiring to obtain such a license shall make application to the commissioner, setting forth the line or lines of business that it is seeking authorization to write. It shall file with the commissioner a certified copy of its charter or articles of association and evidence satisfactory to the commissioner that it has complied with the laws of the jurisdiction under which it is organized, a statement of its financial condition in such form as is required by the commissioner, together with such evidence of its correctness as the commissioner requires and evidence of good management in such form as is required by the commissioner. Applicant companies licensed in and operated from administrative offices in one state but domiciled in another state, as permitted by the applicable state law, shall provide justification of such arrangement, satisfactory to the commissioner, which shall demonstrate that regulatory influence of the domiciliary supervisory official has not been diminished as a result of such arrangement. An applicant shall demonstrate an orderly pattern of growth in its marketing territories in the geographic region, with the exception of a newly formed health care center, and an expertise in marketing and servicing the lines of insurance or the health care center business it desires to write. It shall submit evidence of its ability to provide continuous and timely claims settlement. If the information furnished is satisfactory to the commissioner and if all other requirements of law have been complied with, he may issue to such company a license permitting it to do business in this state. Each such license shall expire on the first day of May succeeding the date of its issuance, but may be renewed without any formalities except as required by the commissioner. Failure of a licensed company to exercise its authority to write a particular line or lines of business in this state for two consecutive calendar years may constitute sufficient cause for revocation of the company's authority to write those lines of business.\n\n(b) The commissioner shall adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 specifying the information and evidence that an insurance company or health care center desiring to obtain or renew a license to do an insurance business or health care center business shall submit and the requirements with which it shall comply.\n\n(c) The commissioner may, at any time, for cause, suspend, revoke or refuse to renew any such license or in lieu of or in addition to suspension or revocation of such license the commissioner, after reasonable notice to and hearing of any holder of such license, may impose a fine not to exceed fifty thousand dollars. Such hearings may be held by the commissioner or any person designated by the commissioner. Whenever a person other than the commissioner acts as the hearing officer, the person shall submit to the commissioner a memorandum of the person's findings and recommendations upon which the commissioner may base a decision. The commissioner may, if the commissioner deems it in the interest of the public, publish in one or more newspapers of the state a statement that, under the provisions of this section, the commissioner has suspended or revoked the license of any insurance company or health care center to do business in this state.\n\n(d) No license to do an insurance business within this state shall be issued to a foreign insurance company owned or financially controlled by another state of the United States or to an alien insurance company owned or financially controlled by a foreign nation or any state or province thereof.\n\n(e) No license to do an insurance business within this state shall be issued to any company which insures or plans to insure the separate risks of the employees of an employer that directly or indirectly controls the insurer by stock ownership or otherwise or exercises control of the operations of the insurer where the premiums written annually by the insurer on the separate risks of such employees exceed or will exceed ten per cent of the total premiums which the insurer writes or will write annually or where the commissions payable, if any, on premiums covering the risks of such employees written by the insurer annually exceed or will exceed ten per cent of the total commissions to agents which are or will be paid annually by the insurer.\n\n(f) Any company aggrieved by the action of the commissioner in revoking, suspending or refusing to renew a license or in imposing a fine may appeal therefrom, in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183, except venue for such appeal shall be in the judicial district of New Britain. Appeals under this section shall be privileged in respect to the order of trial assignment.\n\n(g) Except as provided in section 38a-92lan insurer shall be required to be licensed to transact financial guaranty insurance in this state, as defined in subdivision (1) of section 38a-92a. Prior to the issuance of a license to transact financial guaranty insurance business, an insurer shall submit for the approval of the commissioner a plan of operation detailing the types and projected diversification of guaranties that will be issued, the underwriting procedures that will be followed, managerial oversight methods, investment policies and other matters as may be prescribed by the commissioner.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith or in a manner which he did not reasonably believe to be in the best interests of the mutual insurance company or of the participants and beneficiaries of such employee benefit plan or trust and consistent with the provisions of such employee benefit plan or trust, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that he had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.\n\n(b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a domestic mutual insurance company shall indemnify any person who was or is a party, or was threatened to be made a party, to any action, suit or proceeding, by or in the right of the mutual insurance company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he, or the person whose legal representative he is, (1) is or was a director, officer or employee of the mutual insurance company, or (2) is or was serving at the request of the mutual insurance company (A) as a director, officer or employee of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or (B) as an agent of such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise other than an employee benefit plan or trust, or (3) is or was a director, officer, or employee of the mutual insurance company serving as a fiduciary of an employee benefit plan or trust maintained for the benefit of employees of the mutual insurance company or employees of any such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, or any appeal therein, in relation to matters as to which such person, or the person whose legal representative he is, is finally adjudged not to have breached his duty to the mutual insurance company, or where the court, on application as provided in subsection (d) of this section, shall have determined that in view of all the circumstances such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to be indemnified, and then for such amount as the court shall determine.

Plan Type A: At any time policyholder may withdraw funds only: (1) With an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, or (2) without such adjustment but in installments over five years or more, or (3) as an immediate life annuity, or (4) no withdrawal permitted.\n\nb. Plan Type B: Before expiration of the interest rate guarantee, policyholder may withdraw funds only: (1) With an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, or (2) without such adjustment but in installments over five years or more, or (3) no withdrawal permitted. At the end of the interest rate guarantee, funds may be withdrawn without such adjustment in a single sum or installments over less than five years.\n\nc. Plan Type C: Policyholder may withdraw funds before expiration of interest rate guarantee in a single sum or installments over less than five years either: (1) Without adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, or (2) subject only to a fixed surrender charge stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund.\n\n(vi) A company may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue year basis or on a change in fund basis. Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options shall be valued on an issue year basis. As used in this subsection, an issue year basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract. The change in fund basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in fund;\n\n(5) The reference interest rate referred to in subdivision (3) of this subsection shall be defined as follows: (A) For all life insurance, the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six months and the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June thirtieth of the calendar year next preceding the year of issue, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; (B) for single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June thirtieth of the calendar year of issue or year of purchase of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; (C) for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, with guarantee duration in excess of ten years, the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six months and the aver age over a period of twelve months, ending on June thirtieth of the calendar year of issue or purchase of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; (D) for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, with guarantee duration of ten years or less, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June thirtieth of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; (E) for other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June thirtieth of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; (F) for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, except as stated in subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June thirtieth of the calendar year of the change in the fund, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.\n\n(6) In the event that the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds is no longer published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or in the event that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners determines that the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. is no longer appropriate for the determination of the reference interest rate, an alternative method for determination of the reference interest rate, which is adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and approved by regulations adopted by the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, may be substituted.\n\n(g) (1) The provisions of this subsection shall apply, unless otherwise provided in this title, to policies and contracts issued prior to the operative date of the Valuation Manual, as set forth in section 38a-78a.\n\n(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h), (j) and (l) of this section, reserves according to the commissioners' reserve valuation method, for the life insurance and endowment benefits of policies providing for a uniform amount of insurance and requiring the payment of uniform premiums shall be the excess, if any, of the present value, at the date of valuation, of such future guaranteed benefits provided for by such policies, over the then present value of any future modified net premiums therefor. The modified net premiums for any such policy shall be such uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for such benefits that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of such benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision over subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, as follows: (A) A net level annual premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of such benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value, at the date of issue, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls due; provided such net level annual premium shall not exceed the net level annual premium on the nineteen-year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age at issue of such policy; and (B) a net one year term premium for such benefits provided for in the first policy year provided for any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1985, for which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than such excess premium, the reserve according to the commissioners' reserve valuation method as of any policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date defined herein as the first policy anniversary on which the sum of any endowment benefit and any cash surrender value then available is greater than such excess premium shall, except as otherwise provided in subsection (j) of this section, be the greater of the reserve as of such policy anniversary calculated as described in this subsection and the reserve as of such policy anniversary calculated as described in this subsection but with the value defined in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision being reduced by fifteen per cent of the amount of such excess first year premium, all present values of benefits and premiums being determined without reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date, the policy being assumed to mature on such date as an endowment, and the cash surrender value provided on such date being considered as an endowment benefit. In making the above comparison, the mortality and interest bases stated in subsections (e) and (f) of this section shall be used. Reserves according to the commissioners' reserve valuation method for: (i) Life insurance policies providing for a varying amount of insurance or requiring the payment of varying premiums; (ii) group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under Section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended; (iii) disability and accidental death benefits in all policies and contracts; and (iv) all other benefits, except life insurance and endowment benefits in life insurance policies and benefits provided by all other annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of this subsection.\n\n(h) This subsection shall apply, unless otherwise provided in this title, to all annuity and pure endowment contracts issued prior to the operative date of the Valuation Manual, as set forth in section 38a-78a, other than group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under Section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended. Reserves according to the commissioners' annuity reserve method for benefits under annuity or pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in such contracts, shall be the greatest of the respective excesses of the present values, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits, provided for by such contracts at the end of each respective contract year, over the present value, at the date of valuation, of any future valuation considerations derived from future gross considerations, required by the terms of such contract, that become payable prior to the end of such respective contract year. The future guaranteed benefits shall be determined by using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate, or rates, specified in such contracts for determining guaranteed benefits. The valuation considerations are the portions of the respective gross considerations applied under the terms of such contracts to determine nonforfeiture values.\n\n(i) (1) The provisions of this subsection shall apply, unless otherwise provided in this title, to policies and contracts issued prior to the operative date of the Valuation Manual, as set forth in section 38a-78a.\n\n(2) In no event shall a company's aggregate reserves for all life insurance policies, excluding disability and accidental death benefits, issued on or after the effective date as specified in accordance with the provisions of subsection (h) of section 38-130e of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to 1981, be less than the aggregate reserves calculated in accordance with the methods set forth in this subsection and subsections (f), (g) and (k) of this section, and the mortality table or tables and rate or rates of interest used in calculating nonforfeiture benefits for such policies.\n\n(3) In no event shall the aggregate reserves for all policies, contracts and benefits be less than the aggregate reserves determined by the qualified actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required under subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(4) Reserves for any category of policies, contracts or benefits as established by the commissioner may be calculated, at the option of the company, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for such category than those calculated according to the minimum standard herein provided, but the rate or rates of interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall not be greater than the corresponding rate or rates of interest used in calculating any nonforfeiture benefits provided for in the policies or contracts.\n\n(5) Any such company which at any time shall have adopted any standard of valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to the minimum standard herein provided may, with the approval of the commissioner, adopt any lower standard of valuation, but not lower than the minimum herein provided; provided, for the purposes of this subsection, the holding of additional reserves previously determined by a qualified actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required under subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of this section shall not be deemed to be the adoption of a higher standard of valuation.\n\n(j) (1) The provisions of this subsection shall apply, unless otherwise provided in this title, to policies and contracts issued prior to the operative date of the Valuation Manual, as set forth in section 38a-78a.\n\n(2) If in any contract year the gross premium charged by any life insurance company on any policy or contract, in force as of or written after the effective date as specified in accordance with the provisions of subsection (h) of section 38-130e of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to 1981, is less than the valuation net premium for the policy or contract calculated by the method used in calculating the reserve thereon but using the most recent minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest, the minimum reserve required for such policy or contract shall be the greater of either the reserve calculated according to the mortality table, rate of interest, and method actually used for such policy or contract, or the reserve calculated by the method actually used for such policy or contract but using the minimum standards of mortality and rate of interest in effect in the year that the policy or contract was issued and replacing the valuation net premium by the actual gross premium in each contract year for which the valuation net premium exceeds the actual gross premium. The minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest referred to in this subsection are those standards stated in subsections (d) and (f) of this section. For any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1985, for which the gross premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than such excess premium, the foregoing provisions of this subsection shall be applied as if the method actually used in calculating the reserve for such policy were the method described in subsection (g) of this section. The minimum reserve at each policy anniversary of such policy shall be the greater of the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with subsection (g) of this section and the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with this subsection.\n\n(k) (1) The provisions of this subsection shall apply, unless otherwise provided in this title, to policies and contracts issued prior to the operative date of the Valuation Manual, as set forth in section 38a-78a.\n\n(2) In the case of any plan of life insurance that provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurance company based on then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance or annuity that is of such nature that the minimum reserves cannot be determined by the methods described in subsections (g), (h) and (j) of this section, the reserves that are held under any such plan shall be appropriate in relation to the benefits and the pattern of premiums for that plan, and be computed by a method that is consistent with the principles of this standard valuation law, as determined by regulations adopted by the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54.\n\n(l) The commissioner shall adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 containing the minimum standards applicable to the valuation of health insurance plans issued prior to the operative date of the Valuation Manual, as set forth in section 38a-78a.\n\n(m) (1) The provisions of this subsection shall apply to policies and contracts issued on or after the operative date of the Valuation Manual, as set forth in section 38a-78a. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a society subject to section 38a-614, unless such society elects to use the standards pursuant to subdivision (9) of subsection (a) of section 38a-614.\n\n(2) For policies or contracts subject to a principle-based valuation as specified in the Valuation Manual, a company shall establish reserves using a principle-based valuation that:\n\n(A) Quantifies the benefits, guarantees and funding associated with such policies or contracts and their risks, at a level of conservatism that reflects conditions that include unfavorable events that have a reasonable probability of occurring during the lifetime of such policies or contracts. For policies or contracts with significant tail risk, the principle-based valuation shall reflect appropriately adverse conditions to quantify the tail risk;\n\n(B) Incorporates assumptions, risk analysis methods, financial models and management techniques that are consistent with, but not necessarily identical to, those utilized within the company's overall risk assessment process while recognizing potential differences in financial reporting structures and any prescribed assumptions or methods;\n\n(C) Incorporates assumptions derived in one of the following ways: (i) The assumption is prescribed in the Valuation Manual; or (ii) for an assumption not prescribed in the Valuation Manual, (I) the assumption is established utilizing the company's available experience, to the extent such experience is relevant and statistically credible, or (II) to the extent company data is not available, relevant or statistically credible, the assumption is established utilizing other relevant and statistically credible experience; and\n\n(D) Provides margins for uncertainty including adverse deviation and estimation error, such that the greater the uncertainty, the larger the margin and resulting reserves.\n\n(3) A company using principle-based valuation for one or more policies or contracts subject to subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section shall:\n\n(A) Establish procedures for corporate governance and oversight of the actuarial valuation function consistent with those described in the Valuation Manual;\n\n(B) Provide to the commissioner and such company's board of directors an annual certification of the effectiveness of the internal controls with respect to the principle-based valuation. Such controls shall be designed to ensure that all material risks inherent in the liabilities and associated assets subject to such valuation are included in the valuation and that such valuations are made in accordance with the Valuation Manual. The certification shall be based on the internal controls in place as of the end of the preceding calendar year; and\n\n(C) Develop and file with the commissioner upon request a principle-based valuation report that complies with standards prescribed in the Valuation Manual.\n\n(4) A principle-based valuation may include a prescribed formulaic reserve component.\n\n(n) (1) The provisions of this subsection shall apply to policies and contracts issued on or after the operative date of the Valuation Manual, as set forth in section 38a-78a. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a society subject to section 38a-614, unless such society elects to use the standards pursuant to subdivision (9) of subsection (a) of section 38a-614.\n\n(2) A company shall submit mortality, morbidity, policyholder behavior or expense experience and other data as prescribed in the Valuation Manual.\n\n(o) (1) The provisions of sections 38a-77 and 38a-433 shall apply to policies issued by a company before the date of its election to comply with section 38-130e of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to 1981, or January 1, 1981, whichever occurred first.\n\n(2) The provisions of section 38-130e of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to 1981, shall apply to policies issued by a company on and after the date of such election or on and after January 1, 1981, whichever occurred first, and before October 1, 1981.\n\n(P.A. 78-312, S. 4; P.A. 81-170, S. 2; P.A. 90-243, S. 56; P.A. 91-175, S. 2; P.A. 05-162, S. 2; P.A. 14-195, S. 1; P.A. 17-15, S. 6, 7; P.A. 18-68, S. 1; 18-158, S. 3.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 81-170 authorized the use of new mortality tables, specified the formula used in calculating the interest rate for determining a company's maximum reserves and provided for the reference interest rate as an average over a specified time period of Moody's Corporate Index; P.A. 90-243 made technical corrections substituting “alien” for “foreign”, “the” for “such”, “foreign” for “nonresident” and amended the method for calculating the reserves on life insurance policies in Subsec.

Credit shall be allowed under subsection (d) or (e) of this section only if the applicable requirements of subsection (i) of this section have been satisfied.\n\n(b) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in this state.\n\n(c) (1) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is accredited by the commissioner as a reinsurer in this state. To be eligible for accreditation, an insurer shall (A) file with the commissioner evidence of its submission to this state's jurisdiction, (B) submit to this state's authority to examine its books and records, (C) be licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state, or in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer is entered through and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state, (D) file annually with the commissioner a copy of its annual statement filed with the insurance department of its state of domicile and a copy of its most recent audited financial statement, and (E) demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commissioner that it has adequate financial capacity to meet its reinsurance obligations and is otherwise qualified to assume reinsurance from a domestic insurer. An assuming insurer shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this subparagraph if it maintains a surplus with regard to policyholders of not less than twenty million dollars at the time of accreditation and its accreditation has not been denied by the commissioner within ninety days after the date the insurer submitted its application.\n\n(2) Each accredited reinsurer doing business in this state shall, annually, on or before the first day of March, submit to the commissioner, by electronically filing with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a true and complete report, signed and sworn to by its president or a vice president, and secretary or an assistant secretary, of its financial condition on the thirty-first day of December next preceding, prepared in accordance with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners annual statement instructions handbook and following those accounting procedures and practices prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners accounting practices and procedures manual, subject to any deviations in form and detail as may be prescribed by the commissioner. An electronically filed report in accordance with section 38a-53a that is timely submitted to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners shall be deemed to have been submitted to the commissioner in accordance with this subdivision.\n\n(d) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is domiciled and licensed in, or in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer is entered through, a state that employs standards regarding credit for reinsurance substantially similar to those applicable in this state and the assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer (1) maintains a surplus with regard to policyholders in an amount not less than twenty million dollars, and (2) submits to the authority of this state to examine its books and records. The requirement of subdivision (1) of this subsection shall not apply to reinsurance ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system.\n\n(e) (1) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that maintains a trust that complies with the requirements of subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection in a qualified United States financial institution, as defined in section 38a-87, for the payment of the valid claims of its United States policyholders and ceding insurers, and their assigns and successors in interest. The assuming insurer shall (A) report annually to the commissioner information substantially the same as that required to be reported in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' Annual Statement form by licensed insurers, to enable the commissioner to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund, and (B) submit to, and pay the expenses of, examination of its books and records by the commissioner.\n\n(2) (A) No credit for reinsurance shall be allowed under subdivision (1) of this subsection unless:\n\n(i) The form of the trust and any amendments to the trust have been approved by (I) the insurance regulatory official of the state of domicile of the trust, or (II) the insurance regulatory official of another state who has, pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument, accepted principal regulatory oversight of the trust;\n\n(ii) The form of the trust and any amendments to the trust have been filed with the insurance regulatory officials of each state in which ceding insurer beneficiaries of the trust are domiciled; and\n\n(iii) The trust instrument (I) provides that a contested claim shall be valid and enforceable upon the entry of a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, and (II) vests legal title to its assets in its trustees for the benefit of the assuming insurer's domestic and foreign policyholders and ceding insurers, and their assigns and successors in interest.\n\n(B) (i) The trust shall be subject to examination by the commissioner and shall remain in effect for as long as the assuming insurer has outstanding obligations due under the reinsurance agreements subject to the trust.\n\n(ii) Not later than March first, annually, the trustee of the trust shall (I) report to the commissioner, in writing, the balance and a list of the investments of the trust at the end of the preceding calendar year, and (II) certify to the commissioner the date of termination of the trust, if so planned, or that the trust will not expire prior to the following December thirty-first.\n\n(3) (A) (i) In the case of a single assuming insurer, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account with funds in an amount not less than the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by domestic and foreign ceding insurers and, unless otherwise provided in subparagraph (A)(ii) of this subdivision, the assuming insurer shall maintain a trusteed surplus of not less than twenty million dollars.\n\n(ii) (I) The insurance regulatory official with principal oversight of the trust may authorize a reduction in the required trusteed surplus.\n\n(II) For a trust over which the commissioner has principal regulatory oversight, at any time after the assuming insurer has permanently discontinued for at least three full years underwriting new business secured by the trust, the commissioner may authorize a reduction in the required trusteed surplus. Such reduction shall be made only after the commissioner finds, based on a risk assessment, that the reduced surplus level is adequate to protect domestic and foreign policyholders and ceding insurers and claimants in light of reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development. The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and shall consider all material risk factors, including, when applicable, the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer's liquidity or solvency. The minimum required surplus shall not be reduced to an amount less than thirty per cent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by domestic and foreign ceding insurers covered by the trust.\n\n(B) In the case of an assuming insurer that is a group including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters:\n\n(i) (I) For reinsurance ceded under a reinsurance agreement with an inception date prior to January 1, 1993, and not amended or renewed after said date, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account with funds in an amount not less than such underwriters' several insurance and reinsurance liabilities attributable to business written in the United States; or\n\n(II) For reinsurance ceded under a reinsurance agreement with an inception date on or after January 1, 1993, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account with funds in an amount not less than such underwriters' several liabilities attributable to business ceded by domestic and foreign ceding insurers to any underwriter who is a member of the group;\n\n(ii) In addition to a trust specified in subparagraph (B)(i)(I) or (B)(i)(II) of this subdivision, the group shall maintain, for all years of account, a trusteed surplus of which one hundred million dollars shall be held jointly for the benefit of domestic and foreign ceding insurers of any member of the group;\n\n(iii) The incorporated members of the group shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the group and shall be subject to the same level of solvency regulation and solvency control by the group's domiciliary insurance regulatory official as are the unincorporated members; and\n\n(iv) Not later than ninety days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group's domiciliary insurance regulatory official, the group shall provide to the commissioner an annual certification by the group's domiciliary insurance regulatory official of the solvency of each underwriter who is a member of the group or, if such certification is not provided by the group's domiciliary insurance regulatory official, financial statements prepared by independent public accountants of each such underwriter.\n\n(C) In the case of a group of incorporated underwriters under common administration:\n\n(i) The group shall be accredited and have continuously transacted an insurance business outside the United States for at least three years immediately prior to applying for accreditation;\n\n(ii) The trust shall consist of a trusteed account with funds in an amount not less than such underwriters' several liabilities attributable to business ceded by domestic and foreign ceding insurers pursuant to a reinsurance contract issued in the name of the group to any underwriter who is a member of the group;\n\n(iii) In addition to such trust, the group shall maintain (I) an aggregate policyholders' surplus of not less than ten billion dollars, and (II) a joint trusteed surplus of which one hundred million dollars shall be held jointly for the benefit of domestic and foreign ceding insurers of any member of the group as additional security for these liabilities; and\n\n(iv) Not later than ninety days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group's domiciliary insurance regulatory official, the group shall make available to the commissioner an annual certification by the group's domiciliary insurance regulatory official of the solvency of each underwriter who is a member of the group and financial statements prepared by independent public accountants of each such underwriter.\n\n(f) (1) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is certified in accordance with section 38a-85a by the commissioner as a reinsurer in this state and such certified reinsurer maintains security in a form and amounts set forth in subdivision (3) of subsection (e) of this section or, for a multibeneficiary trust set forth in subdivision (2) of subsection (e) of section 38a-85a, in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (2) of subsection (e) of section 38a-85a.\n\n(2) If the security is not sufficient with respect to obligations incurred by a certified reinsurer, the commissioner shall reduce the credit allowed by an amount proportionate to the deficiency and may impose further reductions in the credit allowed if the commissioner finds there is a material risk that such obligations will not be paid in full when due.\n\n(g) (1) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer meeting each of the conditions set forth below:\n\n(A) The assuming insurer shall have its head office or be domiciled in, as applicable, and be licensed in a reciprocal jurisdiction. A “reciprocal jurisdiction” is a jurisdiction that meets one of the following:\n\n(i) A non-United States jurisdiction that is subject to an in-force covered agreement with the United States, each within its legal authority, or, in the case of a covered agreement between the United States and the European Union, is a member state of the European Union. For purposes of this subsection, a “covered agreement” is an agreement entered into pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 31 USC Sections 313 and 314, that is currently in effect or in a period of provisional application and addresses the elimination, under specified conditions, of collateral requirements as a condition for entering into any reinsurance agreement with a ceding insurer domiciled in this state or for allowing the ceding insurer to recognize credit for reinsurance;\n\n(ii) A United States jurisdiction that meets the requirements for accreditation under the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' financial standards and accreditation program; or\n\n(iii) A qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (c) of section 38a-85a, which is not otherwise described in subparagraph (A)(i) or (A)(ii) of this subdivision and which meets certain additional requirements, consistent with the terms and conditions of in-force covered agreements, as specified by the commissioner in regulations adopted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54.\n\n(B) The assuming insurer shall have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, calculated according to the methodology of its domiciliary jurisdiction, in an amount to be set forth in regulation. If the assuming insurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, it shall have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, minimum capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities, calculated according to the methodology applicable in its domiciliary jurisdiction, and a central fund containing a balance in amounts to be set forth in regulation.\n\n(C) The assuming insurer shall have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, a minimum solvency or capital ratio, as applicable, which will be set forth in regulation. If the assuming insurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, it shall have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, a minimum solvency or capital ratio in the reciprocal jurisdiction where the assuming insurer has its head office or is domiciled, as applicable, and is also licensed.\n\n(D) The assuming insurer shall agree and provide adequate assurance to the commissioner, in a form specified by the commissioner pursuant to regulation, as follows:\n\n(i) The assuming insurer shall provide prompt written notice and explanation to the commissioner if it falls below the minimum requirements set forth in subparagraph (B) or (C) of this subdivision, or if any regulatory action is taken against it for serious noncompliance with applicable law;\n\n(ii) The assuming insurer shall consent in writing to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state and to the appointment of the commissioner as agent for service of process. The commissioner may require that consent for service of process be provided to the commissioner and included in each reinsurance agreement. Nothing in this provision shall limit, or in any way alter, the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, except to the extent such agreements are unenforceable under applicable insolvency or delinquency laws;\n\n(iii) The assuming insurer shall consent in writing to pay all final judgments, wherever enforcement is sought, obtained by a ceding insurer or its legal successor, that have been declared enforceable in the jurisdiction where the judgment was obtained;\n\n(iv) Each reinsurance agreement shall include a provision requiring the assuming insurer to provide security in an amount equal to one hundred per cent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded pursuant to that agreement if the assuming insurer resists enforcement of a final judgment that is enforceable under the law of the jurisdiction in which it was obtained or a properly enforceable arbitration award, whether obtained by the ceding insurer or by its legal successor on behalf of its resolution estate; and\n\n(v) The assuming insurer shall confirm that it is not presently participating in any solvent scheme of arrangement that involves this state's ceding insurers, and agree to notify the ceding insurer and the commissioner and to provide security in an amount equal to one hundred per cent of the assuming insurer's liabilities to the ceding insurer, should the assuming insurer enter into such a solvent scheme of arrangement. Such security shall be in a form consistent with the provisions of subsection (f) of this section and sections 38a-85a and 38a-86 and as specified in regulations adopted by the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54.\n\n(E) The assuming insurer or its legal successor shall provide, if requested by the commissioner, on behalf of itself and any legal predecessors, certain documentation to the commissioner, as specified by the commissioner in regulation.\n\n(F) The assuming insurer shall maintain a practice of prompt payment of claims under reinsurance agreements, pursuant to criteria set forth in regulation.\n\n(G) The assuming insurer's supervisory authority shall confirm to the commissioner on an annual basis, as of the preceding December thirty-first or at the annual date otherwise statutorily reported to the reciprocal jurisdiction, that the assuming insurer complies with the requirements set forth in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this subdivision.\n\n(H) Nothing in this provision precludes an assuming insurer from providing the commissioner with information on a voluntary basis.\n\n(2) The commissioner shall timely create and publish a list of reciprocal jurisdictions.\n\n(A) A list of reciprocal jurisdictions is published through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' committee process. The commissioner's list shall include any reciprocal jurisdiction as defined under subparagraphs (A)(i) and (A)(ii) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, and shall consider any other reciprocal jurisdiction included on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' list. The commissioner may approve a jurisdiction that does not appear on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' list of reciprocal jurisdictions in accordance with criteria to be developed under regulations adopted by the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54.\n\n(B) The commissioner may remove a jurisdiction from the list of reciprocal jurisdictions upon a determination that the jurisdiction no longer meets the requirements of a reciprocal jurisdiction, in accordance with a process set forth in regulations adopted by the commissioner pursuant to chapter 54, except that the commissioner shall not remove from the list a reciprocal jurisdiction as defined under subparagraphs (A)(i) and (A)(ii) of subdivision (1) of this subsection. Upon removal of a reciprocal jurisdiction from this list, credit for reinsurance ceded to an assuming insurer which has its home office or is domiciled in that jurisdiction shall be allowed, if otherwise allowed pursuant to this section and sections 38a-85a to 38a-88, inclusive.\n\n(3) The commissioner shall timely create and publish a list of assuming insurers that have satisfied the conditions set forth in this subsection and to which cessions shall be granted credit in accordance with this subsection. The commissioner may add an assuming insurer to such list if a National Association of Insurance Commissioners accredited jurisdiction has added such assuming insurer to a list of such assuming insurers or if, upon initial eligibility, the assuming insurer submits the information to the commissioner as required under subparagraph (D) of subdivision (1) of this subsection and complies with any additional requirements that the commissioner may impose by regulation, except to the extent that they conflict with an applicable covered agreement.\n\n(4) If the commissioner determines that an assuming insurer no longer meets one or more of the requirements under this subsection, the commissioner may revoke or suspend the eligibility of the assuming insurer for recognition under this subsection in accordance with procedures set forth in regulation.\n\n(A) While an assuming insurer's eligibility is suspended, no reinsurance agreement issued, amended or renewed after the effective date of the suspension qualifies for credit except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with section 38a-86.\n\n(B) If an assuming insurer's eligibility is revoked, no credit for reinsurance may be granted after the effective date of the revocation with respect to any reinsurance agreements entered into by the assuming insurer, including reinsurance agreements entered into prior to the date of revocation, except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the contract are secured in a form acceptable to the commissioner and consistent with the provisions of section 38a-86.\n\n(5) If subject to a legal process of rehabilitation, liquidation or conservation, as applicable, the ceding insurer, or its representative, may seek and, if determined appropriate by the court in which the proceedings are pending, may obtain an order requiring that the assuming insurer post security for all outstanding ceded liabilities.\n\n(6) Nothing in this subsection shall limit or in any way alter the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree on requirements for security or other terms in that reinsurance agreement, except as expressly prohibited by this section and sections 38a-85a to 38a-88, inclusive, or other applicable law or regulation.\n\n(7) Credit may be taken under this subsection only for reinsurance agreements entered into, amended or renewed on or after October 1, 2021, and only with respect to losses incurred and reserves reported on or after the later of the date on which the assuming insurer has met all eligibility requirements pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection, and the effective date of the new reinsurance agreement, amendment or renewal.\n\n(A) This subsection does not alter or impair a ceding insurer's right to take credit for reinsurance, to the extent that credit is not available under this subsection, as long as the reinsurance qualifies for credit under any other applicable provision of this section or sections 38a-85a to 38a-88, inclusive.\n\n(B) Nothing in this subsection shall authorize an assuming insurer to withdraw or reduce the security provided under any reinsurance agreement except as permitted by the terms of the agreement.\n\n(C) Nothing in this subsection shall limit, or in any way alter, the capacity of parties to any reinsurance agreement to renegotiate the agreement.\n\n(h) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer not meeting the requirements of subsection (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of this section but only with respect to the insurance of risks located in jurisdictions where such reinsurance is required by applicable law or regulation of that jurisdiction.\n\n(i) If the assuming insurer is not licensed, accredited or certified to transact insurance or reinsurance in this state, the credit permitted by subsection (d) or (e) of this section shall not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees (1) that in the event of the failure of the assuming insurer to perform its obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the assuming insurer, at the request of the ceding insurer, shall (A) submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction in any state of the United States, (B) comply with all requirements necessary to give such court jurisdiction, and (C) abide by the final decision of such court or any appellate court in the event of an appeal, and (2) to designate the commissioner or a designated attorney as its true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the ceding company. This provision is not intended to conflict with or override the obligation of the parties to a reinsurance agreement to arbitrate their disputes, if such an obligation is created in the agreement.\n\n(j) If the assuming insurer does not meet the requirements of subsection (b), (c), (d) or (g) of this section, the credit permitted by subsection (e) or (f) of this section shall not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees to the following conditions in the trust instrument:\n\n(1) Notwithstanding any provision of the trust instrument, if the trust contains an amount less than the amount required under subdivision (3) of subsection (e) of this section or if the grantor of the trust has been declared insolvent or placed in receivership, rehabilitation, liquidation or a similar proceeding under the laws of its state or country of domicile, the trustee shall comply with an order of the insurance regulatory official with principal regulatory oversight of the trust or with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction that directs the trustee to transfer all trust assets to the insurance regulatory official with principal regulatory oversight of the trust;\n\n(2) The trust assets shall be distributed by and claims filed with and valued by the insurance regulatory official with principal regulatory oversight of the trust in accordance with the laws of the trust's state of domicile that are applicable to the liquidation of domestic insurance companies;\n\n(3) The trustee shall distribute any trust assets or part thereof that are returned by the insurance regulatory official with principal regulatory oversight of the trust, based on such regulatory official's determination that such assets or part thereof are not necessary to satisfy the claims of domestic and foreign ceding insurers of the grantor of the trust, in accordance with the trust instrument; and\n\n(4) The grantor of the trust waives any right otherwise available to the grantor under law that is inconsistent with subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, of this subsection.\n\n(k) (1) (A) The commissioner may suspend or revoke a reinsurer's accreditation or certification if, after notice and hearing, the commissioner finds such reinsurer no longer meets the requirements for accreditation or certification.\n\n(B) If a certified reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction ceases to be a qualified jurisdiction, as set forth in section 38a-85a, the commissioner may suspend the reinsurer's certification indefinitely, in lieu of revocation.\n\n(2) The commissioner may suspend or revoke a reinsurer's accreditation or certification without notice and a hearing if:\n\n(A) The reinsurer waives its right to a hearing;\n\n(B) The commissioner's action is based on (i) regulatory action taken by a regulatory official of the reinsurer's state of domicile, or (ii) the voluntary surrender or termination of the reinsurer's eligibility to transact the business of insurance or reinsurance in its state of domicile or its primary certifying jurisdiction as described in subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 38a-85a; or\n\n(C) The commissioner finds that immediate action is required to protect the public and a court of competent jurisdiction has not stayed the commissioner's action.\n\n(3) (A) While a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is suspended, no credit shall be allowed under this section for a reinsurance contract issued or renewed by the reinsurer on or after the effective date of such suspension, except to the extent that such reinsurer's obligations under such contract are secured in accordance with the provisions of section 38a-86.\n\n(B) If a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is revoked, no credit shall be allowed under this section on and after the effective date of such revocation, except to the extent that such reinsurer's obligations under such contract are secured in accordance with the provisions of subsection (e) of section 38a-85a or section 38a-86.\n\n(4) A reinsurer whose certification has been suspended, revoked or voluntarily surrendered or is inactive shall be treated as a certified reinsurer required to secure one hundred per cent of its obligations, except that this requirement shall not apply to a reinsurer whose certification has been suspended or is inactive if the commissioner continues to assign a high rating to such reinsurer pursuant to section 38a-85a.\n\n(5) Any person aggrieved by the action of the commissioner in revoking or suspending an accreditation or a certification may appeal therefrom in accordance with the provisions of section 38a-19.\n\n(l) (1) A domestic ceding insurer shall manage its reinsurance recoverables in proportion to its own book of business. Such insurer shall notify the commissioner not later than thirty days after (A) reinsurance recoverables from any single assuming insurer or group of affiliated assuming insurers exceed fifty per cent of the domestic ceding insurer's last reported surplus to policyholders, or (B) the domestic ceding insurer determines that reinsurance recoverables from any single assuming insurer or group of affiliated assuming insurers are likely to exceed such limit. Any such notice shall demonstrate that the exposure is safely managed by the domestic ceding insurer.\n\n(2) A ceding insurer shall manage its reinsurance program to ensure diversification. A domestic ceding insurer shall notify the commissioner not later than thirty days after (A) it has ceded to any single assuming insurer or group of affiliated assuming insurers more than twenty per cent of the domestic ceding insurer's gross written premiums in the prior calendar year, or (B) the domestic ceding insurer determines that the reinsurance ceded to any single assuming insurer or group of affiliated assuming insurers is likely to exceed such limit.

The commissioner shall require the subject insurance business to submit annually such information as may be necessary to determine whether the appropriate occupancy and employment requirements have been met at all times during an income year. If the commissioner determines that such requirements have been so met, he shall issue a certification of continued eligibility to that effect to the subject insurance business on or before the first day of the third month following the close of the subject insurance business's income year.\n\n(7) The commissioner shall, upon request, provide a copy of the eligibility certificate and the certification required under subdivision (6) of this subsection to the Commissioner of Revenue Services.\n\n(8) (A) If (i) the number of new employees on account of which a taxpayer claimed the credit allowed by this subsection decreases to less than twenty-five per cent of its total work force for more than sixty days during any of the taxable years for which a credit is claimed, (ii) those employees are not replaced by other employees who have not been shifted from an existing location of the subject insurance business in this state, and (iii) the subject insurance business has relocated operations conducted in the new facility to a location outside this state, the taxpayer shall be required to recapture a percentage, as determined under the provisions of subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, of the credit allowed under this subsection on its tax return and no subsequent credit shall be allowed.

The commissioner may engage the services of attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, independent certified public accountants, or other professionals and specialists to assist in conducting the examinations under this section as examiners, the cost of which shall be borne by the company which is the subject of the examination. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, no domestic captive insurance company subject to examination under this section shall pay, as costs associated with the examination, the salaries, fringe benefits, traveling and maintenance expenses of examining personnel of the Insurance Department engaged in such examination if such domestic company is otherwise liable to assessment levied under section 38a-47, except that such company shall pay the traveling and maintenance expenses of examining personnel of the department when such company is examined outside the state.\n\n(2) In conducting the examination, the commissioner, the commissioner's actuary or any examiner authorized by the commissioner may examine, under oath, the officers and agents of such a company and all persons deemed to have material information regarding the company's property or business. Each such company, its officers and agents shall produce the books and papers, in its or their possession, relating to its business or affairs, and any other person may be required to produce any book or paper, in his custody, deemed to be relevant to such examination for the inspection of the commissioner, the commissioner's actuary or examiners, when required. The officers and agents of the company shall facilitate the examination and aid the examiners in making the same so far as it is in their power to do so. The refusal of any company by its officers, directors, employees or agents to submit to examination or to comply with any reasonable written request of the examiners shall be grounds for suspension of, or revocation of or nonrenewal of any license or authority held by the company to engage in an insurance or other business subject to the commissioner's jurisdiction. Any such proceedings for suspension, revocation or nonrenewal of any license or authority shall be conducted pursuant to section 38a-91ii.\n\n(3) In conducting the examination, the examiner shall observe those guidelines and procedures set forth in the examiners' handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

Findings of fact and conclusions made pursuant to any examination shall be prima facie evidence in any legal or regulatory action.\n\n(2) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit the commissioner's authority in such legal or regulatory action to use and, if appropriate, to make public any final or preliminary examination report, any examiner or company workpapers or other documents, or any other information discovered or developed during the course of any examination.\n\n(3) Not later than sixty days after completion of the examination, the examiner in charge shall file, under oath, with the Insurance Department a verified written report of examination. Upon receipt of the verified report, the Insurance Department shall transmit the report to the company examined, together with a notice which shall afford the company examined a reasonable opportunity, not to exceed thirty days, to make a written submission or rebuttal with respect to any matters contained in the examination report. Not later than thirty days after the period allowed for the receipt of written submissions or rebuttals, the commissioner shall fully consider and review the report, together with any written submissions or rebuttals and any relevant portions of the examiner's workpapers and enter an order: (A) Adopting the examination report as filed or with modification or corrections.

The findings and conclusions, which form the basis of any such order of the commissioner, shall be subject to review as provided in section 38a-19.\n\n(2) Any investigatory hearing conducted under subparagraph (C) of subdivision (3) of subsection (d) of this section by the commissioner or authorized representative shall be conducted as a nonadversarial confidential investigatory proceeding as necessary for the resolution of any inconsistencies, discrepancies or disputed issues apparent (A) upon the filed examination report, (B) raised by or as a result of the commissioner's review of relevant workpapers, or (C) by the written submission or rebuttal of the company. Not later than twenty days after conclusions of any such hearing, the commissioner shall enter an order pursuant to subparagraph (A) of subdivision (3) of subsection (d) of this section. The commissioner shall not appoint an examiner as an authorized representative to conduct the hearing. The hearing shall proceed expeditiously with discovery by the company limited to the examiner's workpapers which tend to substantiate any assertions set forth in any written submission or rebuttal. The commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative may issue subpoenas for the attendance of any witnesses or the production of any documents deemed relevant to the investigation whether under the control of the department, the company or other persons. The documents produced shall be included in the record and testimony taken by the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative shall be under oath and preserved for the record. Nothing contained in this section shall require the department to disclose any information or records which would indicate or show the existence or content of any investigation or activity of a criminal justice agency. The hearing shall proceed with the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative posing questions to the persons subpoenaed.

Cross-examination shall be conducted only by the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative. The company and the Insurance Department shall be permitted to make closing statements and may be represented by counsel of their choice.\n\n(f) The commissioner may, if the commissioner deems it in the public interest, publish any such report or the result of any such examination contained in such report in one or more newspapers of the state.\n\n(g) Nothing contained in this section shall prevent or be construed as prohibiting the commissioner from disclosing the content of an examination report, preliminary examination report or results, or any matter relating to such report to (1) insurance regulatory officials of this or any other state or country, (2) law enforcement officials of this or any other state, or (3) any agency of this or any other state or of the federal government at any time, provided such agency or office receiving the report or matters relating to such report agrees, in writing, that such documents shall be confidential.\n\n(h) All workpapers, recorded information, documents and copies thereof produced by, obtained by or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in the course of an examination made under this section shall (1) be confidential, (2) not be subject to subpoena, and (3) not be made public by the commissioner or any other person, except to the extent provided in subsection (g) of this section. Access to such information may be granted by the commissioner to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, as long as it agrees, in writing, that such information shall be confidential.\n\n(i) (1) The commissioner may engage the services of, from time to time, on an individual basis, qualified actuaries, certified public accountants or other similar individuals who are independently practicing their professions, even though such persons may, from time to time, be similarly employed or retained by persons subject to examination under this section.\n\n(2) No cause of action shall arise nor shall any liability be imposed against the commissioner, the commissioner's authorized representatives or any examiner appointed by the commissioner for any statements made or conduct performed in good faith while carrying out the provisions of this section.\n\n(3) No cause of action shall arise, nor shall any liability be imposed, against any person for the act of communicating or delivering information or data to the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative examiner pursuant to an examination made under this section, if such act of communication or delivery was performed in good faith and without fraudulent intent or the intent to deceive.\n\n(4) This section does not abrogate or modify in any way any common law or statutory privilege or immunity heretofore enjoyed by any person identified in subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n(5) A person identified in subdivision (2) of this subsection shall be entitled to an award of attorney's fees and costs if he is the prevailing party in a civil action for libel, slander or any other relevant tort arising out of activities in carrying out the provisions of this section and the party bringing the action was not substantially justified in doing so.

The court's order may be made in respect of one or more protected cells by name, rather than the special purpose financial captive insurance company generally.\n\n(i) (1) Upon the issuance by a court of any order of conservation, rehabilitation, or liquidation of a special purpose financial captive insurance company or one or more of the special purpose financial captive insurance company's protected cells, the receiver shall manage the assets and liabilities of the special purpose financial captive insurance company or the applicable protected cell in accordance with the provisions of this section and section 38a-91ss.\n\n(2) The assets attributable to one protected cell shall not be applied to the liabilities attributable to another protected cell unless an asset or liability is attributable to more than one protected cell, in which case the receiver shall deal with the asset or liability in accordance with the terms of any relevant governing instrument or contract. Recourse to the special purpose financial captive insurance company's general account in connection with the conservation, rehabilitation or liquidation of a protected cell shall be limited to the greater of the amount of assets in the general account as of the date such proceeding is commenced or the required minimum capital for the general account as of the date such proceeding is commenced. The assets attributable to one protected cell shall not be set off against the liabilities attributable to another protected cell, and assets attributable to the special purpose financial captive insurance company's general account shall not be set off against the liabilities attributable to any protected cell except to the extent provided in this subdivision.\n\n(3) Relief shall not be granted nor shall any order be issued based on equitable theories of recovery, including substantive consolidation, equitable subordination or recoupment, to attach or seize the assets of any solvent protected cell for the benefit of another protected cell or special purpose financial captive insurance company or to pierce the corporate veil of any protected cell, in connection with the conservation, rehabilitation or liquidation of a special purpose financial captive insurance company or one or more protected cells, unless such equitable theories, attachment, seizure or corporate veil piercing would apply to such cell if it were a special purpose financial captive insurance company without separate cells.\n\n(j) Notwithstanding any provision in the contracts or other documentation governing the special purpose financial captive insurance company insurance securitization, amounts recoverable by the receiver of a special purpose financial captive insurance company shall not be reduced or diminished as a result of the entry of an order of conservation, rehabilitation or liquidation with respect to the ceding insurer.\n\n(k) (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 704c:\n\n(A) An application, a petition, a temporary restraining order or an injunction issued pursuant to the provisions of chapter 704c with respect to a ceding insurer shall not prohibit (i) a special purpose financial captive insurance company from transacting business with the ceding insurer, including making any payment pursuant to a special purpose financial captive insurance company security with respect to a protected cell, or (ii) any action or proceeding against a special purpose financial captive insurance company or its assets;\n\n(B) The commencement of a summary proceeding or other interim proceeding commenced before a formal delinquency proceeding or the issuance of any order by the court with respect to a special purpose financial captive insurance company shall not prohibit such company from making payments or taking any action required to make such payments pursuant to a special purpose financial captive insurance company security with respect to a protected cell or a special purpose financial captive insurance company contract;\n\n(C) A receiver of a ceding insurer shall not void a nonfraudulent transfer by a ceding insurer to a special purpose financial captive insurance company of money or other property made pursuant to a reinsurance contract;\n\n(D) A receiver of a special purpose financial captive insurance company shall not void (i) a nonfraudulent transfer by the special purpose financial captive insurance company of money or other property made to a ceding insurer pursuant to a reinsurance contract or made to or for the benefit of any holder of a special purpose financial captive insurance company security with respect to a protected cell, or (ii) a special purpose financial captive insurance company security;\n\n(E) (i) In the event of an insolvency of a special purpose financial captive insurance company where one or more protected cells remain solvent, the commissioner shall separate such cells from such company and shall, on application of a sponsor, allow for the conversion of such cells into one or more special purpose financial captive insurance companies. The commissioner shall issue such orders as the commissioner deems necessary to protect the solvency of the remaining solvent protected cells.\n\n(ii) In the event of an insolvency of a protected cell, the special purpose financial captive insurance company's assets shall be accounted for and managed in accordance with subsection (i) of this section and other applicable laws of this state.\n\n(2) The provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection shall not prohibit the commissioner from taking any action permitted under chapter 704c with respect only to the conservation or rehabilitation of a special purpose financial captive insurance company with protected cell or cells, provided the commissioner has sufficient grounds to seek to declare such company insolvent. In such case, with respect to the solvent protected cell or cells, the commissioner shall not prohibit such company from making payments or taking any action required to make such payments pursuant to a special purpose financial captive insurance company security, reinsurance contract or insurance securitization transaction that are attributable to such cell or cells.\n\n(l) Except for the fulfillment of the obligations under a special purpose financial captive insurance company contract, the assets of a special purpose financial captive insurance company, including assets held in trust, shall not be consolidated with or included in the estate of a ceding insurer in any delinquency proceeding against the ceding insurer for any purpose.\n\n(Oct.

There shall be five incorporators of such captive insurance company, who shall be appointed in the following manner: One by the Governor, one by the speaker, one by the minority leader of the House of Representatives, one by the president pro tempore and one by the Republican president pro tempore of the Senate. The incorporators, in their discretion, may appoint other individuals to form an organizing committee.

For purposes of this subdivision, “the total investment of the insurer” includes: (A) Any direct investment by the insurer in an asset, and (B) the insurer's proportionate share of any investment in an asset by any subsidiary or affiliate of the insurer, which shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of the subsidiary's or affiliate's investment by the percentage of the ownership of such subsidiary or affiliate; and (3) with the approval of the commissioner, invest any greater amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations or other securities of one or more subsidiaries or affiliates, provided after such investment the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.\n\n(b) In determining the financial condition of an insurance company, its investments in subsidiaries or affiliates shall be valued in accordance with any applicable valuation method approved by the commissioner and consistent with procedures promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\n\n(c) With respect to the activities conducted by a domestic insurer's subsidiaries, the commissioner shall have the power to: (1) Order said company to curtail the conduct of any activity if he finds, after notice and opportunity to be heard, that such activity is not lawful or is against public policy or that the continuation of such activity is materially adverse to the interests of the insurer's policyholders; and (2) require separate books, accounts and records for such classes of activities of the insurance company subsidiary as he shall determine, which books, accounts and records shall be so maintained as to disclose clearly and accurately the nature and details of such activities.

If a purchase of securities results in a presumption of control as set forth in subdivision (3) of subsection (b) of section 38a-129, such purchase shall be deemed not to be solely for investment purposes unless (A) the insurance regulatory official of such insurance company's state of domicile accepts a disclaimer of control from such insurance company or such regulatory official affirmatively finds that control does not exist, and (B) such regulatory official communicates such disclaimer or affirmative finding to the commissioner;\n\n(2) The acquisition of a person by another person when neither person is directly or through affiliates primarily engaged in the business of insurance;\n\n(3) The acquisition of an affiliate;\n\n(4) An acquisition if, as an immediate result of such acquisition, (A) the combined market share of the involved insurers will not exceed five per cent of the total market in any market, (B) there will be no increase in any market share, or (C) (i) the combined market share of the involved insurers will not exceed twelve per cent of the total market in any market, and (ii) the market share will not increase more than two per cent of the total market in any market;\n\n(5) An acquisition for which a preacquisition notification would be required solely due to the resulting effect on the ocean marine insurance line of business in this state;\n\n(6) An acquisition of an insurance company that is affirmatively determined by the insurance regulatory official of such insurance company's state of domicile to be in failing condition and (A) there is a lack of a feasible alternative to improving such condition, (B) the public benefits of improving such insurance company's condition through the acquisition exceed the public benefits that would arise from not causing a reduction in competition in this state, and (C) such regulatory official has communicated such determination and findings to the Insurance Commissioner.\n\n(c) For an acquisition not exempt under subsection (b) of this section, the acquiring party shall file a preacquisition notification in accordance with this section and the acquired party may file a preacquisition notification. The commissioner shall treat any information filed under this subsection as confidential in the same manner as provided under section 38a-137.\n\n(1) The preacquisition notification shall be in such form and contain such information as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners prescribes. The commissioner may require additional material and information the commissioner deems necessary, including, but not limited to, the opinion of an economist as to the impact of the proposed acquisition on competition in this state, to evaluate whether the proposed acquisition will violate the competitive standard described in subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(2) There shall be a waiting period after the acquiring party files the preacquisition notification. Such waiting period shall begin on the date the commissioner receives the preacquisition notification and shall end on the thirtieth day after such date or upon termination by the commissioner of such waiting period, whichever is earlier. Prior to the end of the waiting period, the commissioner may require, on a one-time basis, the acquiring party or the acquired party to submit additional needed information relevant to the proposed acquisition, in which case the waiting period shall end on the thirtieth day after the commissioner receives the additional information or upon termination by the commissioner of such waiting period, whichever is earlier.\n\n(d) (1) For a proposed acquisition not exempt under subsection (b) of this section, the commissioner shall evaluate whether such proposed acquisition will reduce substantially competition in any line of insurance business in this state or tend to create a monopoly in this state. In making such evaluation, the commissioner shall consider the percentages of market share the involved insurers possess and the market in which the involved insurers compete.\n\n(A) (i) With respect to an acquisition involving more than two involved insurers, if a comparison of the percentage of market share of the insurance company with the largest market share, designated as Insurer A, against each involved insurer shows for any such comparison that the percentages exceed those in the tables set forth in this subparagraph, such showing shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of the competitive standards described in this subdivision. Percentages not shown in the tables shall be interpolated proportionately to the percentages shown:\n\n(I) In a highly concentrated market and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:\n\nInsurer AInsurer B4%4% or more10%2% or more15%1% or more\n\n(II) In a market not highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:\n\nInsurer AInsurer B5%5% or more10%4% or more15%3% or more19%1% or more\n\n(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, a highly concentrated market is one in which the share of the four largest insurance companies is seventy-five per cent or more of the market.\n\n(B) (i) An acquisition involving two or more involved insurers competing in the same market shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of the competitive standards described in this subdivision if (I) there is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market, (II) one of the involved insurers is included in a grouping of large insurance companies that shows the increase in market share specified in subparagraph (B)(ii) of this subdivision, and (III) another involved insurer's market share is two per cent or more.\n\n(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, there is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market when the aggregate market share for any grouping of the largest insurance companies in the market, from the two largest to the eight largest, has increased by seven per cent or more of the market over a period extending from any base year not less than five years and not more than ten years prior to the proposed acquisition.\n\n(2) For purposes of subdivision (1) of this subsection, “market” means the relevant product and geographical markets. In determining the relevant product and geographical markets, the commissioner shall give due consideration to (A) definitions or guidelines, if any, promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, (B) information submitted, if any, by an acquiring party or an acquired party, and (C) any other information the commissioner deems relevant. In the absence of sufficient information to the contrary, the relevant product market shall be the direct written insurance premium for a line of business, such line being that used in the annual statement insurance companies doing business in this state are required to file with the commissioner, and the relevant geographical market shall be this state.\n\n(3) (A) An acquiring party or an acquired party may rebut a prima facie violation set forth in subdivision (1) of this subsection based on substantial evidence of the absence of the requisite anticompetitive effect. Factors relevant to such rebuttal include, but are not limited to, the involved insurers' market shares, the volatility of market leader rankings, the number of competitors in the market, the concentration and the trend in concentration in the insurance industry and ease of entry to and exit from the market.\n\n(B) The commissioner may find, based on substantial evidence, a violation of the competitive standards described in subdivision (1) of this subsection that is not a prima facie violation as set forth in said subdivision (1).\n\n(e) (1) (A) If the commissioner finds that a proposed acquisition violates the competitive standards described in subdivision (1) of subsection (d) of this section or if an acquiring party fails to file or fails to provide adequate information in the preacquisition notification required under subsection (c) of this section, the commissioner may issue an order, after notice and hearing, (i) directing an involved insurer to cease and desist from doing business in this state with respect to any line of insurance involved in the violation, or (ii) denying the application of an involved insurer for a license to do business in this state.\n\n(B) The commissioner shall not issue such order unless (i) there is a hearing, (ii) notice of the hearing is provided to the involved insurers prior to the end of the waiting period specified in subsection (c) of this section and not less than fifteen days prior to the hearing, and (iii) the hearing is concluded and the order issued not later than sixty days after the date the acquiring party filed the preacquisition notification under subsection (c) of this section. Any such order shall be accompanied by a written decision by the commissioner setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\n(C) Any person who violates a cease and desist order of the commissioner may, after notice and hearing, be fined not more than ten thousand dollars for each day of such violation or be subject to suspension or revocation of such person's license or both.\n\n(D) An order issued pursuant to this subdivision shall not apply if the proposed acquisition is not consummated.\n\n(2) The commissioner shall not issue an order under subdivision (1) of this subsection if:\n\n(A) The proposed acquisition will yield substantial economies of scale or economies in resource utilization that cannot be feasibly achieved in any other way and the public benefits that would arise from such economies exceed the public benefits that would arise from not causing a reduction in competition in this state; or\n\n(B) The proposed acquisition will substantially increase the availability of insurance in this state and the public benefits of such increase exceed the public benefits that would arise from not causing a reduction in competition in this state.\n\n(f) Any person that fails to make a filing required under this section and fails to demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with such filing requirement shall be fined not more than fifty thousand dollars.\n\n(1969, P.A. 444, S. 3; P.A. 12-103, S. 3.)\n\nHistory: Sec. 38-39c transferred to Sec. 38a-131 in 1991; P.A. 12-103 replaced former provisions permitting person required to file information statement to use a registration statement under Securities Act of 1933 or Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with Subsecs.

The commissioner shall consider the information required under subdivision (1) of subsection (c) of section 38a-131 and the considerations specified in subdivision (1) of subsection (d) of section 38a-131 in evaluating the effect of the merger or other acquisition of control on competition in this state.\n\n(B) The commissioner shall not disapprove the merger or other acquisition of control on the basis of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision if the commissioner finds that a situation as described in subdivision (2) of subsection (e) of section 38a-131 exists.\n\n(C) The commissioner may condition the approval of the merger or other acquisition of control on the correction or removal, within a specified period of time, of the basis of the commissioner's disapproval under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision;\n\n(3) The financial condition of any acquiring party is such as might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurance company or prejudice the interests of its policyholders;\n\n(4) The plans or proposals of the acquiring party to liquidate the insurance company, sell such insurance company's assets or consolidate or merge such insurance company with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or corporate structure or management, are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders of the insurance company and not in the public interest;\n\n(5) The competence, experience and integrity of those persons who would control the operation of the insurance company are such that it would not be in the interest of policyholders of the insurance company and of the public to permit the merger or other acquisition of control; or\n\n(6) The acquisition is likely to be hazardous or prejudicial to those buying insurance.\n\n(b) (1) Any public hearing held by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be held not later than thirty days after the statement required by section 38a-130 is filed with the commissioner.

All discovery proceedings shall be concluded not later than three days prior to the commencement of the public hearing.\n\n(3) If a proposed merger or other acquisition of control under section 38a-130 requires the approval of any other insurance regulatory official of another state, a public hearing may be held on a consolidated basis at the discretion of the commissioner. Such hearing shall be held within the United States before the insurance regulatory officials of the states in which the insurance companies are domiciled, who shall hear and receive evidence. An insurance regulatory official may attend such hearing in person or by telecommunication.\n\n(4) The commissioner shall make a determination not later than thirty days after the conclusion of the hearing whether to approve such merger or other acquisition of control. If there will be a change of control of a domestic insurance company, the commissioner shall additionally make a determination not later than thirty days after the conclusion of the hearing whether the acquiring party shall be required to maintain or restore such insurance company's capital to the level required under this title.\n\n(c) All expenses incurred by the commissioner in connection with the proceedings under this section, including expenses for the services of any attorneys, actuaries, accountants and other experts not otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist the commissioner in reviewing the proposed merger or other acquisition of control shall be paid by the person filing the statement required by section 38a-130.\n\n(1969, P.A. 444, S. 4; P.A. 75-289; P.A. 78-331, S. 17, 58; P.A. 85-16, S. 3, 6; P.A. 92-112, S. 15, 35; P.A. 12-103, S. 4; P.A. 13-134, S. 6; P.A. 17-15, S. 8.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 75-289 added Subsec.

Any insurance company that is subject to registration under this section shall register not later than fifteen days after it becomes subject to registration, and annually thereafter by June first of each year for the previous calendar year, unless the commissioner, for good cause shown, extends the time for registration, in which case it shall register within such extended time.\n\n(b) (1) Every insurance company subject to registration shall file a registration statement that shall contain the following current information:\n\n(A) The capital structure, general financial condition, ownership and management of the insurance company and any person controlling the insurance company;\n\n(B) The identity and relationship of every member of the insurance holding company system;\n\n(C) The following agreements in force, and transactions outstanding or that have occurred during the last calendar year between such insurance company and its affiliates: (i) Loans, other investments, or purchases, sales or exchanges of securities of the affiliates by the insurance company or of the insurance company by its affiliates; (ii) purchases, sales or exchanges of assets; (iii) transactions not in the ordinary course of business; (iv) guarantees or undertakings for the benefit of an affiliate that result in an actual contingent exposure of the insurance company's assets to liability, other than insurance contracts entered into in the ordinary course of the insurance company's business; (v) management agreements, service contracts and cost-sharing arrangements; (vi) reinsurance agreements; (vii) dividends and other distributions to securityholders; and (viii) consolidated tax allocation agreements;\n\n(D) Any pledge of the insurance company's stock, including stock of any subsidiary or controlling affiliate, for a loan made to any member of the insurance holding company system;\n\n(E) If requested by the commissioner, financial statements of or within an insurance holding company system, including all affiliates. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, annual audited financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended from time to time, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended from time to time.

Unless the commissioner by regulation or order provides otherwise, sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, investments, or guarantees involving one-half of one per cent or less of the insurance company's admitted assets as of the thirty-first day of December next preceding shall not be deemed material for purposes of this section.\n\n(d) Subject to subsection (b) of section 38a-136, each registered insurance company shall report to the commissioner all dividends and other distributions to securityholders not later than fifteen business days after the declaration thereof or such other period as the commissioner shall prescribe by regulation.\n\n(e) Any person within an insurance holding company system subject to registration shall be required to provide complete and accurate information to an insurance company, where such information is reasonably necessary to enable the insurance company to comply with the provisions of sections 38a-129 to 38a-140, inclusive.\n\n(f) (1) The ultimate controlling person of each insurance company subject to registration under this section shall file an annual enterprise risk report in a form and manner prescribed by the commissioner. Beginning in 2014 and annually thereafter, the report shall be filed by June first for the previous calendar year. The annual enterprise risk report shall identify, to the best of such person's knowledge and belief, the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the insurance company. The report shall be filed with the lead state commissioner as determined by the procedures in NAIC's applicable financial analysis handbook. Such report shall (A) be confidential by law and privileged, (B) not be subject to disclosure under section 1-210, (C) not be subject to subpoena, and (D) not be subject to discovery or admissible in any civil action. The commissioner shall not make such report public without the prior written consent of the ultimate controlling person that filed such report unless the commissioner, after giving the ultimate controlling person and the insurance company to which such report pertains and its affiliates within the insurance holding company system who would be affected thereby notice and opportunity to be heard, determines that the interests of policyholders, securityholders or the public will be served by the publication thereof, in which event the commissioner may publish all or any part thereof in such manner as the commissioner may deem appropriate. The commissioner may use such report in the furtherance of any regulatory or legal action brought as part of the commissioner's official duties.\n\n(2) The commissioner may share the enterprise risk report only with the insurance regulatory official of another state with laws or regulations substantially similar to subsection (a) of section 38a-137 and who has agreed, in writing, to maintain the confidentiality and privileged status of such report.\n\n(g) (1) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to registration shall concurrently file with such registration an annual group capital calculation not later than June first of each year, with the lead state commissioner. The report shall be completed in accordance with the NAIC group capital calculation instructions, which may permit the lead state commissioner to allow a controlling person that is not the ultimate controlling person to file the group capital calculation. The report shall be filed with the lead state commissioner of the insurance holding company system as determined by the lead state commissioner in accordance with the procedures contained in the Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by the NAIC.\n\n(2) An insurance holding company system shall be exempt from filing the group capital calculation if it is:\n\n(A) An insurance holding company system that has only one insurer within its holding company structure, that only writes business and is only licensed in its domestic state and assumes no business from any other insurer;\n\n(B) An insurance holding company system that is subject to the group capital requirements applicable to an insurance group that owns a depository institution or institutions by the United States Federal Reserve Board. The lead state commissioner shall request such group capital requirements applicable to the insurance group from the United States Federal Reserve Board under the terms of information sharing agreements in effect. If the United States Federal Reserve Board cannot share the calculation with the lead state commissioner, the insurance holding company system shall not be exempt from the group capital calculation filing;\n\n(C) An insurance holding company system whose non-United States group-wide supervisor is located within a reciprocal jurisdiction as described in section 38a-85 that recognizes the United States regulatory approach to group supervision and group capital; or\n\n(D) An insurance holding company system:\n\n(i) That provides information to the lead state commissioner that meets the requirements for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and accreditation program, either directly or indirectly through the group-wide supervisor, who has determined such information is satisfactory to allow the lead state commissioner to comply with the NAIC group supervision approach, as detailed in the NAIC Financial Analysis Handbook; and\n\n(ii) Whose non-United States group-wide supervisor that is not in a reciprocal jurisdiction recognizes and accepts, as specified by the lead state commissioner in regulation, the group capital calculation as the world-wide group capital assessment for United States insurance groups who operate in that jurisdiction.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (C) and (D) of subdivision (2) of this subsection, a lead state commissioner shall require the group capital calculation for the United States operations of any non-United States based insurance holding company system where, after any necessary consultation with other supervisors or officials, it is determined appropriate by the lead state commissioner for prudential oversight and solvency monitoring purposes or for ensuring competitiveness of the insurance marketplace.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (D) of subdivision (2) of this subsection, the lead state commissioner shall have the discretion to exempt the ultimate controlling person from filing the annual group capital calculation or to accept a limited group capital filing or report in accordance with criteria as specified by the lead state commissioner in regulation.\n\n(5) If the lead state commissioner determines that an insurance holding company system no longer meets one or more of the requirements for an exemption for filing the group capital calculation under subdivision (2) of this subsection, the insurance holding company system shall file the group capital calculation at the next annual filing date unless given an extension by the lead state commissioner based on reasonable grounds shown.\n\n(6) The information reported and provided to the lead state commissioner by an insurance holding company, including an insurance holding company supervised by the United States Federal Reserve Board pursuant to this subsection, shall:\n\n(A) Be confidential by law and privileged;\n\n(B) Not be subject to disclosure under section 1-210;\n\n(C) Not be subject to subpoena; and\n\n(D) Not be subject to discovery or admissible in any civil action.\n\n(7) The group capital calculation and resulting group capital ratio required pursuant to this subsection are regulatory tools for assessing group risks and capital adequacy and are not intended as a means to rank insurers or insurance holding company systems generally.\n\n(h) The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to registration and also scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework shall file the results of a specific year's liquidity stress test to the lead state insurance commissioner of the insurance holding company system as determined by procedures within the Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by the NAIC.\n\n(1) The NAIC liquidity stress test framework includes scope criteria applicable to a specific data year. These scope criteria are reviewed at least annually by the NAIC Financial Stability Task Force or its successor. Any change to the NAIC liquidity stress test framework or to the data year for which the scope criteria are to be measured shall be effective on January first of the year following the calendar year when such changes are adopted. Insurers meeting at least one threshold of the scope criteria shall be considered scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework for the specified data year unless the lead state commissioner, in consultation with the NAIC Financial Stability Task Force or its successor, determines the insurer should not be scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework for that data year. Insurers that do not trigger at least one threshold of the scope criteria shall be considered scoped out of the NAIC liquidity stress test framework for the specified data year, unless the lead state insurance commissioner, in consultation with the NAIC Financial Stability Task Force or its successor, determines the insurer should be scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework for that data year.\n\n(2) The performance of, and filing of the results from, a specific year's liquidity stress test shall comply with the NAIC liquidity stress test framework's instructions and reporting templates for that year and any lead state insurance commissioner determinations, in conjunction with the NAIC Financial Stability Task Force or its successor, provided within the NAIC liquidity stress test framework.\n\n(3) The information reported and provided to the lead state commissioner by an insurance holding company, including an insurance holding company supervised by the United States Federal Reserve Board pursuant to this subsection, shall:\n\n(A) Be confidential by law and privileged;\n\n(B) Not be subject to disclosure under section 1-210;\n\n(C) Not be subject to subpoena; and\n\n(D) Not be subject to discovery or admissible in any civil action.\n\n(4) The liquidity stress test along with its results and supporting disclosures required pursuant to this subsection are regulatory tools for assessing group liquidity risks and are not intended as a means to rank insurers or insurance holding company systems generally.\n\n(i) The commissioner shall terminate the registration of any insurance company that demonstrates that it no longer is a member of an insurance holding company system.\n\n(j) The commissioner may require or allow two or more affiliated insurance companies subject to registration hereunder to file a consolidated registration statement.\n\n(k) The commissioner may allow an insurance company that is authorized to do business in this state and is part of an insurance holding company system to register on behalf of any affiliated insurer that is required to register under subsection (a) of this section and to file all information and materials required to be filed under this section.\n\n(l) Any person may file with the commissioner a disclaimer of affiliation with any insurance company and any insurance company may file a disclaimer of affiliation with any other person. The disclaimer shall fully disclose all material relationships and bases for affiliation between such person and such insurance company as well as the basis for disclaiming such affiliation. After a disclaimer has been filed, the insurance company shall be relieved of any duty to register or report under this section that may arise out of the insurance company's relationship with such person unless the commissioner disallows such disclaimer. The commissioner shall disallow such disclaimer only after furnishing all parties in interest with notice and an opportunity to be heard, and after making specific findings of fact to support such disallowance.\n\n(m) The failure to file a registration statement or any amendment, addition thereto or summary or an enterprise risk report required by this section within the time specified for such filing shall be a violation of sections 38a-129 to 38a-140, inclusive.\n\n(n) The commissioner may by regulation or order exempt any insurance company or class of insurance companies from registration under this section if, in the commissioner's judgment, registration by such company or class of companies is not necessary to effectuate the purposes of said sections.\n\n(o) A foreign or alien insurer shall not be required to register pursuant to this section if it is (1) subject to disclosure requirements and standards adopted by statute or regulation in the jurisdiction of its domicile that are substantially similar to those contained in this section and subsections (a), (b), (f) and (g) of section 38a-136, or (2) admitted in the domiciliary jurisdiction of the principal insurer in its holding company system and in said jurisdiction is subject to disclosure requirements and standards adopted by statute or regulation that are substantially similar to those contained in this section and subsections (a), (b), (f) and (g) of section 38a-136. The commissioner may require any authorized insurer that is a member of a holding company system not subject to registration under this section to furnish a copy of the registration statement or other information filed by such insurance company with the insurance regulatory authority of its domicile or the domicile of the principal insurer in its holding company system, as the case may be.\n\n(p) (1) To assess the business strategy, financial, legal or regulatory position risk exposure, risk management or governance processes of a domestic insurance company registered under this section that is part of an insurance holding company system that has international operations, and as part of the examination pursuant to section 38a-14a of such insurance company, the commissioner may initiate, be a member of or participate in a supervisory college, which shall be a temporary or permanent forum for communication between and cooperation among state, federal and international regulatory officials.\n\n(2) If the commissioner initiates a supervisory college, the commissioner shall (A) establish the membership of, and participation by state, federal or international regulatory officials in, such supervisory college, (B) establish the functions of the supervisory college and the role of members and participants, and select a chairperson for such supervisory college, (C) coordinate the activities of the supervisory college, including meeting planning and processes for information sharing that comply with the applicable confidentiality provisions set forth in section 38a-137, and (D) establish a crisis management plan for such supervisory college.\n\n(3) The commissioner may enter into written agreements with state, federal or international regulatory officials for the governing of the activities of a supervisory college. Any such agreements shall maintain the confidentiality requirements under section 38a-137.\n\n(4) Each insurance company subject to registration under this section shall be assessed for and shall pay to the commissioner its share of the reasonable costs, including reasonable travel expenses, of the commissioner's participation in a supervisory college. Such payment shall be in addition to any other taxes, fees and moneys otherwise payable to the state. The commissioner shall establish the assessment method for such costs and provide reasonable notice to each insurance company subject to any such assessment.\n\n(5) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of the commissioner to regulate an insurance company or its affiliate under the commissioner's jurisdiction or to delegate any regulatory authority of the commissioner to a supervisory college.\n\n(q) (1) As used in this subsection: (A) “Group-wide supervisor” means the regulatory official (i) authorized by such official's jurisdiction to conduct and coordinate group-wide supervisory activities, and (ii) who is determined or acknowledged to be the group-wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group pursuant to this subsection; and (B) “internationally active insurance group” means any insurance holding company system that (i) includes an insurance company registered pursuant to this section, and (ii) meets the following criteria: (I) Premiums are written in at least three countries; (II) the percentage of gross premiums written, including, for purposes of this subsection, administrative service fees, associated expenses and claims payments, without such amounts transacted in the United States is at least ten per cent of the insurance holding company system's total gross written premiums; and (III) based on a three-year rolling average, the total assets of the insurance holding company system are at least fifty billion dollars or the total gross written premiums of the insurance holding company system are at least ten billion dollars.\n\n(2) (A) The commissioner, in cooperation with other state, federal and international regulatory agencies of the jurisdictions where members of the internationally active insurance group are domiciled, shall determine a single group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group. An insurance holding company system that does not qualify as an internationally active insurance group may request that the commissioner make a determination or acknowledgment of a group-wide supervisor as set forth in this subsection.\n\n(B) The commissioner may determine that the commissioner is the appropriate group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group that conducts substantial insurance business operations in this state and may act as a group-wide supervisor for any internationally active insurance group in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(C) The commissioner may acknowledge that the regulatory official of another jurisdiction is an appropriate group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group that (i) does not conduct substantial insurance business operations in the United States, (ii) conducts substantial insurance business operations in the United States but not in this state, or (iii) conducts substantial insurance business operations in the United States and in this state but the commissioner has determined, pursuant to the factors set forth in subdivision (3) of this subsection, that the regulatory official of another jurisdiction is the appropriate group-wide supervisor.\n\n(D) When another regulatory official is acting as the group-wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner shall acknowledge such official as the group-wide supervisor, except that the commissioner shall make a determination or acknowledgment of a group-wide supervisor for such insurance group if a material change in such insurance group results in (i) the largest share of such insurance group's premiums, assets or liabilities being held by member insurance companies domiciled in this state, or (ii) this state being the place of domicile of the top-tiered insurance company or companies in such insurance group.\n\n(E) A regulatory official determined or acknowledged to be a group-wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group may determine, after considering the factors set forth in subdivision (3) of this subsection, that it is appropriate to acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the group-wide supervisor of such insurance group. Such acknowledgment shall be made (i) in cooperation with and subject to the acknowledgment of other regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of such insurance group are domiciled, and (ii) in consultation with such insurance group.\n\n(3) The commissioner shall consider the following factors in making a determination or acknowledgment under subdivision (2) of this subsection:\n\n(A) The place of domicile of the member insurance companies of the internationally active insurance group that holds the largest share of such insurance group's premiums, assets or liabilities;\n\n(B) The place of domicile of the top-tiered insurance company or companies in the internationally active insurance group;\n\n(C) The locations of the executive offices or the largest operational offices of the internationally active insurance group; and\n\n(D) Whether (i) a regulatory official of another jurisdiction is acting or seeking to act as the group-wide supervisor under a regulatory system the commissioner determines to be substantially similar to that provided under the laws of this state or is otherwise sufficient in terms of group-wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis and cooperation with other regulatory officials, and (ii) such regulatory official acting or seeking to act as the group-wide supervisor provides the commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and cooperation.\n\n(4) The commissioner may collect, pursuant to section 38a-14a, from any insurance company registered pursuant to this section any information necessary for the commissioner to determine whether the commissioner may act as the group-wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group of which such company is a member or whether the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official of another jurisdiction should act as the group-wide supervisor of such insurance group.\n\n(5) Prior to issuing any determination or acknowledgment under this subsection, the commissioner shall notify the member insurance company registered pursuant to this section and the ultimate controlling person of the internationally active insurance group of such pending determination or acknowledgment. The commissioner shall provide the internationally active insurance group at least thirty calendar days to submit any additional information pertinent to such determination or acknowledgment that is requested by the commissioner or that such insurance group chooses to submit. The commissioner shall publish in the Connecticut Law Journal and post on the Insurance Department's Internet web site a current list of internationally active insurance groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to group-wide supervision by the commissioner.\n\n(6) The commissioner may conduct and coordinate the following group-wide supervision activities for an internationally active insurance group for which the commissioner is determined to be the group-wide supervisor:\n\n(A) Assess the enterprise risks within the internationally active insurance group to ensure that material financial conditions of and liquidity risks to the members of such insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified by management and that reasonable and effective mitigation measures are in place;\n\n(B) Request from members of such insurance group information necessary and appropriate to assess enterprise risk, including, but not limited to, information about governance, risk assessment and management, capital adequacy and material intercompany transactions;\n\n(C) Coordinate and, through the authority of the regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of the internationally active insurance group are domiciled, compel the development and implementation of reasonable measures designed to ensure the internationally active insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate material enterprise risks to the members of such insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance;\n\n(D) Communicate with other state, federal and international regulatory agencies of the jurisdictions where members of the internationally active insurance group are domiciled and share relevant information, subject to the confidentiality provisions of section 38a-137, through a supervisory college, as set forth in subsection (p) of this section;\n\n(E) Enter into agreements with or obtain documentation from any member insurance company registered under this section, any other member of the internationally active insurance group and any other state, federal and international regulatory agencies of the jurisdictions where members of the internationally active insurance group are domiciled, to establish or clarify the commissioner's role as group-wide supervisor and that may include provisions for resolving disputes with other regulatory officials. No such agreement or documentation shall serve as evidence that an insurance company or person within an insurance company holding system that is not domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in this state or is otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of this state; and\n\n(F) Other activities necessary to effectuate the group-wide supervisory purposes of this section and sections 38a-129 to 38a-140, inclusive, and within the authority granted in said sections.\n\n(7) If the commissioner acknowledges that a regulatory official of a jurisdiction not accredited by NAIC is the group-wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner shall reasonably cooperate through a supervisory college or otherwise with group supervision undertaken by such group-wide supervisor, provided such cooperation is in compliance with the laws of this state and such group-wide supervisor recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities as a group-wide supervisor for other internationally active insurance groups, where applicable. The commissioner may refuse to cooperate if the commissioner determines such recognition and cooperation are not reasonably reciprocated. The commissioner may enter into agreements with or obtain documentation from any member insurance company registered pursuant to this section, any affiliate of such insurance company and any other state, federal and international regulatory agencies of the jurisdictions where members of the internationally active insurance group are domiciled, to establish or clarify such official's role as group-wide supervisor.\n\n(8) The commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to carry out the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(9) Each insurance company registered pursuant to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the reasonable expenses of the commissioner's administration of this subsection, including the engagement of the services of attorneys, actuaries and other professionals and all reasonable travel expenses.\n\n(1969, P.A. 444, S. 7; 1971, P.A. 368, S. 1; P.A. 92-112, S. 18, 35; P.A. 93-239, S. 23; June 12 Sp.

      "text": "(a) Transactions within an insurance holding company system to which an insurance company subject to registration under section 38a-135 is a party shall be subject to the following requirements:\n\n(1) The terms shall be fair and reasonable;\n\n(2) Charges or fees for services performed shall be reasonable;\n\n(3) Expenses incurred and payment received shall be allocated to the insurance company in conformity with customary insurance accounting practices consistently applied;\n\n(4) The books, accounts and records of each party shall be so maintained as to clearly and accurately disclose the precise nature and details of the transactions, including such accounting information as is necessary to support the reasonableness of the charges or fees to the respective parties;\n\n(5) The insurance company's surplus shall be reasonable in relation to such company's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs;\n\n(6) Agreements for cost-sharing services and management shall include such provisions as may be required by regulations adopted by the commissioner;\n\n(7) If an insurance company subject to sections 38a-129 to 38a-140, inclusive, is determined by the commissioner to be in a hazardous financial condition as set forth in sections 38a-8-101 to 38a-8-104, inclusive, of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies or a condition that would be grounds for supervision, conservation or a delinquency proceeding as set forth in chapter 704c, the commissioner may require the insurance company to secure and maintain either a deposit, held by the commissioner, or a bond, as determined by the insurance company at the insurance company's discretion, for the protection of the insurance company for the duration of the contracts or agreements, or the existence of the condition for which the commissioner required the deposit or the bond. In determining whether the bond is required, the commissioner shall consider whether concerns exist with respect to affiliates of the insurance company to fulfill the contracts or agreements if the insurance company were to be put into liquidation. Once the insurance company is determined to be in a hazardous financial condition or a condition that is grounds for supervision, conservation or a delinquency proceeding, and a deposit or bond is necessary, the commissioner may determine the amount of the deposit or bond, not to exceed the value of the contracts or agreements in any one year, and whether such deposit or bond shall be required for a single contract, multiple contracts or a contract only with a specific affiliate of the insurance company;\n\n(8) All records and data of the insurance company held by an affiliate shall remain the property of the insurance company and shall be subject to control of the insurance company, identifiable, and segregated or readily capable of segregation, at no additional cost to the insurance company, from all other persons' records and data, including, but not limited to, all records and data that are otherwise the property of the insurance company, in whatever form maintained, including, but not limited to, claims and claim files, policyholder lists, application files, litigation files, premium records, rate books, underwriting manuals, personnel records, financial records or similar records within the possession, custody or control of the affiliate. At the request of the insurance company, the affiliate shall provide that the receiver can obtain a complete set of all records of any type that pertain to the insurance company's business; obtain access to the operating systems on which the data is maintained; obtain the software that runs such systems either through assumption of licensing agreements or otherwise; and restrict the use of the data by the affiliate if it is not operating the insurance company's business. The affiliate shall provide a waiver of any landlord lien or other encumbrance to give the insurance company access to all records and data in the event of the affiliate's default under a lease or other agreement; and\n\n(9) Premiums or other funds that belong to the insurance company that are collected by or held by an affiliate or affiliates are the exclusive property of the insurance company and shall be subject to the control of the insurance company. Any right of offset of amounts due to or due from the insurance company and an affiliate or affiliates in the event an insurance company is placed into receivership shall be subject to chapter 704c.\n\n(b) (1) The following transactions involving a domestic insurance company and any person in its holding company system, including amendments to or modifications of affiliate agreements previously filed pursuant to this section and that are subject to any materiality standards specified in subparagraphs (A) to (G), inclusive, of this subdivision, may not be entered into unless the insurance company has notified the commissioner in writing of its intention to enter into such transaction at least thirty days prior thereto, or such shorter period as the commissioner may permit, and the commissioner has approved or not disapproved it within such period. The written notice for such amendments or modifications shall specify the reasons for the change and the financial impact on the domestic insurance company. Not later than thirty days after the termination of a previously filed agreement, the domestic insurance company shall notify the commissioner of such termination for the commissioner's determination of what written notice or filing shall be required, if any:\n\n(A) Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, or investments, provided such transactions are equal to or exceed: (i) With respect to nonlife insurance companies, the lesser of three per cent of the insurance company's admitted assets or twenty-five per cent of surplus; or (ii) with respect to life insurance companies, three per cent of the insurance company's admitted assets; each as of the thirty-first day of December next preceding;\n\n(B) Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate, where the insurance company makes such loans or extensions of credit with the agreement or understanding that the proceeds of such transactions, in whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of credit to, to purchase assets of, or to make investments in, any affiliate of the insurance company making such loans or extensions of credit, provided such transactions are equal to or exceed: (i) With respect to nonlife insurance companies, the lesser of three per cent of the insurance company's admitted assets or twenty-five per cent of surplus; or (ii) with respect to life insurance companies, three per cent of the insurance company's admitted assets; each as of the thirty-first day of December next preceding;\n\n(C) Reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto, including (i) all reinsurance pooling agreements, and (ii) agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the insurance company's liabilities, or the projected reinsurance premium or a projected change in the insurance company's liabilities in any of the next three years, equals or exceeds five per cent of the insurance company's surplus, as of the thirty-first day of December next preceding, including those agreements that may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurance company to a nonaffiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurance company and nonaffiliate that any portion of such assets will be transferred to one or more affiliates of the insurance company;\n\n(D) All management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation agreements and cost-sharing arrangements;\n\n(E) Guarantees by a domestic insurance company, except that a guarantee that is (i) quantifiable as to amount, and (ii) does not exceed the lesser of one-half of one per cent of the insurance company's admitted assets or ten per cent of surplus with regard to policyholders, as of the thirty-first day of December next preceding, shall not be subject to the notice requirement of this subsection;\n\n(F) Direct or indirect acquisitions or investments in a person that controls the domestic insurance company or in an affiliate of the insurance company in an amount that, together with the insurance company's present holdings in such investments, exceeds two and one-half per cent of the insurance company's surplus with regard to policyholders. This subsection shall not apply to direct or indirect acquisitions of or investments in (i) subsidiaries acquired pursuant to section 38a-102d or authorized pursuant to any section of this title other than sections 38a-129 to 38a-140, inclusive, or (ii) nonsubsidiary affiliates that are subject to the provisions of sections 38a-129 to 38a-140, inclusive; and\n\n(G) Any material transactions, specified by regulation, that the commissioner determines may adversely affect the interests of the insurance company's policyholders.\n\n(2) Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to authorize or permit any transactions that, in the case of an insurance company not a member of the same insurance holding company system, would be otherwise contrary to law.\n\n(c) A domestic insurance company may not enter into transactions that are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the insurance holding company system if the purpose of those separate transactions is to avoid the statutory threshold amount and thus avoid the review that would otherwise occur. If the commissioner determines that such separate transactions were entered into over any twelve-month period for such purpose, the commissioner may exercise authority under section 38a-140.\n\n(d) The commissioner, in reviewing transactions pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, shall consider whether the transactions comply with the standards set forth in subsection (a) of this section and whether they may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.\n\n(e) Except as may be exempted pursuant to regulations adopted, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, by the commissioner or otherwise waived by the commissioner, the commissioner shall be notified not later than thirty days after any material investment of the domestic insurance company in any one corporation if the total investment in such corporation by such insurance company's insurance holding company system exceeds ten per cent of such corporation's voting securities.\n\n(f) (1) No insurance company subject to registration under section 38a-135 shall pay any extraordinary dividend or make any other extraordinary distribution to its stockholders until the commissioner has approved such payment or until thirty days after the commissioner has received notice from such company of the declaration thereof within which period the commissioner has not disapproved such payment, whichever is sooner. For the purposes of this subsection, an extraordinary dividend or distribution is any dividend or distribution of cash or other property, whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (A) ten per cent of such insurance company's surplus as of the thirty-first day of December last preceding, or (B) the net gain from operations of such insurance company, if such company is a life insurance company, or the net income, if such company is not a life insurance company, for the twelve-month period ending the thirty-first day of December last preceding, but shall not include pro rata distributions of any class of the insurance company's own securities.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an insurance company may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution that is conditional upon the commissioner's approval thereof, but such a declaration shall confer no rights upon stockholders until (A) the commissioner has approved the payment of such dividend or distribution, or (B) until thirty days after such declaration thereof within which period the commissioner has not disapproved such declaration, whichever is sooner.\n\n(g) For purposes of sections 38a-129 to 38a-140, inclusive, in determining whether an insurance company's surplus is reasonable in relation to the insurance company's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs, the following factors, in addition to others, shall be considered: (1) The size of the insurance company as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force and other appropriate criteria; (2) the extent to which the insurance company's business is diversified among the several lines of insurance; (3) the number and size of risks insured in each line of business; (4) the nature of the geographical dispersion of the insurance company's insured risks; (5) the nature and extent of the insurance company's reinsurance program; (6) the quality, diversification and liquidity of the insurance company's investment portfolio; (7) the recent past and projected future trend in the size of the insurance company's surplus; (8) the surplus maintained by other comparable insurance companies; (9) the adequacy of the insurance company's reserves; (10) the quality of the company's earnings and the extent to which the reported earnings include extraordinary items; and (11) the quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates. The commissioner may discount any such investment or treat any such investment as a disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus whenever, in the commissioner's judgment, such investment warrants.\n\n(h) (1) Any domestic insurance company that is affiliated with an insurance holding company system shall report for informational purposes to the Insurance Commissioner all dividends and other distributions to securityholders, not later than five business days after the declaration and at least ten days, commencing from the date of receipt by the Insurance Department, prior to payment thereof.\n\n(2) No dividend or other distribution may be paid when the surplus of the insurance company is less than the surplus required by section 38a-72 for the kind or kinds of business authorized to be transacted by such company, nor when the payment of a dividend or other distribution would reduce its surplus to less than such amount.\n\n(3) Except as otherwise provided by law, no dividend or other distribution exceeding an amount equal to an insurance company's earned surplus may be paid without the Insurance Commissioner's prior approval. For purposes of this subsection, “earned surplus” means “unassigned funds-surplus”, as defined in the annual report of the insurance company that was most recently submitted pursuant to section 38a-53, reduced by twenty-five per cent of unrealized appreciation in value or revaluation of assets or unrealized profits on investments, as defined in such report.\n\n(i) (1) The commissioner may require a domestic insurance company of which control has been acquired pursuant to section 38a-130 to submit to a financial examination and a market conduct examination within thirty days after such acquisition in accordance with procedures set forth by NAIC's examiner's handbook and such regulations as the commissioner may adopt.\n\n(2) No domestic insurance company of which control has been acquired pursuant to section 38a-130 shall, without the prior approval of the commissioner: (A) Pay or propose to pay any dividend during the period of two years from the date of acquisition of control of such insurance company; (B) acquire or enter into an agreement or understanding to acquire control, during the period of three years after the date of acquisition of control of such insurance company, of any other person or persons whose assets exceed twenty-five million dollars; (C) provide or propose to provide directly or indirectly, during the period of three years after the date of acquisition of control of such insurance company, any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial assistance; or (D) engage in any material transaction with any person during the period of three years after the date of acquisition of such insurance company.

This requirement may be satisfied if the insurance group of which such insurer is a member maintains a risk management framework applicable to the operations of such insurer.\n\n(2) Each domestic insurer or the insurance group of which such insurer is a member shall regularly conduct an ORSA consistent with a process comparable to that set forth in the ORSA Guidance Manual. Any change in the ORSA Guidance Manual shall be effective January first following the calendar year in which such change was adopted by NAIC. The ORSA shall be conducted at least annually and at any time when there are significant changes to the risk profile of such insurer or insurance group.\n\n(c) Commencing January 1, 2015, upon request by the Insurance Commissioner, and not more than once each year, a domestic insurer shall submit to the commissioner an ORSA Summary Report and any combination of reports that together contain the information described in the ORSA Guidance Manual that is applicable to such insurer and insurance group. The date of submission of such report or reports shall be dependent on when such insurer or insurance group conducts its internal strategic planning process. If the commissioner is the lead state commissioner, as determined by the procedures in NAIC's applicable financial analysis handbook, of the insurance group of which such insurer is a member, such insurer shall submit to the commissioner the reports required under this subsection once each year regardless of whether the commissioner has requested such reports. A domestic insurer may comply with this subsection by providing the most recent and substantially similar reports that were provided by such insurer or another member of the insurance group of which such insurer is a member to the insurance regulatory official of another state or a foreign jurisdiction and that provide information that is comparable to the information described in the ORSA Guidance Manual. Any such report in a language other than English shall be accompanied by a translation of that report into the English language.\n\n(d) Each domestic insurer or the insurance group of which such insurer is a member shall prepare an ORSA Summary Report consistent with the standards set forth in the ORSA Guidance Manual. Such insurer or insurance group shall maintain documentation and supporting information of an ORSA and shall make such documentation and information available for examination upon request by the commissioner. The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall review the ORSA Summary Report and such documentation or information using procedures similar to those currently used in the analysis and examination of multistate or global insurers and insurance groups.\n\n(e) The ORSA Summary Report shall include the signature of the domestic insurer's or insurance group's chief risk officer or other executive having responsibility for the oversight of the insurer's enterprise risk management process, attesting that, to the best of such officer's or executive's belief and knowledge, the insurer applied the enterprise risk management process described in the ORSA Summary Report and that a copy of the report has been provided to the insurer's board of directors or appropriate committee thereof.\n\n(f) The commissioner, after notice and hearing, may impose a civil penalty on a domestic insurer that fails, without just cause, to timely file an ORSA Summary Report, of one thousand dollars for each day the failure to file a report continues. The commissioner may reduce the penalty if the insurer demonstrates to the commissioner that the imposition of the penalty would constitute a financial hardship to the insurer.\n\n(g) (1) A domestic insurer shall be exempt from the requirements of subsections (b) to (e), inclusive, of this section if (A) such insurer has annual direct written and unaffiliated assumed premiums, including international direct and assumed premiums but excluding premiums reinsured with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and the National Flood Insurance Program, of less than five hundred million dollars, and (B) the insurance group of which such insurer is a member has annual direct written and unaffiliated assumed premiums, including international direct and assumed premiums but excluding premiums reinsured with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and the National Flood Insurance Program of less than one billion dollars.\n\n(2) If an insurer qualifies for an exemption pursuant to subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of this subsection but the insurance group of which such insurer is a member does not qualify for an exemption pursuant to subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the ORSA Summary Report shall include every insurer within such insurance group. This requirement may be satisfied by the submission of more than one ORSA Summary Report for any combination of insurers, provided such combination of reports includes every insurer within such insurance group.\n\n(3) If an insurer does not qualify for an exemption pursuant to subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of this subsection but the insurance group of which such insurer is a member qualifies for an exemption pursuant to subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the only ORSA Summary Report required shall be the report applicable to such insurer.\n\n(4) An insurer that does not qualify for an exemption pursuant to subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of this subsection may apply to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of subsections (b) to (e), inclusive, of this section, based on unique circumstances. In deciding whether to grant the insurer's request for a waiver, the commissioner may consider the type and volume of business written, ownership and organizational structure of the insurer and any other factors the commissioner considers relevant to the insurer or insurance group of which such insurer is a member. If the insurer is part of an insurance group with insurers domiciled in more than one state, the commissioner shall coordinate with the lead state commissioner, as determined by the procedures in NAIC's applicable financial analysis handbook, of such insurance group and with the other insurance regulatory officials of member insurers' states of domicile in considering whether to grant the insurer's request for a waiver.\n\n(5) If an insurer that qualifies for an exemption pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection subsequently no longer qualifies for such exemption due to changes in premiums as reflected in the insurer's most recent annual statement or in the most recent annual statements of the insurers within the insurance group of which such insurer is a member, such insurer shall have one year following the year the threshold is exceeded to comply with the requirements of subsections (b) to (e), inclusive, of this section.\n\n(6) Notwithstanding the exemptions in this subsection, the commissioner may require that a domestic insurer comply with the requirements of subsections (b) to (e), inclusive, of this section: (A) Based on unique circumstances including, but not limited to, the type and volume of business written, ownership and organizational structure of the insurer and requests from a federal agency or the insurance regulatory official of a foreign jurisdiction; or (B) if the insurer (i) has risk-based capital for a company action level event, as set forth in sections 38a-72-1 to 38a-72-13, inclusive, and 38a-193-1 to 38a-193-13, inclusive, of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, (ii) meets one or more of the standards of an insurer deemed to be in a hazardous financial condition, as set forth in section 38a-8-103 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, or (iii) otherwise exhibits qualities of a troubled insurer as determined by the commissioner.\n\n(h) (1) All documents, materials or other information, including the ORSA Summary Report, in the possession or control of the Insurance Department that are obtained by, created by or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person pursuant to subsections (b) to (e), inclusive, or subsection (g) of this section shall be confidential by law and privileged, shall not be subject to disclosure under section 1-210, shall not be subject to subpoena and shall not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in any civil action in this state. The commissioner may use such documents, materials or information in the furtherance of any regulatory or legal action brought as a part of the commissioner's official duties. The commissioner shall not otherwise make such documents, materials or other information public without the prior written consent of the insurer.\n\n(2) Neither the commissioner nor any person who, while acting under the authority of the commissioner, obtained or created documents, materials or other information pursuant to subsections (b) to (e), inclusive, or subsection (g) of this section, or to whom such documents, materials or other information were disclosed, through examination or otherwise, shall be permitted or required to testify in any civil action in this state concerning any such documents, materials or information.\n\n(i) (1) To assist the commissioner in the performance of the commissioner's regulatory duties, the commissioner:\n\n(A) May share upon request documents, materials or other information set forth in subdivision (1) of subsection (h) of this section, including documents, materials or information deemed confidential and privileged or not disclosable pursuant to said subdivision, with (i) other state, federal and international regulatory officials, including members of a supervisory college as described in section 38a-135, (ii) NAIC, and (iii) any third-party consultants designated by the commissioner, provided the recipient of any such documents, materials or other information agrees, in writing, to maintain the confidentiality and privileged status of such documents, materials or other information and has verified, in writing, the recipient's legal authority to maintain confidentiality;\n\n(B) May receive ORSA-related documents, materials or other information, including documents, materials or information deemed confidential and privileged, from regulatory officials of other states or foreign jurisdictions, including members of a supervisory college as described in section 38a-135, and NAIC. The commissioner shall maintain as confidential and privileged any documents, materials or information received with notice or the understanding that such documents, materials or information are confidential and privileged under the laws of the jurisdiction that is the source of such documents, materials or information; and\n\n(C) Shall enter into a written agreement with NAIC or a third-party consultant, governing the sharing and use of documents, materials and information shared or received pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B) of this subdivision. Any such agreement shall (i) specify policies and procedures regarding the confidentiality and security of such documents, materials or other information that are shared with NAIC or a third-party consultant, including (I) procedures and protocols limiting sharing by NAIC to only regulatory officials of states in which other member insurers of the insurance group of which a domestic insurer is a member are domiciled, and (II) a provision requiring NAIC or a third-party consultant to agree, in writing, and if applicable, a provision requiring NAIC to obtain from a regulatory official under subparagraph (C)(i)(I) of this subdivision an agreement, in writing, to maintain the confidentiality and privileged status of such documents, materials or other information, and verifying the recipient's legal authority to maintain confidentiality; (ii) specify that the commissioner shall retain ownership of such documents, materials or other information and that the use of such documents, materials or other information is subject to the commissioner's discretion; (iii) prohibit NAIC or the third-party consultant from storing such documents, materials or other information in a permanent database after the underlying analysis is completed; (iv) require prompt notice to be given to an insurer whose confidential information is in the possession of NAIC or a third-party consultant if NAIC or the third-party consultant is subject to a request or subpoena for disclosure or production of such documents, materials or other information; (v) require NAIC or the third-party consultant, if NAIC or such consultant is subject to disclosure of an insurer's confidential documents, materials or other information that has been shared with NAIC or such consultant pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, to allow such insurer to intervene in any judicial or administrative action regarding such disclosure; and (vi) in the case of an agreement with a third-party consultant, require the commissioner to obtain the written consent of the insurer prior to sharing any such documents, materials and information.\n\n(2) No waiver of any applicable privilege or claim of confidentiality in any documents, materials or other information thereof shall occur as a result of disclosure to the commissioner or of sharing in accordance with this subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to delegate any regulatory authority of the commissioner to any person or entity with which any documents, materials or other information thereof have been shared.\n\n(3) The ORSA Summary Report and any related documents, materials or other information thereof in the possession or control of NAIC or a third-party consultant pursuant to this subsection shall be confidential by law and privileged, shall not be subject to disclosure under section 1-210, shall not be subject to subpoena and shall not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in any civil action in this state.\n\n(P.A. 14-107, S. 1; P.A. 15-187, S. 3.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 14-107 effective January 1, 2015; P.A. 15-187 amended Subsec.
