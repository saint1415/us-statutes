(9) defining “residence” and replaced “authorized” with “licensed” in Subdiv. (5); P.A. 87-290 added definitions of “affiliate”, “claimant”, and “United States”, and amended the definition of “covered claim” to limit its application to nonresidents of this state, renumbering previous Subdivs. as necessary; P.A. 88-76 clarified the definition of “covered claim”; P.A. 90-243 amended the definitions for “affiliate”, “affiliated”, “person” and “United States”; Sec. 38-275 transferred to Sec. 38a-838 in 1991; P.A. 97-125 amended Subdiv.

(8) re when an insurer ceases to be a member and such member's liability for obligations and amended Subdiv. (10) to redefine “person”, effective July 1, 1997; P.A. 03-49 redefined “affiliate” and “covered claim”, deleted former Subdiv. (4) re definition of “claimant”, redesignated existing Subdivs. (5) to (12) as Subdivs. (4) to (11) and made technical changes, effective May 23, 2003, and applicable to claims filed on or after that date; P.A. 04-174 amended Subdiv.

(B)(i): Waiver by state's indemnity insurer of its contractual right to reimbursement restored status of state's claim as a “covered claim” that was reimbursable by association since claim was no longer for the benefit of an insurer. 278 C. 77. Subpara. (B)(i): Association payment to plaintiff who was injured when her motor vehicle was struck by municipally owned police cruiser did not relieve plaintiff's automobile insurance company of obligation for purposes of statutory limitation on association payments for the benefit of a solvent insurer, nor did that payment violate Sec. 38a-845 requirement of exhaustion of solvent carrier policies; statutory sections do not have effect of automatically shifting liability from association to the nearest solvent insurer when liability does not rest there already. Id., 794. Because the obligation of association re a “covered claim” is limited to that “which arises out of and is within” the coverage of the underlying insurance policy, association is not liable for sanctions imposed by workers' compensation commissioner because the sanctions arose out of association's conduct in handling the claim and not out of the coverage of the policy. 298 C. 620. An insurer's preinsolvency misconduct during underlying litigation does not estop association from challenging the existence of a covered claim, which is a predicate for association's liability under the guaranty act. 314 C. 161.\n\nSubdiv. (6):\n\nCited. 217 C. 371. All claims by insurers are excluded from definition of “covered claim”. 243 C. 438. Employer that is self-insurer under Workers' Compensation Act is not an “insurer” under definition of “covered claim”. 247 C. 442.",

Said association shall pay the full amount of any such claim arising out of a workers' compensation policy, provided in no event shall said association be obligated (I) to any claimant in an amount in excess of the obligation of the insolvent insurer under the policy form or coverage from which the claim arises, or (II) for any claim filed with the association after the expiration of two years from the date of the declaration of insolvency unless such claim arose out of a workers' compensation policy and was timely filed in accordance with section 31-294c;\n\n(2) Be deemed the insurer to the extent of its obligations on the covered claims and to such extent shall have all rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent;\n\n(3) Allocate claims paid and expenses incurred among the three accounts, created by section 38a-839, separately, and assess member insurers separately (A) in respect of each such account for such amounts as shall be necessary to pay the obligations of said association under subdivision (1) of this subsection subsequent to an insolvency; (B) the expenses of handling covered claims subsequent to an insolvency; (C) the cost of examinations under section 38a-846; and (D) such other expenses as are authorized by sections 38a-836 to 38a-853, inclusive. The assessments of each member insurer shall be in the proportion that the net direct written premiums of such member insurer for the calendar year preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in such account bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the calendar year preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in such account. Each member insurer shall be notified of its assessment not later than thirty days before it is due. No member insurer may be assessed in any year on any account an amount greater than two per cent of that member insurer's net direct written premiums for the calendar year preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in said account, provided if, at the time an assessment is levied on the all other insurance account, as defined in subdivision (3) of section 38a-839, the board of directors finds that at least fifty per cent of the total net direct written premiums of a member insurer and all its affiliates, for the year on which such assessment is based, were from policies issued or delivered in Connecticut, on risks located in this state, such member insurer shall be assessed only on such member insurer's net direct written premium that is attributable to the kind of insurance that gives rise to each covered claim. If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of said association in any account, does not provide in any one year in any account an amount sufficient to make all necessary payments from that account, the funds available may be prorated and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon thereafter as funds become available. Said association may defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of any member insurer if the assessment would cause the member insurer's financial statement to reflect amounts of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance, provided during the period of deferment, no dividends shall be paid to shareholders or policyholders. Deferred assessments shall be paid when such payment will not reduce capital or surplus below the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority. Such payments shall be refunded to those insurers receiving greater assessments because of such deferment or, at the election of the insurer, be credited against future assessments. Each member insurer serving as a servicing facility may set off against any assessment, authorized payments made on covered claims and expenses incurred in the payment of such claims by such member insurer if they are chargeable to the account in respect of which the assessment is made;\n\n(4) Investigate claims brought against said association and adjust, compromise, settle, and pay covered claims to the extent of said association's obligations and deny all other claims. The association shall pay claims in any order it deems reasonable including, but not limited to, payment in the order of receipt or by classification. It may review settlements, releases and judgments to which the insolvent insurer or its insureds were parties to determine the extent to which such settlements, releases and judgments may be properly contested;\n\n(5) Notify such persons as the commissioner may direct under subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of section 38a-843;\n\n(6) Handle claims through its employees or through one or more insurers or other persons designated by said association as servicing facilities, provided such designation of a servicing facility is approved by the commissioner and may be declined by a member insurer;\n\n(7) Reimburse each such servicing facility for obligations of said association paid by such facility and for expenses incurred by such facility while handling claims on behalf of said association and shall pay such other expenses of said association as are authorized by sections 38a-836 to 38a-853, inclusive.\n\n(b) Said association may: (1) Employ or retain such persons as are necessary to handle claims and perform other duties of said association; (2) borrow such funds as may be necessary from time to time to effect the purposes of sections 38a-836 to 38a-853, inclusive, in accord with the plan of operation under section 38a-842; (3) sue or be sued; (4) intervene as a matter of right as a party in any proceeding before any court in this state that has jurisdiction over an insolvent insurer, as defined in section 38a-838; (5) negotiate and become a party to such contracts as are necessary to carry out the purpose of sections 38a-836 to 38a-853, inclusive; (6) perform such other acts as are necessary or proper to effectuate the purpose of said sections; (7) refund to the member insurers in proportion to the contribution of each such member insurer to that account, that amount by which the assets of the account exceed the liabilities, if, at the end of any calendar year, the board of directors finds that the assets of said association in any account exceed the liabilities of that account as estimated by the board of directors for the coming year.\n\n(c) (1) Each insurer paying an assessment under sections 38a-836 to 38a-853, inclusive, may offset one hundred per cent of the amount of such assessment against its premium tax liability to this state under chapter 207. Such offset shall be taken over a period of the five successive tax years following the year of payment of the assessment, at the rate of twenty per cent per year of the assessment paid to the association. Each insurer to which has been refunded by the association, pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, all or a portion of an assessment previously paid to the association by the insurer shall be required to pay to the Department of Revenue Services an amount equal to the total amount that has been claimed as an offset against the premiums tax liability on the premiums tax return or returns, as the case may be, filed by such insurer and that is attributable to such refunded assessment, provided the amount required to be paid to said department shall not exceed the amount of the refunded assessment. If the amount of the refunded assessment exceeds the total amount that has been claimed as an offset against the premiums tax liability on the premiums tax return or returns filed by such insurer and that is attributable to such refunded assessment, such excess may not be claimed as an offset against the premiums tax liability on a premiums tax return or returns filed by such insurer or, if the offset has been transferred to another person pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection, by such other person. For purposes of this subparagraph, if the offset has been transferred to another person pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection, the total amount that has been claimed as an offset against the premiums tax liability on the premiums tax return or returns filed by such insurer includes the total amount that has been claimed as an offset against the premiums tax liability on the premiums tax return or returns filed by such other person. The association shall promptly notify the Commissioner of Revenue Services of the name and address of the insurers to which such refunds have been made, the amount of such refunds and the date on which such refunds were mailed to such insurer. If the amount that an insurer is required to pay to the Department of Revenue Services has not been so paid on or before the forty-fifth day after the date of mailing of such refunds, the insurer shall be liable for interest on such amount at the rate of one per cent per month or fraction thereof from such forty-fifth day to the date of payment.\n\n(2) An insurer, in this subparagraph called “the transferor”, may transfer any offset provided under subdivision (1) of this subsection to an affiliate, as defined in section 38a-1, of the transferor.

The limits set forth in this subsection are limits on the benefits for which the association is obligated before taking into account either the association's subrogation and assignment rights or the extent to which those benefits could be provided out of the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer that are attributable to covered policies.

Such rights of the association shall include, but are not limited to, in the case of a structured settlement annuity, any rights of the owner, beneficiary or payee of the annuity, to the extent of benefits received pursuant to sections 38a-858 to 38a-875, inclusive.\n\n(4) If the provisions of subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, of this subsection are invalid or ineffective with respect to any person or claim for any reason, the amount payable by the association with respect to the related covered obligations shall be reduced by the amount realized by any other person with respect to the person or claim that is attributable to the policies or contracts, or portion thereof, covered by the association.\n\n(5) If the association has provided benefits with respect to a covered obligation and a person recovers amounts as to which the association has rights as described in subdivisions (1) to (4), inclusive, of this subsection, the person shall pay to the association the portion of the recovery attributable to the policies or contracts, or portion thereof, covered by the association.\n\n(l) In addition to the rights and powers otherwise provided in sections 38a-858 to 38a-875, inclusive, the association may:\n\n(1) Enter into such contracts as are necessary or proper to carry out the provisions and purposes of sections 38a-858 to 38a-875, inclusive;\n\n(2) Sue or be sued, including, but not limited to, taking any legal actions necessary or proper to recover any unpaid assessments under section 38a-866, and to settle claims or potential claims against it;\n\n(3) Borrow money to effect the purposes of sections 38a-858 to 38a-875, inclusive, and any notes or other evidence of indebtedness of the association not in default shall be legal investments for domestic member insurers and may be carried as admitted assets;\n\n(4) Employ or retain such persons as are necessary or proper to handle the financial transactions of the association, and to perform such other functions as become necessary or proper under sections 38a-858 to 38a-875, inclusive;\n\n(5) Take such legal action as may be necessary or proper to avoid or recover payment of improper claims;\n\n(6) Exercise, for the purposes of sections 38a-858 to 38a-875, inclusive, and to the extent approved by the commissioner, the powers of a domestic life insurer, health insurer or health care center, but in no case may the association issue insurance policies or annuity contracts other than those issued to perform its obligations under sections 38a-858 to 38a-875, inclusive;\n\n(7) Request information from a person seeking coverage from the association in order to aid the association in determining its obligations under sections 38a-858 to 38a-875, inclusive, with respect to the person, and the person shall promptly comply with the request;\n\n(8) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, file for an actuarially justified rate or premium increase for any policy or contract for which the association provides coverage under sections 38a-858 to 38a-875, inclusive, provided such increase is in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in such policy or contract; and\n\n(9) Take other necessary or proper action to discharge its duties and obligations under sections 38a-858 to 38a-875, inclusive, or to exercise its powers under sections 38a-858 to 38a-875, inclusive.\n\n(m) The association may join an organization of one or more other state associations of similar purposes to further the purposes and administer the powers and duties of the association.\n\n(n) (1) At any time within one year after the date on which the association becomes responsible for the obligations of a member insurer, which date shall be deemed the coverage date, the association may elect to succeed to the rights and obligations of the member insurer that accrue on or after the coverage date and that relate to policies, contracts or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, under any one or more indemnity reinsurance agreements entered into by the member insurer as a ceding insurer and selected by the association, except that the association may not exercise an election with respect to a reinsurance agreement if the receiver, rehabilitator or liquidator of a member insurer has previously and expressly disaffirmed the reinsurance agreement. The election shall be effected by a notice to the receiver, rehabilitator or liquidator and to the affected reinsurers. If the association makes an election, then subparagraphs (A) to (D), inclusive, of this subdivision shall apply with respect to the reinsurance agreements selected by the association:\n\n(A) The association shall be responsible for all unpaid premiums due under the agreements for periods before, on and after the coverage date, and shall be responsible for the performance of all other obligations to be performed after the coverage date, in each case which relate to policies, contracts or annuities covered in whole or in part by the association. The association may charge policies, contracts or annuities covered in part by the association, through reasonable allocation methods, the costs for reinsurance in excess of the obligations of the association.\n\n(B) The association shall be entitled to any amounts payable by the reinsurer under the agreements with respect to losses or events that occur in periods after the coverage date and that relate to policies, contracts or annuities covered by the association in whole or in part, and upon the association's receipt of any such amount, the association shall pay any beneficiary under the policy, contract or annuity under which the association paid only a portion of the policy, contract or annuity amount:\n\n(i) The amount received by the association that exceeds the benefits paid the beneficiary under the policy, contract or annuity; less\n\n(ii) The benefits paid by the association on account of the policy, contract or annuity less the retention of the impaired or insolvent member insurer applicable to the loss or event.\n\n(C) Not later than thirty days after the association's election, the association and each reinsurer shall calculate the net balance due to or from the association under each reinsurance agreement as of the date of the association's election with respect to policies, contracts or annuities covered, in whole or in part by the association, giving full credit to all items paid by either the member insurer or its receiver, rehabilitator or liquidator or the reinsurer during the period between the coverage date and the date of the association's election. Either the association or reinsurer shall pay the net balance due the other not later than five days after the completion of the calculation. If the receiver, rehabilitator or liquidator has received any amounts due the association pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, the receiver, rehabilitator or liquidator shall remit the same to the association as promptly as practicable.\n\n(D) If the association or receiver, on behalf of the association, not later than sixty days after the election, pays the premiums due for periods before, on and after the coverage date that relate to policies, contracts or annuities covered by the association in whole or in part, the reinsurer shall not be entitled to terminate the reinsurance agreements insofar as the agreements relate to policies, contracts or annuities covered by the association in whole or in part and shall not be entitled to set off any unpaid premium due for periods prior to the coverage date against amounts due the association.\n\n(2) If the association does not elect to assume a reinsurance contract by the date of the association election pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection, the association shall have no rights or obligations in each case for periods both before and after the date of the order of liquidation with respect to the reinsurance contract.\n\n(3) If the association transfers policies, contracts or annuities, or covered obligations with respect to such policies, contracts or annuities, to another assuming insurer, and if the association and the other insurer agree, the other insurer shall succeed to the rights and obligations of the association under subdivision (1) of this subsection, provided:\n\n(A) The reinsurance agreements shall automatically terminate for new reinsurance unless the reinsurer and the other insurer agree to the contrary;\n\n(B) The association's obligation to pay the beneficiary pursuant to subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of this subsection shall no longer apply on or after the date the reinsurance agreement is transferred to the assuming insurer; and\n\n(C) The transferring party shall give written notice to the affected reinsurer at least thirty days prior to the effective date of the transfer.\n\n(4) The provisions of this subsection shall supersede the provisions of any law of this state or of any affected reinsurance agreement that provides for or requires any payment of reinsurance proceeds on account of losses or events that occur in periods after the date of the order of liquidation, to the receiver, liquidator or rehabilitator of the insolvent member insurer or any other person. The receiver, rehabilitator or liquidator shall remain entitled to any amount payable by the reinsurer under the reinsurance agreement with respect to losses or events that occur in periods prior to the coverage date subject to applicable setoff provisions.\n\n(5) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section, nothing in this subsection shall alter or modify the terms and conditions of the reinsurance agreements of the insolvent member insurer. Nothing in this section shall abrogate or limit any rights of any reinsurer to claim that it is entitled to rescind a reinsurance agreement. Nothing in this section shall give a policy owner, contract owner, enrollee, certificate holder or beneficiary an independent cause of action against a reinsurer that is not otherwise set forth in the reinsurance agreement. Nothing in this section shall limit or affect the association's rights as a creditor of an estate against the assets of the estate. Nothing in this section shall apply to reinsurance agreements covering property or casualty risks.\n\n(o) The board of directors of the association shall have discretion and may exercise reasonable business judgment to determine the means by which the association is to provide the benefits under sections 38a-858 to 38a-875, inclusive, in an economical and efficient manner.\n\n(p) Where the association has arranged or offered to provide the benefits under sections 38a-858 to 38a-875, inclusive, to a covered person under a plan or arrangement that fulfills the association's obligations under sections 38a-858 to 38a-875, inclusive, the person shall not be entitled to benefits from the association in addition to or other than those provided under the plan or arrangement.\n\n(q) Venue in a suit against the association arising under sections 38a-858 to 38a-875, inclusive, shall be in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford. The association shall not be required to give an appeal bond in an appeal that relates to a cause of action arising under sections 38a-858 to 38a-875, inclusive.\n\n(r) In carrying out its duties in connection with guaranteeing, assuming, reissuing or reinsuring policies or contracts under subsections (a) or (b) of this section, the association may issue substitute coverage for a policy or contract that provides an interest rate, crediting rate or similar factor determined by use of an index or other external reference stated in the policy or contract employed in calculating returns or changes in value by issuing an alternative policy or contract in accordance with subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, of this subsection:\n\n(1) In lieu of the index or other external reference provided for in the original policy or contract, the alternative policy or contract provides for (A) a fixed interest rate, (B) payment of dividends with minimum guarantees, or (C) a different method for calculating interest or changes in value;\n\n(2) There is no requirement for evidence of insurability, waiting period or other exclusion that would not have applied under the replaced policy or contract; and\n\n(3) The alternative policy or contract is substantially similar to the replaced policy or contract in all other material terms.\n\n(1972, P.A. 280, S. 8; P.A. 75-18; P.A. 78-58, S. 1; P.A. 87-290, S. 7, 8; P.A. 88-76, S. 8, 10; P.A. 01-67, S. 4; P.A. 18-13, S. 6.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 75-18 raised liability limit in Subsec.

      "text": "(a) For the purpose of providing the funds necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association, the board of directors shall assess the member insurers, separately for each account, at such times and for such amounts as the board finds necessary. The association shall establish a due date for each assessment which shall be at least thirty days after the association has provided the member notice of the assessment. Each member insurer shall pay interest on any late payment at the rate of one per cent per month, or any portion thereof, from the due date to the date of payment.\n\n(b) There shall be two classes of assessments, as follows:\n\n(1) Class A assessments shall be made for the purpose of meeting administrative costs and other general expenses not related to a particular impaired or insolvent insurer; and\n\n(2) Class B assessments shall be authorized and called to the extent necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association under section 38a-865 with regard to an impaired or insolvent insurer.\n\n(c) (1) The amount of any Class A assessment shall be determined by the board and may be authorized and called on a pro-rata or non-pro-rata basis. If an assessment is made on a pro-rata basis, the board may provide that the assessment be credited against future Class B assessments.\n\n(2) (A) The amount of any Class B assessment, except for any assessment related to long-term care insurance, shall be allocated for assessment purposes between the accounts and among the subaccounts of the life insurance and annuity account pursuant to an allocation formula which may be based on the premiums or reserves of the impaired or insolvent insurer or any other standard that the board, in its sole discretion, deems as being fair and reasonable under the circumstances.\n\n(B) The amount of the Class B assessment for long-term care insurance written by the impaired or insolvent insurer shall be allocated according to a methodology included in the plan of operation and approved by the commissioner. The methodology shall provide for fifty per cent of the assessment to be allocated to accident and health member insurers and fifty per cent to be allocated to life and annuity member insurers.\n\n(3) Class B assessments against member insurers for each account and subaccount shall be in the proportion that the premiums received on business in this state by each assessed member insurer on policies or contracts covered by each account for the three most recent calendar years for which information is available preceding the year in which the member insurer became insolvent or, in the case of an assessment with respect to an impaired insurer, the three most recent calendar years for which information is available preceding the year in which the member insurer became impaired bear to such premiums received on business in this state for those calendar years by all assessed member insurers.\n\n(4) Assessments for funds to meet the requirements of the association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer shall not be authorized or called until necessary to implement the purposes of sections 38a-858 to 38a-875, inclusive. Classification of assessments under subsection (b) of this section and computation of assessments under this subsection shall be made with a reasonable degree of accuracy, recognizing that exact determinations may not always be possible. The association shall notify each member insurer of its anticipated pro-rata share of an authorized assessment that is not yet called not later than one hundred eighty days after the association authorizes the assessment.\n\n(d) The association may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. In the event an assessment against a member insurer is abated, or deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which such assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other member insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this section. Once the conditions that caused a deferral have been removed or rectified, the member insurer shall pay all assessments that were deferred pursuant to a repayment plan approved by the association.\n\n(e) (1) (A) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, the total of all assessments authorized by the association with respect to a member insurer for each subaccount of the life insurance and annuity account and for the health account shall not in any one calendar year exceed two per cent of such insurer's average annual premiums received in this state on the policies and contracts covered by the subaccount or account during the three calendar years preceding the year in which the member insurer became an impaired or insolvent insurer.\n\n(B) If two or more assessments are authorized in one calendar year with respect to member insurers that become impaired or insolvent in different calendar years, the average annual premiums for purposes of the aggregate assessment percentage shall be equal and limited to the higher of the three-year average annual premium for the applicable subaccount or account as calculated pursuant to this section.\n\n(C) If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the association in any account, does not provide in any one year in either account an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, the necessary additional funds shall be assessed as soon thereafter as permitted by sections 38a-858 to 38a-875, inclusive.\n\n(2) The board may provide in the plan of operation a method of allocating funds among claims, whether relating to one or more impaired insurers, when the maximum assessment will be insufficient to cover anticipated claims.\n\n(3) If the maximum assessment for any subaccount of the life insurance and annuity account in any one year does not provide an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, then pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection (c) of this section, the board shall access the other subaccounts of the life insurance and annuity account for the necessary additional amount, subject to the maximum stated in subdivision (1) of this subsection.\n\n(f) The board may, by an equitable method as established in the plan of operation, refund to member insurers, in proportion to the contribution of each member insurer to that account, the amount by which the assets of the account exceed the amount the board finds is necessary to carry out during the coming year the obligations of the association with regard to that account, including assets accruing from assignment, subrogation, net realized gains and income from investments. A reasonable amount may be retained in any account to provide funds for the continuing expenses of the association and for future losses if refunds are impractical.\n\n(g) It shall be proper for any member insurer, in determining its premium rates and policy owner dividends as to any kind of insurance or health care center business within the scope of sections 38a-858 to 38a-875, inclusive, to consider the amount reasonably necessary to meet its assessment obligations under said sections.\n\n(h) (1) Each member insurer paying an assessment under sections 38a-858 to 38a-875, inclusive, may offset one hundred per cent of the amount of such assessment against its premium tax liability to this state under chapter 207. Such offset shall be taken over a period of the five successive tax years following the year of payment of the assessment, at the rate of twenty per cent per year of the assessment paid to the association. Each member insurer to which has been refunded by the association, pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, all or a portion of an assessment previously paid to the association by the member insurer shall be required to pay to the Department of Revenue Services an amount equal to the total amount that has been claimed as an offset against the premiums tax liability on the premiums tax return or returns, as the case may be, filed by such insurer and that is attributable to such refunded assessment, provided the amount required to be paid to said department shall not exceed the amount of the refunded assessment. If the amount of the refunded assessment exceeds the total amount that has been claimed as an offset against the premiums tax liability on the premiums tax return or returns filed by such member insurer and that is attributable to such refunded assessment, such excess may not be claimed as an offset against the premiums tax liability on a premiums tax return or returns filed by such insurer or, if the offset has been transferred to another person pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection, by such other person. For purposes of this subdivision, if the offset has been transferred to another person pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection, the total amount that has been claimed as an offset against the premiums tax liability on the premiums tax return or returns filed by such insurer includes the total amount that has been claimed as an offset against the premiums tax liability on the premiums tax return or returns filed by such other person. The association shall promptly notify the Commissioner of Revenue Services of the name and address of the member insurers to which such refunds have been made, the amount of such refunds, and the date on which such refunds were mailed to each such insurer. If the amount that a member insurer is required to pay to the Department of Revenue Services has not been so paid on or before the forty-fifth day after the date of mailing of such refunds, the insurer shall be liable for interest on such amount at the rate of one per cent per month, or fraction thereof, from such forty-fifth day to the date of payment.\n\n(2) A member insurer, in this subdivision called “the transferor”, may transfer any offset provided under subdivision (1) of this subsection to an affiliate, as defined in section 38a-1, of the transferor. Any such transfer of the offset by the transferor, and any subsequent transfer or transfers of the same offset, shall not affect the obligation of the transferor to pay to the Department of Revenue Services any sums which are acquired by refund from the association pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and which are required to be paid to the Department of Revenue Services pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection. Such offset may be taken by any transferee only against the transferee's premium tax liability to this state under chapter 207. The Commissioner of Revenue Services shall not allow such offset to a transferee against its premium tax liability unless the transferor, the affiliate to which the offset was originally transferred, each subsequent transferor and each subsequent transferee have filed such information as may be required on forms provided by said commissioner with respect to any such transfer or transfers on or before the due date of the premium tax return on which such offset would have been taken by the transferor, if no transfer had been made by the transferor.\n\n(i) (1) A member insurer that wishes to protest all or part of an assessment shall pay when due the full amount of the assessment as set forth in the notice provided by the association. The payment shall be available to meet association obligations during the pendency of the protest or any subsequent appeal. Payment shall be accompanied by a written statement that (A) the payment is made under protest, and (B) includes a brief statement of the grounds for the protest.\n\n(2) Not later than sixty days following the payment of an assessment under protest by a member insurer, the association shall notify the member insurer in writing of its determination with respect to the protest unless the association notifies the member insurer that additional time is required to resolve the issues raised by the protest.\n\n(3) Not later than thirty days after a final decision has been made, the association shall notify the protesting member insurer in writing of the final decision.\n\n(4) Not later than sixty days after receipt of notice of the final decision, the protesting member insurer may appeal the final action to the commissioner.\n\n(5) In the alternative to rendering a final decision with respect to a protest based on a question regarding the assessment base, the association may refer protests to the commissioner for a final decision, with a recommendation from the association.\n\n(6) If the protest or appeal on the assessment is upheld, the amount paid in error or excess shall be returned to the member insurer. Interest on a refund due a protesting member insurer whose protest or appeal was upheld shall be paid at the rate actually earned by the association.\n\n(j) The association may request information from member insurers in order to aid in the exercise of its power under this section and member insurers shall promptly comply with such request.\n\n(1972, P.A. 280, S. 9; P.A. 78-58, S. 2; P.A. 81-101, S. 9; P.A. 88-76, S. 9, 10; P.A. 93-239, S. 8; P.A. 00-174, S. 50, 76, 83; P.A. 01-67, S. 5; June Sp.

      "text": "(a) Any person aggrieved under section 38a-880 may apply to the Insurance Department for an order directing payment out of the Brokered Transactions Guaranty Fund subject to the limitations stated in said section and the limitations specified in this section.\n\n(b) The department shall proceed upon such application in a summary manner, after giving reasonable notice to such producer pursuant to section 38a-774, or to an unlicensed person acting as a producer engaged in the business of insurance, alleged to have caused the aggrieved person's loss or damages and, upon the hearing thereof, the aggrieved person shall be required to show: (1) He is not a spouse of the debtor, or the personal representative of such spouse; (2) he is aggrieved by the action of such insurance producer duly licensed in this state under section 38a-769, or that he is aggrieved by the action of such unlicensed person acting as a producer engaged in the business of insurance, by reason of the embezzlement of money or property, or the unlawful obtainment of money or property by false pretenses, artifice, trickery or forgery, or by reason of any fraud, misrepresentation or deceit; and (3) the aggrieved person's loss or damages are equivalent to either the amount of unearned premium or the expense of obtaining duplicate coverage, or the amount of unpaid claims in conformance with the aggrieved person's insurance contract applying any deductibles, copayment requirements or exclusions.\n\n(c) The commissioner shall make an order requiring payment from the Brokered Transactions Guaranty Fund of whatever sum he shall find to be payable upon the claim, pursuant to the provisions of and in accordance with the limitations contained in this section and section 38a-880, if the commissioner is satisfied, upon the hearing, of the truth of all matters required to be shown by the aggrieved person by subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(d) The payment from said fund of any amount in settlement of a claim against a licensed insurance producer or an unlicensed person acting as a producer engaged in the business of insurance pursuant to an order under subsection (c), shall constitute cause for the suspension or revocation of any license issued by the commissioner or for the imposition of a fine pursuant to section 38a-774 and for an order of restitution to the fund in the amount it has paid, and such producer or unlicensed person shall not be eligible to apply for a license until he has repaid in full, plus interest at a rate to be determined by the department and which shall reflect current market rates, the amount paid from said guaranty fund on his account. A discharge in bankruptcy shall not relieve a person from the penalties and disabilities provided in this subsection.\n\n(e) If, at any time, the money deposited in said guaranty fund is insufficient to satisfy any duly authorized claim or portion thereof, the department shall, when sufficient money has been deposited in said guaranty fund, satisfy such unpaid claims or portions thereof, in the order that such claims or portions thereof were originally filed, plus accumulated interest at the rate of four per cent a year.\n\n(P.A. 89-106, S. 5; P.A. 93-236, S. 3; P.A. 96-193, S. 28, 36; P.A. 98-27, S. 5–7.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 93-236 substantially revised procedure to secure payment from the guaranty fund, deleting Subsecs. (a) and (b), which had required aggrieved person to notify department of commencement of action and had detailed circumstances for payment from fund of amounts unpaid after judgment, substituting new Subsec. (a) re application for payment from fund, rewrote Subsec. (c), relettered as Subsec. (b), to provide notice requirements to the agent or broker or unlicensed agent or broker engaged in the business of insurance and to outline the showing required to state a claim against the guaranty fund, deleted Subsec. (d) re waiver of compliance with certain requirements by aggrieved person, relettered Subsec. (e) as (c), substituting “commissioner” for “department” and making certain technical changes for accuracy, relettered Subsec. (f) as (d) and made provision for suspension or revocation of license or imposition of a fine and relettered Subsec. (g) as (e) (Revisor's note: The word “that” was deleted editorially by the Revisors from the beginning of Subdivs. (2) and (3) of Subsec. (b) for consistency with Subdiv. (1)); P.A. 96-193 substituted “producer” for “agent” and “broker”, effective June 3, 1996; P.A. 98-27 amended Subsec. (a) to substitute “the Brokered Transactions Guaranty Fund” for “such guaranty fund”, amended Subsec. (d) to substitute “said” for “such” and amended Subsec. (e) to substitute “said” for “such” (Revisor's note: A missed reference in Subsec. (e) to “such guaranty fund” was changed editorially by the Revisors to “said guaranty fund”).",
