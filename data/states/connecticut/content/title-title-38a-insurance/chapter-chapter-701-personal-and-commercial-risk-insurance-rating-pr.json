      "text": "The following standards, methods and criteria shall apply to the making and use of rates pertaining to commercial risk insurance:\n\n(a) Rates shall not be excessive or inadequate, as herein defined, nor shall they be unfairly discriminatory. No rate shall be held to be excessive unless (1) such rate is unreasonably high for the insurance provided or (2) a reasonable degree of competition does not exist in the area with respect to the classification to which such rate is applicable. No rate shall be held inadequate unless (A) it is unreasonably low for the insurance provided, and (B) continued use of it would endanger solvency of the insurer, or unless (C) such rate is unreasonably low for the insurance provided and the use of such rate by the insurer using same has, or, if continued, will have the effect of destroying competition or creating a monopoly.\n\n(b) Consideration shall be given, to the extent possible, to past and prospective loss experience within and outside this state, to conflagration and catastrophe hazards, to a reasonable margin for underwriting profit and contingencies, to past and prospective expenses both country-wide and those specially applicable to this state, to investment income earned or realized by insurers both from their unearned premium and loss reserve funds, and to all other factors, including judgment factors, deemed relevant within and outside this state and in the case of fire insurance rates, consideration may be given to the experience of the fire insurance business during the most recent five- year period for which such experience is available. Consideration may be given in the making and use of rates to dividends, savings or unabsorbed premium deposits allowed or returned by insurers to their policyholders, members or subscribers.\n\n(c) The systems of expense provisions included in the rates for use by any insurer or group of insurers may differ from those of other insurers or groups of insurers to reflect the operating methods of any such insurer or group with respect to any kind of insurance, or with respect to any subdivision or combination thereof.\n\n(d) Risks may be grouped by classifications for the establishment of rates and minimum premiums, provided no surcharge on any motor vehicle liability or physical damage insurance premium may be assigned for (1) any accident involving only property damage of one thousand dollars or less, or (2) the first accident involving only property damage of more than one thousand dollars which would otherwise result in a surcharge to the policy of the insured, within the experience period set forth in the insurer's safe driver classification plan, or (3) any violation of section 14-219, unless such violation results in the suspension or revocation of the operator's license under section 14-111b, or (4) less than three violations of section 14-218a within any one-year period, or (5) any accident caused by an operator other than the named insured, a relative residing in the named insured's household, or a person who customarily operates the insured vehicle. Classification rates may be modified to produce rates for individual risks in accordance with rating plans which provide for recognition of variations in hazards or expense provisions or both. Such rating plans may include application of the judgment of the insurer and may measure any differences among risks that can be demonstrated to have a probable effect upon losses or expenses.\n\n(e) Each rating plan shall establish appropriate eligibility criteria for determining significant risks which are to qualify under the plan, provided all such plans shall include as an eligible significant risk the state of Connecticut or its instrumentalities. Rating plans which comply with the provisions of this subsection shall be deemed to produce rates which are not unfairly discriminatory.\n\n(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) to (e), inclusive, of this section, no rate shall include any adjustment designed to recover underwriting or operating losses incurred out-of-state.\n\n(g) The commissioner may adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 concerning rating plans to effectuate the provisions of this section.\n\n(1969, P.A. 665, S. 3; P.A. 77-199, S. 2, 12; 77-200; P.A. 78-25; P.A. 79-204, S. 1, 3; 79-609, S. 4; P.A. 80-276, S. 2, 6; P.A. 82-353, S. 4, 26; P.A. 84-165, S. 1; P.A. 85-45, S. 2; P.A. 88-73, S. 3; P.A. 89-114, S. 1; 89-193, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 77-199 substituted “or” for “and” before Subdiv.

(d)(3) providing that no surcharge on an automobile insurance policy may be assigned for the first accident involving only property damage of more than $1,000 which would otherwise result in a surcharge to the policy of the insured, within a certain experience period and renumbered the remaining Subdivs.; Sec. 38-201c transferred to Sec. 38a-665 in 1991.\n\nSee Sec. 38a-686 re standards for the making and use of rates for personal risk insurance.",

      "text": "The following standards, methods and criteria shall apply to the making and use of rates pertaining to personal risk insurance:\n\n(a) Rates shall not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.\n\n(1) A rate in a competitive market is not excessive. A rate in a noncompetitive market including a rate for insurance provided pursuant to sections 38a-328, 38a-329 and 38a-670 is excessive if it is unreasonably high for the insurance provided.\n\n(2) No rate shall be held inadequate unless (A) it is unreasonably low for the insurance provided, and (B) continued use of it would endanger solvency of the insurer, or unless (C) such rate is unreasonably low for the insurance provided and the use of such rate by the insurer using same has, or, if continued will have, the effect of destroying competition or creating a monopoly.\n\n(b) In determining whether rates comply with the excessiveness standard in a noncompetitive market under subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of this section, the inadequacy standard under subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section and the requirement that rates not be unfairly discriminatory, the following criteria shall apply:\n\n(1) Consideration may be given, to the extent possible, to past and prospective loss experience within and outside this state, to conflagration and catastrophe hazards, to a reasonable margin for underwriting profit and contingencies, to past and prospective expenses both country-wide and those specially applicable to this state, to investment income earned or realized by insurers both from their unearned premium and loss reserve funds, and to all other factors, including judgment factors, deemed relevant within and outside this state and in the case of fire insurance rates, consideration may be given to the experience of the fire insurance business during the most recent five-year period for which such experience is available. Consideration may be given in the making and use of rates to dividends, savings or unabsorbed premium deposits allowed or returned by insurers to their policyholders, members or subscribers.\n\n(2) (A) The systems of expense provisions included in the rates for use by an insurer or group of insurers may differ from those of other insurers or groups of insurers to reflect the operating methods of any such insurer or group with respect to any kind of insurance, or with respect to any subdivision or combination thereof.\n\n(B) (i) With respect to private passenger nonfleet automobile insurance, an insurer shall not allocate as flat dollar amounts to base rates: (I) Producer commissions; (II) premium taxes; (III) underwriting profits; or (IV) contingencies.\n\n(ii) With respect to private passenger nonfleet automobile insurance, an insurer shall allocate as flat dollar amounts to base rates: (I) At least ninety per cent of general expenses, including administration and overhead costs; (II) at least ninety per cent of other acquisition costs for marketing and agent field offices, which may be allocated over the expected life of such insurer's policies; and (III) miscellaneous taxes, licenses and fees.\n\n(iii) Each insurer shall allocate such flat dollar amounts set forth in subparagraph (B)(ii) of this subdivision after any classification factors set forth in subdivisions (3) to (5), inclusive, of this subsection have been applied to base rates.\n\n(3) Risks may be grouped by classifications for the establishment of rates and minimum premiums, provided with respect to private passenger nonfleet automobile insurance, any change in territorial classifications shall be subject to prior approval by the Insurance Commissioner, and provided no surcharge on any motor vehicle liability or physical damage insurance premium shall be assigned for (A) any accident involving only property damage of one thousand dollars or less, (B) the first accident involving only property damage of more than one thousand dollars which would otherwise result in a surcharge to the policy of the insured, within the experience period set forth in the insurer's safe driver classification plan, (C) any violation of section 14-219 unless such violation results in the suspension or revocation of the operator's license under section 14-111b, (D) less than three violations of section 14-218a within any one-year period, (E) any accident caused by an operator other than the named insured, a relative residing in the named insured's household, or a person who customarily operates the insured vehicle, (F) the first or second accident within the current experience period in relation to which the insured was not convicted of a moving traffic violation and was not at fault, or (G) any motor vehicle infraction. Subparagraph (G) of this subdivision shall not be applicable to any plan established pursuant to section 38a-329. Classification rates may be modified to produce rates for individual risks in accordance with rating plans that provide for recognition of variations in hazards or expense provisions or both. Such rating plans may include application of the judgment of the insurer and may measure any differences among risks that can be demonstrated to have a probable effect upon losses or expenses.\n\n(4) Each rating plan for private passenger nonfleet automobile insurance that includes territorial classifications shall assign a weight of seventy-five per cent to individual territorial loss cost indication and twenty-five per cent to the state-wide average loss cost indication.\n\n(5) Each rating plan shall establish appropriate eligibility criteria for determining significant risks that are to qualify under the plan. Rating plans that comply with the provisions of this subdivision shall be deemed to produce rates that are not unfairly discriminatory.\n\n(6) With respect to personal risk insurance, an insurer shall not use an applicant's or insured's credit history as a factor in underwriting or rating except in accordance with this subdivision. For the purposes of this section, “credit history” means any credit-related information derived from or found in a credit report or credit scoring program or provided in an application for personal risk insurance, and “financial history measurement program” means a program that uses an applicant's credit history to measure such applicant's risk of loss.\n\n(A) An insurer shall file with the commissioner any financial history measurement program it uses to underwrite or rate risks for personal risk insurance. Such filing shall (i) include a description of the program, (ii) identify the characteristics used in such program from which a measurement is derived, (iii) include the rules and procedures of such program, and (iv) include an explanation of the impact of credit information and items of public record on insurance rates over time. Such program shall not unfairly discriminate among applicants or produce rates that are excessive for the risk assumed. Any filing made pursuant to this subparagraph shall be considered a trade secret for the purposes of section 1-210.\n\n(B) (i) An insurer that uses a financial history measurement program shall submit to the commissioner documentation that demonstrates the correlation between such program and the expected risk of loss, and how such program impacts consumers (I) in urban territories, versus consumers in nonurban territories, and (II) based on consumers' ages. The commissioner may request the insurer to provide a financial history measurement for a set of test examples that reflect various characteristics.\n\n(ii) An insurer that uses a financial history measurement program shall disclose to each applicant for personal risk insurance, in writing, by telephone, by electronic mail or orally, at the time of application that the applicant's credit history may be used in the underwriting or rating of such applicant's policy, and that the applicant has the right to request, in writing, that the insurer consider, during its underwriting or rating process or during a review requested by such applicant of a rate quote, an extraordinary life circumstance, as set forth in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision, if such applicant's credit history has been adversely impacted by such extraordinary life circumstance and such extraordinary life circumstance occurred within three years before the date of the application. In addition, such insurer shall provide to each purchaser of such policy, not later than the date of issuance of such policy, a written disclosure that includes: (I) The name, address, telephone number and toll-free telephone number, if applicable, of the insurer; (II) detailed information about how the insurer uses credit information to underwrite or rate such policies; and (III) a summary of consumer protections regarding the use of credit, in a form determined by the commissioner. Such written disclosure shall be printed in reasonably conspicuous type and be provided by the insurer electronically, by mail or by hand delivery.\n\n(C) (i) An insurer may use a financial history measurement program to underwrite or rate risks only (I) for new personal risk insurance policies, or (II) upon renewal, either at the request of an insured or if such use reduces the premium for the insured in accordance with the insurer's filed rates and rules.\n\n(ii) An insurer shall not use the following characteristics in a financial history measurement program: (I) The number of credit inquiries in an applicant's or insured's credit report or credit history; (II) the applicant's or insured's use of a particular type of credit card, debit card or charge card; (III) the applicant's or insured's total available line of credit; (IV) any disputed credit information while such dispute is under review by a credit reporting company, provided such information is identified in an applicant's or insured's credit report or credit history as being in dispute; (V) collection accounts identified with a medical industry code in the applicant's or insured's credit report or credit history; and (VI) the applicant's or insured's lack of credit history, unless the insurer treats the applicant or insured as if such applicant or insured had neutral credit information, as defined by the insurer.\n\n(iii) A financial history measurement program shall give the same weight to an applicant's or insured's purchase or financing of a specific item regardless of the type of item purchased or financed.\n\n(D) (i) Upon written request by an applicant, an insurer shall consider, during its underwriting or rating process or during a review requested by such applicant of a rate quote, an extraordinary life circumstance of such applicant if such extraordinary life circumstance occurred within three years before the date of application. If such insurer determines that such applicant's credit history has been adversely impacted by such extraordinary life circumstance, such insurer shall grant a reasonable exception to such insurer's rates, rating classifications or underwriting rules for such applicant. As used in this subparagraph, “extraordinary life circumstance” means (I) a catastrophic illness or injury, (II) divorce, (III) the death of a spouse, child or parent, (IV) the involuntary loss of employment for more than three consecutive months, (V) identity theft, (VI) total or other loss that makes a home uninhabitable, (VII) other circumstances as may be adopted in regulations by the commissioner, in accordance with chapter 54, or (VIII) any other circumstance an insurer may choose to recognize.\n\n(ii) An insurer may require the applicant to provide reasonable, independently verifiable written documentation of the extraordinary life circumstance and the effect of such extraordinary life circumstance on such applicant's credit report or credit history. Any such documentation shall be kept confidential by the insurer.\n\n(iii) If the insurer grants an exception pursuant to subparagraph (D)(i) of this subdivision, the insurer shall (I) consider only credit information that is not affected by the extraordinary life circumstance, or (II) treat the applicant as if such applicant had neutral or better than neutral credit information, as defined by the insurer.\n\n(iv) An insurer shall not be deemed to be out of compliance with any provision of the general statutes or regulations adopted thereunder concerning underwriting, rating or rate filing solely on the basis of the granting of an exception pursuant to this subparagraph.\n\n(E) (i) If an insurer takes an adverse action that is due at least in part to the information contained in an applicant's or insured's credit report, such insurer shall disclose to such applicant or insured: (I) That such adverse action was based on the credit report of such insured or applicant; (II) that such applicant or insured is entitled to a free copy of such credit report and where such report can be obtained; (III) the types of extraordinary life circumstances set forth in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision; and (IV) the procedures for an applicant to inform the insurer of an extraordinary life circumstance and to submit any required documentation pursuant to subparagraph (D) of this subdivision.\n\n(ii) For the purposes of this subdivision, an “adverse action” means (I) the denial of coverage to an applicant or insured or the offering of restricted coverage, (II) the offering of a higher rate, (III) the assignment of an applicant or insured to a higher rate tier or to a higher-priced company within an insurer group, or (IV) any other action that adversely impacts an applicant or insured due to the financial history measurement program.\n\n(F) After an insurer's financial history measurement program has been in effect for two years, the commissioner may require such insurer to submit a report to the commissioner on the use of such program in the state. Such report shall include information that demonstrates that such program results in rates that are supported by the data and that are not unfairly discriminatory, and an analysis of consumer complaints submitted in writing or by electronic mail to the insurer resulting from such insurer's use of a financial history measurement program, such that is sufficient to identify the basis for the complaints and any subsequent insurer action.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, no rate shall include any adjustment designed to recover underwriting or operating losses incurred out-of-state.\n\n(d) Not later than January 1, 2012, the commissioner shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to implement the provisions of this section and the most current guidelines and bulletins issued by the Insurance Department and in effect that pertain to territorial classifications.\n\n(P.A. 82-353, S. 5, 26; P.A. 84-165, S. 2; P.A. 85-45, S. 1; P.A. 86-254; P.A. 88-73, S. 4; P.A. 89-114, S. 2; 89-192, S. 2; 89-193, S. 2; P.A. 10-7, S. 1, 2; P.A. 11-19, S. 16; P.A. 17-15, S. 78.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 82-353, S. 5, effective July 1, 1983; P.A. 84-165 amended Subsec.

      "text": "(a) With respect to personal risk insurance, a competitive market is presumed to exist unless the commissioner, after hearing, determines that a reasonable degree of competition does not exist in a market and issues a ruling to that effect. Any such ruling shall expire no later than three years after the date of issue unless the commissioner renews the ruling after hearing and a finding as to the continued lack of a reasonable degree of competition. After such ruling has been in effect for a period of at least one year but not exceeding two years, any insurance company may make written request to the commissioner for a hearing at which it or any of the insurance companies affected by the ruling may present evidence that competition exists in the affected market. The commissioner shall hold such hearing within sixty days after receipt of the request. He shall provide written notice of the time and place of the hearing to all insurance companies affected by the ruling at least fifteen days in advance of such hearing. The commissioner shall issue his findings within thirty days after such hearing. If the commissioner finds a continued lack of reasonable competition in the affected market, his original ruling shall remain in effect. If the commissioner finds that a reasonable degree of competition exists in the affected market, his original ruling shall expire immediately.\n\n(b) In determining whether or not a reasonable degree of competition exists in a market pursuant to subsection (a), the commissioner may define that market in terms of a product market component and a geographic market component. The product market component shall consist of identical or readily interchangeable products including, but not limited to, consideration of coverage, policy terms, rate classifications and underwriting. The geographic market component shall consist of a geographical area in which buyers have a reasonable degree of access to the insurance product through sales outlets and other marketing mechanisms. In determining the geographic market component, the commissioner shall consider existing marketing patterns. The commissioner may consider relevant tests of workable competition pertaining to market structure, performance and conduct and the practical opportunities available to consumers in the market to acquire pricing and other consumer information and to compare and obtain insurance from competing insurers. Such tests may include, but are not limited to, the following: Size and number of firms actively engaged in the market; market shares and changes in market shares of firms, ease of entry and exit from a given market, underwriting restriction or results, investment income earned or realized by insurers from both their unearned premium and loss reserve funds for that market, availability of consumer information concerning the product and sales outlets or other sales mechanisms, and efforts of insurers to provide consumer information. The determination of competition involves the interaction of the various tests. The weight given to specific tests depends upon the particular situation and pattern of test results.\n\n(c) In determining whether or not a competitive market exists pursuant to subsection (a), the commissioner shall monitor the degree of competition in this state. In doing so, he shall utilize existing relevant information, analytical systems and other sources, participate in or cause the development of new relevant information, analytical systems and other sources or rely on some combination thereof. Such activities may be conducted internally within the Insurance Department, in cooperation with other state insurance departments, through outside contractors or in any other manner deemed appropriate by the commissioner. For purposes of judicial review pursuant to the provisions of section 4-183, the determination of whether or not a competitive market exists shall be deemed to be a question of fact.\n\n(d) For the purpose of determining whether a competitive market exists, the commissioner, in his discretion, may make such public or private investigations within or outside this state as he deems necessary.\n\n(e) For the purpose of any hearing or investigation under sections 38a-663 to 38a-696, inclusive, the commissioner or any officer designated by the commissioner may administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, receive oral and documentary evidence and require the production of any books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, agreements or other documents or records which the commissioner deems relevant or material to the inquiry.\n\n(f) In case of a refusal of any person to comply with any subpoena issued hereunder or to testify with respect to any matter concerning which he may be lawfully interrogated, the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford, upon application by the commissioner, may issue an order requiring such person to comply with such subpoena or to testify. Failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt of court.\n\n(g) No person may be excused from attending and testifying or from producing any document or record before the commissioner, or in obedience to the subpoena of the commissioner or any officer designated by him, or in any proceeding instituted by the commissioner, on the ground that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to a penalty of forfeiture, provided no individual may be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he is compelled, after claiming his privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, except that the individual testifying is not exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury or contempt committed in testifying.\n\n(P.A. 82-353, S. 6, 26; P.A. 88-230, S. 1, 12; P.A. 90-98, S. 1, 2; P.A. 93-142, S. 4, 7, 8; P.A. 95-220, S. 4–6; P.A. 01-174, S. 16.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 82-353, S. 6, effective July 1, 1983; P.A. 88-230 replaced “judicial district of Hartford-New Britain” with “judicial district of Hartford”, effective September 1, 1991; P.A. 90-98 changed the effective date of P.A. 88-230 from September 1, 1991, to September 1, 1993; Sec. 38-201w transferred to Sec. 38a-687 in 1991; P.A. 93-142 changed the effective date of P.A. 88-230 from September 1, 1993, to September 1, 1996, effective June 14, 1993; P.A. 95-220 changed the effective date of P.A. 88-230 from September 1, 1996, to September 1, 1998, effective July 1, 1995; P.A. 01-174 amended Subsec.

      "text": "(a) The following procedures shall apply with respect to rates pertaining to personal risk insurance and residual markets:\n\n(1) In a competitive market, every insurer shall file with the commissioner all rates and supplementary rate information to be used in this state, provided such rates and information need not be filed for inland marine risks that by general custom of the business are not written according to manual rules or rating plans. No such filings may be made by a rating organization on behalf of any insurer. Such rates and supplementary rate information shall be filed by the effective date of the filing or the date that premium billing notices reflecting the new rates are sent to insureds or agents, whichever is earlier. In a competitive market, if the commissioner finds, after a hearing, that an insurer's rates require closer supervision because of the insurer's financial condition or unfairly discriminatory rating practices, the insurer shall file with the commissioner at least thirty days before the effective date, all such rates and such supplementary rate information and supporting information as prescribed by the commissioner. Upon application by the filer, the commissioner may authorize an earlier effective date for the filing.\n\n(2) In a noncompetitive market, every insurer shall file with the commissioner all rates and supplementary rate information for that market and such supporting information as is required by the commissioner. For purposes of subsection (d) of section 7-479e, sections 38a-341, 38a-387, 38a-665, subsection (b) of section 38a-672, and sections 38a-673, 38a-675, 38a-676 and 38a-686 to 38a-694, inclusive, residual markets, title insurance and credit property insurance are deemed to be noncompetitive markets. All rates and supplementary rate information and such supporting information as is required by the commissioner, shall also be filed with the commissioner for insurance provided pursuant to section 38a-328, 38a-329 or 38a-670. Such rates and supplementary rate information and supporting information required by the commissioner shall be on file with the commissioner for a waiting period of thirty days before it becomes effective, which period may be extended by the commissioner for an additional period not to exceed thirty days if the commissioner gives written notice within such waiting period to the insurer or rating organization that made the filing that the commissioner needs such additional time for the consideration of such filing. Upon written application by such insurer or rating organization, the commissioner may authorize a filing that the commissioner has reviewed to become effective before the expiration of the waiting period or any extension thereof. A filing shall be deemed to meet the requirements of sections 38a-663 to 38a-696, inclusive, unless disapproved by the commissioner within the waiting period or any extension thereof. If, within the waiting period or any extension thereof, the commissioner finds that a filing does not meet the requirements of sections 38a-663 to 38a-696, inclusive, the commissioner shall send to the insurer or rating organization which made such filing written notice of disapproval of such filing, specifying therein in what respects the commissioner finds such filing fails to meet the requirements of sections 38a-663 to 38a-696, inclusive, and stating that such filing shall not become effective. Such finding of the commissioner shall be subject to review as provided in section 38a-19.\n\n(3) An insurer may file rates by reference, with or without deviation, to rates charged by another insurer that were filed and are in effect if the insurer's direct written premium for the applicable line of insurance is less than one-half of one per cent of the total state-wide direct written premium for that line, as determined from the annual statements filed by insurers licensed to do business in this state and as calculated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners from its data base. Supporting information shall not be required for rates filed by reference pursuant to this subsection. For purposes of this subdivision, “insurer” includes two or more admitted insurers having a common ownership or operating in this state under common management or control.\n\n(4) Rates filed pursuant to this section shall be filed in such form and manner as is prescribed by the commissioner. Whenever a filing made pursuant to subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of this section is not accompanied by the information upon which the insurer supports such filing and the commissioner does not have sufficient information to determine whether such filing meets the requirements of sections 38a-663 to 38a-696, inclusive, the commissioner shall require such insurer to furnish the information upon which it supports such filing and in such event the waiting period shall commence as of the date such information is furnished. The information furnished in support of a filing may include (A) the experience or judgment of the insurer making the filing, (B) its interpretation of any statistical data it relies upon, (C) the experience of other insurers, or (D) any other relevant factors.\n\n(5) All rates, supplementary rate information and any supporting information for risks filed under subsection (d) of section 7-479e, sections 38a-341, 38a-387, 38a-665, subsection (b) of section 38a-672, and sections 38a-673, 38a-675, 38a-676 and 38a-686 to 38a-694, inclusive, shall, as soon as filed, be open to public inspection at any reasonable time. Copies may be obtained by any person on request and upon payment of a reasonable charge.\n\n(b) Rates for insurance described in subsection (a) of this section shall be subject to review as follows:\n\n(1) Rates subject to prefiling under subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of this section may be reviewed and disapproved before their effective date, except that rates for insurance provided pursuant to section 38a-328, 38a-329 and 38a-670 shall not be effective until approved by the commissioner. Any rate may be reviewed and disapproved subsequent to its effective date.\n\n(2) The commissioner may disapprove a rate if the insurer fails to comply with the filing requirements of this section. The commissioner shall disapprove a rate for use in a competitive market if the commissioner finds that the rate is inadequate or unfairly discriminatory under subsection (a) of section 38a-686. The commissioner shall disapprove a rate for use in a noncompetitive or residual market if the commissioner finds the rate is excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory under subsection (a) of section 38a-686.\n\n(3) If the commissioner finds that a reasonable degree of competition does not exist in a market in accordance with section 38a-687, the commissioner may require that the insurers in that market file supporting information with respect to existing rates. If the commissioner believes that such rates may violate any of the requirements of subsection (d) of section 7-479e, sections 38a-341, 38a-387, 38a-665, subsection (b) of section 38a-672, or sections 38a-673, 38a-675, 38a-676, or 38a-686 to 38a-694, inclusive, the commissioner may proceed as provided in section 38a-678. If the commissioner believes that rates in a competitive market violate the inadequacy or unfair discrimination standards in section 38a-686 or any other applicable requirement of subsection (d) of section 7-479e, section 38a-341, 38a-387, 38a-665, subsection (b) of section 38a-672, or sections 38a-673, 38a-675, 38a-676, or 38a-686 to 38a-694, inclusive, the commissioner may require the insurers in that market to file supporting information with respect to existing rates. If after reviewing the supporting information, the commissioner continues to believe that such rates may violate these requirements, the commissioner may proceed as provided in section 38a-678. The commissioner may disapprove, without hearing, rates prefiled pursuant to subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of this section that have not become effective, provided the insurer whose rates have been disapproved shall be given a hearing pursuant to section 38a-19.\n\n(4) If the commissioner disapproves a rate, the commissioner shall issue an order specifying the respects in which it fails to meet the requirements of subsection (d) of section 7-479e, section 38a-341, 38a-387, 38a-665, subsection (b) of section 38a-672, and sections 38a-673, 38a-675, 38a-676, and 38a-686 to 38a-694, inclusive. For rates in effect at the time of the disapproval, the commissioner shall state, within a reasonable period of time, when the further use of such rate in contracts of insurance made thereafter shall be prohibited. The commissioner shall issue such order not later than thirty days after the hearing or within such reasonable time extension as the commissioner may determine. Such order may include a provision for premium adjustment for the period after the effective date of the order for policies in effect on such date.\n\n(5) Whenever an insurer has no legally effective rates as a result of the commissioner's disapproval of rates or other act, the commissioner shall specify interim rates. Upon appeal from any such order of the commissioner the court may, upon request of the appealing insurer, stay such order, provided the insurer places in an escrow account the difference, as received, between the disapproved rates and the interim rates specified by the commissioner. When new rates become legally effective, the commissioner shall order the escrowed funds to be distributed appropriately, with interest at the legal rate as provided in section 37-1, except that minimal refunds to policyholders are not required to be distributed.\n\n(P.A. 82-353, S. 11, 26; P.A. 92-60, S. 21; P.A. 93-297, S. 16, 29; P.A. 01-174, S. 17; P.A. 17-15, S. 79.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 82-353, S. 11, effective July 1, 1983; Sec. 38-201x transferred to Sec. 38a-688 in 1991; P.A. 92-60 made technical corrections for statutory consistency; P.A. 93-297 deleted references to repealed Sec. 38a-386, effective January 1, 1994, and applicable to acts or omissions occurring on or after said date; P.A. 01-174 amended Subsec.

Such percentage limits shall not apply on an individual insured basis. Not more than one filing may be made by an insurer pursuant to this section within any twelve-month period unless the filing, when combined with one or more filings made by the insurer within the preceding twelve months, does not result in an overall state-wide increase or decrease of more than six per cent in the aggregate and not more than a fifteen per cent increase in any individual territory for all coverages that are subject to the filing.\n\n(b) A filing that does not meet the criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall be subject to sections 38a-389 and 38a-688 unless the filing is otherwise exempt from said sections.\n\n(c) A filing submitted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this chapter, except that the commissioner shall have the authority to determine whether the filing is inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.
