      "text": "(a) For purposes of this section, “controverted claim” means any claim in which compensation is denied either in whole or in part by the workers' compensation carrier or the employer, if self-insured.\n\n(b) Any insurer, hospital service corporation, medical service corporation, health care center or employee welfare benefit plan that furnished benefits or services under a health insurance policy or a self-insured employee welfare benefit plan to any person suffering an injury or illness covered by the Workers' Compensation Act has a lien on the proceeds of any award or approval of any compromise made by an administrative law judge less attorneys' fees approved by the district administrative law judge and reasonable costs related to the proceeding, to the extent of benefits paid or services provided for the effects of the injury or illness arising out of and in the course of employment as a result of a controverted claim, provided such plan, policy or contract provides for reduction, exclusion, or coordination of benefits of the policy or plan on account of workers' compensation benefits.\n\n(c) The lien shall arise at the time such benefits are paid or such services are rendered. The person or entity furnishing such benefits or services shall serve written notice upon the employee, the insurance company providing workers' compensation benefits or the employer, if self-insured, and the administrative law judge for the district in which the claim for workers' compensation has been filed, setting forth the nature and extent of the lien allowable under subsection (b) of this section. The lien shall be effective against any workers' compensation award made after the notice is received.\n\n(d) The written notice shall be served upon the employee at his last-known address, the insurance company at its principal place of business in this state or the employer, if self-insured, at its principal place of business, and the administrative law judge, at the district office.

The receipt of such reimbursement by such insurer, hospital service corporation, medical service corporation, health care center or employee welfare benefit plan shall fully discharge such lien.\n\n(f) The validity or amount of the lien may be contested by the workers' compensation carrier, the employer, if self-insured or the employee by bringing an action in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford or in the judicial district in which the plaintiff resides. Such cases shall have the same privilege with respect to their assignment for trial as appeals from the workers' compensation review division but shall first be claimed for the short calendar unless the court shall order the matter placed on the trial list. An appeal may be taken from the decision of the Superior Court to the Appellate Court in the same manner as is provided in section 51-197b. In any appeal in which one of the parties is not represented by counsel and in which the party taking the appeal does not claim the case for the short calendar or trial within a reasonable time after the return day, the court may of its own motion dismiss the appeal, or the party ready to proceed may move for nonsuit or default as appropriate.

Rate filings shall include the information and data required under section 38a-479qqq if the policy is subject to said section, and an actuarial memorandum that includes, but is not limited to, pricing assumptions and claims experience, and premium rates and loss ratios from the inception of the policy. Each premium rate filed on or after January 1, 2021, shall, if the insurer intends to account for rebates, as defined in section 38a-479ooo in the manner specified in section 38a-479rrr, account for such rebates in such manner, if the policy is subject to section 38a-479rrr. The commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to establish a procedure for reviewing such policies. The commissioner shall disapprove the use of such form at any time if it does not comply with the requirements of law, or if it contains a provision or provisions that are unfair or deceptive or that encourage misrepresentation of the policy. The commissioner shall notify, in writing, the insurer that has filed any such form of the commissioner's disapproval, specifying the reasons for disapproval, and ordering that no such insurer shall deliver or issue for delivery to any person in this state a policy on or containing such form.

Such provisions shall be preceded individually by the caption appearing in this subsection or, at the option of the insurer, by such appropriate individual or group captions or subcaptions as the commissioner may approve. Such provisions to be contained in such policy shall be:\n\n(1) A provision as follows: “ENTIRE CONTRACT: CHANGES: This policy, including the endorsements and the attached papers, if any, constitutes the entire contract of insurance. No change in this policy shall be valid until approved by an executive officer of the insurer and unless such approval be endorsed hereon or attached hereto. No agent has authority to change this policy or to waive any of its provisions.”\n\n(2) A provision as follows: “TIME LIMIT ON CERTAIN DEFENSES: This policy shall be incontestable, except for nonpayment of premium, after it has been in force for two years from its date of issue.”\n\n(3) A provision as follows: “GRACE PERIOD: A grace period of .... (insert a number not less than seven for weekly premium policies, ten for monthly premium policies and thirty-one for all other policies) days will be granted for the payment of each premium falling due after the first premium, during which grace period the policy shall continue in force.” A policy which contains a cancellation provision may add, at the end of the above provision, “subject to the right of the insurer to cancel in accordance with the cancellation provision hereof.” A policy in which the insurer reserves the right to refuse any renewal may have, at the beginning of the above provision, “Unless not less than five days prior to the premium due date the insurer has delivered to the insured or has mailed to his last address as shown by the records of the insurer written notice of its intention not to renew this policy beyond the period for which the premium has been accepted.”\n\n(4) A provision as follows: “REINSTATEMENT: If any renewal premium is not paid within the time granted the insured for payment, a subsequent acceptance of premium by the insurer or by any agent duly authorized by the insurer to accept such premium, without requiring in connection therewith an application for reinstatement, shall reinstate the policy; provided, if the insurer or such agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a conditional receipt for the premium tendered, the policy shall be reinstated upon approval of such application by the insurer or, lacking such approval, upon the forty-fifth day following the date of such conditional receipt unless the insurer has previously notified the insured, in writing, of its disapproval of such application. The reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental injury as may be sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss due to such sickness as may begin more than ten days after such date. In all other respects the insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the reinstatement. Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not to any period more than sixty days prior to the date of reinstatement.” The last sentence of the above provision may be omitted from any policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age fifty or (2), in the case of a policy issued after age forty-four, for at least five years from its date of issue.\n\n(5) A provision as follows: “NOTICE OF CLAIM: Written notice of claim must be given to the insurer within twenty days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss covered by the policy, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible. Notice given by or on behalf of the insured or the beneficiary to the insurer at .... (insert the location of such office as the insurer may designate for the purpose), or to any authorized agent of the insurer, with information sufficient to identify the insured, shall be deemed notice to the insurer.” In a policy providing a loss-of-time benefit which may be payable for at least two years, an insurer may, at its option, insert the following between the first and second sentences of the above provision: “Subject to the qualifications set forth below, if the insured suffers loss of time on account of disability for which indemnity may be payable for at least two years, he shall, at least once in every six months after having given notice of claim, give to the insurer notice of continuance of said disability, except in the event of legal incapacity. The period of six months following any filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on account of such claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be excluded in applying this provision. Delay in the giving of such notice shall not impair the insured's right to any indemnity which would otherwise have accrued during the period of six months preceding the date on which such notice is actually given.”\n\n(6) A provision as follows: “CLAIM FORMS: The insurer, upon receipt of a notice of claim, shall furnish to the claimant such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing proofs of loss. If such forms are not furnished within fifteen days after the giving of such notice, the claimant shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of this policy as to proof of loss, upon submitting, within the time fixed in the policy for filing proofs of loss, written proof covering the occurrence, the character and the extent of the loss for which claim is made.”\n\n(7) A provision as follows: “PROOFS OF LOSS: Written proof of loss shall be furnished to the insurer at its said office in case of claim for loss for which this policy provides any periodic payment contingent upon continuing loss within ninety days after the termination of the period for which the insurer is liable and in case of claim for any other loss within ninety days after the date of such loss. Failure to furnish such proof within the time required shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it was not reasonably possible to give proof within such time, provided such proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the absence of legal capacity, later than one year from the time proof is otherwise required.”\n\n(8) A provision as follows: “TIME OF PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnities payable under this policy for any loss other than loss for which this policy provides any periodic payment will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof of such loss. Subject to due written proof of loss, all accrued indemnities for loss for which this policy provides periodic payment shall be paid .... (insert period for payment that shall not be less frequently than monthly) and any balance remaining unpaid upon the termination of liability will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof.”\n\n(9) A provision as follows: “PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnity for loss of life will be payable in accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions respecting such payment which may be prescribed herein and effective at the time of payment. If no such designation or provision is then effective, such indemnity shall be payable to the estate of the insured. Any other accrued indemnities unpaid at the insured's death may, at the option of the insurer, be paid either to such beneficiary or to such estate. All other indemnities will be payable to the insured.” The following provisions, or either of them, may be included with the foregoing provision at the option of the insurer: “If any indemnity of this policy shall be payable to the estate of the insured, or to an insured or beneficiary who is a minor or otherwise not competent to give a valid release, the insurer may pay such indemnity, up to an amount not exceeding $.... (insert an amount which shall not exceed one thousand dollars), to any relative by blood or connection by marriage of the insured or beneficiary who is deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto. Any payment made by the insurer in good faith pursuant to this provision shall fully discharge the insurer to the extent of such payment. Subject to any written direction of the insured in the application or otherwise, all or a portion of any indemnities provided by this policy on account of hospital, nursing, medical or surgical services may, at the insurer's option and unless the insured requests otherwise in writing not later than the time of filing proofs of such loss, be paid directly to the hospital or person rendering such services; but it is not required that the service be rendered by a particular hospital or person.”\n\n(10) A provision as follows: “PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS AND AUTOPSY: The insurer at its own expense shall have the right and opportunity to examine the person of the insured when and as often as it may reasonably require during the pendency of a claim hereunder and to make an autopsy in case of death where it is not forbidden by law.”\n\n(11) A provision as follows: “LEGAL ACTIONS: No action at law or in equity shall be brought to recover on this policy prior to the expiration of sixty days after written proof of loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements of this policy. No such action shall be brought after the expiration of three years after the time written proof of loss is required to be furnished.”\n\n(12) A provision as follows: “CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY: Unless the insured makes an irrevocable designation of beneficiary, the right to change of beneficiary is reserved to the insured and the consent of the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall not be requisite to surrender or assignment of this policy or to any change of beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to any other changes in this policy.” The first clause of this provision, relating to the irrevocable designation of beneficiary, may be omitted at the insurer's option.\n\n(b) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, no such policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this state shall contain provisions respecting the matters set forth below unless such provisions are in the words in which the same appear in this section; provided the insurer may, at its option, use in lieu of any such provision a corresponding provision of different wording approved by the commissioner which is not less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary. Any such provision contained in the policy shall be preceded individually by the appropriate caption appearing in this subsection or, at the option of the insurer, by such appropriate individual or group captions or subcaptions as the commissioner may approve.\n\n(1) A provision as follows: “CHANGE OF OCCUPATION: If the insured be injured or contract sickness after having changed his occupation to one classified by the insurer as more hazardous than that stated in his policy or while doing for compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by the insurer for such more hazardous occupation. If the insured changes his occupation to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the excess pro-rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof, whichever is the more recent. In applying this provision, the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed by the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the state official having supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this policy was issued; but if such filing was not required, then the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by the insurer in such state prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date of proof of change in occupation.”\n\n(2) A provision as follows: “MISSTATEMENT OF AGE: If the age of the insured has been misstated, all amounts payable under this policy shall be such as the premium paid would have purchased at the correct age.”\n\n(3) A provision in accordance with subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this subdivision as follows: (i) “OTHER INSURANCE IN THIS INSURER: If an accident or sickness or accident and sickness policy or policies previously issued by the insurer to the insured be in force concurrently herewith, making the aggregate indemnity for .... (insert type of coverage or coverages) in excess of $.... (insert maximum limit of indemnity or for such excess shall be returned to the insured or his estate”; or, (ii) “OTHER INSURANCE IN THIS INSURER: Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like policy or policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy elected by the insured, his beneficiary or his estate, as the case may be, and the insurer will return all premiums paid for all other such policies.”\n\n(4) A provision as follows: “INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a provision of service basis or on an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only liability under any expense incurred coverage of this policy shall be for such proportion of the loss as the amount which would otherwise have been payable hereunder plus the total of the like amounts under all such other valid coverages for the same loss of which this insurer had notice bears to the total like amounts under all valid coverages for such loss, and for the return of such portion of the premiums paid as shall exceed the pro-rata portion for the amount so determined. For the purpose of applying this provision when other coverage is on a provision of service basis, the “like amount” of such other coverage shall be taken as the amount which the services rendered would have cost in the absence of such coverage.” If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also contains the policy provisions specified in subdivision (5) of this subsection, there shall be added to the caption of the foregoing provision the phrase “– EXPENSE INCURRED BENEFITS”. The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “other valid coverage”, approved as to form by the commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, and by hospital or medical service organizations, and to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the commissioner. In the absence of such definition, such terms shall not include group insurance, automobile medical payments insurance, or coverage provided by hospital or medical service organizations or by union welfare plans or employer or employee benefit organizations. For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute, including any workers' compensation or employer's liability statute, whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise, shall in all cases be deemed to be “other valid coverage” of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing policy provision no third party liability coverage shall be included as “other valid coverage”.\n\n(5) A provision as follows: “INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other than an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only liability for such benefits under this policy shall be for such proportion of the indemnities otherwise provided hereunder for such loss as the like indemnities of which the insurer had notice (including the indemnities under this policy) bear to the total amount of all like indemnities for such loss, and for the return of such portion of the premium paid as shall exceed the pro-rata portion for the indemnities thus determined.” If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also contains the policy provision specified in subdivision (4) of this subsection, there shall be added to the caption of the foregoing provision the phrase “– OTHER BENEFITS”. The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “other valid coverage”, approved as to form by the commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, and to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the commissioner. In the absence of such definition, such term shall not include group insurance, or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations. For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute including any workers' compensation or employer's liability statute, whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be “other valid coverage” of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing policy provision no third party liability coverage shall be included as “other valid coverage”.\n\n(6) A provision as follows: “RELATION OF EARNINGS TO INSURANCE: If the total monthly amount of loss of time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss of time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability commenced or his average monthly earnings for the period of two years immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings or such average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums paid during such two years as shall exceed the pro-rata amount of the premiums for the benefits actually paid hereunder; but this shall not operate to reduce the total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage upon the insured below the sum of two hundred dollars or the sum of the monthly benefits specified in such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce benefits other than those payable for loss of time.” The foregoing policy provision may be inserted only in a policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age fifty, or (2) in the case of a policy issued after age forty-four, for at least five years from its date of issue. The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “valid loss of time coverage”, approved as to form by the commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, or to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the commissioner or any combination of such coverages. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include any coverage provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute, including any workers' compensation or employer's liability statute, or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations.\n\n(7) A provision as follows: “UNPAID PREMIUM: Upon the payment of a claim under this policy, any premium then due and unpaid or covered by any note or written order may be deducted therefrom.”\n\n(8) A provision as follows: “CANCELLATION: The insurer may cancel this policy at any time by written notice delivered to the insured and to any dependents who were listed on the application and any subsequent revisions thereto, or mailed to their last address as shown by the records of the insurer, stating when, not less than five days thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective; and after the policy has been continued beyond its original term the insured may cancel this policy at any time by written notice delivered or mailed to the insurer, effective upon receipt or on such later date as may be specified in such notice. In the event of cancellation, the insurer will return promptly the unearned portion of any premium paid. If the insured cancels, the earned premium shall be computed by the use of the short-rate table last filed with the state official having supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided when the policy was issued. If the insurer cancels, the earned premium shall be computed pro-rata.

(b)(8) that written notice be delivered not only to the insured but also to any dependents listed on the application and any subsequent revisions thereto; (Revisor's note: When P.A. 95-40, which amended Subsec. (b)(8) concerning “CANCELLATION”, was incorporated into the section by the Revisors, the unamended text of Subsec. (b)(8) was inadvertently moved to and replaced the then existing Subsec. (a)(8) concerning “TIME OF PAYMENT OF CLAIMS”. Since there was no legislation in 1995, or subsequently, making any changes to Subsec. (a)(8), the Revisors editorially corrected their 1995 codification error by reinstating the correct wording of Subsec. (a)(8) for the 2001 revision); P.A. 10-5 made a technical change in Subsec.

If enrollment of a child is dependent on the enrollment of a participant who is not enrolled, both the child and the participant shall be enrolled. If the parent is enrolled for coverage but fails to make application to obtain coverage for a child, the insurer shall enroll such child under family coverage upon application of such child's other parent, the state agency administering the Medicaid program or the state agency administering Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, or upon receipt of a NMSN, as provided in section 46b-88. The insurer shall not disenroll or eliminate coverage of such child unless the insurer is provided with satisfactory written evidence that the court or administrative order is no longer in effect or the child is enrolled or shall be enrolled in comparable health coverage through another insurer which shall take effect no later than the effective date of such disenrollment, or the employer eliminates family health coverage for all its employees.\n\n(e) If a parent is required by a court or an administrative order to provide health coverage for a child and the parent is eligible for family health coverage through an employer doing business in the state, such employer shall permit such parent to enroll such child under such coverage without regard to any open enrollment restrictions. If a parent is enrolled but fails to make application to obtain coverage of a child, the employer shall enroll such child under health care coverage upon application by the child's other parent or by the Commissioner of Social Services, or his designee, when such child is eligible under the Medicaid program or is receiving child support enforcement services pursuant to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act. A NMSN shall constitute an application for health care coverage by the issuing agency. If a noncustodial parent in a IV-D case provides such coverage and changes employment, and the new employer provides health care coverage, the IV-D agency or an agency under cooperative agreement therewith shall transfer notice of the provision for health care coverage to such new employer, as provided in section 46b-88. A NMSN shall operate to enroll the child in the parent's health care plan if that portion of the parent's income which is subject to withholding pursuant to subsection (e) of section 52-362, is sufficient to cover both the current support order and health care coverage. At the time notice is transferred to the employer, the IV-D agency, or an agency under cooperative agreement therewith, shall also cause a copy of the notice of such transfer of health care coverage to be delivered to each parent. A parent may contest such notice by filing a motion for modification with the family support magistrate. An employer, subject to the provisions of this section, shall not disenroll or eliminate coverage of any such child unless the employer is provided satisfactory written evidence that: (1) A court or an administrative order for health care coverage is no longer in effect; (2) the child is or shall be enrolled in comparable health care coverage which shall take effect not later than the effective date of such disenrollment or elimination; or (3) the employer has eliminated family health care coverage for all of its employees.\n\n(May Sp.

Such trust shall create an unconditional duty to pay the full amount held in trust exclusively to cover the costs of confinement during the elimination period, subject only to taxes and any trustee's charges allowed by law. Payment shall be made directly to the provider. The duty of the trustee may be enforced by the state, the grantor or any person acting on behalf of the grantor. A long-term care policy shall provide benefits for confinement in a nursing home or confinement in the insured's own home or both. Any additional benefits provided shall be related to long-term treatment of an injury, illness or loss of functional capacity. “Long-term care policy” does not include any such policy that is offered primarily to provide basic Medicare supplement coverage, basic medical-surgical expense coverage, hospital confinement indemnity coverage, major medical expense coverage, disability income protection coverage, accident only coverage, specified accident coverage or limited benefit health coverage.\n\n(2) (A) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, no insurance company, fraternal benefit society, hospital service corporation, medical service corporation or health care center may deliver, issue for delivery, renew, continue or amend any long-term care policy in this state on or after January 1, 2022, unless the insurance company, fraternal benefit society, hospital service corporation, medical service corporation or health care center is authorized or licensed to sell long-term care insurance and at least one other line of insurance in this state.\n\n(B) No insurance company, fraternal benefit society, hospital service corporation, medical service corporation or health care center delivering, issuing for delivery, renewing, continuing or amending any long-term care policy in this state may refuse to accept, or refuse to make reimbursement pursuant to, a claim for benefits submitted by or prepared with the assistance of a managed residential community, as defined in section 19a-693, in accordance with subdivision (7) of subsection (a) of section 19a-694, solely because such claim for benefits was submitted by or prepared with the assistance of a managed residential community.\n\n(C) Each insurance company, fraternal benefit society, hospital service corporation, medical service corporation or health care center delivering, issuing for delivery, renewing, continuing or amending any long-term care policy in this state shall, upon receipt of a written authorization executed by the insured, (i) disclose information to a managed residential community for the purpose of determining such insured's eligibility for an insurance benefit or payment, and (ii) provide a copy of the initial acceptance or declination of a claim for benefits to the managed residential community at the same time such acceptance or declination is made to the insured.\n\n(b) (1) No insurance company, fraternal benefit society, hospital service corporation, medical service corporation or health care center may deliver or issue for delivery any long-term care policy that has a loss ratio of less than sixty per cent for any individual long-term care policy. An issuer shall not use or change premium rates for a long-term care policy unless the rates have been filed with and approved by the commissioner. Any rate filings or rate revisions shall demonstrate that anticipated claims in relation to premiums when combined with actual experience to date can be expected to comply with the loss ratio requirement of this section. A rate filing shall include the factors and methodology used to estimate irrevocable trust values if the policy includes an option for the elimination period specified in subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(2) (A) Any insurance company, fraternal benefit society, hospital service corporation, medical service corporation or health care center that files a rate filing for an increase in premium rates for a long-term care policy that is for twenty per cent or more shall spread the increase over a period of not less than three years and not file a rate filing for an increase in premium rates for the long-term care policy during the period chosen. Such company, society, corporation or center shall use a periodic rate increase that is actuarially equivalent to a single rate increase and a current interest rate for the period chosen.\n\n(B) Prior to implementing a premium rate increase, each such company, society, corporation or center shall:\n\n(i) Notify its policyholders of such premium rate increase and make available to such policyholders the additional choice of reducing the policy benefits to reduce the premium rate or electing coverage that reflects the minimum set of affordable benefit options developed by the commissioner pursuant to section 38a-475a. Such notice shall include a description of such policy benefit reductions and minimum set of affordable benefit options. The premium rates for any benefit reductions shall be based on the new premium rate schedule;\n\n(ii) Provide policyholders not less than thirty calendar days to elect a reduction in policy benefits or coverage that reflects the minimum set of affordable benefit options developed by the commissioner pursuant to section 38a-475a; and\n\n(iii) Include a statement in such notice that if a policyholder fails to elect a reduction in policy benefits or coverage that reflects the minimum set of affordable benefit options developed by the commissioner pursuant to section 38a-475a by the end of the notice period and has not cancelled the policy, the policyholder will be deemed to have elected to retain the existing policy benefits.\n\n(c) (1) No such company, society, corporation or center may deliver or issue for delivery any long-term care policy without providing, at the time of solicitation or application for purchase or sale of such coverage, full and fair written disclosure of the benefits and limitations of the policy.\n\n(2) (A) The applicant shall sign an acknowledgment at the time of application for such policy that the company, society, corporation or center has provided the written disclosure required under this subsection to the applicant. If the method of application does not allow for such signature at the time of application, the applicant shall sign such acknowledgment not later than at the time of delivery of such policy.\n\n(B) Except for a long-term care policy for which no applicable premium rate revision or rate schedule increases can be made or as otherwise provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection, such disclosure shall include:\n\n(i) A statement that the policy may be subject to rate increases in the future;\n\n(ii) An explanation of potential future premium rate revisions and the policyholder's option in the event of a premium rate revision;\n\n(iii) The premium rate or rate schedule applicable to the applicant that will be in effect until such company, society, corporation or center files a request with the commissioner for a revision to such premium rate or rate schedule;\n\n(iv) An explanation of how a premium rate or rate schedule revision will be applied that includes a description of when such rate or rate schedule revision will be effective; and\n\n(v) Information regarding each premium rate increase, if any, over the past ten years on such policy form or similar policy forms for this state or any other state, that identifies, at a minimum, (I) the policy forms for which premium rates have been increased, (II) the calendar years when each such policy form was available for purchase, and (III) the amount or percentage of each increase. The percentage may be expressed as a percentage of the premium rate prior to the increase or as minimum and maximum percentages if the rate increase is variable by rating characteristics.\n\n(C) The company, society, corporation or center may provide, in a fair manner, any additional explanatory information related to a premium rate or rate schedule revision.\n\n(3) (A) Any such company, society, corporation or center may exclude from the disclosure required under subparagraph (B) of subdivision (2) of this subsection premium rate increases that only apply to blocks of business or long-term care policies acquired from a nonaffiliated company, society, corporation or center and that occurred prior to the acquisition.\n\n(B) If an acquiring company, society, corporation or center files a request for a premium rate increase on or before January 1, 2015, or the end of a twenty-four-month period after the acquisition, whichever is later, for a block of policy forms or long-term care policies acquired from a nonaffiliated company, society, corporation or center, such acquiring company, society, corporation or center may exclude from the disclosure required under subparagraph (B) of subdivision (2) of this subsection such premium rate increase, except that the nonaffiliated company, society, corporation or center selling such block of policy forms or long-term care policies shall include such premium rate increase in such disclosure.\n\n(C) If an acquiring company, society, corporation or center under subparagraph (B) of this subdivision files a subsequent request, even within the twenty-four-month period specified in said subparagraph, for a premium rate increase on the same block of policy forms or long-term care policies set forth in said subparagraph, the acquiring company, society, corporation or center shall include in the disclosure required under subparagraph (B) of subdivision (2) of this subsection such premium rate increase and any premium rate increase filed and approved pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this subdivision.\n\n(4) If the offering for any long-term care policy includes an option for the elimination period specified in subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of this section, the application form for such policy and the face page of such policy shall contain a clear and conspicuous disclosure that the irrevocable trust may not be sufficient to cover all costs during the elimination period.\n\n(d) No such company, society, corporation or center may deliver or issue for delivery any long-term care policy on or after July 1, 2008, without offering, at the time of solicitation or application for purchase or sale of such coverage, an option to purchase a policy that includes a nonforfeiture benefit. Such offer of a nonforfeiture benefit may be in the form of a rider attached to such policy. In the event the nonforfeiture benefit is declined, such company, society, corporation or center shall provide a contingent benefit upon lapse that shall be available for a specified period of time following a substantial increase in premium rates. Not later than July 1, 2008, the commissioner shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to implement the provisions of this subsection. Such regulations shall specify the type of nonforfeiture benefit that may be offered, the standards for such benefit, the period of time during which a contingent benefit upon lapse will be available and the substantial increase in premium rates that trigger a contingent benefit upon lapse in accordance with the Long-Term Care Insurance Model Regulation adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\n\n(e) The commissioner shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, that address (1) the insured's right to information prior to the insured replacing an accident and sickness policy with a long-term care policy, (2) the insured's right to return a long-term care policy to the insurer, within a specified period of time after delivery, for cancellation, and (3) the insured's right to accept by the insured's signature, and prior to it becoming effective, any rider or endorsement added to a long-term care policy after the issuance date of such policy. The commissioner shall adopt such additional regulations as the commissioner deems necessary in accordance with chapter 54 to carry out the purpose of this section.\n\n(f) The commissioner may, upon written request by any such company, society, corporation or center, issue an order to modify or suspend a specific provision of this section or any regulation adopted pursuant thereto with respect to a specific long-term care policy upon a written finding that: (1) The modification or suspension would be in the best interest of the insureds; (2) the purposes to be achieved could not be effectively or efficiently achieved without such modification or suspension; and (3) (A) the modification or suspension is necessary to the development of an innovative and reasonable approach for insuring long-term care, (B) the policy is to be issued to residents of a life care or continuing care retirement community or other residential community for the elderly and the modification or suspension is reasonably related to the special needs or nature of such community, or (C) the modification or suspension is necessary to permit long-term care policies to be sold as part of, or in conjunction with, another insurance product. Whenever the commissioner decides not to issue such an order, the commissioner shall provide written notice of such decision to the requesting party in a timely manner.\n\n(g) Upon written request by any such company, society, corporation or center, the commissioner may issue an order to extend the preexisting condition exclusion period, as established by regulations adopted pursuant to this section, for purposes of specific age group categories in a specific long-term care policy form whenever the commissioner makes a written finding that such an extension is in the best interest to the public. Whenever the commissioner decides not to issue such an order, the commissioner shall provide written notice of such decision to the requesting party in a timely manner.\n\n(h) The provisions of section 38a-19 shall be applicable to any such requesting party aggrieved by any order or decision of the commissioner made pursuant to subsections (f) and (g) of this section.\n\n(P.A. 86-49, S. 2, 3; P.A. 89-236, S. 1, 3; P.A. 90-82; 90-243, S. 91; P.A. 91-276, S. 1; P.A. 94-39, S. 5; P.A. 07-28, S. 1; 07-226, S. 1; P.A. 10-127, S. 2; P.A. 12-145, S. 15; P.A. 13-134, S. 18, 19; P.A. 14-8, S. 1; 14-10, S. 1; P.A. 17-15, S. 56; P.A. 21-150, S. 3.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 89-236 amended Subsec.

To select the initial board of directors, and to initially organize the association, the commissioner shall give notice to all members of the time and place of the organizational meeting. In determining voting rights at the organizational meeting each member shall be entitled to vote in person or proxy. The vote shall be a weighted vote based upon the net health insurance premium derived from this state in the previous calendar year. If the board of directors is not selected within sixty days after notice of the organizational meeting, the commissioner may appoint the initial board. In approving or selecting members of the board, the commissioner may consider, among other things, whether all members are fairly represented. Members of the board may be reimbursed from the moneys of the association for expenses incurred by them as members, but shall not otherwise be compensated by the association for their services.\n\n(2) The board shall submit to the commissioner a plan of operation for the association necessary or suitable to assure the fair, reasonable and equitable administration of the association. The plan of operation shall become effective upon approval in writing by the commissioner. Such plan shall continue in force until modified by the commissioner or superseded by a plan submitted by the board and approved by the commissioner. The plan of operation shall: (A) Establish procedures for the handling and accounting of assets and moneys of the association; (B) establish regular times and places for meetings of the board of directors; (C) establish procedures for records to be kept of all financial transactions, and for the annual fiscal reporting to the commissioner; (D) establish procedures whereby selections for the board of directors shall be made and submitted to the commissioner; (E) establish procedures to amend, subject to the approval of the commissioner, the plan of operations; (F) establish procedures for the selection of an administrator and set forth the powers and duties of the administrator; (G) contain additional provisions necessary or proper for the execution of the powers and duties of the association; and (H) contain additional provisions necessary for the association to establish health insurance plans that qualify as acceptable coverage in accordance with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and other state or federal programs that may be established.\n\n(c) The association shall have the general powers and authority granted under the laws of this state to carriers to transact the kinds of insurance defined under section 38a-551, and in addition thereto, the specific authority to: (1) Enter into contracts necessary or proper to carry out the provisions and purposes of this section and sections 38a-551 and 38a-557 to 38a-559, inclusive; (2) sue or be sued, including taking any legal actions necessary or proper for recovery of any assessments for, on behalf of, or against participating members; (3) take such legal action as necessary to avoid the payment of improper claims against the association or the coverage provided by or through the association; (4) establish, with respect to health insurance provided by or on behalf of the association, appropriate rates, scales of rates, rate classifications and rating adjustments, such rates not to be unreasonable in relation to the coverage provided and the operational expenses of the association; (5) administer any type of reinsurance program, for or on behalf of participating members; (6) pool risks among participating members; (7) issue policies of insurance required or permitted by this section and sections 38a-551 and 38a-557 to 38a-559, inclusive, in its own name or on behalf of participating members; (8) administer separate pools, separate accounts or other plans as deemed appropriate for separate members or groups of members; (9) operate and administer any combination of plans, pools, reinsurance arrangements or other mechanisms as deemed appropriate to best accomplish the fair and equitable operation of the association; (10) set limits on the amounts of reinsurance that may be ceded to the association by its members; (11) appoint from among participating members appropriate legal, actuarial and other committees as necessary to provide technical assistance in the operation of the association, policy and other contract design, and any other function within the authority of the association; (12) apply for and accept grants, gifts and bequests of funds from other states, federal and interstate agencies and independent authorities, private firms, individuals and foundations for the purpose of carrying out its responsibilities.

All rates shall be promulgated by the association through an actuarial committee consisting of five persons who are members of the American Academy of Actuaries, shall be filed with the commissioner and may be disapproved within sixty days after the filing thereof if excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.\n\n(e) (1) Following the close of each fiscal year, the administrator shall determine the net premiums, reinsurance premiums less administrative expense allowance, the expense of administration pertaining to the reinsurance operations of the association and the incurred losses for the year. Any net loss shall be assessed to all participating members in proportion to their respective shares of the total health insurance premiums earned in this state during the calendar year, or with paid losses in the year, coinciding with or ending during the fiscal year of the association or on any other equitable basis as may be provided in the plan of operations. For self-insured members of the association, health insurance premiums earned shall be established by dividing the amount of paid health losses for the applicable period by eighty-five per cent. Net gains, if any, shall be held at interest to offset future losses or allocated to reduce future premiums.\n\n(2) Any net loss to the association represented by the excess of its actual expenses of administering policies issued by the association over the applicable expense allowance shall be separately assessed to those participating members who do not elect to administer their plans.

Such substitution shall only be made under conditions approved by the commissioner. A carrier may substitute a plan or arrangement as set forth in this subparagraph only if the carrier effects the same substitution upon renewal for all small employers previously covered under the particular plan or arrangement, unless otherwise approved by the commissioner.

      "text": "(a)(1) There is established a nonprofit entity to be known as the “Connecticut Small Employer Health Reinsurance Pool”. All insurers issuing health insurance in this state and insurance arrangements providing health plan benefits in this state on and after July 1, 1990, shall be members of the pool.\n\n(2) On or before July 15, 1990, the commissioner shall give notice to all insurers and insurance arrangements of the time and place for the initial organizational meeting, which shall take place by September 1, 1990. The members shall select the initial board, subject to approval by the commissioner. The board shall consist of at least five and not more than nine representatives of members. There shall be no more than two members of the board representing any one insurer or insurance arrangement. In determining voting rights at the organizational meeting, each member shall be entitled to vote in person or by proxy. The vote shall be weighted based upon net health insurance premium derived from this state in the previous calendar year. To the extent possible, at least one-third of the members of the board shall be domestic insurance companies and at least two-thirds of the members of the board shall be small employer carriers. At least one member of the board shall be a health care center and at least one member shall be a small employer carrier with less than one hundred million dollars in net small employer health insurance premium in this state. The Insurance Commissioner shall be an ex-officio member of the board. The net premium amount shall be adjusted by the board periodically for health care cost inflation. In approving selection of the board, the commissioner shall assure that all members are fairly represented. The membership of all boards subsequent to the initial board shall, to the extent possible, reflect the same distribution of representation as is described in this subdivision.\n\n(3) If the initial board is not elected at the organizational meeting, the commissioner shall appoint the initial board within fifteen days of the organizational meeting.\n\n(4) Within ninety days after the appointment of such initial board, the board shall submit to the commissioner a plan of operation and thereafter any amendments thereto necessary or suitable to assure the fair, reasonable and equitable administration of the pool. The commissioner shall, after notice and hearing, approve the plan of operation provided he determines it to be suitable to assure the fair, reasonable and equitable administration of the pool, and provides for the sharing of pool gains or losses on an equitable proportionate basis in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this section, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2013. The plan of operation shall become effective upon approval in writing by the commissioner consistent with the date on which the coverage under this section shall be made available. If the board fails to submit a suitable plan of operation within one hundred eighty days after its appointment, or at any time thereafter fails to submit suitable amendments to the plan of operation, the commissioner shall, after notice and hearing, adopt and promulgate a plan of operation or amendments, as appropriate. The commissioner shall amend any plan adopted by him, as necessary, at the time a plan of operation is submitted by the board and approved by the commissioner.\n\n(5) On and after July 10, 2015, the plan of operation shall establish procedures for: (A) Handling and accounting of assets and moneys of the pool, and for an annual fiscal reporting to the commissioner; (B) filling vacancies on the board, subject to the approval of the commissioner; (C) selecting an administrator and setting forth the powers and duties of the administrator; (D) reinsuring risks; (E) collecting assessments from all members to provide for claims reinsured by the pool and for administrative expenses incurred or estimated to be incurred during the period for which the assessment is made; and (F) any additional matters at the discretion of the board.\n\n(6) The pool shall have the general powers and authority granted under the laws of Connecticut to insurance companies licensed to transact health insurance and, in addition thereto, the specific authority to: (A) Enter into contracts as are necessary or proper to carry out the provisions and purposes of this section, including the authority, with the approval of the commissioner, to enter into contracts with programs of other states for the joint performance of common functions, or with persons or other organizations for the performance of administrative functions; (B) sue or be sued, including taking any legal actions necessary or proper for recovery of any assessments for, on behalf of, or against members; (C) take such legal action as necessary to avoid the payment of improper claims against the pool; (D) define the array of health coverage products for which reinsurance will be provided, and to issue reinsurance policies, in accordance with the requirements of this section; (E) establish rules, conditions and procedures pertaining to the reinsurance of members' risks by the pool; (F) establish appropriate rates, rate schedules, rate adjustments, rate classifications and any other actuarial functions appropriate to the operation of the pool; (G) assess members in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, and to make advance interim assessments as may be reasonable and necessary for organizational and interim operating expenses. Any such interim assessments shall be credited as offsets against any regular assessments due following the close of the fiscal year; (H) appoint from among members appropriate legal, actuarial and other committees as necessary to provide technical assistance in the operation of the pool, policy and other contract design, and any other function within the authority of the pool; and (I) borrow money to effect the purposes of the pool. Any notes or other evidence of indebtedness of the pool not in default shall be legal investments for insurers and may be carried as admitted assets.\n\n(b) Any member whose health insurance plan is subject to section 38a-567 may reinsure with the pool coverage of an eligible employee of a small employer or any dependent of such an employee.\n\n(c) (1) Following the close of each fiscal year, the administrator shall determine the net premiums, the pool expenses of administration and the incurred losses for the year, taking into account investment income and other appropriate gains and losses. For purposes of this section, health insurance premiums earned by insurance arrangements shall be established by adding paid health losses and administrative expenses of the insurance arrangement. Health insurance premiums and benefits paid by a member that are less than an amount determined by the board to justify the cost of collection shall not be considered for purposes of determining assessments. For purposes of this subsection, “net premiums” means health insurance premiums, less administrative expense allowances.\n\n(2) Any net loss for the year shall be recouped by assessments of members.\n\n(A) Assessments shall first be apportioned by the board among all members in proportion to their respective shares of the total health insurance premiums earned in this state from health insurance plans and insurance arrangements covering small employers during the calendar year coinciding with or ending during the fiscal year of the pool, or on any other equitable basis reflecting coverage of small employers as may be provided in the plan of operations. An assessment shall be made pursuant to this subparagraph against a health care center, that is approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services as a health maintenance organization pursuant to 42 USC 300e et seq., subject to an assessment adjustment formula adopted by the board and approved by the commissioner for such health care centers that recognizes the restrictions imposed on such health care centers by federal law. Such adjustment formula shall be adopted by the board and approved by the commissioner prior to the first anniversary of the pool's operation.\n\n(B) If such net loss is not recouped before assessments totaling five per cent of such premiums from plans and arrangements covering small employers have been collected, additional assessments shall be apportioned by the board among all members in proportion to their respective shares of the total health insurance premiums earned in this state from other individual and group plans and arrangements, exclusive of any individual Medicare supplement policies as defined in section 38a-495 during such calendar year.\n\n(C) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, the assessments to any one member under subparagraph (A) or (B) of this subdivision shall not exceed forty per cent of the total assessment under each subparagraph for the first fiscal year of the pool's operation and fifty per cent of the total assessment under each subparagraph for the second fiscal year. Any amounts abated pursuant to this subparagraph shall be assessed against the other members in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this subdivision.\n\n(3) If assessments exceed actual losses and administrative expenses of the pool, the excess shall be held at interest and used by the board to offset future losses or to reduce pool premiums.
