The commissioner shall be entitled to request the administrative judge of the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford to appoint a single judge to supervise the liquidation and hear any cases or controversies arising out of or related to the liquidation. Liquidation proceedings shall be exempt from any dormancy or similar program maintained by the court for the early closure of civil actions. The liquidator shall be vested by operation of law with the title to all of the property, contracts, and rights of action and all of the books and records of the insurer ordered liquidated, wherever located, as of the entry of the final order of liquidation. The filing or recording of the order with the clerk of the Superior Court and with the recorder of deeds of the town in which its principal office or place of business is located, or, in the case of real estate with the recorder of deeds of the town where the property is located, shall impart the same notice as a deed, bill of sale, or other evidence of title duly filed or recorded with that recorder of deeds would have imparted.\n\n(b) Upon issuance of the order, the rights and liabilities of any such insurer and of its creditors, policyholders, shareholders, members and all other persons interested in its estate shall become fixed as of the date of entry of the order of liquidation, except as provided in sections 38a-921 and 38a-939 unless otherwise fixed by the Superior Court.\n\n(c) An order to liquidate the business of an alien insurer domiciled in this state shall be in the same terms and have the same legal effect as an order to liquidate a domestic insurer, except that the assets and the business in the United States shall be the only assets and business included therein.\n\n(d) At the time of petitioning for an order of liquidation, or at any time thereafter, the commissioner, after making appropriate findings of an insurer's insolvency, may petition the court for a judicial declaration of such insolvency. After providing such notice and hearing as it deems proper the court may make the declaration.\n\n(e) Any order issued under this section shall require the liquidator to submit financial reports to the court. Financial reports shall include, at a minimum, a statement of the assets and liabilities of the insurer and all funds received or disbursed by the liquidator during the current period. Financial reports shall be filed within one year of the liquidation order and at least annually thereafter.\n\n(f) (1) Not later than five days after the initiation of an appeal of an order of liquidation, which order has not been stayed, the commissioner shall present for the court's approval a plan for the continued performance of the defendant company's policy claim obligations, including the duty to defend the insured under liability insurance policies, during the pendency of an appeal. Such plan shall provide for the continued performance and payment of policy claim obligations in the normal course of events, notwithstanding the grounds alleged in support of the order of liquidation including the ground of insolvency. In the event the defendant company's financial condition will not, in the judgment of the commissioner, support the full performance of all policy claim obligations during the appeal pendency period, the plan may prefer the claims of certain policyholders and claimants over creditors and interested parties as well as other policyholders and claimants, as the commissioner finds to be fair and equitable considering the relative circumstances of such policyholders and claimants. The court shall examine the plan submitted by the commissioner and if it finds the plan to be in the best interests of the parties, the court shall approve the plan. No action shall lie against the commissioner or any of his deputies, agents, clerks, assistants or attorneys by any party based on preference in an appeal pendency plan approved by the court.\n\n(2) The appeal pendency plan shall not supersede or affect the obligations of any insurance guaranty association.\n\n(3) Any such plans shall provide for equitable adjustments to be made by the liquidator to any distributions of assets to guaranty associations, in the event that the liquidator pays claims from assets of the estate, which would otherwise be the obligations of any particular guaranty association but for the appeal of the order of liquidation, such that all guaranty associations equally benefit on a pro rata basis from the assets of the estate. In the event an order of liquidation is set aside upon any appeal, the company shall not be released from delinquency proceedings unless and until funds advanced by any guaranty association, including reasonable administrative expenses in connection therewith relating to obligations of the company, shall be repaid in full, together with interest at the judgment rate of interest or unless an arrangement for repayment thereof has been made with the consent of all applicable guaranty associations.\n\n(P.A. 79-382, S. 18; P.A. 88-230, S. 1, 12; P.A. 90-92, S. 1, 2; P.A. 92-93, S. 14; P.A. 93-142, S. 4, 7, 8; P.A. 95-220, S. 4–6; P.A. 98-214, S. 11.)\n\nHistory: Sec. 38-438 transferred to Sec. 38a-920 in 1991; P.A. 92-93 amended Subsec.

The special deputy shall serve at the pleasure of the liquidator; (2) to employ employees and agents, legal counsel, actuaries, accountants, appraisers, consultants and such other personnel as the liquidator may deem necessary to assist in the liquidation, notwithstanding any provision of law, including chapters 55a and 67; (3) to fix the reasonable compensation of employees and agents, legal counsel, actuaries, accountants, appraisers and consultants with the approval of the court; (4) to pay reasonable compensation to persons appointed and to defray from the funds or assets of the insurer all expenses of taking possession of, conserving, conducting, liquidating, disposing of, or otherwise dealing with the business and property of the insurer. The liquidator shall have the power to pay reasonable compensation to such persons on an interim basis. All such interim payments shall be subject to the approval of the court upon submission by the liquidator. In the event that the property of the insurer does not contain sufficient cash or liquid assets to defray the costs incurred, the commissioner may advance the costs so incurred out of any appropriation for the maintenance of the Insurance Department.

The liquidator shall also have power to execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all deeds, assignments, releases and other instruments necessary or proper to effectuate any sale of property or other transaction in connection with the liquidation; (10) to borrow money on the security of the assets in the insurer's estate or without security and to execute and deliver all documents necessary to that transaction for the purpose of facilitating the liquidation. Any such funds borrowed may be repaid as an administrative expense and have priority over any other claims in class 1 under the priority of distributions; (11) to enter into such contracts as are necessary to carry out the order to liquidate and to affirm or disavow any contracts to which the insurer is a party; (12) to continue to prosecute and to institute in the name of the insurer or in the liquidator's own name any and all suits and other legal proceedings, in this state or elsewhere, and to abandon the prosecution of claims the liquidator deems unprofitable to pursue further. If the insurer is dissolved pursuant to section 38a-922, the liquidator shall have the power to apply to any court in this state or elsewhere for leave to substitute the liquidator for the insurer as plaintiff; (13) to prosecute any action which may exist on behalf of the creditors, members, policyholders or shareholders of the insurer against any officer of the insurer or any other person; (14) to remove any or all records and property of the insurer to the offices of the commissioner or to such other place as may be convenient for the purposes of efficient and orderly execution of the liquidation. Guaranty associations shall have such reasonable access to the records of the insurer as is necessary for them to carry out their statutory obligations; (15) to deposit in one or more banks in this state such sums as are required for meeting current administration expenses and dividend distributions; (16) to invest all sums not currently needed, unless the court orders otherwise; (17) to file any necessary documents for record in the office of any recorder of deeds or record office in this state or elsewhere where property of the insurer is located; (18) to assert all defenses available to the insurer as against third persons, including statutes of limitation, statutes of frauds and the defense of usury.

If a liquidation order is entered while the insurer is already subject to a rehabilitation order, then such transfers shall be deemed preferences if made or suffered within one year before the filing of the successful petition for rehabilitation, or within two years before the filing of the successful petition for liquidation, whichever time is shorter.\n\n(2) Any preference may be avoided by the liquidator if: (A) The insurer was insolvent at the time of the transfer; (B) the transfer was made within four months before the filing of the petition; (C) the creditor receiving it or to be benefited thereby or such creditor's agent acting with reference thereto had, at the time when the transfer was made, reasonable cause to believe that the insurer was insolvent or was about to become insolvent; or (D) the creditor receiving it was an officer, or any employee or attorney or other person who was in fact in a position of comparable influence in the insurer to an officer whether or not such employee, attorney or other person held such position, or any shareholder holding directly or indirectly more than five per cent of any class of any equity security issued by the insurer, or any other person, firm, corporation, association, or aggregation of persons with whom the insurer did not deal at arm's length.\n\n(3) Where the preference is voidable, the liquidator may recover the property, or if it has been converted, its value from any person who has received or converted the property, except where a bona fide purchaser or lienor has given less than fair equivalent value, such purchaser or lienor shall have a lien upon the property to the extent of the consideration actually given by such purchaser or lienor. Where a preference by way of lien or security title is voidable, the court may on due notice order the lien or title to be preserved for the benefit of the estate, in which event the lien or title shall pass to the liquidator.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, of this subsection, a transfer pursuant to a commutation of a reinsurance agreement that is approved by the commissioner or the commissioner's designated appointee under section 38a-962d shall not be voidable as a preference. For the purposes of this subdivision, a commutation of a reinsurance agreement is the elimination of all present and future obligations between the parties, arising from the reinsurance agreement, in exchange for a current consideration.\n\n(b) (1) A transfer of property other than real property shall be deemed to be made or suffered when it becomes so far perfected that no subsequent lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings on a simple contract could become superior to the rights of the transferee.\n\n(2) A transfer of real property shall be deemed to be made or suffered when it becomes so far perfected that no subsequent bona fide purchaser from the insurer could obtain rights superior to the rights of the transferee.\n\n(3) A transfer which creates an equitable lien shall not be deemed to be perfected if there are available means by which a legal lien could be created.\n\n(4) A transfer not perfected prior to the filing of a petition for liquidation shall be deemed to be made immediately before the filing of the successful petition.\n\n(5) The provisions of this subsection apply whether or not there are or were creditors who might have obtained liens or persons who might have become bona fide purchasers.\n\n(c) (1) A lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings upon a simple contract is one arising in the ordinary course of such proceedings upon the entry or docketing of a judgment or decree, or upon attachment, garnishment, execution, or like process, whether before, upon, or after judgment or decree and whether before or upon levy. It does not include liens which under applicable law are given a special priority over other liens which are prior in time.\n\n(2) A lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings could become superior to the rights of a transferee, or a purchaser could obtain rights superior to the rights of a transferee within the meaning of subsection (b) of this section, if such consequences would follow only from the lien or purchase itself, or from the lien or purchase followed by any step wholly within the control of the respective lienholder or purchaser, with or without the aid of ministerial action by public officials. Such a lien could not, however, become superior and such a purchase could not create superior rights for the purpose of subsection (b) of this section through any acts subsequent to the obtaining of such a lien or subsequent to such a purchase which require the agreement or concurrence of any third party or which require any further judicial action, or ruling.\n\n(d) A transfer of property for or on account of a new and contemporaneous consideration which is deemed under subsection (b) of this section to be made or suffered after the transfer because of delay in perfecting it does not thereby become a transfer for or on account of an antecedent debt if any acts required by the applicable law to be performed in order to perfect the transfer as against liens or bona fide purchasers' rights are performed within twenty-one days or any period expressly allowed by the law, whichever is less. A transfer to secure a future loan, if such a loan is actually made, or a transfer which becomes security for a future loan, shall have the same effect as a transfer for or on account of a new and contemporaneous consideration.\n\n(e) If any lien deemed voidable under subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section has been dissolved by the furnishing of a bond or other obligation, the surety on which has been indemnified directly or indirectly by the transfer of or the creation of a lien upon any property of an insurer before the filing of a petition under sections 38a-903 to 38a-961, inclusive, which results in a liquidation order, the indemnifying transfer or lien shall also be deemed voidable.\n\n(f) The property affected by any lien deemed voidable under subsections (a) and (e) of this section shall be discharged from such lien, and that property and any of the indemnifying property transferred to or for the benefit of a surety shall pass to the liquidator, except that the court may on due notice order any such lien to be preserved for the benefit of the estate and the court may direct that such conveyance be executed as may be proper or adequate to evidence the title of the liquidator.\n\n(g) The Superior Court shall have summary jurisdiction of any proceeding by the liquidator to hear and determine the rights of any parties under this section. Reasonable notice of any hearing in the proceeding shall be given to all parties in interest, including the obligee of a releasing bond or other like obligation. Where an order is entered for the recovery of indemnifying property in kind or for the avoidance of an indemnifying lien, the court, upon application of any party in interest, shall in the same proceeding ascertain the value of the property or lien, and if the value is less than the amount for which the property is indemnity or than the amount of the lien, the transferee or lienholder may elect to retain the property or lien upon payment of its value, as ascertained by the court, to the liquidator, within such reasonable times as the court shall fix.\n\n(h) The liability of a surety under a releasing bond or other like obligation shall be discharged to the extent of the value of the indemnifying property recovered or the indemnifying lien nullified and avoided by the liquidator, or where the property is retained under subsection (g) of this section to the extent of the amount paid to the liquidator.\n\n(i) If a creditor has been preferred, and afterward in good faith gives the insurer further credit without security of any kind, for property which becomes a part of the insurer's estate, the amount of the new credit remaining unpaid at the time of the petition may be set off against the preference which would otherwise be recoverable from him.\n\n(j) If an insurer, directly or indirectly, within four months before the filing of a successful petition for liquidation under sections 38a-903 to 38a-961, inclusive, or at any time in contemplation of a proceeding to liquidate it, pays money or transfers property to an attorney-at-law for services rendered or to be rendered, the transaction may be examined by the court on its own motion or shall be examined by the court on petition of the liquidator and shall be held valid only to the extent of a reasonable amount to be determined by the court, and the excess may be recovered by the liquidator for the benefit of the estate, provided if the attorney is in a position of influence in the insurer or an affiliate thereof payment of any money or the transfer of any property to the attorney-at-law for services rendered or to be rendered shall be governed by the provisions of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(k) (1) Every officer, manager, employee, shareholder, member, subscriber, attorney, or any other person acting on behalf of the insurer who knowingly participates in giving any preference when he has reasonable cause to believe the insurer is or is about to become insolvent at the time of the preference shall be personally liable to the liquidator for the amount of the preference. It is permissible to infer that there is reasonable cause to so believe if the transfer was made within four months before the date of filing of the successful petition for liquidation.\n\n(2) Every person receiving any property from the insurer or the benefit thereof as a preference voidable under subsection (a) shall be personally liable therefor and shall be bound to account to the liquidator.\n\n(3) Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice any other claim by the liquidator against any person.\n\n(P.A. 79-382, S. 28; P.A. 85-613, S. 105, 154; P.A. 17-198, S. 7; P.A. 18-68, S. 22.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 85-613 made technical change in Subsec.

In those cases under subparagraph (C) of this subdivision, insureds may include in contingent claims reasonable attorney's fees for services rendered after the date of liquidation, in defense of claims or suits covered by the insured's policy, provided the attorney's fees have been paid by the insured and evidence of payment is presented to the receiver; (3) if the claim was unliquidated as of the date established under section 38a-920, its amount has been determined, provided such determination does not prejudice the orderly administration of the liquidation proceeding; or (4) if the claim was immature as of the date established under section 38a-920, it shall be discounted at the higher of the legal rate of interest accruing on judgments or the rate of interest available on United States Treasury securities of approximately the same maturity.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) to (c), inclusive, of this section, any insured shall have the right to file a claim for the protection afforded under the insured's policy, irrespective of whether a claim is then known, if the policy is an occurrence policy. Thereafter, at such time that a specific claim is made by or against the insurer, the insured shall supplement his claim and the receiver shall treat the same as a contingent, unliquidated or immature claim. Any such claims of policyholders for the protection under an occurrence policy remaining at or near the closing of the estate shall be disposed of in accordance with section 38a-945.\n\n(e) The estimation and allowance of a contingent claim under this section shall not provide a basis to compel payment from a reinsurer of estimated incurred but not reported losses and, except with respect to claims made under subsection (c) of section 38a-939, outstanding reserves, unless the reinsurance contract specifically provides for the payment of such losses or reserves.\n\n(P.A. 79-382, S. 37; P.A. 98-214, S. 18; P.A. 17-15, S. 89.)\n\nHistory: Sec. 38-457 transferred to Sec. 38a-939 in 1991; P.A. 98-214 deleted former Subsecs. (a), (b) and (c), redesignated former Subsec. (d) as Subsec. (a), added new Subsec. (b) re claims when a liquidation order has been entered, added new Subsec. (c) prohibiting a claim from sharing in a distribution of assets pursuant to chapter except as provided in section, added new Subsec. (d) allowing any insured to file a claim for protection offered under his policy, and added new Subsec. (e) providing that the estimation and allowance of a contingent claim under section shall not be a basis to compel payment from reinsurer of certain losses; P.A. 17-15 made a technical change in Subsec. (c).",

To the extent the insured files a claim, it shall be deemed sufficient to cover all related third party claims. If the insured fails to file a claim by the date for filing claims specified in the order of liquidation or within sixty days after mailing of the notice required by section 38a-924, whichever is later, the insured shall be deemed an unexcused late filer.\n\n(c) The liquidator shall make recommendations to the court pursuant to section 38a-944 for the allowance of an insured's claim pursuant to subsection (b) of this section after consideration of the probable outcome of any pending action against the insured on which the claim is based, the probable damages recoverable in the action and the probable costs and expenses of defense. After allowance by the court, the liquidator shall withhold any dividends payable on the claim, pending the outcome of litigation and negotiation with the insured. Whenever it seems appropriate, the liquidator shall reconsider the claim on the basis of additional information and amend his recommendations to the court. The insured shall be afforded the same notice and opportunity to be heard on all changes in the recommendation as in its initial determination. The court may amend its allowance as it finds appropriate. As claims against the insured are settled or barred, the insured shall be paid from the amount withheld the same percentage dividend as was paid on other claims of like priority, based on the lesser of (1) the amount actually recovered from the insured by action or paid by agreement plus the reasonable costs and expenses of defense, or (2) the amount allowed on the claims by the court. After all claims are settled or barred, any sum remaining from the amount withheld shall revert to the undistributed assets of the insurer. Delay in final payment under this subsection shall not be a reason for unreasonable delay of final distribution and discharge of the liquidator.\n\n(d) If several claims founded upon one policy are filed, whether by third parties or as claims by the insured under this section, and the aggregate allowed amount of the claims to which the same limit of liability in the policy is applicable exceeds that limit, each claim as allowed shall be reduced in the same proportion so that the total equals the policy limit.

Every claim in each class shall be paid in full or adequate funds retained for such payment before the members of the next class receive any payment. Once such funds are retained by the liquidator and approved by the court, the insurer's estate shall have no further liability to members of that class except to the extent of the retained funds and any other undistributed funds. No subclasses shall be established within any class, except as provided in subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 38a-923. No claim by a shareholder, policyholder or other creditor shall be permitted to circumvent the priority classes through the use of equitable remedies. The order of distribution of claims shall be:\n\n(1) Class 1. The costs and expenses of administration expressly approved by the receiver, including but not limited to the following: (A) The actual and necessary costs of preserving or recovering the assets of the insurer; (B) compensation for all services rendered in the conservation, rehabilitation or liquidation; (C) any necessary filing fees; (D) the fees and mileage payable to witnesses; and (E) authorized reasonable attorney's fees and other professional services rendered in the conservation, rehabilitation or liquidation.\n\n(2) Class 2. The administrative expenses of guaranty associations. For purposes of this section such expenses shall be those reasonable expenses incurred by guaranty associations where the expenses are not payments or expenses that are required to be incurred as direct policy benefits in fulfillment of the terms of the insurance contract or policy, and that are of the type and nature that, but for the activities of the guaranty association otherwise would have been incurred by the receiver, including, but not limited to, evaluations of policy coverage, activities involved in the adjustment and settlement of claims under policies, including those of in-house or outside adjusters, and the reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the arrangements for ongoing coverage through transfer to other insurers, policy exchanges or maintaining policies in force. The receiver may in his or her sole discretion approve as an administrative expense under this section any other reasonable expenses of the guaranty association if the receiver finds: (A) The expenses are not expenses required to be paid or incurred as direct policy benefits by the terms of the policy, and (B) the expenses were incurred in furtherance of activities that provided a material economic benefit to the estate as a whole, irrespective of whether the activities resulted in additional benefits to covered claimants. The court shall approve such expenses unless it finds the receiver abused his or her discretion in approving the expenses. If the receiver determines that the assets of the estate will be sufficient to pay all class 1 claims in full, class 2 claims shall be paid currently, provided the liquidator shall secure from each of the associations receiving disbursements pursuant to this section an agreement to return to the liquidator such disbursement, together with investment income actually earned on such disbursements, as may be required to pay class 1 claims. No bond shall be required of any such association.\n\n(3) Class 3. All claims under policies including such claims of the federal or any state or local government for losses incurred, including third party claims, claims for unearned premiums, and all claims of a guaranty association for payment of covered claims or covered obligations of the insurer. All claims of a guaranty association for reasonable expenses other than those included in class 2. All claims under life and health insurance policies, annuity contracts and funding agreements, whether for death proceeds, health benefits, annuity proceeds, or investment values shall be treated as loss claims. That portion of any loss, indemnification for which is provided by other benefits or advantages recovered by the claimant, shall not be included in this class, other than benefits or advantages recovered or recoverable in discharge of familial obligations of support or by way of succession at death or as proceeds of life insurance, or as gratuities. No payment by an employer to his employee shall be treated as a gratuity. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, the following claims shall be excluded from class 3 priority: (A) Obligations of the insolvent insurer arising out of reinsurance contracts; (B) obligations incurred after the expiration date of the insurance policy or after the policy has been replaced by the insured or canceled at the insured's request or after the policy has been canceled as provided in this chapter. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, earned premium claims on policies, other than reinsurance agreements, shall not be excluded; (C) obligations to insurers, insurance pools or underwriting associations and their claims for contribution, indemnity or subrogation, equitable or otherwise; and (D) any claim which is in excess of any applicable limits provided in the insurance policy issued by the insolvent insurer.\n\n(4) Class 4. Claims of the federal government except those under class 3.\n\n(5) Class 5. Debts due employees for services, benefits, contractual or otherwise due arising out of such reasonable compensation to employees for services performed to the extent that they do not exceed two months of monetary compensation and represent payment for services performed within six months before the filing of the petition for liquidation or, if rehabilitation preceded liquidation, within one year before the filing of the petition for rehabilitation. Officers and directors shall not be entitled to the benefit of this priority, except as otherwise approved by the liquidator and the court. Such priority shall be in lieu of any other similar priority which may be authorized by law as to wages or compensation of employees.\n\n(6) Class 6. Claims of general creditors, including claims of ceding and assuming companies in their capacity as such, and claims against the insurer for liability for bodily injury or for injury to or destruction of tangible property which are not under policies.\n\n(7) Class 7. Claims of any state or local government, except those under class 4. Claims of any such governmental body for a penalty or forfeiture, but only to the extent of the pecuniary loss sustained from the act, transaction or proceeding out of which the penalty or forfeiture arose, with reasonable and actual costs occasioned thereby. The remainder of such claims shall be postponed to the class of claims under subdivision (8) of this subsection.\n\n(8) Class 8. Surplus or contribution notes, or similar obligations, and premium refunds on assessable policies, interest on claims of classes 1 to 7, inclusive, and any other claims specifically subordinated to this class.\n\n(9) Class 9. Claims of shareholders or other owners arising out of their capacity as shareholders or owners, or arising in any other capacity or facts except as they may be qualified in class 3 or 4.\n\n(b) Upon the declaration of a dividend, the receiver shall apply the amount of the dividend against any indebtedness owed to the insurer by the person entitled to the dividend. There shall be no claim allowed for any deductible charged by a guaranty association or entity performing a similar function.\n\n(c) Every claim under a separate account agreement providing, in effect, that the assets in the separate account shall not be chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business of the insurer shall be satisfied out of the assets in the separate account equal to the reserves maintained in such account for such agreement and, to the extent, if any, not fully discharged thereby, shall be treated as a class 3 claim against the estate. For the purposes of this section, “insurer's estate” means the general assets of such company less any assets held in separate accounts that, pursuant to section 38a-433 or 38a-459, are not chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business of the insurer.\n\n(P.A. 79-382, S. 42; P.A. 82-472, S. 118, 183; P.A. 92-93, S. 27; P.A. 97-113, S. 1, 2; P.A. 98-214, S. 23; P.A. 14-122, S. 173; P.A. 17-15, S. 91.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 82-472 made a technical correction; Sec. 38-462 transferred to Sec. 38a-944 in 1991; P.A. 92-93 divided section into Subsecs. and Subdivs., prohibited claims by creditors to circumvent priority classes, extensively revised classes of priority distribution to include in class 1 costs of professional services, to change “debts due” in class 2 to “reasonable compensation” and to change maximum payment from $1,000 to two month's compensation and include cases where rehabilitation precedes liquidation, to include in class 3 certain claims of federal, state and local government, annuity contracts and funding agreements, and to make changes in class 4, i.e. claims under nonassessable policies, incorporating former class 5 within class 4, renumbering classes as necessary and making technical changes for statutory consistency; P.A. 97-113 reorganized classes in Subsec.

The amount of the claim shall be the actual direct compensatory damages determined as of the date of the disaffirmance or repudiation of the netting agreement or qualified financial contract. “Actual direct compensatory damages” does not include punitive or exemplary damages, damages for lost profit or lost opportunity or damages for pain and suffering, but does include normal and reasonable costs of cover or other reasonable measures of damages utilized in the derivatives market for the contract and agreement claims.\n\n(g) As used in this section, “contractual right” includes any right, whether or not evidenced in writing, arising under statutory or common law, a rule or bylaw of a national securities exchange, national securities clearing organization or securities clearing agency, a rule or bylaw, or a resolution of the governing body, of a contract market or its clearing organization, or under law merchant.\n\n(h) The provisions of this section shall not apply to persons who are affiliates of the insurer that is the subject of the proceeding.\n\n(i) All rights of counterparties under sections 38a-903 to 38a-961, inclusive, shall apply to netting agreements entered into on behalf of the general account or separate accounts if the assets of each separate account are available only to counterparties to netting agreements entered into on behalf of that separate account.\n\n(P.A. 98-214, S. 22; P.A. 17-15, S. 92.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 17-15 made technical changes in Subsec.
