      "text": "(a)Net worth requirements.(1) Before issuing any certificate of authority to any health care center on or after July 1, 1990, the commissioner shall require that a health care center have: (A) An initial net worth of one million five hundred thousand dollars, and (B) agree to thereafter maintain the minimum net worth required under subdivision (4) of this subsection.\n\n(2) No health care center shall be licensed to transact business in this state or remain so licensed unless, (A) its net worth bears a reasonable relationship to its liabilities based upon the type, volume and nature of business transacted, and (B) its risk-based capital related to its total adjusted capital is adequate for the type of business transacted. As used in this subsection, “total adjusted capital” means the sum of a health care center's net worth and any other item in the nature of capital as deemed appropriate by the commissioner; and “risk-based capital” means the net worth of the health care center adjusted to recognize the level of risk inherent in its business, including (i) risk with respect to the health care center's assets, (ii) the risk of adverse underwriting experience with respect to the health care center's liabilities and obligations, (iii) the credit risk with respect to the health care center's business, and (iv) all other business risks and such other relevant risks as the commissioner may determine.\n\n(3) (A) In determining net worth, no debt shall be considered fully subordinated unless the subordination clause is in a form acceptable to the commissioner. Any interest obligation relating to the repayment of any subordinated debt shall be similarly subordinated. (B) The interest expenses relating to the repayment of any fully subordinated debt shall not be considered uncovered expenditures. (C) Any debt incurred by a note meeting the requirements of this section, and otherwise acceptable to the commissioner, shall not be considered a liability and shall be recorded as equity.\n\n(4) Except as provided in subdivision (3) and subdivisions (5) to (7), inclusive, of this subsection, each health care center shall maintain a minimum net worth equal to the greater of: (A) One million dollars; or (B) two per cent of its annual premium revenues as reported on the most recent annual financial statement filed with the commissioner on the first one hundred fifty million dollars of premium revenues plus one per cent of annual premium revenues in excess of one hundred fifty million dollars. No health care center authorized by the commissioner to do business in this state, on July 1, 1990, shall be required to comply with the provisions of subparagraph (B) of this subdivision until January 1, 1995.\n\n(5) Each health care center that offers or proposes to offer out-of-network benefits shall either:\n\n(A) Enter into an agreement with a duly licensed insurance company to provide coverage to subscribers and enrollees outside of the health care center's established network, subject to approval by the commissioner; or\n\n(B) Implement an out-of-network benefit system to be operated by the health care center, subject to approval by the commissioner, provided the health care center establishes and maintains its net worth at an amount equal to the greater of (i) three million dollars, (ii) two per cent of its annual premium revenues as reported on the most recent annual financial statement filed with the commissioner on the first one hundred fifty million dollars of premium revenues plus one per cent of annual premium revenues in excess of one hundred fifty million dollars, or (iii) two months of its cost of uncovered expenditures. For purposes of this subsection, “annual premium revenues” does not include revenue earned as a result of an arrangement between a health care center and the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, on a cost or risk basis, for services to a Medicare beneficiary, or revenue earned as a result of an arrangement between a health care center and a Medicaid state agency, for services to a Medicaid beneficiary. For the purposes of this subsection, the uncovered expenditures of the health care center for the requisite two-month period shall be calculated as follows:\n\nUE = Uncovered expenditures of the health care center for the requisite two-month period.\n\nX = Total year-to-date uncovered expenditures reported in the health care center's most recent statutory quarterly or annual statement.\n\nY = Total year-to-date uncovered expenditures reported in the health care center's annual statement for the prior calendar year.\n\nZ = Total year-to-date uncovered expenditures reported in the health care center's statutory quarterly or annual statement for the current calendar quarter of the prior calendar year.\n\n(6) The total cost of the out-of-network benefits of a health care center shall not exceed ten per cent of the total cost of the health care center's claims and expenses on a quarterly basis without the prior approval of the commissioner.\n\n(7) Any health care center that provides out-of-network benefits pursuant to this subsection shall provide a quarterly report concurrent with filing of the required quarterly and annual financial statements which shall demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(8) The commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to implement the purposes of this subsection, including, but not limited to, provisions concerning: (A) The preparation and filing of reports by health care centers relating to risk-based capital levels and the calculation thereof; (B) the preparation and filing of comprehensive financial plans when such capital levels are reduced below minimum threshold levels; (C) the confidentiality of such reports and plans; and (D) the regulatory corrective actions the commissioner may take in the event minimum risk-based capital levels are not maintained, or the health care center's financial plans filed with the commissioner are deficient, or the health care center fails to otherwise comply with the provisions of the regulations.\n\n(b)Liabilities.Every health care center shall, when determining liabilities, include an amount estimated in the aggregate to provide for any unearned premium and for the payment of all claims for health care expenditures which have been incurred, whether reported or unreported, which are unpaid and for which such organization is or may be liable, and to provide for the expense of adjustment or settlement of such claims. Such liabilities shall be calculated in accordance with those accounting procedures and practices prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, version effective January 1, 2001, and subsequent revisions and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Annual Statement Instructions, subject to any deviations prescribed by the commissioner.\n\n(c)Required provisions in every contract between health care centers and participating providers.(1) Every contract between a health care center and a participating provider of health care services shall be in writing and shall contain the following provisions or variations approved by the commissioner:\n\n“(A) (Name of provider or facility) .... hereby agrees that in no event, including, but not limited to, nonpayment by (name of health care center) ...., (name of health care center's) .... insolvency, or breach of this contract shall (name of provider or facility) .... bill, charge, collect a deposit from, seek compensation, remuneration, or reimbursement from, or have any recourse against a covered person or person acting on their behalf, other than (name of health care center) ...., for services provided pursuant to this contract. This provision shall not prohibit collection of cost-sharing amounts, or costs for noncovered services, which have not otherwise been paid by a primary or secondary carrier in accordance with regulatory standards for coordination of benefits, from covered persons in accordance with the terms of the covered person's health plan.\n\n(B) (Name of provider or facility) ... agrees, in the event of (name of health care center's) .... insolvency, to continue to provide the services promised in this contract to covered persons of (name of health care center) .... for the duration of the period for which premiums on behalf of the covered person were paid to (name of health care center) .... or until the covered person's discharge from inpatient facilities, whichever time is greater.\n\n(C) Notwithstanding any other provision in this contract, nothing in this contract shall be construed to modify the rights and benefits contained in the covered person's health plan.\n\n(D) (Name of provider or facility) ... may not bill the covered person for covered services, except for cost-sharing amounts, where (name of health care center) .... denies payment because the provider or facility has failed to comply with the terms or conditions of this contract.\n\n(E) (Name of provider or facility) .... further agrees (i) that the provisions of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C) and (D) of this subdivision (or citations appropriate to the contract form) .... shall survive termination of this contract regardless of the cause giving rise to termination and shall be construed to be for the benefit of (name of health care center's) .... covered persons, and (ii) that this provision supersedes any oral or written contrary agreement now existing or hereafter entered into between (name of provider or facility) .... and covered persons or persons acting on their behalf.\n\n(F) If (name of provider or facility) .... contracts with other providers or facilities who agree to provide covered services to covered persons of (name of health care center) .... with the expectation of receiving payment directly or indirectly from (name of health care center) ...., such providers or facilities shall agree to abide by the provisions of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E) of this subsection (or citations appropriate to the contract form) .....”\n\n(2) In the event that the participating provider contract has not been reduced to writing as required by this subsection or that the contract fails to contain the provisions required by subdivision (1) of this subsection, the participating provider shall not collect or attempt to collect from the subscriber or enrollee sums owed by the health care center.\n\n(3) No participating provider, or agent, trustee or assignee thereof, may: (A) Maintain any action at law against a subscriber or enrollee to collect sums owed by the health care center; (B) request payment from a subscriber or enrollee for such sums; (C) request payment from a subscriber or enrollee for covered emergency services, or services rendered to an insured at an urgent crisis center, as defined in section 38a-477aa, that are provided by an out-of-network provider; or (D) request payment from a subscriber or enrollee for a surprise bill, as defined in section 38a-477aa. For purposes of this subdivision “request payment” includes, but is not limited to, submitting a bill for services not actually owed or submitting for such services an invoice or other communication detailing the cost of the services that is not clearly marked with the phrase “THIS IS NOT A BILL”. The contract between a health care center and a participating provider shall inform the participating provider that pursuant to section 20-7f, it is an unfair trade practice in violation of chapter 735a for any health care provider to request payment from a subscriber or an enrollee, other than a coinsurance, copayment, deductible or other out-of-pocket expense, for covered medical or emergency services or facility fees, as defined in section 19a-508c, or services rendered to an insured at an urgent crisis center, as defined in section 38a-477aa, or surprise bills, or to report to a credit reporting agency an enrollee's failure to pay a bill for such services when a health care center has primary responsibility for payment of such services, fees or bills.\n\n(d)Notice of termination.Every agreement to provide health care services between a provider and a health care center shall require the provider to provide at least sixty days' advance notice to the health care center to terminate the agreement.\n\n(P.A. 90-68, S. 13, 16; P.A. 98-163, S. 2; P.A. 99-9, S. 4, 6; P.A. 00-30, S. 11, 14; P.A. 03-19, S. 89; P.A. 07-178, S. 1; P.A. 14-235, S. 15; P.A. 15-146, S. 12; P.A. 19-125, S. 8; P.A. 22-47, S. 51.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 98-163 added Subsec.

      "text": "(a)Enrollment period.In the event of an insolvency of a health care center, upon order of the commissioner, all other carriers that participated in the enrollment process with the insolvent health care center at a group's last regular enrollment period shall offer such group's subscribers of the insolvent health care center a thirty-day enrollment period commencing upon the date of insolvency. Each carrier shall offer such subscribers of the insolvent health care center the same coverages and rates that such carrier had offered to the subscribers of the group at its last regular enrollment period for the remainder of the term of the original group contract. An open enrollment shall not be required where the group contract holder participates in a self-insured, self-funded or other health plan exempt from the regulation of the commissioner, unless the plan administrator and group contract holder voluntarily agree to offer a simultaneous open enrollment and extend coverage under the same enrollment terms and conditions as are applicable to carriers under sections 38a-175 to 38a-183, inclusive, section 38a-192 and the regulations adopted under said sections.\n\n(b)Replacement coverage allocated among centers within service area.If no other carrier has been offered to one or more groups enrolled in the insolvent health care center, or if the commissioner determines that the other carrier or carriers lack sufficient health care delivery resources to assure that health care services will be available and accessible to all of the group enrollees of the insolvent health care center, the commissioner shall allocate equitably the insolvent health care center's group contracts for such groups among all health care centers that operate within a portion of the insolvent health care center's service area, taking into consideration the health care delivery resources of each health care center. Each health care center, to which a group or groups are so allocated, shall offer such group or groups the health care center's existing coverage that is most similar to the group's coverage with the insolvent health care center at rates determined in accordance with the successor health care center's existing rating methodology. No offering by a carrier shall be required where the group contract holder participates in a self-insured, self-funded or other health plan exempt from regulation by the commissioner. The commissioner shall also allocate equitably the insolvent health care center's nongroup enrollees who are unable to obtain other coverage among all health care centers that operate within a portion of the insolvent health care center's service area, taking into consideration the health care delivery resources of each such health care center. Each health care center to which nongroup enrollees are allocated shall offer each such nongroup enrollee the health care center's existing coverage for individual coverage as determined by such nongroup enrollee's type of coverage in the insolvent health care center at rates determined in accordance with the successor health care center's existing rating methodology. Successor health care centers that do not offer direct nongroup enrollment may aggregate all of the allocated nongroup enrollees into one group for rating and coverage purposes.\n\n(c)Replacement coverage extended to all subscribers. Exception.(1) As used in this subsection, “discontinuance” means the termination of the contract between the group contract holder and a health care center due to the insolvency of the health care center, and does not refer to the termination of any agreement between any individual enrollee and the health care center.\n\n(2) Any carrier providing replacement coverage with respect to group hospital, medical or surgical expense or service benefits within a period of sixty days from the date of discontinuance of a prior health care center contract or policy providing such hospital, medical or surgical expense or service benefits shall immediately cover all subscribers and subscribers' beneficiaries who were validly covered under the previous health care center contract or policy at the date of discontinuance and who would otherwise be eligible for coverage under the succeeding carrier's contract, regardless of any provisions of the contract relating to active employment or hospital confinement or pregnancy.\n\n(3) Except to the extent benefits for the condition would have been reduced or excluded under the prior carrier's contract or policy, no provision in a succeeding carrier's contract of replacement coverage which would operate to reduce or exclude benefits on the basis that the condition giving rise to benefits, preexisted the effective date of the succeeding carrier's contract, shall be applied with respect to those subscribers and subscribers' beneficiaries validly covered under the prior carrier's contract or policy on the date of discontinuance.\n\n(d)Insolvency. Priority of distribution.In the event of the insolvency of a health care center, for purposes of determining the priority of distribution of the general assets of the health care center, claims of enrollees, enrollees' beneficiaries, subscribers and subscribers' beneficiaries shall have the same priority as established by section 38a-944 for policyholders and beneficiaries of insureds of insurance companies described in subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of section 38a-944. If an enrollee or subscriber is liable to any provider for services provided pursuant to and covered by the health care center, that liability shall have the status of an enrollee or subscriber claim for distribution of assets. Any provider who is obligated by statute or agreement to hold enrollees or subscribers harmless from liability for services provided pursuant to and covered by a health care center shall have a priority of distribution of the general assets immediately following that of enrollees, enrollees' beneficiaries, subscribers and subscribers' beneficiaries as described in this subsection, and immediately preceding the priority of distribution described in subdivision (4) of subsection (a) of section 38a-944.\n\n(P.A. 90-68, S. 14, 16; P.A. 99-9, S. 5, 6; P.A. 14-122, S. 166; P.A. 17-15, S. 12.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 99-9 substituted “subscribers” for “enrollees” in Subsec.

When so determined by any such corporation comprehensive health care shall also include appliances, drugs, medicines, supplies and all other health goods and services, including the services of physicians, doctors of dentistry and other licensed practitioners of the healing arts. Each such corporation shall be governed by sections 38a-199 to 38a-209, inclusive, and shall, except as otherwise provided in this title, be exempt from the provisions of the general statutes relating to insurance. The provisions of sections 38a-815 to 38a-819, inclusive, except subdivision (9) of section 38a-816, shall be applicable to such corporation. Such hospitals, clinics and chronic and convalescent nursing homes as shall be contained in a list of approved institutions maintained by the Department of Public Health shall be deemed approved for the purposes of sections 38a-199 to 38a-209, inclusive.\n\n(b) A hospital service corporation providing health care benefits to plan subscribers under the provisions of subsection (a) of this section may, upon obtaining the approval of the Insurance Commissioner as provided in section 38a-208: (1) Contract for the coordination of benefits with other hospital service corporations, medical service corporations or insurance companies to avoid duplication of benefits to be provided to its group subscribers; (2) make loans, grants or provide anything of value to a health care center covering all or part of the cost of health services provided to members; (3) contract with a health care center to provide insurance or similar protection to cover the cost of care provided through health care centers and to provide coverage in the event of the insolvency of the health care center; and (4) establish, maintain, own and operate health care centers as a line of business, provided (A) aggregate investments hereafter made by such corporation shall not exceed ten per cent of such corporation's contingency reserve as of the date of the investment; (B) such investments shall not be repaid or recovered from rates charged by such corporation for its non-health-care-center lines of business; and (C) the commissioner finds, based upon evidence furnished by such corporation, that the financial condition of such corporation and the rates of its non-health-care-center subscribers are not unduly jeopardized by such investment. Subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be subject to such regulations as may be adopted by the Insurance Commissioner, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to establish coordination of benefits clauses in health care contracts.\n\n(c) Each hospital service corporation shall maintain reserves equal in amount to its liabilities under all its policy contracts, as the same are computed in accordance with regulations adopted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 upon reasonable consideration of ascertained experience for the purpose of adequately protecting the subscriber and securing the solvency of such company.
