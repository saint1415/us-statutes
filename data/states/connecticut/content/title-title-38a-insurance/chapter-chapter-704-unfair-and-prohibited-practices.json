(A) No person may (i) require, as a condition precedent to the lending of money or extension of credit, or any renewal thereof, that the person to whom such money or credit is extended or whose obligation the creditor is to acquire or finance, negotiate any policy or contract of insurance through a particular insurer or group of insurers or producer or group of producers; (ii) unreasonably disapprove the insurance policy provided by a borrower for the protection of the property securing the credit or lien; (iii) require directly or indirectly that any borrower, mortgagor, purchaser, insurer or producer pay a separate charge, in connection with the handling of any insurance policy required as security for a loan on real estate or pay a separate charge to substitute the insurance policy of one insurer for that of another; or (iv) use or disclose information resulting from a requirement that a borrower, mortgagor or purchaser furnish insurance of any kind on real property being conveyed or used as collateral security to a loan, when such information is to the advantage of the mortgagee, vendor or lender, or is to the detriment of the borrower, mortgagor, purchaser, insurer or the producer complying with such a requirement.\n\n(B) (i) Subparagraph (A)(iii) of this subdivision shall not include the interest which may be charged on premium loans or premium advancements in accordance with the security instrument. (ii) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii) of this subdivision, such disapproval shall be deemed unreasonable if it is not based solely on reasonable standards uniformly applied, relating to the extent of coverage required and the financial soundness and the services of an insurer. Such standards shall not discriminate against any particular type of insurer, nor shall such standards call for the disapproval of an insurance policy because such policy contains coverage in addition to that required. (iii) The commissioner may investigate the affairs of any person to whom this subdivision applies to determine whether such person has violated this subdivision. If a violation of this subdivision is found, the person in violation shall be subject to the same procedures and penalties as are applicable to other provisions of section 38a-815, subsections (b) and (e) of section 38a-817 and this section.

Any individual who is blind or partially blind shall be subject to the same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or reasonably anticipated experience as are sighted persons with respect to all other conditions, including the underlying cause of the blindness or partial blindness.\n\n(14) Refusing to insure, refusing to continue to insure or limiting the amount, extent or kind of coverage available to an individual or charging an individual a different rate for the same coverage because of exposure to diethylstilbestrol through the female parent.\n\n(15) (A) Failure by an insurer, or any other entity responsible for providing payment to a health care provider pursuant to an insurance policy, to pay accident and health claims, including, but not limited to, claims for payment or reimbursement to health care providers, within the time periods set forth in subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, unless the Insurance Commissioner determines that a legitimate dispute exists as to coverage, liability or damages or that the claimant has fraudulently caused or contributed to the loss.
