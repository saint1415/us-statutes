      "text": "(a) A nonprofit legal service corporation is defined as a nonprofit corporation without capital stock organized under the laws of the state for the purpose of establishing, maintaining and operating a plan whereby legal services may be provided at the expense of such corporation by attorneys-at-law to subscribers under contract entitling such subscribers to payments or benefits in fixed or variable amounts for the cost of legal services. Cost of legal services shall include attorneys' fees, court costs and related expenses incurred in the exercise of any right.\n\n(b) A legal service corporation providing benefits to plan subscribers under the provisions of subsection (a) of this section may, upon obtaining the approval of the Insurance Commissioner as provided in section 38a-234: (1) Fix or adjust the rates to be paid by any group or groups of its subscribers based upon past and prospective loss experience and may classify subscribers and groups of subscribers and determine rates with reference to standards for variations of risks or expenses which it may establish, and (2) contract for the coordination of benefits with other legal service corporations or with insurance companies to avoid duplication of benefits to be provided to its group subscribers. Subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection shall be subject to such regulations as may be promulgated by the Insurance Commissioner to establish guidelines of eligibility for experience rating and adoption of coordination of benefit clauses in legal service benefit contracts. Every such corporation shall be governed by sections 38a-230 to 38a-245, inclusive, and shall, except as specifically designated herein, be exempt from the provisions of the general statutes relating to insurance.\n\n(c) Any such legal service corporation may contract with any insurance company authorized to make any contract for accident and health insurance or casualty insurance in this state, or with any hospital service corporation incorporated under sections 38a-199 to 38a-209, inclusive, or any medical service corporation incorporated under sections 38a-214 to 38a-225, inclusive, for the performance of services to such legal service corporation or its subscribers necessary or proper in providing for payments or benefits under the provisions of this section.\n\n(P.A. 79-234, S. 1; P.A. 80-482, S. 3, 345, 348.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 80-482 abolished the department of business regulation and restored its division of insurance as an independent department (as it was prior to creation of the business regulation department in P.A. 77-614), thus allowing omission of reference to business regulation department in insurance commissioner's title; Sec. 38-401 transferred to Sec. 38a-230 in 1991.",
