      "text": "As used in this title, unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires, “public adjuster” means any person, partnership, association, limited liability company or corporation who or which:\n\n(1) On behalf of an insured and for monetary or other compensation or anything of value, (A) prepares, documents and submits a first-party property claim to an insurance company for loss or damage by a covered peril under a personal or commercial risk insurance policy, as defined in section 38a-663, issued by such company, or (B) negotiates, adjusts or effects the settlement of such claim;\n\n(2) Advertises or solicits business as a public adjuster; or\n\n(3) Holds himself or itself out to the public as engaging in the activities set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subdivision (1) of this section as a business. Lawyers settling claims of clients shall not be deemed to be public adjusters.\n\n(P.A. 90-243, S. 23; P.A. 95-79, S. 147, 189; P.A. 10-32, S. 123; 10-79, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 95-79 redefined “public adjuster” to include a limited liability company, effective May 31, 1995; P.A. 10-32 made technical changes, effective May 10, 2010; P.A. 10-79 redefined “public adjuster” and made technical changes.\n\nEmployment contract between licensed public adjuster and property owner was unenforceable because statute and regulations governing public adjusters limit a licensed public adjuster's employment to adjusting losses and damages arising under a fire insurance policy on behalf of an insured under the policy; additionally, it was a condition precedent to enforcement of a licensed public adjuster's employment contract that such adjuster represent an insured party. 252 C. 400.",
