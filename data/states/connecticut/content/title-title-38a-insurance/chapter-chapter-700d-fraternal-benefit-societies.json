No society shall incur any liability other than for the return of such advance premium, nor issue any certificate, nor pay, allow, or offer or promise to pay or allow, any death or disability benefit to any person until: (a) Actual bona fide applications for death benefits have been secured aggregating at least five hundred thousand dollars on not less than five hundred lives; (b) all such applicants for death benefits have furnished evidence of insurability satisfactory to the society; (c) certificates of examinations or acceptable declarations of insurability have been filed and approved by the chief medical examiner of the society; (d) ten subordinate lodges or branches have been established into which the five hundred applicants have been admitted; (e) there has been submitted to the commissioner, under oath of the president or secretary, or corresponding officer of the society, a list of such applicants, giving their names and addresses, the date each was admitted, the name and number of the subordinate branch of which each applicant is a member, the amount of benefits to be granted and the premiums therefor; and (f) it has been shown to the commissioner, by sworn statement of the treasurer or corresponding officer of such society, that at least five hundred applicants have each paid in cash at least one regular monthly premium as herein provided, which premiums in the aggregate shall amount to at least twenty-five hundred dollars, all of which shall be credited to the fund or funds from which benefits are to be paid and no part of which may be used for expenses. Such advance premiums shall be held in trust during the period of organization and, if the society has not qualified for a certificate of authority within one year, as herein provided, such premiums shall be returned to the applicants.\n\n(5) The commissioner may make such examination and require such further information as he deems advisable. Upon presentation of satisfactory evidence that the society has complied with all the provisions of law, he shall issue to the society a certificate to that effect and that the society is authorized to transact business pursuant to the provisions of sections 38a-595 to 38a-626, inclusive, 38a-631 to 38a-640, inclusive, and 38a-800.

The statement shall be in general form and context as approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for fraternal benefit societies and as supplemented by additional information required by the commissioner. An electronically filed true and complete report filed in accordance with section 38a-53a that is timely submitted to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners shall be deemed to have been submitted to the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(2) Each foreign society transacting business in this state shall, annually, on or before the first day of March, unless the commissioner has extended such time for cause shown, file with the commissioner, and electronically to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a true and complete statement of its financial condition, transactions and affairs for the preceding calendar year and pay the fee specified in section 38a-11 for filing such annual statement.

An electronically filed true and complete report filed in accordance with section 38a-53a that is timely submitted to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners shall be deemed to have been submitted to the commissioner in accordance with this subsection.\n\n(3) Not later than June first, annually, each society shall print and mail to each benefit member of the society a synopsis of its annual statement that provides an explanation of the facts thereby disclosed concerning the condition of the society. In lieu thereof, a society may publish such synopsis in the society's official publication.\n\n(4) (A) As part of the annual statement required under this subsection, each society shall, annually, on or before the first day of March, file with the commissioner a valuation of its certificates in force on December thirty-first last preceding, provided the commissioner may, for cause shown, extend the time for filing such valuation for not more than two calendar months. Such report of valuation shall show, as reserve liabilities, the difference between the present midyear value of the promised benefits provided in the certificates of such society in force and the present midyear value of the future net premiums as the same are in practice actually collected, not including therein any value for the right to make extra assessments and not including any amount by which the present midyear value of future net premiums exceeds the present midyear value of promised benefits on individual certificates.\n\n(B) At the option of any society, in lieu of the valuation specified in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, the valuation may show the net tabular value. Such net tabular value as to certificates issued prior to January 1, 1959, shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of law applicable prior to January 1, 1958, and as to certificates issued on or after January 1, 1959, shall not be less than the reserves determined according to the Commissioners' Reserve Valuation method as hereinafter defined. If the premium charge is less than the tabular net premium according to the basis of valuation used, an additional reserve equal to the present value of the deficiency in such premiums shall be set up and maintained as a liability. The reserve liabilities shall be properly adjusted if the midyear or tabular values are not appropriate.\n\n(5) Reserves according to the Commissioners' Reserve Valuation method, for the life insurance and endowment benefits of certificates providing for a uniform amount of insurance and requiring the payment of uniform premiums, shall be the excess, if any, of the present value, at the date of valuation, of such future guaranteed benefits provided for by such certificates over the then present value of any future modified net premiums therefor. The modified net premiums for any such certificate shall be such uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for such benefits that the present value, at the date of issue of the certificate, of all such modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of such benefits provided for by the certificate and the excess of (A) over (B), as follows: (A) A net level premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of such benefits provided for after the first certificate year, divided by the present value, at the date of issue, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of such certificate on which a premium falls due; provided such net level annual premium shall not exceed the net level annual premium on the nineteen year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age at issue of such certificate; and (B) a net one-year term premium for such benefits provided for in the first certificate year. Reserves according to the Commissioners' Reserve Valuation method for (i) life insurance benefits for varying amounts of benefits or requiring the payment of varying premiums, (ii) annuity and pure endowment benefits, (iii) disability and accidental death benefits in all certificates and contracts, and (iv) all other benefits except life insurance and endowment benefits shall be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of this subdivision.\n\n(6) The present value of deferred payments due under incurred claims or matured certificates shall be deemed a liability of the society and shall be computed upon mortality and interest standards prescribed in subdivision (7) of this subsection.\n\n(7) Such valuation and underlying data shall be certified by a competent actuary or, at the expense of the society, verified by the actuary of the department of insurance of the state of domicile of the society. The minimum standards of valuation for certificates issued prior to January 1, 1959, shall be those provided by the law applicable immediately prior to January 1, 1958, but not lower than the standards used in the calculating of rates for such certificates. The minimum standard of valuation for certificates issued after January 1, 1959, shall be three and one-half per cent interest and the following tables: (A) For certificates of life insurance, American Men Ultimate Table of Mortality, with Bowerman's or Davis' Extension thereof or, with the consent of the Insurance Commissioner, the Commissioner's 1941 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table or the Commissioner's 1941 Standard Industrial Table of Mortality, or the Commissioners' 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, except that, with the approval of the commissioner, the valuation of contracts on female risks may be calculated, at the option of the society, according to an age not more than three years younger than the actual age of the insured; (B) for annuity certificates, including life annuities provided or available under optional modes of settlement in such certificates, the 1937 Standard Annuity Table; (C) for disability benefits issued in connection with life benefit certificates, Hunter's Disability Table, which, for active lives, shall be combined with a mortality table permitted for calculating the reserves on life insurance certificates, except that the table known as Class III Disability Table (1926), modified to conform to the contractual waiting period, shall be used in computing reserves for disability benefits under a contract which presumes that total disability shall be considered to be permanent after a specified period; (D) for accidental death benefits issued in connection with life benefit certificates, the Inter-Company Double Indemnity Mortality Table combined with a mortality table permitted for calculating the reserves for life insurance certificates; and (E) for noncancellable accident and health benefits, the Class III Disability Table (1926) with conference modifications or, with the consent of the commissioner, tables based upon the society's own experience. The commissioner may accept other standards for valuation if the commissioner finds that the reserves produced thereby will not be less in the aggregate than reserves computed in accordance with the minimum valuation standard herein prescribed. The commissioner may, in his or her discretion, vary the standards of mortality applicable to all certificates of insurance on substandard lives or other extra hazardous lives by any society authorized to do business in this state. Whenever the mortality experience under all certificates valued on the same mortality table is in excess of the expected mortality according to such table for a period of three consecutive years, the commissioner may require additional reserves when deemed necessary in the commissioner's judgment on account of such certificates. Any society, with the consent of the insurance commissioner of the state of domicile of the society and under such conditions, if any, that such commissioner may impose, may establish and maintain reserves on its certificates in excess of the reserves required thereunder, but the contractual rights of any insured member shall not be affected thereby.\n\n(8) A society doing business in this state that fails to file the annual statement in the form and within the time provided by this subsection shall pay a late filing fee of one hundred seventy-five dollars per day for each day from the due date of such statement, and, upon notice by the commissioner to that effect, its authority to do business in this state shall cease while such failure to file continues. The commissioner may waive the late filing fee if (A) the society cannot file such statement because the governor of such society's state of domicile has proclaimed a state of emergency in such state and such state of emergency impairs the society's ability to file the statement, or (B) the insurance regulatory official of the state of domicile of a foreign benefit society has permitted the society to file such statement late.\n\n(9) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, a society may, with the approval of the Insurance Commissioner, use the standards for valuation and nonforfeiture authorized by the provisions of sections 38a-61, 38a-77, 38a-78, 38a-81, 38a-82, 38a-284, 38a-287, 38a-430 to 38a-454, inclusive, and 38a-458.\n\n(b) Each association that is (1) a tax-exempt organization under Section 501(c)(23) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time, (2) doing business in this state, and (3) not licensed under sections 38a-595 to 38a-626, inclusive, 38a-631 to 38a-640, inclusive, and 38a-800, shall, annually, on or before the first day of May, file with the commissioner a true and complete financial statement audited by an independent certified public accountant or accounting firm of its financial condition, transactions and affairs for the preceding calendar year and pay the fee specified in section 38a-11 for filing such annual statement.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 6243, 6254, 6255, 6258, 6260, 6273; 1957, P.A. 448, S. 34; 1959, P.A. 55; 392, S. 5; 1963, P.A. 642, S. 40; P.A. 83-139; P.A. 07-225, S. 3; June 12 Sp.
