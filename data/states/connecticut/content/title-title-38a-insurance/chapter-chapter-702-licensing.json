      "text": "(a) Any person, partnership, association or corporation that is resident in this state, or a nonresident of this state who is not licensed in any other state that offers the type of license sought in this state and maintains a principal place of business in this state, desiring to act within this state as a public adjuster, casualty adjuster, motor vehicle physical damage appraiser, certified insurance consultant, surplus lines broker or desiring to engage in any insurance-related occupation for which a license is deemed necessary by the commissioner, other than an occupation as an insurance producer, shall make a written application to the commissioner for a resident license. Any other person, partnership, association or corporation desiring to so act or to engage in any insurance-related occupation for which a license is deemed necessary by the commissioner, other than an occupation as an insurance producer, shall make a written application to the commissioner for a nonresident license.\n\n(b) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, no application for a nonresident license shall be granted unless the applicant holds an equivalent license from any other state. Any application for a resident or nonresident license shall be made for each name or designation under which such business shall be conducted, in such form as the commissioner prescribes, stating the line or lines of insurance for which the applicant desires such license and any other business which the applicant desires also to transact. All initial applications shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable filing fee specified in section 38a-11. The commissioner shall cause to be made such inquiry and examination as to the qualifications of each such applicant as the commissioner deems necessary.\n\n(c) Any person, partnership, association or corporation residing in a state that does not offer the type of license sought by such person, partnership, association or corporation in this state may make a written application to the commissioner for a nonresident license and designate this state as such person's, association's or corporation's home state.\n\n(d) Each application for a license shall be signed by: The applicant, if the application is for an individual; a licensed officer, if the application is for a corporation; a licensed partner, if the application is for a partnership; and a licensed principal, if the application is for any other applicant.\n\n(e) Each applicant for a license shall furnish satisfactory evidence to the commissioner that the applicant is a person of good moral character and that the applicant is financially responsible. In order to determine the trustworthiness and competency of an applicant the commissioner shall subject the applicant to personal written examination as to the applicant's competency to act as a licensee for each line of insurance for which the applicant desires to be licensed. The commissioner may, at the commissioner's discretion, designate an independent testing service to prepare and administer such examination, provided any examination fees charged by such service shall be paid by the applicant. The commissioner shall collect the appropriate examination fee as specified in section 38a-11, which shall entitle the applicant to take the examination for the license desired, except that when a testing service is used, the testing service shall pay such fee to the commissioner for each examination taken by an applicant. In either case, each such examination shall be as the commissioner prescribes and shall be of sufficient scope to test the applicant's knowledge of insurance, the duties and responsibilities of a licensee and the laws of this state applicable to insurance. The commissioner may require a waiting period not exceeding six months, before reexamining any applicant who has failed to pass any such examination.\n\n(f) Upon finding that an applicant meets the licensing requirements of this title and is in all respects properly qualified and trustworthy and that the granting of such license is not against the public interest, the commissioner may issue to such applicant the license applied for, in such form as the commissioner may adopt, to act within this state to the extent therein specified.\n\n(g) The commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, concerning the approval of schools offering courses in insurance, the content of such courses and the advertising to the public of the services of these schools.\n\n(h) To further the enforcement of this section and to determine the eligibility of any licensee, the commissioner may, as often as the commissioner deems necessary, examine the books and records of any such licensee.\n\n(i) A license may, in the discretion of the commissioner, be renewed or continued upon payment of the appropriate fee as specified in section 38a-11, without the resubmittal of the detailed information required in the original application.\n\n(j) The provisions of subsections (b) to (i), inclusive, of this section shall be applicable to any licensee or applicant for a license, including, but not limited to, such licensee engaged in, or such applicant who seeks to become licensed to engage in, the occupation of insurance producer.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 6060; 1949, 1951, 1955, S. 2787d; 1957, P.A. 355; 1959, P.A. 472, S. 1; February, 1965, P.A. 196, S. 2; 552, S. 1; 1967, P.A. 47, S. 1; 1969, P.A. 82; 1971, P.A. 393; P.A. 75-409, S. 1, 2; P.A. 80-228, S. 3; P.A. 81-314, S. 1, 4; P.A. 82-30, S. 1, 2; 82-96, S. 1, 8; P.A. 83-201; 83-476, S. 1; P.A. 84-403, S. 2, 3; P.A. 85-84; P.A. 88-44; P.A. 89-251, S. 180, 203; P.A. 90-243, S. 26; P.A. 91-29, S. 3, 8; P.A. 94-160, S. 13, 24; P.A. 99-45, S. 1; P.A. 01-113, S. 20, 42; P.A. 02-19, S. 2; P.A. 05-29, S. 2; P.A. 23-127, S. 2.)\n\nHistory: 1959 act inserted provisions re examination for each line of insurance, $5 fee for three-time examination and waiting period before reexamination; 1965 acts deleted reference to assessment of fees “subject to the provisions of section 12-211” and added provision re required prerequisites for admission to license examination and re commissioner's power to regulate approval of schools, course content and advertising of school's services; 1967 act allowed waiver of examination for life agent's or broker's license and fire or casualty agent's or broker's license in new Subdivs. (f) and (g); 1969 act imposed filing fee of $5 for initial applications and deleted “three times” in provision re applicant's right to take any one of the examinations upon payment of $5 fee; 1971 act extended examination waiver by adding Subdiv.

      "text": "(a) Agents of societies shall be licensed in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(b) (1) The commissioner may issue a license to any person who has paid the license fee specified in section 38a-11, and who has complied with the requirements of this section, authorizing such licensee to act as fraternal agent on behalf of any society named in such license which is authorized to do business in this state. (2) Before any fraternal agent's license shall be issued there shall be on file in the office of the commissioner the following documents: (A) A written application by the prospective licensee in such form or forms and supplements thereto, and containing such information, as the commissioner may prescribe and on an initial application the filing fee specified in section 38a-11, shall be remitted; and (B) a certificate by the society which is to be named in such license, stating that such society has satisfied itself that the named applicant is trustworthy and competent to act as such fraternal agent and that the society will appoint such applicant to act as its agent if the license applied for is issued by the commissioner. Such certificates shall be executed and acknowledged by an officer or managing agent of such society. (3) No written or other examination shall be required of any individual seeking to be named as a licensee to represent a fraternal benefit society as its agent. (4) The commissioner may refuse to issue or renew any fraternal agent's license if in his judgment the proposed licensee is not trustworthy and competent to act as such agent, or has given cause for revocation or suspension of such license, or has failed to comply with any prerequisite for the issuance or renewal, as the case may be, of such license. (5) Every license issued pursuant to this section, and every renewal thereof, shall expire on December thirty-first of each odd-numbered year. (6) If the application for a renewal license has been filed with the commissioner on or before such expiration date, such applicant named in such existing license may continue to act as fraternal agent under such existing license, unless the same is revoked or suspended, until the issuance by the commissioner of the renewal license or until the expiration of five days after he has refused to renew such license and has served written notice of such refusal on the applicant. If the applicant, within thirty days after such notice is given, notifies the commissioner in writing of his request for a hearing on such refusal, the commissioner shall, within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, grant such hearing, and he may, in his discretion, reinstate such license. (7) Any such renewal license of a fraternal agent may be issued upon the application of the society named in the existing license and payment of the fee specified in section 38a-11. Such application shall be in the form or forms prescribed by the commissioner and shall contain such information as he may require. Such application shall contain a certificate executed by the president, or by a vice president, a secretary, an assistant secretary, or corresponding officer by whatever name known, or by an employee expressly designated and authorized to execute such certificate of a domestic or foreign society or by the United States manager of an alien society, stating that the addresses therein given of the agents of such society for whom renewal licenses are requested therein have been verified in each instance immediately preceding the preparation of the application. Notwithstanding the filing of such application, the commissioner may, after reasonable notice to any such society, require that any or all agents of such society to be named as licensees in renewal licenses shall execute and file separate applications for the renewal of such licenses, as hereinbefore specified, and he may also require that each such application shall be accompanied by the certificate specified in subdivision (2)(B) of this subsection.\n\n(c) Every society doing business in this state shall, upon the termination of the appointment of any fraternal agent licensed to represent it in this state, forthwith file with the commissioner a statement, in such form as he may prescribe, of the facts relative to such termination and the cause thereof. Every statement made pursuant to this section shall be deemed a privileged communication.\n\n(d) The commissioner may revoke, or may suspend for such period as he may determine, any fraternal agent's license if, after notice and hearing as specified in section 38a-774, he determines that the licensee has: (1) Violated any provision of, or any obligation imposed by, this section, or has violated any law in the course of his dealings as agent; (2) made a material misstatement in the application for such license; (3) been guilty of fraudulent or dishonest practices; (4) demonstrated his incompetency or untrustworthiness to act as an insurance agent; or (5) been guilty of rebating as defined by the laws of this state applicable to life insurance companies. The revocation or suspension of any fraternal agent's license shall terminate forthwith the license of such agent. No individual whose license has been revoked shall be entitled to obtain any fraternal agent's license under the provisions of this section for a period of one year after such revocation or, if such revocation is judicially reviewed, for one year after the final determination thereof affirming the action of the commissioner in revoking such license.\n\n(1957, P.A. 448, S. 28; 1959, P.A. 392, S. 4; 1961, P.A. 9, S. 1, 2; 1969, P.A. 73; P.A. 82-96, S. 5, 8; P.A. 90-243, S. 140.)\n\nHistory: 1959 act raised agent's license fee to $20; 1961 act restored it to $10 but provided for annual instead of biennial expiration; 1969 act raised license fee to $20 and imposed filing fee of $10 upon initial application; P.A. 82-96 amended Subdiv. (4) to require biennial rather than annual renewal for a fraternal agent's license and specified fee of $40, effective June 1, 1983; P.A. 90-243 divided section into alphabetical Subsecs., specified the licensing requirement by enumerating the section number for licensure and fees and substituted “foreign” for “nonresident” and “alien” for “foreign”; Sec. 38-234 transferred to Sec. 38a-800 in 1991.",
