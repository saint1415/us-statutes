(A) A person “controls” a declarant if the person (i) is a general partner, officer, director, or employer of the declarant, (ii) directly or indirectly or acting in concert with one or more other persons, or through one or more subsidiaries, owns, controls, holds with power to vote, or holds proxies representing, more than twenty per cent of the voting interest in the declarant, (iii) controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the declarant, or (iv) has contributed more than twenty per cent of the capital of the declarant. (B) A person “is controlled by” a declarant if the declarant (i) is a general partner, officer, director, or employer of the person, (ii) directly or indirectly or acting in concert with one or more other persons, or through one or more subsidiaries, owns, controls, holds with power to vote, or holds proxies representing, more than twenty per cent of the voting interest in the person, (iii) controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the person, or (iv) has contributed more than twenty per cent of the capital of the person. Control does not exist if the powers described in this subsection are held solely as security for an obligation and are not exercised.\n\n(2) “Allocated interests” means the following interests allocated to each unit: (A) In a condominium, the undivided interest in the common elements, the common expense liability, and votes in the association; (B) in a cooperative, the common expense liability and the ownership interest and votes in the association; and (C) in a planned community, the common expense liability and votes in the association.\n\n(3) “Assessment” means the sums attributable to a unit and due the association pursuant to section 47-257.\n\n(4) “Association” or “unit owners' association” means the unit owners' association organized under section 47-243.\n\n(5) “Bylaws” means the instruments, however denominated, that contain the procedures for conduct of the affairs of the association regardless of the form in which the association is organized, including any amendments to the instruments.\n\n(6) “Common elements” means (A) in the case of (i) a condominium or cooperative, all portions of the common interest community other than the units; and (ii) a planned community, any real property within a planned community owned or leased by the association, other than a unit, and (B) in all common interest communities, any other interests in real property for the benefit of unit owners which are subject to the declaration.\n\n(7) “Common expenses” means expenditures made by, or financial liabilities of, the association, together with any allocations to reserves.\n\n(8) “Common expense liability” means the liability for common expenses allocated to each unit pursuant to section 47-226.\n\n(9) “Common interest community” means real property described in a declaration with respect to which a person, by virtue of his ownership of a unit, is obligated to pay for a share of (A) real property taxes on, (B) insurance premiums on, (C) maintenance of, (D) improvement of, or (E) services or other expenses related to, common elements, other units or any other real property other than that unit described in the declaration. “Common interest community” does not include an arrangement described in section 47-219a or a covenant described in section 47-219b. For purposes of this subdivision, “ownership of a unit” includes holding a leasehold interest of forty years or more in a unit, including renewal options. “Ownership of a unit” does not include the interest which a resident holds in a mutual housing association, as defined in subsection (b) of section 8-214f, by virtue of either a state contract for financial assistance or an individual occupancy agreement. An association of property owners funded solely by voluntary payments from those owners is not a common interest community.\n\n(10) “Condominium” means a common interest community in which portions of the real property are designated for separate ownership and the remainder of the real property is designated for common ownership solely by the owners of those portions. A common interest community is not a condominium unless the undivided interests in the common elements are vested in the unit owners.\n\n(11) “Conversion building” means a building that at any time before creation of the common interest community was occupied wholly or partially by persons other than purchasers and persons who occupy with the consent of purchasers.\n\n(12) “Cooperative” means a common interest community in which the real property is owned by an association, each of whose members is entitled by virtue of his ownership interest in the association to exclusive possession of a unit.\n\n(13) “Dealer” means a person who owns either six or more units, or fifty per cent or more of all the units, in a common interest community.\n\n(14) “Declarant” means any person or group of persons acting in concert who (A) as part of a common promotional plan, offers to dispose of his interest in a unit not previously disposed of or (B) reserves or succeeds to any special declarant right.\n\n(15) “Declaration” means any instruments, however denominated, that create a common interest community, including any amendments to those instruments.\n\n(16) “Development rights” means any right or combination of rights reserved by a declarant in the declaration to (A) add real property to a common interest community; (B) create units, common elements, or limited common elements within a common interest community; (C) subdivide units or convert units into common elements; or (D) withdraw real property from a common interest community.\n\n(17) “Dispose” or “disposition” means a voluntary transfer to a purchaser of any legal or equitable interest in a unit, but the term does not include the transfer or release of a security interest.\n\n(18) “Executive board” means the body, regardless of name, designated in the declaration to act on behalf of the association.\n\n(19) “Identifying number” means a symbol or address that identifies only one unit in a common interest community.\n\n(20) “Leasehold common interest community” means a common interest community in which all or a portion of the real property is subject to a lease the expiration or termination of which will terminate the common interest community or reduce its size.\n\n(21) “Limited common element” means a portion of the common elements allocated by the declaration or by operation of subdivision (2) or (4) of section 47-221 for the exclusive use of one or more but fewer than all of the units.\n\n(22) “Master association” means an organization described in section 47-239, whether or not it is also an association described in section 47-243.\n\n(23) “Offer” or “offering” means any advertisement, inducement, solicitation or attempt to encourage any person to acquire any interest in a unit, other than as security for an obligation. An advertisement in a newspaper or other periodical of general circulation, or in any broadcast medium to the general public, of a common interest community not located in this state, is not an offering if the advertisement states that an offering may be made only in compliance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the common interest community is located.\n\n(24) “Person” means an individual, corporation, limited liability company, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, association, joint venture, public corporation, government, governmental subdivision or agency, instrumentality or any other legal or commercial entity.\n\n(25) “Planned community” means a common interest community that is not a condominium or a cooperative. A condominium or cooperative may be part of a planned community.\n\n(26) “Proprietary lease” means an agreement with the association pursuant to which a member is entitled to exclusive possession of a unit in a cooperative.\n\n(27) “Purchaser” means a person, other than a declarant or a dealer, who by means of a voluntary transfer acquires a legal or equitable interest in a unit other than (A) a leasehold interest, including renewal options, of less than twenty years, or (B) as security for an obligation.\n\n(28) “Real property” means any leasehold or other estate or interest in, over, or under land, including structures, fixtures, and other improvements and interests that by custom, usage, or law pass with a conveyance of land though not described in the contract of sale or instrument of conveyance. “Real property” includes parcels with or without upper or lower boundaries, and spaces that may be filled with air or water.\n\n(29) “Record”, used as a noun, means information that is inscribed on a tangible medium or that is stored in an electronic or other medium and is retrievable in perceivable form.\n\n(30) “Residential purposes” means use for dwelling or recreational purposes, or both.\n\n(31) “Rule” means a policy, guideline, restriction, procedure or regulation of an association, however denominated, which is adopted by an association, which is not set forth in the declaration or bylaws, and which regulates conduct occurring within the common interest community or the use, maintenance, repair, replacement, modification or appearance of the common interest community.\n\n(32) “Security interest” means an interest in real property or personal property, created by contract or conveyance, which secures payment or performance of an obligation. “Security interest” includes a lien created by a mortgage, deed of trust, trust deed, security deed, contract for deed, land sales contract, lease intended as security, assignment of lease or rents intended as security, pledge of an ownership interest in an association, and any other consensual lien or title retention contract intended as security for an obligation.\n\n(33) “Special declarant rights” means rights reserved for the benefit of a declarant to (A) complete improvements indicated on surveys and plans filed with the declaration or, in a cooperative, to complete improvements described in the public offering statement pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 47-264; (B) exercise any development right; (C) maintain sales offices, management offices, signs advertising the common interest community, and models; (D) use easements through the common elements for the purpose of making improvements within the common interest community or within real property which may be added to the common interest community; (E) make the common interest community subject to a master association; (F) merge or consolidate a common interest community with another common interest community of the same form of ownership; (G) appoint or remove any officer of the association or any master association or any executive board member during any period of declarant control; (H) control any construction, design review or aesthetic standards committee or process; (I) attend meetings of the unit owners and, except during an executive session, the executive board; or (J) have access to the records of the association to the same extent as a unit owner.\n\n(34) “Time share” means a right to occupy a unit or any of several units during five or more separated time periods over a period of at least five years, including renewal options, whether or not coupled with an estate or interest in a common interest community or a specified portion thereof.\n\n(35) “Unit” means a physical portion of the common interest community designated for separate ownership or occupancy, the boundaries of which are described pursuant to subdivision (5) of subsection (a) of section 47-224. If a unit in a cooperative is owned by a unit owner or is sold, conveyed, voluntarily or involuntarily encumbered or otherwise transferred by a unit owner, the interest in that unit which is owned, sold, conveyed, encumbered or otherwise transferred is the right to possession of that unit under a proprietary lease, coupled with the allocated interests of that unit, and the association's interest in that unit is not thereby affected.\n\n(36) “Unit owner” means a declarant or other person who owns a unit, or a lessee of a unit in a leasehold common interest community whose lease expires simultaneously with any lease the expiration or termination of which will remove the unit from the common interest community, but does not include a person having an interest in a unit solely as security for an obligation. In a condominium or planned community, the declarant is the owner of any unit created by the declaration. In a cooperative, the declarant is treated as the owner of any unit to which allocated interests have been allocated until that unit has been conveyed to another person.\n\n(P.A. 83-474, S. 3, 96; P.A. 84-472, S. 1, 23; P.A. 91-341, S. 14, 19; P.A. 95-79, S. 170, 189; 95-187, S. 1; P.A. 09-225, S. 1; P.A. 10-186, S. 1; P.A. 17-224, S. 3.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 84-472 amended Subdiv.

      "text": "(a) The General Assembly expressly finds that many leases involving the use of land or recreational or other common facilities by residents of a residential common interest community were entered into by parties wholly representative of the interests of a residential common interest developer at a time when the residential common interest community unit owners not only did not control the administration of their residential common interest community, but also had little or no voice in such administration. Such leases often contain numerous obligations on the part of either or both a residential common interest community association and residential common interest community unit owners with relatively few obligations on the part of the lessor. Such lease may or may not be unconscionable in any given case. Nevertheless, the General Assembly finds that a combination of certain onerous obligations and circumstances warrants the establishment of a rebuttable presumption of unconscionability of certain leases, as specified in subsection (d) of this section. The presumption may be rebutted by a lessor upon the showing of additional facts and circumstances to justify and validate what otherwise appears to be an unconscionable lease under this section. Failure of a lease to contain the required number of specified elements shall not preclude a determination of unconscionability of the lease. It is the intent of the General Assembly that this section is remedial and does not create any new cause of action to invalidate any residential common interest community lease, but shall operate as a statutory prescription on procedural matters in actions brought on one or more causes of action existing at the time of the execution of such lease.\n\n(b) The court, on finding as a matter of law that a contract or contract clause was unconscionable at the time the contract was made, may refuse to enforce the contract, enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause or limit the application of any unconscionable clause in order to avoid an unconscionable result.\n\n(c) Whenever it is claimed, or appears to the court, that a contract or any contract clause is or may be unconscionable, the parties, in order to aid the court in making the determination, shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to:\n\n(1) The commercial setting of the negotiations;\n\n(2) Whether a party has knowingly taken advantage of the inability of the other party reasonably to protect his interests by reason of physical or mental infirmity, illiteracy, inability to understand the language of the agreement or similar factors;\n\n(3) The effect and purpose of the contract or clause; and\n\n(4) If a sale, any gross disparity, at the time of contracting, between the amount charged for the property and the value of that property measured by the price at which similar property was readily obtainable in similar transactions. A disparity between the contract price and the value of the property measured by the price at which similar property was readily obtainable in similar transactions does not, of itself, render the contract unconscionable.\n\n(d) A lease entered into prior to January 1, 1984, pertaining to use of land or facilities by unit owners in a residential common interest community, is presumed to be unconscionable if:\n\n(1) The lease by its terms requires the lessee to pay an annual rental and other expenses that exceed fifteen per cent of the appraised value of the leased property as improved, provided for the purposes of this subdivision, “annual rental and other expenses” means the amount paid by the lessee during the twelve months immediately preceding the filing of an action under this section as rent and for real estate taxes, insurance, capital improvements and other expenses required to maintain the property under the lease terms, and “appraised value” means the appraised value placed upon the leased property by a licensed or certified real estate appraiser on a date during the twelve months immediately preceding the filing of an action under this section; and\n\n(2) Seven of the following eight elements exist:\n\n(A) The lease was executed by persons none of whom at the time of the execution of the lease were elected by unit owners, other than the declarant;\n\n(B) The lease requires either the association or the unit owners to pay all real estate taxes on the subject real property;\n\n(C) The lease requires either the association or the unit owners to insure buildings or other facilities on the subject real property against fire or any other hazard;\n\n(D) The lease requires either the association or the unit owners to perform some or all maintenance obligations pertaining to the subject real property or facilities located upon the subject real property;\n\n(E) The lease requires either the association or the unit owners to pay rents to the lessor for a period of twenty-one years or more;\n\n(F) The lease provides that failure of the lessee to make payments of rents due under the lease creates, establishes or permits establishment of a lien upon individual units to secure claims for rent;\n\n(G) The lease provides for a periodic rental increase based upon reference to a price index; and\n\n(H) The lease or other common interest community documents require that any transferee of a unit must assume obligations under the lease.\n\n(e) The presumption set forth in subsection (d) of this section may be rebutted by a lessor upon the showing of additional facts and circumstances to justify and validate what otherwise appears to be an unconscionable lease under this section.\n\n(f) Failure of a lease to contain the required number of elements specified in subsection (d) of this section shall not preclude a determination that the lease is unconscionable.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, neither the statute of limitations nor laches shall prohibit unit owners of a residential common interest community from maintaining a cause of action under this section.\n\n(h) If a court finds that a lease contract or lease contract clause was unconscionable at the time the contract was made, in determining whether to enforce the contract, or enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause, or whether to limit the application of any unconscionable clause in order to avoid an unconscionable result, the court shall consider evidence regarding the adverse impact, if any, of any such determination on the interests of third parties, including lenders who may have, in good faith, relied upon such lease provisions, and the court, in formulating such a determination, shall seek to avoid an unjust impact on such third parties and shall make no such determination, the effect of which would be to terminate the common interest community.\n\n(P.A. 83-474, S. 11, 96; P.A. 95-187, S. 27; P.A. 14-122, S. 56.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 95-187 added new Subsec.

(f) to provide that a determination that the lease is unconscionable is not precluded by the failure of the lease to contain the required number of elements specified in Subsec. (d), added Subsec. (g) to provide that neither the statute of limitations nor laches shall prohibit unit owners maintaining a cause of action and added Subsec. (h) requiring the court to consider the impact on third parties when determining an appropriate remedy upon finding that a lease contract or lease contract clause was unconscionable at the time the contract was made, requiring the court to seek to avoid an unjust impact on third parties and prohibiting the court from making a determination the effect of which would be to terminate the common interest community; P.A. 14-122 made a technical change in Subsec. (d)(1).\n\nCited. 237 C. 123.\n\nSubsec. (d):\n\nDetermination of unconscionability is to be made based on a certain time frame after claim is filed, not after the contract is formed. 265 C. 579.",

This provision does not extend the time limit on the exercise of development rights imposed by the declaration pursuant to subdivision (8) of subsection (a) of section 47-224.\n\n(c) Whenever a declarant exercises a development right to subdivide or convert a unit previously created into additional units, common elements or both: (1) If the declarant converts the unit entirely to common elements, the amendment to the declaration shall reallocate all the allocated interests of that unit among the other units as if that unit had been taken by eminent domain; and (2) if the declarant subdivides the unit into two or more units, whether or not any part of the unit is converted into common elements, the amendment to the declaration shall reallocate all the allocated interests of the unit among the units created by the subdivision in any reasonable manner prescribed by the declarant.\n\n(d) If the declaration provides, pursuant to subdivision (8) of subsection (a) of section 47-224, that all or a portion of the real property is subject to a right of withdrawal: (1) If all the real property is subject to withdrawal, and the declaration does not describe separate portions of real property subject to that right, none of the real property may be withdrawn after a unit has been conveyed to a purchaser; and (2) if any portion is subject to withdrawal, it may not be withdrawn after a unit in that portion has been conveyed to a purchaser.\n\n(e) If a declarant fails to exercise any development right within the time limit described in the declaration pursuant to subdivision (8) of subsection (a) of section 47-224 and in accordance with any conditions or limitations described in the declaration pursuant to subdivision (10) of said subsection, or records an instrument surrendering a development right, that development right shall lapse.\n\n(P.A. 83-474, S. 30, 96; P.A. 84-472, S. 10, 23.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 84-472 amended Subsec.

The declaration may specify a smaller percentage, but in no event less than a majority of the votes in the association, only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.\n\n(b) An agreement to terminate shall be evidenced by the execution of a termination agreement, or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners. The termination agreement shall specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless it is recorded before that date. A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof shall be recorded in every town in which a portion of the common interest community is situated and is effective only on recordation.\n\n(c) In the case of a condominium or planned community containing only units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may provide that all of the common elements and units of the common interest community shall be sold following termination. If, pursuant to the agreement, any real property in the common interest community is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement shall set forth the minimum terms of the sale.\n\n(d) In the case of a condominium or planned community containing any units not having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may provide for sale of the common elements, but it may not require that the units be sold following termination, unless the declaration as originally recorded provided otherwise or all unit owners consent to the sale.\n\n(e) The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of real property in a common interest community, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until approved pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section. If any real property is to be sold following termination, title to that real property, on termination, vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale shall be distributed to unit owners and lien holders, as their interests may appear, in accordance with subsections (h), (i) and (j) of this section. Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real property, each unit owner and the unit owner's successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real property that formerly constituted the unit. During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and the unit owner's successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by this chapter or the declaration.\n\n(f) In a condominium or planned community, if the real property constituting the common interest community is not to be sold following termination, title to the common elements and, in a common interest community containing only units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, title to all the real property in the common interest community, vest in the unit owners on termination as tenants in common in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection (j) of this section, and liens on the units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common exists, each unit owner and the unit owner's successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real property that formerly constituted the unit.\n\n(g) Following termination of the common interest community, the proceeds of any sale of real property, together with the assets of the association, are held by the association as trustee for unit owners and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear.\n\n(h) Following termination of a condominium or planned community, creditors of the association holding liens on the units, which were recorded before termination, may enforce those liens in the same manner as any lien holder. All other creditors of the association are to be treated as if they had perfected liens on the units immediately before termination.\n\n(i) In a cooperative, the declaration may provide that all creditors of the association have priority over any interests of unit owners and creditors of unit owners. In that event, following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the cooperative which were recorded before termination may enforce their liens in the same manner as any lien holder, and any other creditor of the association is to be treated as if he had perfected a lien against the cooperative immediately before termination. Unless the declaration provides that all creditors of the association have that priority:\n\n(1) The lien of each creditor of the association which was perfected against the association before termination becomes, on termination, a lien against each unit owner's interest in the unit as of the date the lien was perfected;\n\n(2) Any other creditor of the association is to be treated on termination as if the creditor had perfected a lien against each unit owner's interest immediately before termination;\n\n(3) The amount of the lien of an association's creditor described in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection against each of the unit owners' interest shall be proportionate to the ratio which each unit's common expense liability bears to the common expense liability of all of the units;\n\n(4) The lien of each creditor of each unit owner which was perfected before termination continues as a lien against that unit owner's unit as of the date the lien was perfected; and\n\n(5) The assets of the association shall be distributed to all unit owners and all lien holders as their interests may appear in the order described above. Creditors of the association are not entitled to payment from any unit owner in excess of the amount of the creditor's lien against that unit owner's interest.\n\n(j) The respective interests of unit owners referred to in subsections (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i) of this section are as follows:\n\n(1) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the respective interests of unit owners are the fair market values of their units, allocated interests and any limited common elements immediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association. The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within thirty days after distribution by unit owners of units to which twenty-five per cent of the votes in the association are allocated. The proportion of any unit owner's interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of that unit owner's unit and its allocated interests by the total fair market values of all the units and their allocated interests.\n\n(2) If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value thereof before destruction cannot be made, the interests of all unit owners are their respective common expense liabilities immediately before the termination.\n\n(k) In a condominium or planned community, except as provided in subsection (l) of this section, foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire common interest community does not terminate, of itself, the common interest community, and foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the common interest community, other than withdrawable real property, does not withdraw that portion from the common interest community. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable real property, or against common elements that have been subjected to a security interest by the association under section 47-254, does not withdraw, of itself, that real property from the common interest community, but the person taking title thereto may require from the association, on request, an amendment excluding the real property from the common interest community.\n\n(l) In a condominium or planned community, if a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the real property comprising the common interest community has priority over the declaration and the lien or encumbrance has not been partially released, the parties foreclosing the lien or encumbrance, on foreclosure, may record an instrument excluding the real property subject to that lien or encumbrance from the common interest community.\n\n(m) If substantially all the units in a common interest community have been destroyed or abandoned or are uninhabitable and the available methods for giving notice under section 47-261c of a meeting of unit owners to consider termination under this section will not likely result in receipt of the notice, the executive board or any other interested person may commence an action in the Superior Court seeking to terminate the common interest community. During the pendency of the action, the court may issue whatever orders it considers appropriate, including appointment of a receiver. After a hearing, the court may terminate the common interest community or reduce its size pursuant to this section, notwithstanding that eighty per cent of the unit owners did not vote or agree to that action, and may issue any other order the court considers to be in the best interest of the unit owners and persons holding a property interest in the common interest community.\n\n(P.A. 83-474, S. 38, 96; P.A. 95-187, S. 13; P.A. 05-288, S. 166; P.A. 09-225, S. 17; P.A. 10-186, S. 4, 5.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 95-187 amended Subsec. (k) to provide that foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance “against common elements that have been subjected to a security interest by the association under section 47-254” does not withdraw, of itself, that real property from the community; P.A. 05-288 made technical changes in Subsec.

If the association does not notify unit owners of a special meeting within fifteen days after the requisite number or percentage of unit owners request the secretary to do so, the requesting members may directly notify the unit owners of the meeting. Only matters described in the meeting notice required by subdivision (3) of this subsection may be considered at a special meeting;\n\n(3) An association shall notify unit owners of the time, date and place of each annual and special meeting of unit owners not less than ten days or more than sixty days before the meeting date. Notice may be by any means described in section 47-261c. The notice of any meeting shall state the time, date and place of the meeting and the items on the agenda, including (A) a statement of the general nature of any proposed amendment to the declaration or bylaws, (B) any budget changes, and (C) any proposal to remove an officer or member of the executive board;\n\n(4) Unit owners shall be given a reasonable opportunity at any meeting to comment regarding any matter affecting the common interest community or the association; and\n\n(5) Unless prohibited by the declaration or bylaws, meetings of unit owners may be conducted by telephonic, video or other conferencing process if the alternative process is consistent with subdivision (7) of subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(b) The following requirements apply to meetings of the executive board and committees of the association authorized to act for the association:\n\n(1) Meetings shall be open to the unit owners and to a representative designated by any unit owner except during executive sessions. The executive board and those committees may hold an executive session only during a regular or special meeting of the board or a committee. No final vote or action may be taken during an executive session. An executive session may be held only to: (A) Consult with the association's attorney concerning legal matters; (B) discuss existing or potential litigation or mediation, arbitration or administrative proceedings; (C) discuss labor or personnel matters; (D) discuss contracts, leases and other commercial transactions to purchase or provide goods or services currently being negotiated, including the review of bids or proposals, if premature general knowledge of those matters would place the association at a disadvantage; or (E) prevent public knowledge of the matter to be discussed if the executive board or committee determines that public knowledge would violate the privacy of any person.\n\n(2) For purposes of this section, a gathering of board members at which the board members do not conduct association business is not a meeting of the executive board. The executive board and its members may not use incidental or social gatherings of board members or any other method to evade the open meeting requirements of this section.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any actions taken by not less than two-thirds consent of the entire executive board pursuant to subdivision (8) or (9) of this subsection, during and after the period of declarant control, the executive board shall meet at least two times a year at the common interest community or at a place convenient to the community. Those meetings, and after termination of the period of declarant control, all executive board meetings, shall be at the common interest community or at a place convenient to the community unless the bylaws are amended to vary the location of those meetings.\n\n(4) At each executive board meeting, the executive board shall provide a reasonable opportunity for unit owners to comment regarding any matter affecting the common interest community and the association.\n\n(5) Unless the meeting is included in a schedule given to the unit owners or the meeting is called to deal with an emergency, the secretary or other officer specified in the bylaws shall give notice of each executive board meeting to each board member and to the unit owners. The notice shall be given at least five days before the meeting and shall state the time, date, place and agenda of the meeting, except that notice of a meeting called to adopt, amend or repeal a rule shall be given in accordance with subsection (a) of section 47-261b. If notice of the meeting is included in a schedule given to the unit owners, the secretary or other officer specified in the bylaws shall make available an agenda for such meeting to each board member and to the unit owners not later than forty-eight hours prior to the meeting.\n\n(6) If any materials are distributed to the executive board before the meeting, the executive board at the same time shall make copies of those materials reasonably available to unit owners, except that the board need not make available copies of unapproved minutes or materials that are to be considered in executive session.\n\n(7) Unless prohibited by the declaration or bylaws, the executive board may meet by telephonic, video or other conferencing process if (A) the meeting notice states the conferencing process to be used and provides information explaining how unit owners may participate in the conference directly or by meeting at a central location or conference connection; and (B) the process provides all unit owners the opportunity to hear or perceive the discussion and offer comments as provided in subdivision (4) of this subsection.\n\n(8) The minutes of all executive board meetings shall contain a record of how each board member cast his or her vote on any final action proposed to be taken by the executive board, unless such action was approved either by unanimous consent of the board members or without objection by any board member.\n\n(9) Instead of meeting, the executive board may act by not less than two-thirds consent of all executive board members as documented in a record authenticated by its members, noting the consent or nonconsent of each executive board member. The secretary promptly shall give notice to all unit owners of any action taken by not less than two-thirds consent of all executive board members.\n\n(10) Even if an action by the executive board is not in compliance with this section, it is valid unless set aside by a court. A challenge to the validity of an action of the executive board for failure to comply with this section may not be brought more than sixty days after the minutes of the executive board of the meeting at which the action was taken are approved or the record of that action is distributed to unit owners, whichever is later.\n\n(c) Meetings of the association shall be conducted in accordance with the most recent edition of Roberts' Rules of Order Newly Revised unless (1) the declaration, bylaws or other law otherwise provides, or (2) two-thirds of the votes allocated to owners present at the meeting are cast to suspend those rules.\n\n(P.A. 83-474, S. 51, 96; P.A. 09-225, S. 25; P.A. 10-186, S. 10, 25; P.A. 13-289, S. 2; P.A. 14-215, S. 1; P.A. 15-211, S. 26, 27; P.A. 21-169, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 09-225 designated existing provisions as Subsec.

      "text": "(a) Commencing not later than the time of the first conveyance of a unit to a person other than a declarant, the association shall maintain, to the extent reasonably available and subject to reasonable deductibles: (1) Property insurance on the common elements and, in a planned community, also on property that must become common elements, insuring against those risks of direct physical loss commonly insured against, which insurance, after application of any deductibles shall be not less than eighty per cent of the actual cash value of the insured property at the time the insurance is purchased and at each renewal date, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations and other items normally excluded from property policies; (2) flood insurance in the event the condominium is located in a flood hazard area, as defined and determined by the National Flood Insurance Act, as amended, USC 42 Section 4101, P.L. 93-234, and the unit owners by vote direct; (3) commercial general liability insurance, including medical payments insurance, in an amount determined by the executive board but not less than any amount specified in the declaration, covering all occurrences commonly insured against for bodily injury and property damage arising out of or in connection with the use, ownership or maintenance of the common elements and, in cooperatives, also of all units; and (4) fidelity insurance.\n\n(b) (1) In the case of a building that contains units divided by horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, or by vertical boundaries that comprise or are located within common walls between units, the insurance maintained under subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of this section, to the extent reasonably available, shall include the units, and all improvements and betterments installed by unit owners, unless the declaration limits the association's authority to insure all improvements and betterments or the executive board decides, after giving notice and an opportunity for unit owners to comment, not to insure such improvements and betterments. In the case of common interest communities containing more than twelve units, unless the association insures all improvements and betterments, the association shall:\n\n(A) Prepare and maintain a schedule of the standard fixtures, improvements and betterments in the units, including any standard wall, floor and ceiling coverings covered by the association's insurance policy;\n\n(B) Provide such schedule at least annually to the unit owners in order to enable unit owners to coordinate their homeowners insurance coverage with the coverage afforded by the association's insurance policy; and\n\n(C) Include such schedule in any resale certificate prepared pursuant to section 47-270.\n\n(2) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a building in a common interest community that has not more than two units divided by a single horizontal or vertical boundary unless such common interest community voluntarily chooses to comply with this subsection.\n\n(c) If the insurance described in subsections (a) and (b) of this section is not reasonably available, the association promptly shall cause notice of that fact to be given to all unit owners pursuant to section 47-261c. The declaration may require the association to carry any other insurance, and the association may carry any other insurance it considers appropriate to protect the association or the unit owners.\n\n(d) Insurance policies carried pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall provide that: (1) Each unit owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of his interest in the common elements or membership in the association; (2) the insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any unit owner or member of his household; (3) no act or omission by any unit owner, unless acting within the scope of his authority on behalf of the association, will void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy; and (4) if, at the time of a loss under the policy, there is other insurance in the name of a unit owner covering the same risk covered by the policy, the association's policy provides primary insurance.\n\n(e) Any loss covered by the property policy under subdivision (1) of subsection (a) and subsection (b) of this section shall be adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss are payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose, or otherwise to the association, and not to any holder of a security interest. The insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for the association, unit owners and lien holders as their interests may appear. Subject to the provisions of subsection (h) of this section, the proceeds shall be disbursed first for the repair or replacement of the damaged property, and the association, unit owners and lien holders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the property has been completely repaired or replaced, or the common interest community is terminated.\n\n(f) An insurance policy issued to the association does not prevent a unit owner from obtaining insurance for his own benefit.\n\n(g) An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, on request made in a record, to any unit owner or holder of a security interest. The insurer issuing the policy may not cancel or refuse to renew it until sixty days after notice of the proposed cancellation or nonrenewal has been mailed to the association, each unit owner and each holder of a security interest to whom a certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued at their respective last-known addresses.\n\n(h) (1) Any portion of the common interest community for which insurance is required under this section which is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the association unless (A) the common interest community is terminated, in which case section 47-237 applies, (B) repair or replacement would be illegal under any state or local statute or ordinance governing health or safety, or (C) eighty per cent of the unit owners, including every owner of a unit or assigned limited common element that will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild. The cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves, regardless of whether such excess is the result of the application of a deductible under insurance coverage, is a common expense.\n\n(2) If the entire common interest community is not repaired or replaced, (A) the insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements shall be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the common interest community, and (B) except to the extent that other persons will be distributees, (i) the insurance proceeds attributable to units and limited common elements that are not rebuilt shall be distributed to the owners of those units and the owners of the units to which those limited common elements were allocated, or to lien holders, as their interests may appear, and (ii) the remainder of the proceeds shall be distributed to all of the unit owners or lien holders, as their interests may appear, in proportion to the common expense liabilities of all of the units.\n\n(3) If the unit owners vote not to rebuild any unit, that unit's allocated interests are automatically reallocated on the vote as if the unit had been acquired by eminent domain under subsection (a) of section 47-206, and the association promptly shall prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations.\n\n(i) The provisions of this section may be varied or waived for (1) a common interest community all of whose units are restricted to nonresidential use, or (2) the units in a building in a common interest community if all of the units within that building are restricted to nonresidential use.\n\n(P.A. 83-474, S. 56, 96; P.A. 93-239, S. 11; P.A. 07-68, S. 3; P.A. 09-225, S. 29; P.A. 10-186, S. 12; P.A. 11-195, S. 5; P.A. 23-18, S. 4.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 93-239 amended Subsec.

      "text": "(a) The association has a statutory lien on a unit for any assessment attributable to that unit or fines imposed against its unit owner. Unless the declaration otherwise provides, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, other fees, charges, late charges, fines and interest charged pursuant to subdivisions (10), (11) and (12) of subsection (a) of section 47-244 and any other sums due to the association under the declaration, this chapter, or as a result of an administrative, arbitration, mediation or judicial decision, are enforceable in the same manner as unpaid assessments under this section. If an assessment is payable in installments, the full amount of the assessment is a lien from the time the first installment thereof becomes due.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding any provision in the declaration or bylaws to the contrary, a lien under this section is prior to all other liens and encumbrances on a unit except (1) liens and encumbrances recorded before the recordation of the declaration and, in a cooperative, liens and encumbrances which the association creates, assumes or takes subject to, (2) a first or second security interest on the unit recorded before the date on which the assessment sought to be enforced became delinquent, or, in a cooperative, a first or second security interest encumbering only the unit owner's interest and perfected before the date on which the assessment sought to be enforced became delinquent, and (3) liens for real property taxes and other governmental assessments or charges against the unit or cooperative. In all actions brought to foreclose a lien under this section or a security interest described in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the lien is also prior to all security interests described in subdivision (2) of this subsection to the extent of (A) an amount equal to the common expense assessments based on the periodic budget adopted by the association pursuant to subsection (a) of section 47-257 which would have become due in the absence of acceleration during the nine months immediately preceding institution of an action to enforce either the association's lien or a security interest described in subdivision (2) of this subsection, excluding any late fees, interest or fines which may be assessed by the association during the nine-month period, and (B) the association's costs and reasonable attorney's fees in enforcing its lien. A lien for any assessment or fine specified in subsection (a) of this section shall have the priority provided for in this subsection in an amount not to exceed the amount specified in subparagraph (A) of this subsection. This subsection does not affect the priority of mechanics' or materialmen's liens or the priority of liens for other assessments made by the association.\n\n(c) Unless the declaration otherwise provides, if two or more associations have liens for assessments created at any time on the same property, those liens have equal priority.\n\n(d) Recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien. No further recordation of any claim of lien for assessment under this section is required.\n\n(e) A lien for unpaid assessments is extinguished unless proceedings to enforce the lien are instituted within three years after the full amount of the assessments becomes due; provided, that if an owner of a unit subject to a lien under this section files a petition for relief under the United States Bankruptcy Code, the period of time for instituting proceedings to enforce the association's lien shall be tolled until thirty days after the automatic stay of proceedings under Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code is lifted.\n\n(f) This section does not prohibit actions against unit owners to recover sums for which subsection (a) of this section creates a lien or prohibit an association from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure.\n\n(g) A judgment or decree in any action brought under this section shall include costs and reasonable attorney's fees for the prevailing party.\n\n(h) The association on request made in a record shall furnish to a unit owner a statement in recordable form setting forth the amount of unpaid assessments against the unit. The statement shall be furnished within ten business days after receipt of the request and is binding on the association, the executive board and every unit owner.\n\n(i) In a cooperative, on nonpayment of an assessment on a unit, the unit owner may be evicted in the same manner as provided by law in the case of an unlawful holdover by a tenant, and the lien may be foreclosed as provided by this section.\n\n(j) The association's lien may be foreclosed in like manner as a mortgage on real property.\n\n(k) In any action by the association to collect assessments or to foreclose a lien for unpaid assessments, the court may appoint a receiver of the unit owner pursuant to section 52-504 to collect all sums alleged to be due from that unit owner prior to or during the pendency of the action. The court may order the receiver to pay any sums held by the receiver to the association during the pendency of the action to the extent of the association's common expense assessments based on a periodic budget adopted by the association pursuant to subsection (a) of section 47-257.\n\n(l) If a holder of a first or second security interest on a unit forecloses that security interest, the purchaser at the foreclosure sale is not liable for any unpaid assessments against that unit which became due before the sale, other than the assessments which are prior to that security interest under subsection (b) of this section. Any unpaid assessments not satisfied from the proceeds of sale become common expenses collectible from all unit owners, including the purchaser.\n\n(m) (1) An association may not commence an action to foreclose a lien on a unit under this section unless: (A) The unit owner, at the time the action is commenced, owes a sum equal to at least two months of common expense assessments based on the periodic budget last adopted by the association pursuant to subsection (a) of section 47-257; (B) the association has made a demand for payment in a record and has simultaneously provided a copy of such record to the holder of a security interest described in subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of this section; and (C) the executive board has either voted to commence a foreclosure action specifically against that unit or has adopted a standard policy that provides for foreclosure against that unit.\n\n(2) Not less than sixty days prior to commencing an action to foreclose a lien on a unit under this section, the association shall provide a written notice by first class mail to the holders of all security interests described in subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of this section, which shall set forth the following: (A) The amount of unpaid common expense assessments owed to the association as of the date of the notice; (B) the amount of any attorney's fees and costs incurred by the association in the enforcement of its lien as of the date of the notice; (C) a statement of the association's intention to foreclose its lien if the amounts set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this subdivision are not paid to the association not later than sixty days after the date on which the notice is provided; (D) the association's contact information, including, but not limited to, (i) the name of the individual acting on behalf of the association with respect to the matter, and (ii) the association's mailing address, telephone number and electronic mail address, if any; and (E) instructions concerning the acceptable means of making payment on the amounts owing to the association as set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this subdivision. Any notice required to be given by the association under this subsection shall be effective when sent.\n\n(3) When providing the written notice required by subdivision (2) of this subsection, the association may rely on the last-recorded security interest of record in identifying the name and mailing address of the holder of that interest, unless the holder of the security interest is the plaintiff in an action pending in the Superior Court to enforce that security interest, in which case the association shall provide the written notice to the attorney appearing on behalf of the holder of the security interest in such action.\n\n(4) The provision of the written notice required by subdivision (2) of this subsection shall not be deemed an unauthorized communication with a third party under the provisions of sections 36a-645 to 36a-648a, inclusive, or any regulations adopted thereunder.\n\n(5) The failure of the association to provide the written notice required by subdivision (2) of this subsection prior to commencing an action to foreclose its lien shall not affect the priority of its lien for an amount equal to nine months common expense assessments, but the priority amount in such action shall not include any costs or attorney's fees.\n\n(n) Every aspect of a foreclosure, sale or other disposition under this section, including the method, advertising, time, date, place and terms, shall be commercially reasonable.\n\n(P.A. 83-474, S. 59, 96; P.A. 84-472, S. 16, 23; P.A. 89-254, S. 14; P.A. 91-341, S. 15, 19; 91-359, S. 1, 2; P.A. 95-187, S. 22; P.A. 09-225, S. 32; P.A. 10-186, S. 13; P.A. 13-156, S. 1, 2; P.A. 23-119, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 84-472 amended Subsec.

(a) to substitute “attributable to” for “levied against” re any assessment, add reasonable attorneys' fees and costs and any other sums due the association under the declaration, this chapter or as result of administrative, arbitration, mediation or judicial decision, and substitute “enforceable in the same manner as unpaid assessments” for “enforceable as assessments”, substituted “three years” for “two years” in Subsec.
