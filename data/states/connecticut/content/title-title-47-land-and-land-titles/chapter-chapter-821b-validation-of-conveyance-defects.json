The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to any conveyance where any deed, mortgage, lease, release, assignment or other instrument is executed by a fiduciary and the fiduciary is the grantee, mortgagee, leasee, releasee or assignee designated in such instrument.\n\n(d) Defect where fiduciary conveyed to self. Any recorded deed, mortgage, lease, release, assignment or other instrument made for the purpose of conveying, leasing, mortgaging or affecting any interest in real property in this state, which instrument is executed by a fiduciary, but which instrument is voidable because the fiduciary is the grantee, mortgagee, leasee, releasee or assignee designated in such instrument, is as valid as if it had been executed without the defect unless an action is commenced to avoid and set aside such instrument and a notice of lis pendens is recorded in the land records of the town or towns where the instrument is recorded within ten years from the date of recording of such instrument.\n\n(e) Defect with respect to conveyance by fiduciary.
