At least sixty per cent of the eligible children enrolled in an early care and education program receiving financial assistance under Early Start CT shall be members of a family that is at or below seventy-five per cent of the state median income. No such financial assistance shall be available to (1) any such child care center, group child care home or family child care home unless such center or home has been licensed by the Commissioner of Early Childhood pursuant to section 19a-80 or 19a-87b, or (2) any such local or regional board of education or regional educational service center unless the preschool program is approved by the Department of Education.
