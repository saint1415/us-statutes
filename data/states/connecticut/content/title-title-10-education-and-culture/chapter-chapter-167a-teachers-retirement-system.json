      "text": "(a)(1) An active member is eligible for a disability allowance if he or she has (A) become disabled as a result of any sickness or injury incurred in the performance of his or her duty as a teacher, without regard to the member's accumulated years of service at the time the disability is incurred; or (B) accumulated at least five years of service in the public schools and becomes disabled, without regard to whether the disability was incurred in the performance of his or her duty as a teacher.\n\n(2) Any active member seeking a disability allowance shall submit to the board a formal application for disability allowance, which shall include the following: (A) The member's application; (B) the member's birth certificate or, in lieu thereof, a notarized statement supported by other evidence satisfactory to the board; (C) records of service, if such records are required by the board to determine a salary rate or years of creditable service; (D) a physician's statement of health for the member, including, but not limited to, medical reports and office notes from such physician; (E) in the case of a member who is married, a marriage certificate; (F) an employer's statement regarding work performance, attendance records and any other information regarding the member's disability; (G) the member's statement outlining the effect his or her impairment has on the ability to perform the duties of his or her occupation; and (H) any other documentation required by the board. For any formal application for disability allowance filed on or after July 1, 1986, upon a finding by the board that extenuating circumstances relating to the health of an active member caused a delay in the filing of such member's complete formal application for disability allowance, the board may deem such application to have been filed up to three months earlier than the actual date of such filing.\n\n(b) The disability allowance is computed as follows: Two per cent times credited service to the date of disability multiplied by average annual salary, provided such allowance shall not be less than fifteen per cent or more than fifty per cent of the member's average annual salary. In no case shall such disability allowance, less cost of living adjustments, plus any initial award of Social Security benefits and workers' compensation, exceed seventy-five per cent of the member's average annual salary.\n\n(c) The board shall designate a medical committee to be composed of no more than five physicians. If required, other physicians may be employed to report on special cases. Such medical committee shall review each application for a disability allowance and shall make findings and recommendations in writing to the board. The medical committee shall perform additional examinations or case reviews as deemed necessary by the board. Members of such committee shall receive compensation for their services at a rate to be determined by the board.\n\n(d) The disability allowance being paid to a member shall cease when and if the disability ends. The board may determine that a member's disability has ended if it finds, upon the recommendation of its medical committee, that the member has failed to pursue an appropriate program of treatment. In either event, such member shall receive credited service for the years he received such disability allowance subject to a maximum total credit of thirty years, or actual years of credited service to the date the disability commenced, whichever is greater. Such member, if eligible, may then (1) retire on a normal, early or proratable retirement benefit, or (2) retain a vested right to a deferred normal, early or proratable retirement benefit. Upon attainment of the member's normal retirement date, as determined by his age and credited service, including the credited service granted by this subsection, the member's disability allowance shall convert to a normal or other service retirement, which shall be payable either in the normal form or under an optional payment form under section 10-183j. The board may require periodic medical examinations.\n\n(e) No credit for a period of service of any kind prior to the months in which contribution therefor is made shall be given under this chapter or any special act in determining service in connection with an application for disability allowance other than for injury received in performance of duty as a teacher if such disability occurred within five years after contributions and required interest on account of such period were paid in full. The foregoing limitation shall not apply to (1) any reinstatement of prior Connecticut teaching service, or (2) credit obtained immediately after transfer from the state employees retirement system under this chapter for service previously credited in said system; but in the case of such transfer, no allowance on account of disability occurring within such five-year period, other than for injury received in performance of duty as a teacher, shall exceed the benefit which would have been payable by said system if transfer had not been made.\n\n(f) During the first twenty-four months of payment of the disability allowance to a member, twenty per cent of all of such member's outside earned income or wages shall be offset against the disability allowance payable, unless the board determines that such earned income or wages are being paid as part of the rehabilitation of the member. At the expiration of such twenty-four-month period, if the total of the disability allowance and outside earned income exceeds one hundred per cent of average annual salary, the disability allowance will be reduced by the amount of such excess over one hundred per cent. The board shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, concerning procedures for verification of the income of members in receipt of a disability allowance.\n\n(g) All members of the teachers' retirement system who are receiving disability payments under subsection (e) of section 10-183g of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to 1979, may, using a form provided by the board, elect to have their disability payments recomputed with regard to the percentage basis and pursuant to the provisions of this section and section 10-183bb. Such election shall not be revocable.\n\n(h) For purposes of this section, “active member” means a member who (1) is actively employed as a teacher at the time the member submits an application for disability benefits, or (2) was actively employed as a teacher not more than ninety days before the date the member submitted his or her application for disability benefits.\n\n(P.A. 79-541, S. 2, 4, 6; P.A. 83-449, S. 4, 5; P.A. 89-276, S. 2, 3; P.A. 93-353, S. 46, 52; P.A. 21-186, S. 8; P.A. 22-118, S. 184.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 83-449 changed “disability retirement allowance” to “disability allowance”, amended Subsec. (b) to repeal provision that in no case shall allowance exceed 75% of average annual salary plus social security benefits and workers' compensation and substituted provision that in no case shall allowance “less cost of living adjustments, plus any initial award of social security benefits and workers' compensation” exceed 75% of average annual salary, amended Subsec.

The inclusion in annual salary of amounts paid to the member, in lieu of payment by the employer for the cost of benefits, insurance, or individual retirement arrangements which in prior years had been paid by the employer and not included in the member's annual salary, shall be prima facie evidence that such amounts are included for the purpose of inflating the member's average annual salary.

Such cost of living allowance shall be computed on the basis of the retirement benefits to which such retired member or successor beneficiary was entitled on the last day of the preceding December or June except benefits based upon one per cent or voluntary contributions. Such member's successor beneficiary means any person, other than such member, receiving benefits as the result of the election of a period certain option or a coparticipant option, including an election for such an option by a surviving spouse under subsection (d) of section 10-183h.

If on any subsequent first day of January or July the Teacher's Retirement Board determines that the National Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers for the twelve-month period ending on the last day of the preceding November or May has increased less than the cost of living allowance provided under this subsection, the cost of living allowance provided by this subsection shall be adjusted to reflect the change in such index provided such cost of living allowance shall not be less than three per cent.\n\n(k)Cost of living allowance for members retiring on or after September 1, 1992.Beginning the first day of January or July which follows nine months in retirement, a retired member who retired on or after September 1, 1992, or a member's successor beneficiary, except a person receiving survivor's benefits, shall be eligible for an annual cost of living allowance calculated in accordance with the provisions of subsections (l) or (m) of this section on any benefit except a benefit based upon such member's one per cent contributions or voluntary contributions. Such cost of living allowance shall be computed on the basis of the retirement benefits to which such retired member or successor beneficiary was entitled on the last day of the preceding December or June except benefits based upon one per cent or voluntary contributions.

The cost of living allowance shall be calculated by using the percentage cost of living adjustment granted by the Social Security Administration for the applicable year, computed on the basis of the retirement benefits to which such retired member or successor beneficiary was entitled on the last day of the preceding December or June except benefits based upon one per cent or voluntary contributions, provided no cost of living allowance shall exceed six per cent and provided further, if the total return earned by the trustees on the market value of the pension assets for the preceding fiscal year is less than six and nine-tenths per cent, any cost of living allowance granted shall not exceed one and one-half per cent.\n\n(2) A member entering the retirement system commencing on or after July 1, 2007, or such member's successor beneficiary, except a person receiving survivor's benefits, shall, beginning the first day of January or July that follows nine months in retirement, be eligible for an annual cost of living allowance as follows: The cost of living allowance shall be calculated by using the percentage cost of living adjustment granted by the Social Security Administration for the applicable year, computed on the basis of the retirement benefits to which such retired member or successor beneficiary was entitled on the last day of the preceding December or June, as applicable, except benefits based upon one per cent or voluntary contributions, provided (A) no cost of living allowance shall exceed five per cent, and (B) if the total return earned by the trustees on the market value of the pension assets for the preceding fiscal year is less than six and nine-tenths per cent, any cost of living allowance granted shall not exceed one per cent, if such total return for the preceding fiscal year is greater than six and nine-tenths per cent but less than nine and nine-tenths per cent, any cost of living allowance granted shall not exceed three per cent, and if such return exceeds nine and nine-tenths per cent, any cost of living allowance granted shall not exceed five per cent.\n\n(m)Proportionate reduction of cost of living allowance.Repealed by P.A. 07-186, S. 14.\n\n(n)Cost of living adjustment reserve account.Repealed by P.A. 07-186, S. 14.\n\n(o)Single increase in benefits on January 1, 1988.On January 1, 1988, each eligible retired member who had rendered at least twenty-five years of full-time service prior to normal retirement under the provisions of subsection (a) of section 10-183f, or such member's successor beneficiary, as defined in subsection (j) of this section, shall receive a single increase in retirement benefits provided under this chapter. Such increase shall be paid to such eligible members or successor beneficiaries whose monthly benefit as of December 31, 1987, before any reduction for an optional benefit payment plan, is less than eight hundred dollars, and shall be sufficient to increase such monthly benefit to eight hundred dollars.\n\n(p)Single increase in benefits on January 1, 1991.On January 1, 1991, each eligible retired member who had rendered at least twenty-five years of full-time service at least twenty years of which were service in the public schools of Connecticut prior to early retirement before January 1, 1976, under the provisions of subsection (c) of section 10-183f, or such member's successor beneficiary, as defined in subsection (j) of this section, shall receive a single increase in retirement benefits provided under this chapter.

The board may offer one or more basic plans, the cost of which to any such member, spouse, surviving spouse or disabled dependent shall be one-third of the basic plan's premium equivalent, and one or more optional plans, provided such member, spouse, surviving spouse or disabled dependent shall pay one-third of the basic plan's premium equivalent plus the difference in cost between any such basic plans and any such optional plans. The board shall designate those plans which are basic and those plans which are optional for the purpose of determining such cost and the amount to be charged or withheld from benefit payments for such plans. The surviving spouse of a member, or a disabled dependent of a member if there is no surviving spouse, shall not be ineligible for participation in any such plan solely because such surviving spouse or disabled dependent is not receiving benefits from the system. With respect to any person participating in any such plan, the state shall appropriate to the board one-third of the cost of such basic plan or plans, or one-third of the cost of the rate in effect during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1998, whichever is greater.\n\n(b) (1) Any member who (A) is receiving retirement benefits or a disability allowance from the system, the spouse or surviving spouse of such member, or a disabled dependent of such member if there is no spouse or surviving spouse, and who is not participating in Medicare Part A hospital insurance and Medicare Part B medical insurance, and (B) meets the state's eligibility criteria for health insurance or is eligible to participate in the group health insurance plan offered by such member's last employing board of education, may fully participate in any or all group health insurance plans maintained for active teachers by such member's last employing board of education, or by the state in the case of a member who was employed by the state, upon payment to such board of education or to the state, as applicable, by such member, spouse, surviving spouse or disabled dependent, of the premium charged for the member's form of coverage. Such premium shall be no greater than that charged for the same form of coverage for active teachers.\n\n(2) The member's spouse, surviving spouse or disabled dependent shall not be ineligible for participation in any such plan solely because such spouse, surviving spouse or disabled dependent is not receiving benefits from the system. No person shall be ineligible for participation in such plans for failure to enroll in such plans at the time the member's retirement benefit or disability allowance became effective.\n\n(3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impair or alter the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement relating to the payment by a board of education of group health insurance premiums on behalf of any member receiving benefits from the system. Prior to the cancellation of coverage for any member, spouse, surviving spouse or disabled dependent for failure to pay the required premiums or cost due, the board of education or the state, if applicable, shall notify the Teachers' Retirement Board of its intention to cancel such coverage at least thirty days prior to the date of cancellation. Absent any contractual provisions to the contrary, the payments made pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall be first applied to any cost borne by the member, spouse, surviving spouse or disabled dependent participating in any such plan.\n\n(4) As used in this subsection, “last employing board of education” means the board of education by which such member was employed when such member filed his or her initial application for retirement, and “health insurance plans” means hospital, medical, major medical, dental, prescription drug or auditory benefit plans that are available to active teachers.\n\n(c) (1) On and after July 1, 2022, the board shall pay a subsidy of two hundred twenty dollars, to the board of education or to the state, if applicable, on behalf of any member who is receiving retirement benefits or a disability allowance from the system, the spouse of such member, the surviving spouse of such member, or a disabled dependent of such member if there is no spouse or surviving spouse, who is participating in a health insurance plan maintained by a board of education or by the state, if applicable. Such payment shall not exceed the actual cost of such insurance.\n\n(2) With respect to any person participating in any such plan pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the state shall appropriate to the board one-third of the cost of the subsidy, except that, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, the state shall appropriate twenty-five per cent of the cost of the subsidy. On and after July 1, 2018, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, and for each fiscal year thereafter, fifty per cent of the total amount appropriated by the state in each such fiscal year for the state's share of the cost of such subsidies shall be paid to the board on or before July first of such fiscal year, and the remaining fifty per cent of such total amount shall be paid to the board on or before December first of such fiscal year.\n\n(3) No payment to a board of education pursuant to this subsection may be used to reduce the amount of any premium payment on behalf of any such member, spouse, surviving spouse, or disabled dependent, made by such board pursuant to any agreement in effect on July 1, 1990. On and after July 1, 2022, the board shall pay a subsidy of four hundred forty dollars per month on behalf of the member, spouse or the surviving spouse of such member who: (A) Has attained the normal retirement age to participate in Medicare, (B) is not eligible for Medicare Part A without cost, and (C) contributes at least four hundred forty dollars per month towards his or her medical and prescription drug plan provided by the board of education.\n\n(d) The Treasurer shall establish a separate retired teachers' health insurance premium account within the Teachers' Retirement Fund. Commencing July 1, 1989, and annually thereafter all health benefit plan contributions withheld under this chapter in excess of five hundred thousand dollars shall, upon deposit in the Teachers' Retirement Fund, be credited to such account. Interest derived from the investment of funds in the account shall be credited to the account. Funds in the account shall be used for (1) payments to boards of education pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and for payment of premiums on behalf of members, spouses of members, surviving spouses of members or disabled dependents of members participating in one or more health insurance plans pursuant to subsection (a) of this section in an amount equal to the difference between the amount paid pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and the amount paid pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, and (2) payments for professional fees associated with the administration of the health benefit plans offered pursuant to this section. If, during any fiscal year, there are insufficient funds in the account for the purposes of all such payments, the General Assembly shall appropriate sufficient funds to the account for such purpose.\n\n(e) (1) Not later than the first business day of February, May, August and November of each year, each employer shall submit to the board, in a format required by the board, any information the board determines to be necessary concerning additions, deletions and premium changes for the health insurance subsidy program described in subsection (c) of this section. Any report received by the board after the due date shall be processed in the following quarterly cycle. An employer's failure to timely submit a quarterly report shall result in a delay of the subsidy for that quarter and the board shall pay the subsidy as a retroactive subsidy, as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n(2) Retroactive subsidy payments shall be limited to six months prior to the first day of the month in which the board receives an untimely report that includes newly eligible retired members or dependents. The board shall pay the subsidy retroactively to the effective date of the disability, provided any eligible members or dependents are added to the report not later than the first quarter following the board's approval of the disability and the member's disability allowance is initiated within four months of board approval. The employer shall hold any member or dependent harmless for any costs associated with, arising from or out of the loss of the benefit of the subsidy as a result of the employer's untimely or inaccurate filing of the quarterly report.\n\n(P.A. 78-208, S. 19, 35; 78-228, S. 5, 8; P.A. 79-625, S. 5, 6; P.A. 84-451, S. 2; May Sp.

      "text": "(a)(1) There is established the Connecticut Teachers' Retirement Fund Bonds Special Capital Reserve Fund. The purpose of the fund shall be to provide, and it is determined that such fund does provide, adequate provision for the protection of the holders of bonds of the state issued pursuant to section 10-183qq and any bonds refunding such bonds. The fund shall secure the payment of the principal of and interest on such bonds and shall be held in trust for the benefit of the holders of the bonds secured thereby, separate and apart from other funds of the state.\n\n(2) The fund established pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection shall contain (A) any moneys required by law to be deposited in the fund, including, but not limited to, deposits from the Connecticut Lottery Corporation in accordance with section 12-812, and (B) any financial guaranty or guaranties obtained by the Treasurer for purposes of the fund, which may include any letter of credit, surety bond, insurance policy, guaranty or similar instrument, issued by a bond or insurance company or other financial institution that has a long-term rating within the top two rating categories of at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization at the time of issuance of such financial guaranty, as determined by the Treasurer to be in the best interest of the state. Such financial guaranty shall be in a form prescribed by the Treasurer, valued at par and payable or available to be drawn upon on or before any date by which debt service on the bonds secured thereby is required to be paid. In connection with such financial guaranty, the Treasurer may enter into any other necessary or appropriate agreements on behalf of the state, including intercreditor provisions if there is more than one financial guaranty. The Treasurer may pledge the full faith and credit of the state, and pledge the moneys required to be deposited in the fund to the state's payment obligations under any agreement entered into pursuant to this subdivision. As part of the contract of the state with the other parties to any agreement entered into pursuant to this subdivision for which the full faith and credit of the state is pledged to the state's payment obligations under such agreement, appropriation of all amounts necessary for the punctual payment of the obligations of the state under any such agreement is hereby made and the Treasurer shall pay such amounts as the same become due. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the costs of any agreement entered into pursuant to this subdivision may be paid from amounts in the fund.\n\n(3) The Superior Court shall have jurisdiction to enter judgment against the state founded upon any agreement entered into pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection. Any action brought under this subdivision shall be brought in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford. The jurisdiction conferred on the Superior Court by this subdivision includes any set-off, claim or demand on the part of the state against any plaintiff commencing an action under this subdivision. Such action shall be tried to the court without a jury. All legal defenses, except governmental immunity, shall be reserved to the state. Any action brought under this subdivision shall be privileged in respect to assignment for trial upon motion of either party.\n\n(4) After obtaining a financial guaranty or guaranties pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection, if the moneys deposited in the fund, together with the amount available under such financial guaranty or guaranties, exceeds the required minimum capital reserve, the amount of such excess may be released as provided in subsection (d) of this section. It is determined that the Connecticut Teachers' Retirement Fund Bonds Special Capital Reserve Fund, if so funded in whole or in part by such a financial guaranty or guaranties, continues to provide, and does provide, adequate provision for the protection of the holders of bonds of the state issued pursuant to section 10-183qq and any bonds refunding such bonds.\n\n(5) During any period when any bonds secured by the fund remain outstanding, amounts on deposit in the fund or available under a financial guaranty shall not be commingled with other state funds and the state shall have no claim to or against, or interest in, the fund, except as hereinafter provided. Amounts in such fund shall be deposited in a separate account or accounts in a trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within the state, which shall serve as the trustee of the fund. The Treasurer shall enter into an agreement with such trust company or bank in accordance with the provisions of this section, sections 10-183b, 10-183z, 10-183ww, 12-801, 12-806 and 12-812 and section 90 of public act 19-117*.\n\n(b) The moneys held in the Connecticut Teachers' Retirement Fund Bonds Special Capital Reserve Fund or available under a financial guaranty, except as provided in this section, shall be pledged to payment on bonds secured by the fund and shall be used solely for the payment of the principal of bonds secured by the fund as such bonds become due by reason of maturity or sinking fund redemption, the purchase of such bonds, the payment of interest on such bonds and the payment of any redemption premium required to be paid when such bonds are redeemed prior to maturity. In the event the state has not otherwise timely made available moneys to pay principal or interest due on such bonds, the Treasurer shall direct the trustee of the fund to transfer from the fund to the paying agent for such bonds, or draw under such financial guaranty, to the extent available therefor, the amount necessary to timely pay such principal or interest then due. Except for the payment of the principal of bonds secured by the fund as such bonds become due and the payment of interest on such bonds, no moneys shall be withdrawn from the fund in such amount as would reduce the total amount on deposit in the fund plus the amount available under a financial guaranty or guaranties to less than the required minimum capital reserve. The pledge made by the state pursuant to this section shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made. The lien of such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the state, irrespective of whether the parties have notice of the claims. Notwithstanding any provision of the Uniform Commercial Code, no instrument by which such pledge is created need be recorded or filed. Any moneys so pledged and later received by the state shall be subject immediately to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act and such lien shall have priority over all other liens. For the purpose of evaluation of such fund, obligations acquired as an investment shall be valued at market. For purposes of this section, “required minimum capital reserve” means the maximum amount of principal and interest becoming due on bonds of the state issued pursuant to section 10-183qq, and any bonds refunding such bonds then outstanding, by reason of maturity or a required sinking fund installment in any succeeding fiscal year.\n\n(c) The amounts payable from the Connecticut Lottery Corporation into such fund as provided in section 12-812 shall be sufficient for the payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds secured by the Connecticut Teachers' Retirement Fund Bonds Special Capital Reserve Fund when due, whether at maturity or by mandatory sinking fund installments.\n\n(d) The Treasurer shall certify to the Governor, the Teachers' Retirement Board and the president of the Connecticut Lottery Corporation whenever the total amount on deposit in the Connecticut Teachers' Retirement Fund Bonds Special Capital Reserve Fund plus the amount available under a financial guaranty or guaranties exceeds the required minimum capital reserve and then shall direct the trustee for the fund to remit to the Treasurer for deposit into the Connecticut Baby Bond Trust, established under section 3-36b, any such excess amount.\n\n(e) The Connecticut Teachers' Retirement Fund Bonds Special Capital Reserve Fund shall terminate and, after payment of any payment obligations under any agreement entered into pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, upon direction of the Treasurer, any moneys remaining therein shall be transferred to the Connecticut Baby Bond Trust: (1) Upon payment in full of the principal and interest on all bonds secured by the fund; (2) if there has been deposited in an irrevocable trust for the benefit of the holders of the bonds secured by the fund either (A) moneys in an amount that shall be sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of and interest on such bonds, and any redemption premium required to be paid when such bonds are redeemed prior to maturity, or (B) noncallable and nonprepayable direct obligations of, or obligations the timely payment of principal of and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States of America, the principal of and the interest on which when due, without reinvestment, will provide moneys that together with the moneys, if any, deposited with the trustee at the same time, shall be sufficient to pay when due the principal of and interest on such bonds, and any redemption premium required to be paid when such bonds are redeemed prior to maturity; or (3) if the amount of the annual required contribution to the fund for the Connecticut teachers' retirement system is determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of section 10-183land section 10-183z, as such sections were in effect on April 30, 2008. The Treasurer shall direct the trustee of the Connecticut Teachers' Retirement Fund Bonds Special Capital Reserve Fund to enter into such contract with the trustee of the Connecticut Baby Bond Trust as the Treasurer deems necessary or appropriate to provide for such transfer so as to protect the interest of beneficiaries of the Connecticut Baby Bond Trust, subject to the use of amounts in the Connecticut Teachers' Retirement Fund Bonds Special Capital Reserve Fund for purposes of paying principal and interest on bonds secured by the fund.\n\n(f) Pending the use or application of amounts in the fund, moneys in the fund may be invested and reinvested at the direction of the Treasurer in such obligations, securities and investments as are set forth in subsection (f) of section 3-20 and in participation certificates in the Short Term Investment Fund created under section 3-27a.\n\n(g) The state pledges to the holders of the bonds of the state issued pursuant to section 10-183qq, and any bonds refunding such bonds, that the state shall not limit or alter the rights of such holders under this section or reduce the transfer or deposit of moneys into the fund pursuant to section 10-183ww or section 12-812 until all such bonds are fully paid or until provision for the payment of such bonds has been made as provided in subdivision (2) of subsection (e) of this section, provided nothing contained in this section shall preclude such limitation, alteration or reduction if adequate provision is made by law for the protection of the holders of such bonds.\n\n(P.A. 19-117, S. 82; P.A. 23-204, S. 148.)\n\n*Note: Section 90 of public act 19-117 is special in nature and therefore has not been codified but remains in full force and effect according to its terms.\n\nHistory: P.A. 19-117 effective June 26, 2019; P.A. 23-204 amended Subsec. (a) by dividing provisions into subdivisions, deleting provision re contents of fund in Subdiv. (1), adding Subdivs. (2) to (4) and adding provision re financial guaranty in Subdiv. (5), amended Subsec. (b) by adding provisions re financial guaranty, amended Subsec. (d) by adding provision re financial guaranty and remitting excess to Connecticut Baby Bond Trust instead of General Fund, and amended Subsec. (e) by adding provision re payment obligation under agreement entered into under Subsec. (a), replacing reference to Budget Reserve Fund with Connecticut Baby Bond Trust, deleting Subdiv. (4) and adding provision re contract with trustee of Connecticut Baby Bond Trust, effective June 12, 2023.",

      "text": "(a) The retirement system for teachers shall be funded on an actuarial reserve basis. The retirement board shall, on or before December first, annually, certify to the General Assembly the amount necessary, on the basis of an actuarial determination, to establish and maintain the retirement fund on such determined actuarial reserve basis and make such other recommendations with regard to the fund and its administration as the board deems necessary. On the basis of each evaluation, the retirement board shall redetermine the normal rate of contribution and, until it is amortized, the unfunded past service liability. The General Assembly shall review the board's recommendations and certification and shall appropriate to the retirement fund the amount certified by the retirement board as necessary, provided said certification is in compliance with this section. On and after the effective date of this section, no public or special act of the General Assembly shall reduce such appropriation to an amount below such amount certified unless the Governor declares an emergency or the existence of extraordinary circumstances, in which the provisions of section 4-85 are invoked, and at least three-fifths of the members of each chamber of the General Assembly vote to reduce such appropriation during the biennium for which the emergency or existence of extraordinary circumstances is declared. The amount appropriated by the General Assembly shall be deposited by the Treasurer into the retirement fund in quarterly allotments on July fifteenth, October first, January first and April first.\n\n(b) The board shall determine on an actuarial basis (1) a normal rate of contribution which the state shall be required to make into the retirement fund in order to meet the actuarial cost of current service and (2) the unfunded past service liability. In making such determination the board shall assume that the annual rate of interest earned by the funds of the system invested by the State Treasurer pursuant to section 10-183m equals the total assumed rate of return adopted by the board under the provisions of section 10-183nn. For the first eight years, the funding program for the actuarial reserve basis shall consist of the following percentages of the sum of normal cost and the amount required for a forty-year amortization of unfunded liabilities, provided, if in any such year the amount required to be paid by this section is less than the amount which would be required to fund the system on a terminal basis and to pay the annual cost of benefits payable under subsection (j) of section 10-183g or under other prior legislative adjustments to retirement benefits, the state shall pay the greater amount:\n\nFISCAL YEARBEGINNINGPERCENTAGE TO BE PAID OF NORMAL COSTPLUS FULL FORTY-YEAR AMORTIZATIONFROM THE BEGINNINGOF SUCH FISCAL YEAR7-1-85657-1-86707-1-87757-1-88807-1-89857-1-90907-1-91957-1-92100\n\nCommencing with the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, and through the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, the unfunded liability shall be amortized over a period of forty years. Commencing with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020, the unfunded liability as of June 30, 2018, shall be separately amortized over a closed period of thirty years and future actuarial gains and losses shall be amortized over separate closed periods of twenty-five years, beginning the year each separate base is established. The phrase “fund the system on a terminal basis” means contribution by the state of such moneys as are certified by the Teachers' Retirement Board as necessary, according to the mortality table adopted yearly, for the full reserve for pensions for retiring teachers provided under sections 10-183f, 10-183j and 10-183aa, but not such moneys as are necessary to make payments under subsection (j) of section 10-183g or under other prior legislative amendments to retirement benefits.\n\n(c) No act liberalizing the benefits of the retirement system shall be enacted by the General Assembly until the assembly has requested and received from the retirement board a certification of the unfunded liability created by such change and the cost of such change under the actuarial funding basis adopted by section 10-183b. Any unfunded liability created by such change shall be amortized over a period consistent with actuarial recommendations approved by the retirement board.\n\n(d) The funds of the teachers' retirement system, except the expense fund, shall not be reduced or used for other than the purposes of said system.\n\n(P.A. 79-436, S. 3, 5, 6; P.A. 80-273, S. 1, 2; P.A. 85-594, S. 2, 4; 85-613, S. 22, 154; P.A. 89-333, S. 1, 2; P.A. 92-205, S. 9, 12; May Sp.

(c) to delete “and this section using full normal cost plus thirty-year amortization” and replace provision re thirty-year amortization period with provision re period consistent with actuarial recommendations approved by the retirement board, and made technical changes, effective on the date the Treasurer certifies, pursuant to section 10-183vv, that the amount on deposit in the Connecticut Teachers' Retirement Fund Bonds Special Capital Reserve Fund equals or exceeds the required minimum capital reserve, as defined in said section.",
