Such grant shall be calculated using the data of record as of the December first prior to the fiscal year such grant is to be paid, adjusted for the difference between the final entitlement for the prior fiscal year and the preliminary entitlement for such fiscal year as calculated using the data of record as of the December first prior to the fiscal year when such grant was paid.\n\n(b) The amount due each town pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall be paid by the Comptroller, upon certification of the Commissioner of Education, to the treasurer of each town entitled to such aid in installments during the fiscal year as follows: Twenty-five per cent of the grant in October, twenty-five per cent of the grant in January and the balance of the grant in April. The balance of the grant due towns under the provisions of this subsection shall be paid in March rather than April to any town which has not adopted the uniform fiscal year and which would not otherwise receive such final payment within the fiscal year of such town.\n\n(c) All aid distributed to a town pursuant to the provisions of this section and section 10-262u shall be expended for educational purposes only and shall be expended upon the authorization of the local or regional board of education and in accordance with the provisions of section 10-262u. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1999, and each fiscal year thereafter, if a town receives an increase in funds pursuant to this section over the amount it received for the prior fiscal year, such increase shall not be used to supplant local funding for educational purposes. The budgeted appropriation for education in any town receiving an increase in funds pursuant to this section shall be not less than the amount appropriated for education for the prior year plus such increase in funds.\n\n(d) For any fiscal year, (1) if the amount of the equalization aid grant a town is entitled to pursuant to section 10-262h is greater than such town's equalization aid grant amount for the prior fiscal year, the difference between the amount of such town's equalization aid grant for the fiscal year, and such town's equalization aid grant amount for the prior fiscal year shall be the aid increase for such town for the fiscal year, and (2) if the amount of the equalization aid grant a town is entitled to pursuant to section 10-262h is less than such town's equalization aid grant amount for the prior fiscal year, the difference between such town's equalization aid grant amount for the prior fiscal year and the amount of such town's equalization aid grant for the fiscal year shall be the aid reduction for such town for the fiscal year.\n\n(e) Upon a determination by the State Board of Education that a town or kindergarten to grade twelve, inclusive, regional school district failed in any fiscal year to meet the requirements pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) of this section or section 10-262j, the town or kindergarten to grade twelve, inclusive, regional school district shall forfeit an amount equal to two times the amount of the shortfall. The amount so forfeited shall be withheld by the Department of Education from the grant payable to the town in the second fiscal year immediately following such failure by deducting such amount from the town's equalization aid grant payment pursuant to this section, except that in the case of a kindergarten to grade twelve, inclusive, regional school district, the amount so forfeited shall be withheld by the Department of Education from the grants payable pursuant to this section to the towns which are members of such regional school district. The amounts deducted from such grants to each member town shall be proportional to the number of resident students in each member town. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the State Board of Education may waive such forfeiture upon agreement with the town or kindergarten to grade twelve, inclusive, regional school district that the town or kindergarten to grade twelve, inclusive, regional school district shall increase its budgeted appropriation for education during the fiscal year in which the forfeiture would occur by an amount not less than the amount of said forfeiture or for other good cause shown. Any additional funds budgeted pursuant to such an agreement shall not be included in a district's budgeted appropriation for education for the purpose of establishing any future minimum budget requirement.\n\n(P.A. 88-358, S. 3, 9; P.A. 89-124, S. 5, 13; P.A. 98-168, S. 16, 26; P.A. 05-245, S. 31; P.A. 06-13, S. 6; June Sp.

      "text": "(a) The Department of Education shall, within available appropriations, establish a grant program (1) to assist (A) local and regional boards of education, (B) regional educational service centers, (C) the Board of Trustees of the Community-Technical Colleges on behalf of Quinebaug Valley Community College and Three Rivers Community College, and (D) cooperative arrangements pursuant to section 10-158a, and (2) in assisting the state in meeting its obligations pursuant to the decision in Sheff v. O'Neill, 238 Conn. 1 (1996), or any related stipulation or order in effect, as determined by the commissioner, to assist (A) the Board of Trustees of the Community-Technical Colleges on behalf of a regional community-technical college, (B) the Board of Trustees of the Connecticut State University System on behalf of a state university, (C) the Board of Trustees of The University of Connecticut on behalf of the university, (D) the board of governors for an independent institution of higher education, as defined in subsection (a) of section 10a-173, or the equivalent of such a board, on behalf of the independent institution of higher education, and (E) any other third-party not-for-profit corporation approved by the commissioner with the operation of interdistrict magnet school programs. All interdistrict magnet schools shall be operated in conformance with the same laws and regulations applicable to public schools. For the purposes of this section “an interdistrict magnet school program” means a program which (i) supports racial, ethnic and economic diversity, (ii) offers a special and high quality curriculum, and (iii) requires students who are enrolled to attend at least half-time. An interdistrict magnet school program does not include a regional agricultural science and technology school, a technical education and career school or a regional special education center. For the school year commencing July 1, 2017, and each school year thereafter, the governing authority for each interdistrict magnet school program shall (I) restrict the number of students that may enroll in the school from a participating district to seventy-five per cent of the total school enrollment, and (II) maintain a total school enrollment that is in accordance with the reduced-isolation setting standards for interdistrict magnet school programs, developed by the Commissioner of Education pursuant to section 10-264r.\n\n(b) (1) Applications for interdistrict magnet school program operating grants awarded pursuant to this section shall be submitted annually to the Commissioner of Education at such time and in such manner as the commissioner prescribes, except that on and after July 1, 2009, applications for such operating grants for new interdistrict magnet schools, other than those that the commissioner determines will assist the state in meeting its obligations pursuant to the decision in Sheff v. O'Neill, 238 Conn. 1 (1996), or any related stipulation or order in effect, as determined by the commissioner, shall not be accepted until the commissioner develops a comprehensive state-wide interdistrict magnet school plan. The commissioner shall submit such comprehensive state-wide interdistrict magnet school plan on or before October 1, 2016, to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to education and appropriations.\n\n(2) In determining whether an application shall be approved and funds awarded pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall consider, but such consideration shall not be limited to: (A) Whether the program offered by the school is likely to increase student achievement; (B) whether the program is likely to reduce racial, ethnic and economic isolation; (C) the percentage of the student enrollment in the program from each participating district; and (D) the proposed operating budget and the sources of funding for the interdistrict magnet school. For a magnet school not operated by a local or regional board of education, the commissioner shall only approve a proposed operating budget that, on a per pupil basis, does not exceed the maximum allowable threshold established in accordance with this subdivision. The maximum allowable threshold shall be an amount equal to one hundred twenty per cent of the state average of the quotient obtained by dividing net current expenditures, as defined in section 10-261, by average daily membership, as defined in said section, for the fiscal year two years prior to the fiscal year for which the operating grant is requested. The Department of Education shall establish the maximum allowable threshold no later than December fifteenth of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year for which the operating grant is requested. If requested by an applicant that is not a local or regional board of education, the commissioner may approve a proposed operating budget that exceeds the maximum allowable threshold if the commissioner determines that there are extraordinary programmatic needs. For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2017, June 30, 2018, June 30, 2020, and June 30, 2021, in the case of an interdistrict magnet school that will assist the state in meeting its obligations pursuant to the decision in Sheff v. O'Neill, 238 Conn. 1 (1996), or any related stipulation or order in effect, as determined by the commissioner, the commissioner shall also consider whether the school is meeting the reduced-isolation setting standards for interdistrict magnet school programs, developed by the commissioner pursuant to section 10-264r. If such school has not met such reduced-isolation setting standards, it shall not be entitled to receive a grant pursuant to this section unless the commissioner finds that it is appropriate to award a grant for an additional year or years and approves a plan to bring such school into compliance with such reduced-isolation setting standards. If requested by the commissioner, the applicant shall meet with the commissioner or the commissioner's designee to discuss the budget and sources of funding.\n\n(3) For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2018, to June 30, 2025, inclusive, the commissioner shall not award a grant to an interdistrict magnet school program that (A) has more than seventy-five per cent of the total school enrollment from one school district, or (B) does not maintain a total school enrollment that is in accordance with the reduced-isolation setting standards for interdistrict magnet school programs, developed by the Commissioner of Education pursuant to section 10-264r, except the commissioner may award a grant to such school for an additional year or years if the commissioner finds it is appropriate to do so and approves a plan to bring such school into compliance with such residency or reduced-isolation setting standards.\n\n(4) For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2018, to June 30, 2021, inclusive, if an interdistrict magnet school program does not maintain a total school enrollment that is in accordance with the reduced-isolation setting standards for interdistrict magnet school programs, developed by the commissioner pursuant to section 10-264r, for two or more consecutive years, the commissioner may impose a financial penalty on the operator of such interdistrict magnet school program, or take any other measure, in consultation with such operator, as may be appropriate to assist such operator in complying with such reduced-isolation setting standards.\n\n(c) (1) The maximum amount each interdistrict magnet school program, except those described in subparagraphs (A) to (G), inclusive, of subdivision (3) of this subsection, shall be eligible to receive per enrolled student who is not a resident of the town operating the magnet school shall be (A) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, seven thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars, and (B) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, and each fiscal year thereafter, at least seven thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars. The per pupil grant for each enrolled student who is a resident of the town operating the magnet school program shall be (i) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, three thousand sixty dollars, and (ii) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, and each fiscal year thereafter, at least three thousand sixty dollars.\n\n(2) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2003, and each fiscal year thereafter, the commissioner may, within available appropriations, provide supplemental grants for the purposes of enhancing educational programs in such interdistrict magnet schools, as the commissioner determines.

A student from a district that is not participating in an interdistrict magnet school or the interdistrict student attendance program pursuant to section 10-266aa to an extent determined by the Commissioner of Education shall be given preference. The local or regional board of education otherwise responsible for educating such student shall contribute funds to support the operation of the interdistrict magnet school in an amount equal to the per student tuition, if any, charged to participating districts, except for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, and each fiscal year thereafter, such per student tuition charged to such participating districts shall not exceed fifty-eight per cent the per student tuition charged during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.\n\n(k) (1) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, and each fiscal year thereafter, any tuition charged to a local or regional board of education by a regional educational service center operating an interdistrict magnet school or any tuition charged by the Hartford school district operating the Great Path Academy on behalf of Manchester Community College for any student enrolled in kindergarten to grade twelve, inclusive, in such interdistrict magnet school shall be in an amount equal to the difference between (A) the average per pupil expenditure of the magnet school for the prior fiscal year, and (B) the amount of any per pupil state subsidy calculated under subsection (c) of this section plus any revenue from other sources calculated on a per pupil basis, except for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, and each fiscal year thereafter, the per student tuition charged to a local or regional board of education shall not exceed fifty-eight per cent the per student tuition charged during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. If any such board of education fails to pay such tuition, the commissioner may withhold from such board's town or towns a sum payable under section 10-262i in an amount not to exceed the amount of the unpaid tuition to the magnet school and pay such money to the fiscal agent for the magnet school as a supplementary grant for the operation of the interdistrict magnet school program. In no case shall the sum of such tuitions exceed the difference between (i) the total expenditures of the magnet school for the prior fiscal year, and (ii) the total per pupil state subsidy calculated under subsection (c) of this section plus any revenue from other sources. The commissioner may conduct a comprehensive financial review of the operating budget of a magnet school to verify such tuition rate.\n\n(2) (A) For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2013, and June 30, 2014, a regional educational service center operating an interdistrict magnet school offering a preschool program that is not located in the Sheff region may charge tuition to the Department of Education for a child enrolled in such preschool program in an amount not to exceed an amount equal to the difference between (i) the average per pupil expenditure of the preschool program offered at the magnet school for the prior fiscal year, and (ii) the amount of any per pupil state subsidy calculated under subsection (c) of this section plus any revenue from other sources calculated on a per pupil basis. The commissioner may conduct a comprehensive financial review of the operating budget of any such magnet school charging such tuition to verify such tuition rate.

The Department of Education shall be financially responsible for any unpaid portion of the tuition not charged to such parent or guardian under such sliding tuition scale. Such tuition shall not exceed an amount equal to the difference between (i) the average per pupil expenditure of the preschool program offered at the magnet school for the prior fiscal year, and (ii) the amount of any per pupil state subsidy calculated under subsection (c) of this section plus any revenue from other sources calculated on a per pupil basis. The commissioner may conduct a comprehensive financial review of the operating budget of any such magnet school charging such tuition to verify such tuition rate.\n\n(C) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016, and each fiscal year thereafter, a regional educational service center operating an interdistrict magnet school offering a preschool program that is not located in the Sheff region shall charge tuition to the parent or guardian of a child enrolled in such preschool program in an amount up to four thousand fifty-three dollars, except such regional educational service center shall (i) not charge tuition to such parent or guardian with a family income at or below seventy-five per cent of the state median income, and (ii) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, and each fiscal year thereafter, charge tuition to such parent or guardian in an amount not to exceed fifty-eight per cent of the tuition charged during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. The Department of Education shall, within available appropriations, be financially responsible for any unpaid tuition charged to such parent or guardian with a family income at or below seventy-five per cent of the state median income. The commissioner may conduct a comprehensive financial review of the operating budget of any such magnet school charging such tuition to verify such tuition rate.\n\n(l) A participating district shall provide opportunities for its students to attend an interdistrict magnet school in a number that is at least equal to the number specified in any written agreement with an interdistrict magnet school operator or in a number that is at least equal to the average number of students that the participating district enrolled in such magnet school during the previous three school years.\n\n(m) (1) On or before May 15, 2010, and annually thereafter, each interdistrict magnet school operator shall provide written notification to any school district that is otherwise responsible for educating a student who resides in such school district and will be enrolled in an interdistrict magnet school under the operator's control for the following school year. Such notification shall include (A) the number of any such students, by grade, who will be enrolled in an interdistrict magnet school under the control of such operator, (B) the name of the school in which such student has been placed, and (C) the amount of tuition to be charged to the local or regional board of education for such student. Such notification shall represent an estimate of the number of students expected to attend such interdistrict magnet schools in the following school year, but shall not be deemed to limit the number of students who may enroll in such interdistrict magnet schools for such year.\n\n(2) For the school year commencing July 1, 2015, and each school year thereafter, any interdistrict magnet school operator that is a local or regional board of education and did not charge tuition to another local or regional board of education for the school year commencing July 1, 2014, may not charge tuition to such board unless (A) such operator receives authorization from the Commissioner of Education to charge the proposed tuition, and (B) if such authorization is granted, such operator provides written notification on or before September first of the school year prior to the school year in which such tuition is to be charged to such board of the tuition to be charged to such board for each student that such board is otherwise responsible for educating and is enrolled at the interdistrict magnet school under such operator's control, except for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, and each fiscal year thereafter, the amount of such tuition charged to such other local or regional board of education shall not exceed fifty-eight per cent the per student tuition charged during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. In deciding whether to authorize an interdistrict magnet school operator to charge tuition under this subdivision, the commissioner shall consider (i) the average per pupil expenditure of such operator for each interdistrict magnet school under the control of such operator, and (ii) the amount of any per pupil state subsidy and any revenue from other sources received by such operator. The commissioner may conduct a comprehensive financial review of the operating budget of the magnet school of such operator to verify that the tuition is appropriate. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to any interdistrict magnet school operator that is a regional educational service center or assisting the state in meeting its obligations pursuant to the decision in Sheff v. O'Neill, 238 Conn. 1 (1996), or any related stipulation or order in effect, as determined by the Commissioner of Education.\n\n(3) Not later than two weeks following an enrollment lottery for an interdistrict magnet school conducted by a magnet school operator, the parent or guardian of a student (A) who will enroll in such interdistrict magnet school in the following school year, or (B) whose name has been placed on a waiting list for enrollment in such interdistrict magnet school for the following school year, shall provide written notification of such prospective enrollment or waiting list placement to the school district in which such student resides and is otherwise responsible for educating such student.\n\n(n) (1) Each interdistrict magnet school operator shall annually file with the Commissioner of Education, at such time and in such manner as the commissioner prescribes, (A) a financial audit for each interdistrict magnet school operated by such operator, and (B) an aggregate financial audit for all of the interdistrict magnet schools operated by such operator.\n\n(2) Annually, the commissioner shall randomly select one interdistrict magnet school operated by a regional educational service center to be subject to a comprehensive financial audit conducted by an auditor selected by the commissioner.

The Department of Education shall, within available appropriations, be financially responsible for such excess per student tuition. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, and each fiscal year thereafter, the amount of the grants payable to the boards of education for the towns of East Hartford and Manchester in accordance with this subsection shall be reduced proportionately if the total of such grants in such year exceeds the amount appropriated for purposes of this subsection.\n\n(2) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, if the local or regional board of education for (A) the town of Windsor, (B) the town of New Britain, (C) the town of New London, and (D) the town of Bloomfield, has greater than four per cent of its resident students, as defined in section 10-262f, enrolled in an interdistrict magnet school program, then such board of education shall not be financially responsible for four thousand four hundred dollars of the portion of the per student tuition charged for each such student in excess of such four per cent.

      "text": "(a) As used in this section:\n\n(1) “Receiving district” means any school district that accepts students under the program established pursuant to this section;\n\n(2) “Sending district” means any school district that sends students it would otherwise be legally responsible for educating to another school district under the program; and\n\n(3) “Minority students” means students who are “pupils of racial minorities”, as defined in section 10-226a.\n\n(b) There is established, within available appropriations, an interdistrict public school attendance program. The purpose of the program shall be to: (1) Improve academic achievement; (2) reduce racial, ethnic and economic isolation or preserve racial and ethnic balance; and (3) provide a choice of educational programs. The Department of Education shall provide oversight for the program, including the setting of reasonable limits for the transportation of students participating in the program, and may provide for the incremental expansion of the program for the school year commencing in 2000 for each town required to participate in the program pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(c) The program shall be phased in as provided in this subsection. (1) For the school year commencing in 1998, and for each school year thereafter, the program shall be in operation in the Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport regions. The Hartford program shall operate as a continuation of the program described in section 10-266j. Students who reside in Hartford, New Haven or Bridgeport may attend school in another school district in the region and students who reside in such other school districts may attend school in Hartford, New Haven or Bridgeport, provided, beginning with the 2001-2002 school year, the proportion of students who are not minority students to the total number of students leaving Hartford, Bridgeport or New Haven to participate in the program shall not be greater than the proportion of students who were not minority students in the prior school year to the total number of students enrolled in Hartford, Bridgeport or New Haven in the prior school year. The regional educational service center operating the program shall make program participation decisions in accordance with the requirements of this subdivision. (2) For the school year commencing in 2000, and for each school year thereafter, the program shall be in operation in New London, provided beginning with the 2001-2002 school year, the proportion of students who are not minority students to the total number of students leaving New London to participate in the program shall not be greater than the proportion of students who were not minority students in the prior year to the total number of students enrolled in New London in the prior school year. The regional educational service center operating the program shall make program participation decisions in accordance with this subdivision. (3) The Department of Education may provide, within available appropriations, grants for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2003, to the remaining regional educational service centers to assist school districts in planning for a voluntary program of student enrollment in every priority school district, pursuant to section 10-266p, which is interested in participating in accordance with this subdivision. For the school year commencing in 2003, and for each school year thereafter, the voluntary enrollment program may be in operation in every priority school district in the state. Students from other school districts in the area of a priority school district, as determined by the regional educational service center pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, may attend school in the priority school district, provided such students bring racial, ethnic and economic diversity to the priority school district and do not increase the racial, ethnic and economic isolation in the priority school district. (4) For the school year commencing July 1, 2022, there shall be a pilot program in operation in Danbury and Norwalk. The pilot program shall serve (A) up to fifty students who reside in Danbury, and such students may attend school in the school districts for the towns of New Fairfield, Brookfield, Bethel, Ridgefield and Redding, and (B) up to fifty students who reside in Norwalk, and such students may attend school in the school districts for the towns of Darien, New Canaan, Wilton, Weston and Westport.

(5) For the school year commencing July 1, 2022, and each school year thereafter, the town of Guilford shall be eligible to participate in the program as a receiving district and a sending district with New Haven.\n\n(d) School districts which received students from New London under the program during the school year commencing July 1, 2000, shall allow such students to attend school in the district until they graduate from high school. The attendance of such students in such program shall not be supported by grants pursuant to subsections (f) and (g) of this section but shall be supported, in the same amounts as provided for in said subsections, by interdistrict cooperative grants pursuant to section 10-74d to the regional educational service centers operating such programs.\n\n(e) Once the program is in operation in the region served by a regional educational service center pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the Department of Education shall provide an annual grant to such regional educational service center to assist school districts in its area in administering the program and to provide staff to assist students participating in the program to make the transition to a new school and to act as a liaison between the parents of such students and the new school district. Each regional educational service center shall determine which school districts in its area are located close enough to a priority school district to make participation in the program feasible in terms of student transportation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, provided any student participating in the program prior to July 1, 1999, shall be allowed to continue to attend the same school such student attended prior to said date in the receiving district until the student completes the highest grade in such school. If there are more students who seek to attend school in a receiving district than there are spaces available, the regional educational service center shall assist the school district in determining attendance by the use of a lottery or lotteries designed to preserve or increase racial, ethnic and economic diversity, except that the regional educational service center shall give preference to siblings and to students who would otherwise attend a school that has lost its accreditation by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges or has been identified as in need of improvement pursuant to the No Child Left Behind Act, P.L. 107-110. The admission policies shall be consistent with section 10-15c and this section. No receiving district shall recruit students under the program for athletic or extracurricular purposes. Each receiving district shall allow out-of-district students it accepts to attend school in the district until they graduate from high school.\n\n(f) The Department of Education shall provide grants to regional educational service centers or local or regional boards of education for the reasonable cost of transportation for students participating in the program. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, and each fiscal year thereafter, the department shall provide such grants within available appropriations, provided the state-wide average of such grants does not exceed an amount equal to three thousand two hundred fifty dollars for each student transported, except that the Commissioner of Education may grant to regional educational service centers or local or regional boards of education additional sums from funds remaining in the appropriation for such transportation services if needed to offset transportation costs that exceed such maximum amount. The regional educational service centers shall provide reasonable transportation services to high school students who wish to participate in supervised extracurricular activities.

O'Neill, HHD-X07-CV89-4026240-S, provide, within available appropriations, an additional grant to the local or regional board of education for each receiving district in the amount of two thousand dollars for each out-of-district student who resides in the Hartford region and attends school in the receiving district under the program.\n\n(3) (A) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, the department shall provide a grant to the local or regional board of education for each receiving district described in subdivision (4) of subsection (c) of this section in an amount of four thousand dollars for each out-of-district student who resides in Danbury or Norwalk and attends school in the receiving district under the pilot program.\n\n(B) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, and each fiscal year thereafter, the department shall provide an annual grant to the local or regional board of education for each receiving district described in subdivision (4) of subsection (c) of this section for each out-of-district student who resides in Danbury or Norwalk and attends school in the receiving district under the pilot program in accordance with the provisions of subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection.\n\n(C) Not later than January 1, 2025, the department shall submit a report on the pilot program in operation in Danbury and Norwalk, pursuant to subdivision (4) of subsection (c) of this section, to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to education and appropriations, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a.

The grants shall provide funds for extended school building hours for public schools in such districts for academic enrichment and support, and recreation programs for students in the districts. Such programs may be conducted in buildings other than public school buildings, provided the board of education is able to demonstrate to the commissioner that the facility in which the program will be run can adequately support the academic goals of the program and a plan is in place to provide adequate academic instruction.\n\n(b) The Commissioner of Education shall provide a grant estimate annually to each priority school district. The estimated grant shall be calculated as follows: Each district's average daily membership, as defined in subdivision (2) of section 10-261, divided by the total of all priority school districts' average daily membership, multiplied by the amount appropriated for the grant program minus the amounts specified in subsections (a) and (b) of section 10-266u.\n\n(c) (1) Annually, each such district shall file a grant application with the Commissioner of Education, in such form and at such time as he prescribes. The application shall identify the local distribution of funds by school and operator, with program specification, hours and days of operation.\n\n(2) Each such district shall solicit applications for individual school programs, on a competitive basis, from town and nonprofit agencies, prioritize the applications and select applications for funding within the total grant amount allocated to the district. District decisions to fund individual school programs shall be based on specified criteria including: (A) Total hours of operation, (B) number of students served, (C) total student hours of service, (D) total program cost, (E) estimate of volunteer hours, or other sources of support, (F) community involvement, commitment and support, (G) nonduplication of existing services, (H) needs of the student body of the school, (I) unique qualities of the proposal, and (J) responsiveness to the requirements of this section and section 10-266u.
