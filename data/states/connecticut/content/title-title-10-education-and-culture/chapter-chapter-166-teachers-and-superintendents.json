Any such board of education may request the superintendent to submit multiple nominations of qualified candidates, if more than one candidate is available for nomination, for any supervisory or administrative position, in which case the superintendent shall submit such a list and may place the candidates on such list in the order in which such superintendent recommends such candidates. If such board rejects such nominations, the superintendent shall submit to such board other nominations and such board may employ teachers from the persons so nominated and shall accept or reject such nominations not later than one month from their submission. Whenever a superintendent offers a teacher who has not attained tenure a contract to return for another year of employment, such offer shall be based on records of evaluations pursuant to subsection (a) of section 10-151b.

Upon the teacher's written request, not later than three calendar days after such teacher receives such notice of nonrenewal or termination, a notice of nonrenewal or termination shall be supplemented not later than four calendar days after receipt of the request by a statement of the reason or reasons for such nonrenewal or termination. Such teacher, upon written request filed with the board of education not later than ten calendar days after the receipt of notice of termination, or nonrenewal shall be entitled to a hearing, except as provided in this subsection, (1) before the board, or (2) if indicated in such request and if designated by the board, before an impartial hearing officer chosen by the teacher and the superintendent in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this section. Such hearing shall commence not later than fifteen calendar days after receipt of such request unless the parties mutually agree to an extension not to exceed fifteen calendar days. The impartial hearing officer or a subcommittee of the board of education, if the board of education designates a subcommittee of three or more board members to conduct hearings, shall submit written findings and recommendations to the board for final disposition. The teacher shall have the right to appear with counsel of the teacher's choice at the hearing. A teacher who has not attained tenure shall not be entitled to a hearing concerning nonrenewal if the reason for such nonrenewal is either elimination of position or loss of position to another teacher. The board of education shall rescind a nonrenewal decision only if the board finds such decision to be arbitrary and capricious. Any such teacher whose contract is terminated for the reasons enumerated in subdivisions (3) and (4) of subsection (d) of this section shall have the right to appeal in accordance with the provisions of subsection (e) of this section.\n\n(d) The contract of employment of a teacher who has attained tenure shall be continued from school year to school year, except that it may be terminated at any time for one or more of the following reasons: (1) Inefficiency, incompetence or ineffectiveness, provided, if a teacher is notified on or after July 1, 2014, that termination is under consideration due to incompetence or ineffectiveness, the determination of incompetence or ineffectiveness is based on evaluation of the teacher using teacher evaluation guidelines established pursuant to section 10-151b; (2) insubordination against reasonable rules of the board of education; (3) moral misconduct; (4) disability, as shown by competent medical evidence; (5) elimination of the position to which the teacher was appointed or loss of a position to another teacher, if no other position exists to which such teacher may be appointed if qualified, provided such teacher, if qualified, shall be appointed to a position held by a teacher who has not attained tenure, and provided further that determination of the individual contract or contracts of employment to be terminated shall be made in accordance with either (A) a provision for a layoff procedure agreed upon by the board of education and the exclusive employees' representative organization, or (B) in the absence of such agreement, a written policy of the board of education; or (6) other due and sufficient cause.

Prior to terminating a contract, the superintendent shall give the teacher concerned a written notice that termination of such teacher's contract is under consideration and give such teacher a statement of the reasons for such consideration of termination. Not later than ten calendar days after receipt of written notice by the superintendent that contract termination is under consideration, such teacher may file with the local or regional board of education a written request for a hearing. A board of education may designate a subcommittee of three or more board members to conduct hearings and submit written findings and recommendations to the board for final disposition in the case of teachers whose contracts are terminated. Such hearing shall commence not later than fifteen calendar days after receipt of such request, unless the parties mutually agree to an extension, not to exceed fifteen calendar days (A) before the board of education or a subcommittee of the board, or (B) if indicated in such request or if designated by the board before an impartial hearing officer chosen by the teacher and the superintendent. If the parties are unable to agree upon the choice of a hearing officer not later than five calendar days after the decision to use a hearing officer, the hearing officer shall be selected with the assistance of the American Arbitration Association using its expedited selection process and in accordance with its rules for selection of a neutral arbitrator in grievance arbitration. If the hearing officer is not selected with the assistance of such association after five days, the hearing shall be held before the board of education or a subcommittee of the board. When the reason for termination is incompetence or ineffectiveness, the hearing shall (i) address the question of whether the performance evaluation ratings of the teacher were determined in good faith in accordance with the program adopted by the local or regional board of education pursuant to section 10-151b and were reasonable in light of the evidence presented, and (ii) be limited to twelve total hours of evidence and testimony, with each side allowed not more than six hours to present evidence and testimony except the board, subcommittee of the board or impartial hearing officer may extend the time period for evidence and testimony at the hearing when good cause is shown. Not later than forty-five calendar days after receipt of the request for a hearing, the subcommittee of the board or hearing officer, unless the parties mutually agree to an extension not to exceed fifteen calendar days, shall submit written findings and a recommendation to the board of education as to the disposition of the charges against the teacher and shall send a copy of such findings and recommendation to the teacher. The board of education shall give the teacher concerned its written decision not later than fifteen calendar days after receipt of the written recommendation of the subcommittee or hearing officer. Each party shall share equally the fee of the hearing officer and all other costs incidental to the hearing. If the hearing is before the board of education, the board shall render its decision not later than fifteen calendar days after the close of such hearing and shall send a copy of its decision to the teacher. The hearing shall be public if the teacher so requests or the board, subcommittee or hearing officer so designates. The teacher concerned shall have the right to appear with counsel at the hearing, whether public or private. A copy of a transcript of the proceedings of the hearing shall be furnished by the board of education, upon written request by the teacher within fifteen days after the board's decision, provided the teacher shall assume the cost of any such copy. Nothing herein contained shall deprive a board of education or superintendent of the power to suspend a teacher from duty immediately when serious misconduct is charged without prejudice to the rights of the teacher as otherwise provided in this section.\n\n(e) Any teacher aggrieved by the decision of a board of education after a hearing as provided in subsection (d) of this section may appeal therefrom, not later than thirty calendar days after such decision, to the Superior Court. Such appeal shall be made returnable to said court in the same manner as is prescribed for civil actions brought to said court. Any such appeal shall be a privileged case to be heard by the court as soon after the return day as is practicable. The board of education shall file with the court a copy of the complete transcript of the proceedings of the hearing and the minutes of board of education meetings relating to such termination, including the vote of the board on the termination, together with such other documents, or certified copies thereof, as shall constitute the record of the case.

Certified professional employees covered by the terms and conditions of a contract in effect prior to October 1, 1983, shall continue to be covered by such contract or any successor contract until such time as the employee is covered by the terms and conditions of a contract negotiated by the exclusive bargaining unit of which the employee is a member for purposes of collective bargaining pursuant to the provisions of this section. (2) The “teachers' unit” means (A) the group of professional employees who hold a certificate or durational shortage area permit issued by the State Board of Education under the provisions of sections 10-144o to 10-149, inclusive, and are employed by a local or regional board of education in positions requiring such a certificate or durational shortage area permit and are not included in the administrators' unit or excluded from the purview of sections 10-153a to 10-153n, inclusive, and (B) the group of professional employees who hold a certificate, durational shortage area permit issued by the State Board of Education under the provisions of sections 10-144o to 10-149, inclusive, or a charter school educator permit issued by the State Board of Education under the provisions of section 10-145q, and are employed by a charter school in positions requiring such a certificate, durational shortage area permit or charter school educator permit and are not included in the administrators' unit or excluded from the purview of sections 10-153a to 10-153n, inclusive.

(6) “Days” means calendar days.\n\n(b) The superintendent of schools, assistant superintendents, certified professional employees who act for the board of education in negotiations with certified professional personnel or are directly responsible to the board of education for personnel relations or budget preparation, temporary substitutes and all noncertified employees of the board of education are excluded from the purview of this section and sections 10-153c to 10-153n, inclusive.\n\n(c) The employees in either unit defined in this section may designate any organization of certified professional employees to represent them in negotiations with respect to salaries, hours and other conditions of employment with the local or regional board of education which employs them by filing, during the period between March first and March thirty-first of any school year, with the board of education a petition which requests recognition of such organization for purposes of negotiation under this section and sections 10-153c to 10-153n, inclusive, and is signed by a majority of the employees in such unit. Where a new school district is formed as the result of the creation of a regional school district, a petition for designation shall also be considered timely if it is filed at any time from the date when such regional school district is approved pursuant to section 10-45 through the first school year of operation of any such school district. Where a new school district is formed as a result of the dissolution of a regional school district, a petition for designation shall also be considered timely if it is filed at any time from the date of the election of a board of education for such school district through the first year of operation of any such school district. Within three school days next following the receipt of such petition, such board shall post a notice of such request for recognition and mail a copy thereof to the commissioner. Such notice shall state the name of the organization designated by the petitioners, the unit to be represented and the date of receipt of such petition by the board. If no petition which requests a representation election and is signed by twenty per cent of the employees in such unit is filed in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this section, with the commissioner within the thirty days next following the date on which the board of education posts notice of the designation petition, such board shall recognize the designated organization as the exclusive representative of the employees in such unit for a period of one year or until a representation election has been held for such unit pursuant to this section and section 10-153c, whichever occurs later. If a petition complying with the provisions of subsection (d) of this section is filed within such period of thirty days, the local or regional board of education shall not recognize any organization so designated until an election has been held pursuant to said sections to determine which organization shall represent such unit.\n\n(d) Twenty per cent or more of the personnel in an administrators' unit or teachers' unit may file during the period between March first and April thirtieth of any school year with the commissioner a petition requesting that a representation election be held to elect an organization to represent such unit. Where a new school district is formed as the result of the creation of a regional school district, a petition for a representation election shall also be considered timely if it is filed at any time from the date when such regional school district is approved pursuant to section 10-45 through the first school year of operation of any such school district. Where a new school district is formed as a result of the dissolution of a regional school district, a petition for a representation election shall also be considered timely if it is filed at any time during the first school year of operation of any such school district. Whenever a multiple-year contract is in effect, a petition requesting that a representation election be held to elect an organization to represent such unit shall be considered timely if it is filed with the commissioner between March first and April thirtieth after two years of a contract have elapsed or is filed between March first and April thirtieth of the calendar year prior to the year of expiration of the collective bargaining contract covering the employees who are the subject of the petition, whichever is sooner. The commissioner shall file notice of such petition with the local or regional board of education on or before the fifth school day following receipt of the petition. The commissioner shall not divulge the names on such petition or any petition filed with the commissioner pursuant to this section to anyone except upon court order. Such notice shall state the name of the petitioning group, the unit for which an election is sought and the date the petition was filed. Within three school days after receipt of such notice, the local or regional board of education shall post a copy of the notice. Any organization interested in representing personnel in such unit may intervene within three school days after the board posts notice of such petition by filing with the commissioner a petition signed by ten per cent of the employees in such unit provided that any employee who signs more than one such petition between March first and April thirtieth in any one school year shall not be deemed to have signed any such petition. The commissioner shall notify the local or regional board on or before the third day following receipt of the intervening petition, and such board shall post notice of the intervening petition within three days following receipt thereof. No intervening petition shall be required from any incumbent organization previously designated by the board or elected and such incumbent organization shall be listed on the ballot if a petition for a representation election is filed. The petitioning organization, the incumbent organization, if any, and any intervening organization may agree on an impartial person or agency to conduct such an election consistent with the other provisions of this section, provided not more than one such election shall be held to elect an organization to represent the employees in such unit in any one school year, except, however, if no organization receives a majority of the vote validly cast, the election shall not be deemed completed and within ten days after the initial election a runoff election shall be held. In the event of a disagreement on the agency to conduct the election, the method shall be determined by the board of arbitration selected in accordance with section 10-153c. The person or agency so selected shall conduct, between twenty and forty-five days after the first petition requesting an election is filed with the commissioner, an election by secret ballot to determine which organization, if any, shall represent such unit, provided if no organization receives a majority of the vote validly cast, such election shall not be deemed completed and a runoff election between the two choices receiving the largest and second largest number of valid votes cast in the election shall be held within ten days after the initial election. The organizations participating in the election and the organizations participating in the runoff election shall share equally in the cost incurred by the impartial person or agency selected to conduct each election. Such person or agency shall immediately report the results of the election or runoff election to the commissioner. Within five days after receipt of the tally of ballots in the election or runoff election, any party to said election or runoff election may file with the commissioner any objection to said election or runoff election. If timely objections are found to be valid and they affected the results of the election or runoff election, the commissioner shall order another election or runoff election, as appropriate, to be conducted within ten days of the commissioner's decision. If satisfied that the election or runoff election has been conducted properly, the commissioner shall certify that the organization receiving a majority of votes is the exclusive representative of the employees in such unit.\n\n(e) The representative designated or elected in accordance with this section shall, from the date of such designation or election, be the exclusive representative of all the employees in such unit for the purposes of negotiating with respect to salaries, hours and other conditions of employment, provided any certified professional employee or group of such employees shall have the right at any time to present any grievance to such persons as the local or regional board of education shall designate for that purpose. The terms of any existing contract shall not be abrogated by the election or designation of a new representative. During the balance of the term of such contract the board of education and the new representative shall have the duty to negotiate pursuant to section 10-153d concerning a successor agreement. The new representative shall, from the date of designation or election, acquire the rights and powers and shall assume the duties and obligations of the existing contract during the period of its effectiveness.\n\n(f) Any organization which has been designated or elected the exclusive representative of a unit which includes teachers and administrators shall continue to be the exclusive representative of such personnel upon expiration of the salary agreement in effect between such organization and the board of education employing such personnel on July 1, 1969, until or unless employees of such board of education in either of the units defined in this section initiate a petition for designation or election of an organization to represent them in accordance with the procedures set forth in sections 10-153a to 10-153n, inclusive.\n\n(February, 1965, P.A. 298, S. 1; 1967, P.A. 752, S. 1; 1969, P.A. 811, S. 2; P.A. 73-385, S. 1, 2; P.A. 76-403, S. 2, 11; P.A. 77-614, S. 302, 610; P.A. 78-218, S. 81; 78-303, S. 85, 136; P.A. 82-225, S. 1, 3; P.A. 83-72, S. 2, 9; 83-359; P.A. 84-546, S. 22, 23, 173; P.A. 87-250, S. 3, 4, 11; 87-499, S. 12, 34; P.A. 88-136, S. 8, 37; P.A. 91-303, S. 3, 22; P.A. 98-56, S. 3, 5; P.A. 03-174, S. 15; P.A. 11-60, S. 3; 11-234, S. 4.)\n\nHistory: 1967 act detailed process for designating representative organization in Subsecs.

      "text": "(a) No certified professional employee shall, in an effort to effect a settlement of any disagreement with the employing board of education, engage in any strike or concerted refusal to render services. This provision may be enforced in the superior court for any judicial district in which said board of education is located by an injunction issued by said court or a judge thereof pursuant to sections 52-471 to 52-479, inclusive, provided the Commissioner of Education shall be given notice of any hearing and the commissioner or said commissioner's designee shall be an interested party for the purposes of section 52-474.\n\n(b) The local or regional board of education or its representatives or agents are prohibited from: (1) Interfering, restraining or coercing certified professional employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in sections 10-153a to 10-153n; (2) dominating or interfering with the formation, existence or administration of any employees' bargaining agent or representative; (3) discharging or otherwise discriminating against or for any certified professional employee because such employee has signed or filed any affidavit, petition or complaint under said sections; (4) refusing to negotiate in good faith with the employees' bargaining agent or representative which has been designated or elected as the exclusive representative in an appropriate unit in accordance with the provisions of said sections; or (5) refusing to participate in good faith in mediation or arbitration. A prohibited practice committed by a board of education, its representatives or agents shall not be a defense to an illegal strike or concerted refusal to render services.\n\n(c) Any organization of certified professional employees or its agents is prohibited from: (1) Interfering, restraining or coercing (A) certified professional employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in this section and sections 10-153a to 10-153c, inclusive, provided that this shall not impair the right of an employees' bargaining agent or representative to prescribe its own rules with respect to acquisition or retention of membership provided such rules are not discriminatory and (B) a board of education in the selection of its representatives or agents; (2) discriminating against or for any certified professional employee because such employee has signed or filed any affidavit, petition or complaint under said sections; (3) breaching its duty of fair representation pursuant to section 10-153a; (4) refusing to negotiate in good faith with the employing board of education, if such organization has been designated or elected as the exclusive representative in an appropriate unit; (5) refusing to participate in good faith in mediation or arbitration; or (6) soliciting or advocating support from public school students for activities of certified professional employees or organizations of such employees.\n\n(d) As used in this section, sections 10-153a to 10-153c, inclusive, and section 10-153g, “to negotiate in good faith” is the performance of the mutual obligation of the board of education or its representatives or agents and the organization designated or elected as the exclusive representative for the appropriate unit to meet at reasonable times, including meetings appropriately related to the budget-making process, and to participate actively so as to indicate a present intention to reach agreement with respect to salaries, hours and other conditions of employment, or the negotiation of an agreement, or any question arising thereunder and the execution of a written contract incorporating any agreement reached if requested by either party, but such obligation shall not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession.\n\n(e) Whenever a board of education or employees' representative organization has reason to believe that a prohibited practice, as defined in subsection (b) or (c) of this section, has been or is being committed, or whenever a certified employee believes a breach of the duty of fair representation under subdivision (3) of subsection (c) of this section has occurred or is occurring, such board of education, representative organization or certified employee shall file a written complaint with the State Board of Labor Relations and shall mail a copy of such complaint to the party that is the subject of the complaint. Upon receipt of a properly filed complaint said board shall refer such complaint to the agent who shall, after investigation and within ninety days after the date of such referral, either (1) make a report to said board recommending dismissal of the complaint or (2) issue a written complaint charging prohibited practices. If no such report is made and no such written complaint is issued, the Board of Labor Relations in its discretion may proceed to a hearing upon the party's original complaint of the violation of this chapter which shall in such case be treated for the purpose of this section as a complaint issued by the agent. Upon receiving a report from the agent recommending dismissal of a complaint, said Board of Labor Relations may issue an order dismissing the complaint or may order a further investigation or a hearing thereon. Upon receiving a complaint issued by the agent, the Board of Labor Relations shall set a time and place for the hearing. If the alleged prohibited practice or breach of duty is ongoing, the board may issue and cause to be served on the party committing the act or practice an order requiring such party to cease and desist from such act or practice until the board has made its determination. Any such complaint may be amended with the permission of said board. The party so complained of shall have the right to file an answer to the original or amended complaint within five days after the service of such complaint or within such other time as said board may limit. Such party shall have the right to appear in person or otherwise to defend against such complaint. In the discretion of said board any person may be allowed to intervene in such proceeding. In any hearing said board shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence prevailing in the courts. A stenographic or electronic record of the testimony shall be taken at all hearings of the Board of Labor Relations and a transcript thereof shall be filed with said board upon its request. Said board shall have the power to order the taking of further testimony and further argument. If, upon all the testimony, said board determines that the party complained of has engaged in or is engaging in any prohibited practice, it shall state its finding of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on such party an order requiring it to cease and desist from such prohibited practice, and shall take such further affirmative action as will effectuate the policies of subsections (b) to (d), inclusive, of this section. Such order may further require such party to make reports from time to time showing the extent to which the order has been complied with. If upon all the testimony the Board of Labor Relations is of the opinion that the party named in the complaint has not engaged in or is not engaging in any such prohibited practice, then said board shall make its finding of fact and shall issue an order dismissing the complaint. Until a transcript of the record in a case has been filed in the Superior Court, as provided in subsection (g) of this section, said board may at any time, upon notice, modify or set aside in whole or in part any finding or order made or issued by it. Proceedings before said board shall be held with all possible expedition. Any party who wishes to have a transcript of the proceedings before the Board of Labor Relations shall apply therefor. The parties may agree on the sharing of the costs of the transcript but, in the absence of such agreement, the costs shall be paid by the requesting party.\n\n(f) For the purpose of hearings pursuant to this section before the Board of Labor Relations said board shall have power to administer oaths and affirmations and to issue subpoenas requiring the attendance of witnesses. In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any person, the Superior Court, upon application by said board, shall have jurisdiction to order such person to appear before said board to produce evidence or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation or in question, and any failure to obey such order may be punished by said court as a contempt thereof. No person shall be excused from attending and testifying or from producing books, records, correspondence, documents or other evidence in obedience to the subpoena of the board, on the ground that the testimony or evidence required may tend to incriminate or subject such person to a penalty or forfeiture; but no individual shall be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter or thing concerning which such individual is compelled, after claiming a privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce evidence, except that such individual so testifying shall not be exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying. Complaints, orders and other processes and papers of the Board of Labor Relations or the agent may be served personally, by registered or certified mail, by telegraph or by leaving a copy thereof at the principal office or place of business of the person required to be served. The verified return of service shall be proof of such service. Witnesses summoned before said board or the agent shall be paid the same fees and mileage allowances that are paid witnesses in the courts of this state, and witnesses whose depositions are taken and the person taking the same shall severally be entitled to the same fees as are paid for like services in the courts of this state. All processes of any court to which an application or petition may be made under this chapter may be served in the judicial district wherein the person or persons required to be served reside or may be found.\n\n(g) (1) The Board of Labor Relations may petition the superior court for the judicial district wherein the prohibited practice in question occurred or wherein any party charged with the prohibited practice resides or transacts business, or, if said court is not in session, any judge of said court, for the enforcement of an order and for appropriate temporary relief or a restraining order, and shall certify and file in the court a transcript of the entire record of the proceedings, including the pleadings and testimony upon which such order was made and the finding and orders of said board. In the event an appeal has not been filed pursuant to section 4-183, the board may file its petition in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford, or, if said court is not in session, the board may petition any judge of said court. Within five days after filing such petition in the Superior Court, said board shall cause a notice of such petition to be sent by registered or certified mail to all parties or their representatives. The Superior Court, or, if said court is not in session, any judge of said court, shall have jurisdiction of the proceedings and of the questions determined thereon, and shall have the power to grant such relief, including temporary relief, as it deems just and suitable and to make and enter a decree enforcing, modifying and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part, the order of said board. (2) No objection that has not been urged before the Board of Labor Relations shall be considered by the court, unless the failure to urge such objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances. The findings of said board as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive. If either party applies to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shows to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the hearing before said board, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before said board and to be made part of the transcript. The Board of Labor Relations may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of additional evidence so taken, and it shall file such modified or new findings, which, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, and shall file its recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original order. (3) The jurisdiction of the Superior Court shall be exclusive and its judgment and decree shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the Appellate Court, on appeal, by either party, irrespective of the nature of the decree or judgment or the amount involved. Such appeal shall be taken and prosecuted in the same manner and form and with the same effect as is provided in other cases of appeal to the Appellate Court, and the record so certified shall contain all that was before the lower court. (4) Any party aggrieved by a final order of the Board of Labor Relations granting or denying in whole or in part the relief sought may appeal pursuant to the provisions of chapter 54 to the superior court for the judicial district where the prohibited practice was alleged to have occurred, in the judicial district of New Britain, or in the judicial district wherein such party resides or transacts business. (5) Petitions filed under this subsection shall be heard expeditiously and determined upon the transcript filed, without requirement of printing. Hearings in the Superior Court or Appellate Court under this chapter shall take precedence over all other matters, except matters of the same character.\n\n(h) Subject to regulations to be made by the Board of Labor Relations, the complaints, orders and testimony relating to a proceeding instituted under subsection (e) of this section may be available for inspection or copying. All proceedings pursuant to said subsection shall be open to the public.\n\n(i) Any person who wilfully resists, prevents or interferes with any member of the Board of Labor Relations or the agent in the performance of duties pursuant to subsections (e) to (i), inclusive, of this section shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than six months or both.\n\n(February, 1965, P.A. 298, S. 4; 1969, P.A. 811, S. 4; P.A. 76-403, S. 5, 11; P.A. 77-235, S. 1, 2; 77-614, S. 302, 610; P.A. 78-218, S. 83–86; 78-280, S. 2, 127; 78-303, S. 85, 136; P.A. 83-72, S. 4, 9; 83-308, S. 2; June Sp.

      "text": "(a) There shall be in the Department of Education an arbitration panel of not less than twenty-four or more than twenty-nine persons to serve as provided in subsection (c) of this section. The Governor shall appoint the members of such panel, with the advice and consent of the General Assembly, as follows: (1) Seven members who are representative of the interests of local and regional boards of education and selected from lists of names submitted by such boards; (2) seven members who are representative of the interests of exclusive bargaining representatives of certified employees and selected from lists of names submitted by such bargaining representatives; and (3) not less than ten or more than fifteen members who are impartial representatives of the interests of the public in general, residents of the state of Connecticut, experienced in public sector collective bargaining interest impasse resolution and selected from lists of names submitted by the State Board of Education. The lists of names submitted to the Governor pursuant to subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, of this subsection shall, in addition to complying with the provisions of section 4-9b, include a report from the State Board of Education certifying that the process conducted for soliciting applicants made adequate outreach to minority communities and documenting that the number and make-up of minority applicants considered reflect the state's racial and ethnic diversity. Each member of the panel serving on or appointed after January 1, 2016, shall serve a term of four years, except that each arbitrator shall hold office until a successor is appointed and any arbitrator not reappointed shall finish to conclusion any arbitration for which such arbitrator has been selected or appointed. Arbitrators may be removed for good cause. If any vacancy occurs in such panel, the Governor shall act within forty days to fill such vacancy in the manner provided in section 4-19. Persons appointed to the arbitration panel shall serve without compensation but each shall receive a per diem fee for any day during which such person is engaged in the arbitration of a dispute pursuant to this section. The parties to the dispute so arbitrated shall pay the fee in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(b) If any local or regional board of education cannot agree with the exclusive representatives of a teachers' or administrators' unit after negotiation concerning the terms and conditions of employment applicable to the employees in such unit, either party may submit the issues to the commissioner for mediation. On the one hundred sixtieth day prior to the budget submission date, the commissioner shall order the parties to report their settlement. If, on such one hundred sixtieth day, the parties have not reached agreement and have failed to initiate mediation, the commissioner shall order the parties to notify the commissioner of the name of a mutually selected mediator and to commence mediation. The commissioner may order the parties to appear before said commissioner during the mediation period. In either case, the parties shall meet with a mediator mutually selected by them, provided such parties shall inform the commissioner of the name of such mediator, or with the commissioner or the commissioner's agents or a mediator designated by said commissioner. Mediators shall be chosen from a panel of mediators selected by the State Board of Education or from outside such panel if mutually agreed by the parties. Such mediators shall receive a per diem fee determined on the basis of the prevailing rate for such services, and the parties shall share equally in the cost of such mediation. In any civil or criminal case, any proceeding preliminary thereto, or in any legislative or administrative proceeding, a mediator shall not disclose any confidential communication made to such mediator in the course of mediation unless the party making such communication waives such privilege. The parties shall provide such information as the commissioner may require. The commissioner may recommend a basis for settlement but such recommendations shall not be binding upon the parties. Such recommendation shall be made within twenty-five days after the day on which mediation begins.\n\n(c) (1) On the fourth day next following the end of the mediation session or on the one hundred thirty-fifth day prior to the budget submission date, whichever is sooner, the commissioner shall order the parties to report their settlement of the dispute or, if there is no settlement, to notify the commissioner of either their agreement to submit their dispute to a single arbitrator or the name of the arbitrator selected by each of them. Within five days of providing such notice, the parties shall notify the commissioner of the name of the arbitrator if there is an agreement on a single arbitrator appointed to the panel pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section or agreement on the third arbitrator appointed to the panel pursuant to said subdivision. The commissioner may order the parties to appear before said commissioner during the arbitration period. If the parties have notified the commissioner of their agreement to submit their dispute to a single arbitrator and they have not agreed on such arbitrator, within five days after such notification, the commissioner shall select such single arbitrator who shall be an impartial representative of the interests of the public in general. If each party has notified the commissioner of the name of the arbitrator it has selected and the parties have not agreed on the third arbitrator, within five days after such notification, the commissioner shall select a third arbitrator, who shall be an impartial representative of the interests of the public in general. If either party fails to notify the commissioner of the name of an arbitrator, the commissioner shall select an arbitrator to serve and the commissioner shall also select a third arbitrator who shall be an impartial representative of the interests of the public in general. Any selection pursuant to this section by the commissioner of an impartial arbitrator shall be made at random from among the members appointed under subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section. Arbitrators shall be selected from the panel appointed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and shall receive a per diem fee determined on the basis of the prevailing rate for such services. Whenever a panel of three arbitrators is selected, the chairperson of such panel shall be the impartial representative of the interests of the public in general.\n\n(2) The chairperson of the arbitration panel or the single arbitrator shall set the date, time and place for a hearing to be held in the school district between the fifth and twelfth day, inclusive, after such chairperson or such single arbitrator is selected. At least five days prior to such hearing, a written notice of the date, time and place of the hearing shall be sent to the board of education and the representative organization which are parties to the dispute, and, if a three-member arbitration panel is selected or designated, to the other members of such panel. Such written notice shall also be sent, by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the fiscal authority having budgetary responsibility or charged with making appropriations for the school district, and a representative designated by such body may be heard at the hearing as part of the presentation and participation of the board of education. At the hearing each party shall have full opportunity to submit all relevant evidence, to introduce relevant documents and written material and to argue on behalf of its positions. At the hearing a representative of the fiscal authority having budgetary responsibility or charged with making appropriations for the school district shall be heard regarding the financial capability of the school district, unless such opportunity to be heard is waived by the fiscal authority. The nonappearance of the representative shall constitute a waiver of the opportunity to be heard unless there is a showing that proper notice was not given to the fiscal authority. The chairperson of the arbitration panel or the single arbitrator shall preside over such hearing.\n\n(3) The hearing may, at the discretion of the arbitration panel or the single arbitrator, be continued but in any event shall be concluded within twenty-five days after its commencement.\n\n(4) After hearing all the issues, the arbitrators or the single arbitrator shall, within twenty days, render a decision in writing, signed by a majority of the arbitrators or the single arbitrator, which states in detail the nature of the decision and the disposition of the issues by the arbitrators or the single arbitrator. The written decision shall include a narrative explaining the evaluation by the arbitrators or the single arbitrator of the evidence presented for each item upon which a decision was rendered by the arbitrators or the single arbitrator and shall state with particularity the basis for the decision as to each disputed issue and the manner in which the factors enumerated in this subdivision were considered in arriving at such decision, including, where applicable, the specific similar groups and conditions of employment presented for comparison and accepted by the arbitrators or the single arbitrator and the reason for such acceptance. The arbitrators or the single arbitrator shall file one copy of the decision with the commissioner, each town clerk in the school district involved, the legislative body or bodies of the town or towns for the school district involved, or, in the case of a town for which the legislative body of the town is a town meeting or representative town meeting, to the board of selectmen, and the board of education and organization which are parties to the dispute. The decision of the arbitrators or the single arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties to the dispute unless a rejection is filed in accordance with subdivision (7) of this subsection.
