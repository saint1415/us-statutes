I, Secs. 1, 20 and Art. VIII, Sec. 1 of Connecticut Constitution. 172 C. 615. Cited. 237 C. 169; 238 C. 1. Legislature did not expressly extend sovereign immunity to boards of education for special education services, and also did not render the general delegation of control to municipalities inapplicable in the case of special education, therefore, defendants not entitled to sovereign immunity defense when claim is that defendants were negligent in verifying the credentials of someone who was hired to provide special education services because this act is not control over state functions, but rather a human resources or contract administration action. 334 C. 564.\n\nSection, insofar as it delegates to Canton the state's duty to operate and maintain free public schools and raise taxes therefor, violates Art. I, Sec. 20 and Art. VIII, Sec. 1 of Connecticut Constitution; duty to educate is that of state and delegating it will not discharge it. 31 CS 377.",
