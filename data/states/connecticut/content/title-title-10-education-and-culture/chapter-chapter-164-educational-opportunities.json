The executive director shall serve as secretary to the Interstate Commission, but shall not be a member of the Interstate Commission. The executive director shall hire and supervise such other persons as may be authorized by the Interstate Commission.\n\nD. The Interstate Commission's executive director and its employees shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for a claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of or relating to an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred, within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities provided, such person shall not be protected from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of such person.\n\n1.

The Interstate Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact.

Failure to provide service of process to the Interstate Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Interstate Commission, this compact or promulgated rules.\n\nB. If the Interstate Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the Interstate Commission shall:\n\n1.

The Interstate Commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default.\n\n2.

If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default.\n\n4. Suspension or termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.\n\n5. The state which has been suspended or terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of suspension or termination including obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of suspension or termination.\n\n6. The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or which has been suspended or terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.\n\n7. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Interstate Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.\n\nC. Dispute Resolution\n\n1. The Interstate Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state, to resolve disputes which are subject to the compact and which may arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.\n\n2. The Interstate Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.\n\nD. Enforcement\n\n1. The Interstate Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.\n\n2. The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its promulgated rules and bylaws, against a member state in default. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.\n\n3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Interstate Commission. The Interstate Commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession.\n\nARTICLE XIV\n\nFINANCING OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION\n\nA. The Interstate Commission shall pay, or provide for the payment of, the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization and ongoing activities.\n\nB. The Interstate Commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each member state to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission's annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member states.\n\nC. The Interstate Commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the Interstate Commission pledge the credit of any of the member states, except by and with the authority of the member state.\n\nD. The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws.

Any state is eligible to become a member state.\n\nB. The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less than ten of the states. The effective date shall be no earlier than December 1, 2007. Thereafter it shall become effective and binding as to any other member state upon enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of nonmember states or their designees shall be invited to participate in the activities of the Interstate Commission on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states.\n\nC. The Interstate Commission may propose amendments to the compact for enactment by the member states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the member states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the member states.\n\nARTICLE XVI\n\nWITHDRAWAL AND DISSOLUTION\n\nA. Withdrawal\n\n1. Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every member state provided a member state may withdraw from the compact by specifically repealing the statute, which enacted the compact into law.\n\n2. Withdrawal from this compact shall be by the enactment of a statute repealing the same, but shall not take effect until one year after the effective date of such statute and until written notice of the withdrawal has been given by the withdrawing state to the Governor of each other member jurisdiction.\n\n3.

If an eligible student does not meet the English mastery standard at the end of the initial thirty months or at the end of an extension of the bilingual education program for such student, the local or regional board of education shall provide language transition and academic support services to such student. Such services may include, but need not be limited to, English as a second language programs, sheltered English programs, English immersion programs, or other research-based language development programs. Families may also receive guidance from school professionals to help their children make progress in their native language. If an eligible student enrolls in a secondary school when the student has fewer than thirty months remaining before graduation, the local or regional board of education shall assign the student to an English as a second language program and may provide intensive services to the student to enable the student to speak, write and comprehend English by the time the student graduates and to meet the course requirements for graduation.\n\n(e) Each local and regional board of education shall hold a meeting with the parents and legal guardians of eligible students to explain the benefits of the language program options available in the school district, including an English language immersion program, and any native language accommodations that may be available for the mastery examination, administered pursuant to section 10-14n.

Each member town shall elect at least one member. The committee report shall determine the number of members of such regional board and the representation of each town. The first members of such regional board of education shall be nominated and elected at a meeting of the legislative body of each town held within thirty days after the referendum creating the district. The regional board of education at its first meeting, called by the Commissioner of Education within ten days from the time the last member town to appoint members to the regional board has done so, shall organize and the members shall serve until their successors are elected and qualify. At such meeting, the board shall determine the term of office of each member according to the following principles: (1) The term of office of each successor shall be four years; (2) to establish a continuity of membership, a system of rotation shall be used; if the board has an even number of members, one-half of such number shall be elected every two years and if the board has an uneven number of members, no more than a bare majority or a bare minority shall be elected every two years, except when the unexpired portion of the term of a vacated office must be filled; (3) the same system of rotation shall be used for election of the representatives of each member town, if possible; (4) if necessary, it shall be determined by lot which of the initial members shall serve the short terms; (5) at the first election of members in accordance with subsection (b) or (c) of this section, no more than half the offices held by initial board members shall be filled; (6) the offices held by the remaining initial board members shall be filled at the second election held in accordance with subsection (b) or (c) of this section. Thereafter, members of the board shall be nominated and elected in their respective towns in accordance with subsection (b) or (c) of this section as determined by the legislative body of each town.\n\n(b) (1) At least thirty days before the expiration of the term of office of any board member, a town meeting shall be held in accordance with chapter 90 to nominate and elect a successor. Any person who is an elector of such town may vote at such meeting. If a vacancy occurs in the office of any member of the regional board of education, the town affected, at a town meeting called within thirty days from the beginning of such vacancy, shall nominate and elect a successor to serve for the unexpired portion of the term in accordance with the above procedure. (2) Where members of the regional school board are to be elected at-large under a plan for reapportionment recommended under subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 10-63l, and approved under sections 10-63m and 10-63n, at least thirty days before the expiration of the term of office of any board member, a meeting of the voters of the entire regional school district shall be held to nominate and elect successors in accordance with subsection (e) of this section. Any person who is an elector of any member town may vote at such regional meeting. Vacancies shall be filled by a regional meeting called within thirty days from the beginning of such vacancy.\n\n(c) Board members shall be nominated and elected in the same manner as town officers in accordance with the provisions of title 9 except that (1) section 9-167a and parts II and III of chapter 146 shall not apply, (2) the board members so elected shall take office in accordance with subsection (d) of this section and if members of the regional school board are elected at-large under a plan for reapportionment recommended under subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 10-63l, and approved under sections 10-63m and 10-63n, a caucus of the voters of the entire regional school district shall be held to nominate candidates for election to the board in accordance with subsection (e) of this section. At such caucus, any person who is an elector of any member town may vote. If a vacancy occurs in the office of any member of the regional board of education, the legislative body of the town affected shall elect a successor to serve until the next general election, at which time a successor shall be elected to serve any unexpired portion of such term, except that if members are elected at-large, such successor shall be nominated and elected at a meeting of the entire regional school district held as provided in subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(d) All members of a regional board of education, except those members regularly elected in the month of May, shall take office on the first day of the month following their election. Those members of a regional board of education regularly elected in the month of May shall take office on the first day of July. Such board shall hold an organizational meeting in the month following the last election of members thereof held in the member towns in any calendar year at which time the board shall elect by ballot from its membership a chairperson, a secretary, a treasurer and any other officer deemed necessary and may annually thereafter elect such officers. In the case of a tie vote in the balloting for any officer, such tie shall be broke by lot. The treasurer shall give bond to the regional board of education in an amount determined by the members thereof. The cost of such bond shall be borne by the district.\n\n(e) Each regional school district meeting and caucus held pursuant to subsection (b) and (c) of this section shall be conducted in accordance with standard parliamentary practice. A moderator shall be chosen to preside over such meeting or caucus. A majority of those present and eligible to vote at such meeting or caucus shall determine the manner in which any vote shall be taken. The moderator shall certify all results of such meeting or caucus to the secretary of the state who shall then officially notify each town within the regional school district of the result.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 1376; 1951, 1953, 1955, S. 901d; February, 1965, P.A. 470; 1967, P.A. 333, S. 1; 1969, P.A. 698, S. 8; 1971, P.A. 679, S. 1; P.A. 75-644, S. 11, 14; P.A. 77-614, S. 302, 610; P.A. 78-124, S. 1–4; 78-218, S. 33; P.A. 82-184, S. 1, 2.)\n\nHistory: 1965 act allowed initial regional board to serve until each member town has held a regular election rather than “until the first meeting in July next succeeding”, deleted references to one and three-year terms of office, provided that not more than a bare majority of terms on odd-numbered board expire in any one year and made nomination and election the same as for town board of education members unless done in special town meeting by ordinance; 1967 act returned section to provisions existing before 1965 act except that provisions for two or four year terms were deleted as was provision for half of terms expiring in one year for even-numbered board memberships; 1969 act divided section into subsections, made size of board and representation of towns determined in final committee report rather than by joint vote of town boards comprising district, made secretary of state board responsible for calling first meeting rather than the chairman of the study committee, provided complex guidelines for determining terms of initial members and added Subsecs.

At the annual meeting on the first Monday in May, the board shall present a budget which includes a statement of (1) estimated receipts and expenditures for the next fiscal year, (2) estimated receipts and expenditures for the current fiscal year, (3) estimated surplus or deficit in operating funds at the end of the current fiscal year, (4) bonded or other debt, (5) estimated per pupil expenditure for the current and for the next fiscal year, and (6) such other information as is necessary in the opinion of the board. Persons present and eligible to vote under section 7-6 may accept or reject the proposed budget except as provided below. No person who is eligible to vote in more than one town in the regional school district is eligible to cast more than one vote on any issue considered at a regional school district meeting or referendum held pursuant to this section. Any person who violates this section by fraudulently casting more than one vote or ballot per issue shall be fined not more than three thousand five hundred dollars and shall be imprisoned not more than two years and shall be disenfranchised. The regional board of education may, in the call to the meeting, designate that the vote on the motion to adopt the budget shall be by paper ballots at the district meeting held on the budget or by a “yes” or “no” vote on the voting tabulators in each of the member towns on the day following the district meeting. If submitted to a vote by voting tabulator, questions may be included on the ballot for persons voting “no” to indicate whether the budget is too high or too low, provided the vote on such questions shall be for advisory purposes only and not binding upon the board. Two hundred or more persons qualified to vote in any regional district meeting called to adopt a budget may petition the regional board, in writing, at least three days prior to such meeting, requesting that any item or items on the call of such meeting be submitted to the persons qualified to vote in the meeting for a vote by paper ballot or on the voting tabulators in each of the member towns on the day following the district meeting and in accordance with the appropriate procedures provided in section 7-7. If a majority of such persons voting reject the budget, the board shall, within four weeks thereafter and upon notice of not less than one week, call a district meeting to consider the same or an amended budget. Such meetings shall be convened at such intervals until a budget is approved. If the budget is not approved before the beginning of a fiscal year, the disbursing officer for each member town, or the designee of such officer, shall make necessary expenditures to such district in amounts equal to the total of the town's appropriation to the district for the previous year and the town's proportionate share in any increment in debt service over the previous fiscal year, pursuant to section 7-405 until the budget is approved. The town shall receive credit for such expenditures once the budget is approved for the fiscal year. After the budget is approved, the board shall estimate the share of the net expenses to be paid by each member town in accordance with subsection (b) of this section and notify the treasurer thereof. With respect to adoption of a budget for the period from the organization of the board to the beginning of the first full fiscal year, the board may use the above procedure at any time within such period. If the board needs to submit a supplementary budget, the general procedure specified in this section shall be used.\n\n(b) For the purposes of this section, “net expenses” means estimated expenditures, including estimated capital expenditures, less estimated receipts as presented in a regional school district budget. On the date or dates fixed by the board, each town in the district shall pay a share of the cost of capital outlay, including costs for school building projects under chapter 173, and current expenditures necessary for the operation of the district. The board shall determine the amount to be paid by each member town as follows: (1) In an amount that bears the same ratio to the net expenses of the district as the number of pupils resident in such town in average daily membership in the regional school district during the preceding school year bears to the total number of such pupils in all the member towns, provided that the board may recalculate such amount based on the number of pupils in average daily membership in the regional school district for the current school year and may adjust each member town's payment to the regional school district for the following fiscal year by the difference between the last such payment and the recalculated amount, or (2) in an amount established pursuant to an agreement, approved by the State Board of Education, among such member towns, provided if the payment by any such member town deviates in an amount that is greater than or equal to one per cent of the amount established in such agreement, the state board shall review and may approve or reject such deviation. Until the regional school district has been in operation for one year, such amounts shall be based on the average daily membership of pupils in like grades from each of such towns at any school at which children were in attendance at the expense of such towns during the preceding school year or in accordance with the provisions of the agreement between the member towns described in subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n(c) The board shall deposit or invest temporarily any funds which are not needed immediately for the operation of the school district as permitted in section 7-400 or 7-402. Any income derived from such deposits or investments shall be used at least semiannually to reduce the net expenses. The board shall use any budget appropriation which has not been expended by the end of the fiscal year to reduce the net expenses of the district for the following fiscal year. The board may borrow funds temporarily and issue notes or other obligations, and pay interest thereon, in anticipation of payments to be made to it by a member town or the state, for the operation of its schools. Such notes or obligations shall be authorized by resolution of the board, and shall be general obligations of the regional school district and its member towns. The date, maturity, interest rate, form, manner of sale and other terms of such notes or other obligations shall be determined by the board or any officer or body to whom the board delegates authority to make such determinations. Such notes may be renewed from time to time, provided all such notes shall mature and be payable no later than the end of the fiscal year during which such member town or state payments are payable.\n\n(d) (1) Prior to June 7, 2006, upon the recommendation and the approval of a majority of members on the board, a regional board of education may create a reserve fund to finance a specific capital improvement or the acquisition of any specific piece of equipment. Such fund shall thereafter be termed “reserve fund for specific capital improvements or equipment purchases”. No annual appropriation to such fund shall exceed one per cent of the annual district budget. Appropriations to such fund shall be included in the share of net expenses to be paid by each member town until the fund established pursuant to this subdivision is discontinued. The board shall annually submit a complete and detailed report of the condition of such fund to the member towns. Such fund may be discontinued, after recommendation by the board and approval by the board, and any amounts held in the fund shall be transferred to the general fund of the district.\n\n(2) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, and each fiscal year thereafter, a regional board of education, by a majority vote of its members, may create a reserve fund for educational expenditures. Such fund shall thereafter be termed “reserve fund for educational expenditures”. The aggregate amount of annual and supplemental appropriations by a district to such fund shall not exceed two per cent of the annual district budget for such fiscal year. Annual appropriations to such fund shall be included in the share of net expenses to be paid by each member town. Supplemental appropriations to such fund may be made from estimated fiscal year end surplus in operating funds. Interest and investment earnings received with respect to amounts held in the fund shall be credited to such fund. The board shall annually submit a complete and detailed report of the condition of such fund to the member towns. Upon the recommendation and approval by the regional board of education, any part or the whole of such fund may be used for educational expenditures. Upon the approval of any such expenditure an appropriation shall be set up, plainly designated for the educational expenditure for which it has been authorized. Any unexpended portion of such appropriation remaining shall revert to said fund. If any authorized appropriation is set up pursuant to the provisions of this subsection and through unforeseen circumstances the board is unable to expend the total amount of such appropriation, the board, by a majority vote of its members, may terminate such appropriation which then shall no longer be in effect. Such fund may be discontinued, after the recommendation and approval by the regional board of education, and any amounts held in the fund shall be transferred to the general fund of the district.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 1378; 1951, 1953, S. 906d; 1969, P.A. 698, S. 13; 1971, P.A. 679, S. 3, 4; P.A. 81-188; P.A. 83-82, S. 1, 2; 83-309, S. 1, 2; P.A. 84-255, S. 6, 21; 84-476, S. 1, 2; P.A. 92-262, S. 7, 42; P.A. 93-158, S. 5, 11; P.A. 94-245, S. 20, 46; P.A. 95-282, S. 5, 11; P.A. 96-244, S. 38, 63; P.A. 01-173, S. 9, 67; P.A. 04-117, S. 3; P.A. 06-192, S. 4; P.A. 11-20, S. 1; P.A. 13-258, S. 10; P.A. 15-215, S. 20; June Sp.

In computing the aggregate indebtedness of a regional school district for purposes of this section and section 7-374 there shall be excluded each bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness issued in anticipation of the receipt of (A) payments by a member town or the state for the operation of such district's schools and (B) proceeds from any state or federal grant for which the district has received a written commitment or for which an allocation has been approved by the State Bond Commission or from a contract with the state, a state agency or another municipality providing for the reimbursement of capital costs but only to the extent such indebtedness can be paid from such proceeds.\n\n(c) When a district has been authorized to issue general obligation bonds, notes or other obligations as provided by this section, the board may authorize, for a period not to exceed ten years, the issue of temporary notes in anticipation of the receipt of the proceeds from the sale of such bonds. Notes issued for a shorter period of time may be renewed by the issue of other notes, provided the period from the date of the original notes to the maturity of the last notes issued in renewal thereof shall not exceed ten years. The term of such notes shall not be included in computing the time within which such bonds shall mature, provided such term does not exceed four years. For any series of notes the term of which is extended past the fourth year, the provisions of section 7-378a providing for the retirement from budgeted funds of one-twentieth, or one-thirtieth, as applicable, of the net project cost, the reduction of the term of the bonds when sold and the commencement of the first principal payment of such bonds, shall apply with respect to each year beyond the fourth that the notes are outstanding. The provisions of section 7-373 shall be deemed to apply to such notes. The board, or such officer or body to whom the board delegates the authority to make such determinations, shall determine the date, maturity, interest rate, form, manner of sale and other terms of such notes which shall be general obligations of the regional school district and member towns. Such notes may bear interest or be sold at a discount. The interest or discount on such notes and any renewals thereof and the expense of preparing, issuing and marketing them may be included as a part of the cost of the project for the financing of which such bonds were authorized. Upon the sale of such bonds, the board shall apply immediately the proceeds thereof, to the extent required, to the payment of the principal and interest of all notes issued in anticipation thereof or deposit the proceeds in trust for such purpose with a bank or trust company, which may be the bank or trust company, if any, at which such notes are payable.\n\n(d) Subject to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, the board may deposit or invest the proceeds of bonds, notes or other obligations as permitted in section 7-400 or 7-402.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 1381; 1951, 1955, S. 911d; 1953, S. 919d; November, 1955, S.

(b) basing bond limit on aggregate indebtedness and annual receipts from taxation, placed four-year limit on temporary notes regardless of whether they are initial notes or renewals, rephrased other provisions concerning notes and added Subsec. (d) concerning investment or deposit of proceeds of bonds and notes; P.A. 74-239 amended Subsec. (a) to add statement that exercise of powers under section is not to be construed as amendment of regional plan; P.A. 86-350 made a variety of changes for purposes of clarification, updating the statutes to conform to current financial practices and to conform to anticipated changes in federal tax policy; P.A. 87-506 amended Subsec. (a) to provide for various methods of determining payment amounts; P.A. 89-337 allowed semiannual installments, provided that the first maturity date or sinking fund payment shall be not later than three years, rather than two, from the issuance date and clarified the powers which the board may delegate to an officer or a body; P.A. 93-158 amended Subsec. (a) by deleting provision re redemption by new issuance and amended Subsec. (b) by redefining “annual receipts from taxation” to be receipts for fiscal year preceding beginning of current year rather than those preceding close of last year and adding provision re exclusions from the computation of aggregate indebtedness, effective June 23, 1993; P.A. 95-282 amended Subsec. (d) to make technical changes, effective July 6, 1995, provided “any designation of a depository of public funds of the state or any municipality or regional school district, and any prescription of the method of supervision of the investment and reinvestment of trust funds of a municipality, made in accordance with the applicable provisions of sections 4-33, 7-401, 7-402, 7-403, subsection (c) of section 10-52 or subsection (d) of section 10-56 in effect on or before July 6, 1995, shall remain in effect until rescinded or otherwise modified in accordance with the provisions of public act 95-282” (Revisor's note: The reference to “section 10-52” appears to be a clerical error since Subsec. (c) of Sec. 10-51 was amended by Sec. 5 of P.A. 95-282); P.A. 96-244 revised effective date section of P.A. 95-282 but without affecting this section; P.A. 99-97 amended Subsec. (b) to add reference to Sec. 7-374 in computing the aggregate indebtedness of districts, effective June 3, 1999; June Sp. Sess. P.A. 05-6 amended Subsec. (c) to permit period to extend up to eight years and add language re terms extending past the fourth year, effective July 1, 2005; P.A. 07-87 amended Subsec. (a) to allow a 30-year term for bonds authorized pursuant to Ch. 173 on or after July 1, 1996, and amended Subsec. (c) to include reference to one-thirtieth of the net project cost, effective July 1, 2007; Nov. 24 Sp. Sess. P.A. 08-2 amended Subsec. (c) to extend maximum time period for issuance of temporary notes from eight to ten years and extend maximum time period for renewal of notes from eight to ten years, effective November 25, 2008.\n\nCited. 169 C. 613. Conclusion in 169 C. 613 that section applies only to amendments that directly affect voting rights of electors, and its function in light of Sec. 10-47c, reversed. 292 C. 784. Failure to strictly comply with statutory notice provisions does not automatically invalidate the result of a referendum conducted pursuant to Subsec. (a); a referendum may be judicially invalidated only when there were substantial violations of the governing statutes and, as a result of those violations, the reliability of the result of the election is seriously in doubt. 319 C. 245.",

If a holder or owner of any such bond or note of such regional school district files with the State Comptroller a verified statement describing such bond or note and alleging default in the payment thereof or the interest thereon, or both, the Comptroller shall immediately investigate the circumstances of the alleged default, prepare and file in his office a certificate setting forth his finding with respect thereto and serve a copy of such finding, by registered or certified mail, upon the treasurer or chief fiscal officer of such regional school district. Such investigation shall cover the current status with respect to the payment of principal of and interest on all outstanding bonds and notes of such regional school district, and the statement prepared and filed by the Comptroller pursuant to this section shall set forth a description of all bonds and notes of such regional school district found to be in default and the amount of principal and interest thereon past due. Upon the filing of such a certificate in the office of the Comptroller, the Comptroller shall thereafter deduct and withhold from the next succeeding payment of state aid or assistance otherwise due such regional school district such amount as is necessary to pay the principal of and interest on such bonds and notes of such regional school district then in default. If such amount is insufficient to pay all of such principal and interest, said Comptroller shall similarly deduct and withhold from the next succeeding payment of state aid and assistance, otherwise due to any town in such district which is currently in default of its annual payments to such district, such amount as is necessary to pay the principal of and interest on such bonds or notes remaining in default. If all such amounts withheld are insufficient to pay all such principal and interest, the Comptroller shall similarly deduct and withhold from each succeeding payment of state aid or assistance otherwise due such regional school district and such towns such amount or amounts thereof as may be required to pay all of the principal of and interest on such bonds and notes then in default. Payments of state aid or assistance so deducted and withheld shall be forwarded promptly by the Comptroller to the paying agent or agents for the bonds and notes in default for the sole purpose of payment of defaulted principal of and interest on such bonds or notes; provided, if any such payment of state aid or assistance so deducted or withheld is less than the total amount of all principal and interest on such bonds and notes, then the Comptroller shall forward to each paying agent an amount in the proportion that the amount of such bonds and notes in default payable by such paying agent bears to the total amount of the principal of and interest then in default on such bonds and notes of such regional school district. The Comptroller shall promptly notify the treasurer or the chief fiscal officer of such regional school district of any payment or payments made to any paying agent or paying agents of defaulted bonds or notes pursuant to this section.

The board of a regional educational service center shall have authority, within the limits prescribed by this part and as specified by the written agreement of the member boards, to establish policies for the regional educational service center, to determine the programs and services to be provided, to employ staff including a director of the center, to prepare and expend the budget and, within the limits authorized under this section, to provide for the financing of the programs and projects of the regional educational service center.\n\n(b) For the purpose of carrying out or administering a regional educational service center project, program or other function authorized under this section or refinancing existing indebtedness or funding debt service reserve or project reserve funds, a regional educational service center may, without limiting its authority under other provisions of law, borrow temporarily in anticipation of receipt of current revenues and issue bonds, notes or other obligations payable from or secured by any one or more of the following: (1) A pledge, lien, mortgage or other security interest in any or all of the income, proceeds, revenues and property, real or personal, of its projects, assets, programs or other functions, including the proceeds of grants, loans, advances, guarantees or contributions from the federal government, state or any other source; or (2) a pledge, lien, mortgage or other security interest in the property, real or personal, of projects to be financed by the bonds, notes or other obligations.\n\n(c) Bonds, notes or other obligations issued under this section may be issued in one or more series, shall bear such date or dates, be in such form, mature at such time or times, be payable at such place or places whether within the state or without, bear interest at such rate or rates, be in such denominations and form, with coupons attached, or registered, be fully negotiable, contain such conversion and redemption provisions, such other terms, covenants and conditions and be issued and sold in such manner as the regional educational service center, by resolution of the board of such center, determines, and may be payable at such time or times not exceeding twenty years from the date of issuance. Such bonds, notes or other obligations shall not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any debt limitation or restrictions and shall not be obligations of the state of Connecticut or any municipality, and each such bond, note or other obligation shall so state on its face. Neither the officers or members of the board of any regional educational service center nor any person executing the bond, note or other obligations shall be personally liable thereon by reason of the issuance thereof.\n\n(d) A regional educational service center may issue notes in anticipation of the receipt of proceeds from the sale of such bonds. If such notes are issued, the provisions of sections 7-378 and 7-378a, relating to the terms and conditions of issuing and renewing such notes, shall apply.\n\n(e) Each pledge, agreement or assignment made for the benefit or security of any bonds, notes or other obligations issued under this section shall be in effect until the principal and interest on the bonds, notes or other obligations for the benefit of which the same were made have been fully paid, or until provision is made for the payment in the manner provided in the resolution or resolutions authorizing their issuance. Any pledge or assignment made in respect of such bonds, notes or other obligations secured thereby shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge or assignment is made; any income, proceeds, revenues or property so pledged or assigned and thereafter received by the regional educational service center shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge, without any physical delivery thereof or further act; and the lien of any such pledge or assignment shall be valid and binding as against parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the regional educational service center, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution, trust indenture, agreement, assignment or other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded or filed, except for the recording of any mortgage or lien on real property or on any interest in real property.\n\n(f) A regional educational service center may enter into contractual agreements, including trust indentures or agreements with trustees, for the collection, investment and payment of pledged or assigned income, proceeds, revenues or property, the establishment of reserves, covenants and agreements for the benefit of the trustee or the holders of any bonds, notes or other obligations, and such other terms and conditions which are reasonable to delineate the respective rights, duties, safeguards, responsibilities and liabilities of the regional educational service center, holders of bonds, notes or other obligations and the trustee or assignee. Any such agreement may provide for the pledge or assigning of any assets or income from assets to which or in which the center has rights or interest, the vesting in such trustee or trustees of such property, rights, powers and duties in trust as the center may determine, which may include any or all of the property, rights, powers and duties of any trustee appointed by the holders of any bonds, notes or other obligations, or limiting or restricting the rights of any holder of any bonds, notes or other obligations, or limiting or abrogating the right of the holders of any bonds, notes or other obligations to appoint a trustee, or limiting the rights, powers and duties of such trustee, and may further provide for such other rights and remedies exercisable by the trustee as may be proper for the protection of the holders of any bonds, notes or other obligations and not otherwise in violation of law, including the acceleration of payment in the event of a default.\n\n(g) Any regional educational service center may obtain from a commercial bank or insurance company authorized to do business within or without this state a letter of credit, line of credit or other credit or liquidity facility, for the purpose of providing funds for the payment of such bonds, notes or other obligations required by their terms or by the holder thereof to be redeemed or repurchased at or prior to maturity or for providing additional security for such bonds, notes or other obligations. In connection therewith, a regional educational service center may authorize the execution of reimbursement agreements, remarketing agreements, standby bond purchase agreements, agreements for the purpose of moderating interest rate fluctuations and any other necessary or appropriate agreements. If a regional educational service center is required to draw upon any such credit facility, the amount of each loan made pursuant to such credit facility shall be repaid by the center as provided in such agreement with the provider of the credit facility, but no later than the last date on which the bond, notes or other obligations secured thereby would be required to mature by law. Such regional educational service center may pledge or assign or mortgage any of its income, proceeds, revenues or properties authorized by this section to secure its bonds, notes or other obligations to secure its payment obligations under any agreement entered into pursuant to this section.\n\n(h) Bonds, notes or other obligations issued by a regional educational service center under the provisions of this section are hereby made securities in which all public officers and public bodies of the state and its political subdivisions, all insurance companies, credit unions, building and loan associations, investment companies, savings banks, banking associations, trust companies, executors, administrators, trustees and other fiduciaries and pension, profit-sharing and retirement funds may properly and legally invest funds, including capital in their control or belonging to them. Such bonds are hereby made securities which may properly and legally be deposited with and received by any state or municipal officer or any agency or municipality of the state for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds or obligations of the state is now or may hereafter be authorized by law.\n\n(i) A regional educational service center shall be considered an agency of the state for purposes of subdivision (14) of subsection (d) of section 42a-9-109.\n\n(1972, P.A. 117, S. 3; P.A. 75-431; P.A. 78-77, S. 1, 2; 78-295, S. 2, 9; P.A. 80-154, S. 3, 5; P.A. 87-460, S. 1, 2; P.A. 95-259, S. 29, 32; May Sp.

The State Board of Education shall consider the results of any such appraisal in determining whether to renew such charter. The State Board of Education may deny an application for the renewal of a charter if (1) student progress has not been sufficiently demonstrated, as determined by the commissioner, (2) the governing council has not been sufficiently responsible for the operation of the school or has misused or spent public funds in a manner that is detrimental to the educational interests of the students attending the charter school, (3) the school has not been in compliance with the terms of the charter, applicable laws and regulations, (4) the efforts of the school have been insufficient to effectively attract, enroll and retain students from among the following populations: (A) Students with a history of low academic performance, (B) students who receive free or reduced priced lunches pursuant to federal law and regulations, (C) students with a history of behavioral and social difficulties, (D) students identified as requiring special education, or (E) students who are multilingual learners, or (5) the governing council of the state or local charter school has not provided evidence that such council has initiated substantive communication with the local or regional board of education of the town in which the state or local charter school is located to share student learning practices and experiences.

On and after July 1, 2015, any charter renewed by the State Board of Education shall include academic and organizational performance goals, developed by the state board, that set forth the performance indicators, measures and metrics that will be used by the state board to evaluate the charter school.\n\n(h) The Commissioner of Education may at any time place a charter school on probation if (1) the school has failed to (A) adequately demonstrate student progress, as determined by the commissioner, (B) comply with the terms of its charter or with applicable laws and regulations, (C) achieve measurable progress in reducing racial, ethnic and economic isolation, or (D) maintain its nonsectarian status, or (2) the governing council has demonstrated an inability to provide effective leadership to oversee the operation of the charter school or has not ensured that public funds are expended prudently or in a manner required by law. If a charter school is placed on probation, the commissioner shall provide written notice to the charter school of the reasons for such placement, not later than five days after the placement, and shall require the charter school to file with the Department of Education a corrective action plan acceptable to the commissioner not later than thirty-five days from the date of such placement. The charter school shall implement a corrective action plan accepted by the commissioner not later than thirty days after the date of such acceptance. The commissioner may impose any additional terms of probation on the school that the commissioner deems necessary to protect the educational or financial interests of the state. The charter school shall comply with any such additional terms not later than thirty days after the date of their imposition. The commissioner shall determine the length of time of the probationary period, which may be up to one year, provided the commissioner may extend such period, for up to one additional year, if the commissioner deems it necessary. In the event that the charter school does not file or implement the corrective action plan within the required time period or does not comply with any additional terms within the required time period, the Commissioner of Education may withhold grant funds from the school until the plan is fully implemented or the school complies with the terms of probation, provided the commissioner may extend the time period for such implementation and compliance for good cause shown. Whenever a charter school is placed on probation, the commissioner shall notify the parents or guardians of students attending the school of the probationary status of the school and the reasons for such status. During the term of probation, the commissioner may require the school to file interim reports concerning any matter the commissioner deems relevant to the probationary status of the school, including financial reports or statements. No charter school on probation may increase its student enrollment or engage in the recruitment of new students without the consent of the commissioner.\n\n(i) The State Board of Education may revoke a charter if a charter school has failed to: (1) Comply with the terms of probation, including the failure to file or implement a corrective action plan; (2) demonstrate satisfactory student progress, as determined by the commissioner; (3) comply with the terms of its charter or applicable laws and regulations; or (4) manage its public funds in a prudent or legal manner. Unless an emergency exists, prior to revoking a charter, the State Board of Education shall provide the governing council of the charter school with a written notice of the reasons for the revocation, including the identification of specific incidents of noncompliance with the law, regulation or charter or other matters warranting revocation of the charter. The State Board of Education shall also provide the governing council with the opportunity to demonstrate compliance with all requirements for the retention of its charter by providing the State Board of Education or a subcommittee of the board, as determined by the State Board of Education, with a written or oral presentation. Such presentation shall include an opportunity for the governing council to present documentary and testimonial evidence to refute the facts cited by the State Board of Education for the proposed revocation or in justification of its activities. Such opportunity shall not constitute a contested case within the meaning of chapter 54. The State Board of Education shall determine, not later than thirty days after the date of an oral presentation or receipt of a written presentation, whether and when the charter shall be revoked and notify the governing council of the decision and the reasons therefor. A decision to revoke a charter shall not constitute a final decision for purposes of chapter 54. In the event an emergency exists in which the commissioner finds that there is imminent harm to the students attending a charter school, the State Board of Education may immediately revoke the charter of the school, provided the notice concerning the reasons for the revocation is sent to the governing council not later than ten days after the date of revocation and the governing council is provided an opportunity to make a presentation to the board not later than twenty days from the date of such notice.\n\n(j) (1) The governing council of a state or local charter school may apply to the State Board of Education for a waiver of the requirements of the enrollment lottery described in subdivision (8) of subsection (d) of this section, provided such state or local charter school has as its primary purpose the establishment of education programs designed to serve one or more of the following populations: (A) Students with a history of behavioral and social difficulties, (B) students identified as requiring special education, (C) students who are multilingual learners, or (D) students of a single gender.\n\n(2) An enrollment lottery described in subdivision (8) of subsection (d) of this section shall not be held for a local charter school that is established at a school that is among the schools with a percentage equal to or less than five per cent when all schools are ranked highest to lowest in accountability index scores, as defined in section 10-223e.\n\n(3) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (1) of this subsection, on and after July 1, 2023, no application for enrollment in a state or local charter school shall inquire or request information about an applicant student's need for or receipt of special education and related services, and the criteria for administering an enrollment lottery for a state or local charter school shall not include consideration of a student's need for or status as requiring special education and related services.\n\n(P.A. 96-214, S. 2; P.A. 97-290, S. 7, 29; P.A. 98-252, S. 6, 80; P.A. 99-289, S. 5, 11; P.A. 00-220, S. 5, 43; P.A. 03-76, S. 7; P.A. 06-55, S. 1; June Sp.

The board of education shall be eligible for reimbursement for such special education costs pursuant to section 10-76g.\n\n(2) The local or regional board of education of the school district in which the local charter school is located shall be responsible for the financial support of such local charter school at a level that is at least equal to the product of (A) the per pupil cost for the fiscal year two years prior to the fiscal year for which support will be provided, and (B) the number of students attending such local charter school in the current fiscal year. As used in this subdivision, “per pupil cost” means, for a local or regional board of education, the quotient of the current program expenditures, as defined in section 10-262f, divided by the number of resident students, as defined in section 10-262f, of such local or regional board of education.\n\n(c) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, and each fiscal year thereafter, the State Board of Education may approve, within available appropriations, a per student grant to a local charter school in an amount not to exceed three thousand dollars for each student enrolled in such local charter school, provided the local or regional board of education for such local charter school and the representatives of the exclusive bargaining unit for certified employees, chosen pursuant to section 10-153b, mutually agree on staffing flexibility in such local charter school, and such agreement is approved by the State Board of Education. The state shall make such payments, in accordance with this subsection, to the fiscal authority for a local charter school for each student enrolled in such school as follows: Twenty-five per cent of the amount not later than July fifteenth and September first based on estimated student enrollment on May first, and twenty-five per cent of the amount not later than January first and the remaining amount not later than April first, each based on student enrollment on October first.\n\n(d) (1) As used in this subsection:\n\n(A) “Total charter need students” means the sum of (i) the number of students enrolled in state charter schools under the control of the governing authority for such state charter schools for the school year, and (ii) for the school year commencing July 1, 2021, and each school year thereafter, (I) thirty per cent of the number of children enrolled in such state charter schools eligible for free or reduced price meals or free milk, (II) fifteen per cent of the number of such children eligible for free or reduced price meals or free milk in excess of the number of such children eligible for free or reduced price meals or free milk that is equal to sixty per cent of the total number of children enrolled in such state charter schools, and (III) twenty-five per cent of the number of students enrolled in such state charter schools who are multilingual learners, as defined in section 10-76kk.\n\n(B) “Foundation” has the same meaning as provided in section 10-262f.\n\n(C) “Charter full weighted funding per student” means the quotient of (i) the product of the total charter need students and the foundation, and (ii) the number of students enrolled in state charter schools under the control of the governing authority for such state charter schools for the school year.\n\n(D) “Charter grant adjustment” means the absolute value of the difference between the foundation and charter full weighted funding per student for state charter schools under the control of the governing authority for such state charter schools for the school year.\n\n(2) For the fiscal year ending July 1, 2022, the state shall pay in accordance with this subsection, to the fiscal authority for a state charter school for each student enrolled in such school, the foundation plus four and one-tenth per cent of its charter grant adjustment.\n\n(3) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, the state shall pay in accordance with this subsection, to the fiscal authority for a state charter school for each student enrolled in such school, the foundation plus twenty-five and forty-two-one-hundredths per cent of its charter grant adjustment.\n\n(4) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, the state shall pay in accordance with this subsection, to the fiscal authority for a state charter school for each student enrolled in such school, the foundation plus thirty-six and eight-one-hundredths per cent of its charter grant adjustment.\n\n(5) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, and each fiscal year thereafter, the state shall pay in accordance with this subsection, to the fiscal authority for a state charter school for each student enrolled in such school, the foundation plus fifty-six and seven tenths per cent of its charter grant adjustment.\n\n(6) Payments under subdivisions (2) to (5), inclusive, of this subsection shall be paid as follows: Twenty-five per cent of the amount not later than July fifteenth and September first based on estimated student enrollment on May first, and twenty-five per cent of the amount not later than January first and the remaining amount not later than April first, each based on student enrollment on October first.\n\n(7) In the case of a student identified as requiring special education, the school district in which the student resides shall: (A) Hold the planning and placement team meeting for such student and shall invite representatives from the charter school to participate in such meeting; and (B) pay the state charter school, on a quarterly basis, an amount equal to the difference between the reasonable cost of educating such student and the sum of the amount received by the state charter school for such student pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection and amounts received from other state, federal, local or private sources calculated on a per pupil basis. Such school district shall be eligible for reimbursement pursuant to section 10-76g. The charter school a student requiring special education attends shall be responsible for ensuring that such student receives the services mandated by the student's individualized education program whether such services are provided by the charter school or by the school district in which the student resides.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, if at the end of a fiscal year amounts received by a state charter school, pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (d) of this section, are unexpended, the charter school (1) may use, for the expenses of the charter school for the following fiscal year, up to ten per cent of such amounts, and (2) may (A) create a reserve fund to finance a specific capital or equipment purchase or another specified project as may be approved by the commissioner, and (B) deposit into such fund up to five per cent of such amounts.\n\n(f) The local or regional board of education of the school district in which the charter school is located shall provide transportation services for students of the charter school who reside in such school district pursuant to section 10-273a unless the charter school makes other arrangements for such transportation.

Any local or regional board of education providing transportation services under this subsection may suspend such services in accordance with the provisions of section 10-233c. The parent or guardian of any student denied the transportation services required to be provided pursuant to this subsection may appeal such denial in the manner provided in sections 10-186 and 10-187.\n\n(g) Charter schools shall be eligible to the same extent as boards of education for any grant for special education, competitive state grants and grants pursuant to sections 10-17g and 10-266w.\n\n(h) If the commissioner finds that any charter school uses a grant under this section for a purpose that is inconsistent with the provisions of this part, the commissioner may require repayment of such grant to the state.\n\n(i) Charter schools shall receive, in accordance with federal law and regulations, any federal funds available for the education of any pupils attending public schools.\n\n(j) The governing council of a charter school may (1) contract or enter into other agreements for purposes of administrative or other support services, transportation, plant services or leasing facilities or equipment, and (2) receive and expend private funds or public funds, including funds from local or regional boards of education and funds received by local charter schools for out-of-district students, for school purposes.\n\n(k) If in any fiscal year, more than one new state or local charter school is approved pursuant to section 10-66bb and is awaiting funding pursuant to the provisions of this section, the State Board of Education shall determine which school is funded first based on a consideration of the following factors in order of importance as follows: (1) The quality of the proposed program as measured against the criteria required in the charter school application process pursuant to section 10-66bb, (2) whether the applicant has a demonstrated record of academic success by students, (3) whether the school is located in a school district with a demonstrated need for student improvement, and (4) whether the applicant has plans concerning the preparedness of facilities, staffing and outreach to students.\n\n(l) Within available appropriations, the state may provide a grant in an amount not to exceed seventy-five thousand dollars to any newly approved state charter school that assists the state in meeting its obligations pursuant to the decision in Sheff v. O'Neill, 238 Conn. 1 (1996), or any related stipulation or order in effect, as determined by the Commissioner of Education, for start-up costs associated with the new charter school program.\n\n(m) Charter schools may, to the same extent as local and regional boards of education, enter into cooperative arrangements as described in section 10-158a, provided such arrangements are approved by the Commissioner of Education.

Payments pursuant to this section for each estimated total grant of less than fifteen hundred dollars shall be made in a single installment in May of the fiscal year in which such programs are offered, based on a revised estimate of the eligible costs of adult education filed with the Commissioner of Education at such time as the commissioner prescribes.

No child may be required to obtain a prescription for a substance covered by the Controlled Substances Act, 21 USC 801 et seq., as amended from time to time, as a condition of attending school, receiving an evaluation under section 10-76ff or receiving services pursuant to sections 10-76a to 10-76h, inclusive, or the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 USC 1400 et seq., as amended from time to time.\n\n(2) Not later than December 1, 2017, each local and regional board of education shall (A) enroll as a provider in the state medical assistance program, (B) participate in the Medicaid School Based Child Health Program administered by the Department of Social Services, and (C) submit billable service information electronically to the Department of Social Services, or its billing agent. For each local or regional board of education with a student population of less than one thousand students, a cost benefit analysis may be conducted by such local or regional board of education in a form prescribed by the Commissioner of Social Services to determine whether the cost to participate in the medical assistance program exceeds the revenue that would be generated for the local or regional board of education. A local or regional board of education exempted from the requirements of this subdivision after such cost benefit analysis shall complete and submit such analysis to the commissioner every three years in order to remain exempt. Not later than September 1, 2018, the Commissioner of Social Services shall develop a cost benefit analysis model and determine the feasibility of directly certifying students as eligible for Medicaid benefits on behalf of a local or regional board of education.\n\n(3) Any local or regional board of education may enter into an agreement with a third-party vendor or another local or regional board of education to comply with the requirements of subdivision (2) of this subsection. Such agreement may provide that costs for services provided on behalf of a local or regional board of education shall be paid from the grant received pursuant to subdivision (5) of this subsection and shall be contingent on receipt of funds from such grant in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of providing such service. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 17b-99, the Commissioner of Social Services shall not assess or extrapolate any overpayments to any third-party provider that contracts with the local or regional board of education to provide Medicaid services, when the error is determined by the department to be caused by (A) a clerical error; (B) information provided by the local or regional board of education; or (C) another third-party vendor in the submission of billable service information.\n\n(4) Each local or regional board of education, through the planning and placement team established in accordance with regulations adopted by the State Board of Education under this section, shall determine a child's Medicaid enrollment status. In determining Medicaid enrollment status, the planning and placement team shall: (A) Inquire of the parents or guardians of each such child whether the child is enrolled in or may be eligible for Medicaid; and (B) if the child may be eligible for Medicaid, (i) request that the parent or guardian of the child apply for Medicaid, and (ii) comply with the requirements under 34 CFR 300.154, as amended from time to time, prior to billing for services under the Medicaid School Based Child Health Program administered by the Department of Social Services. For the purpose of determining Medicaid rates for Medicaid eligible special education and related services based on a representative cost sampling method, the board of education shall make available documentation of the provision and costs of Medicaid eligible special education and related services for any students receiving such services, regardless of an individual student's Medicaid enrollment status, to the Commissioner of Social Services or to the commissioner's authorized agent at such time and in such manner as prescribed. For the purpose of determining Medicaid rates for Medicaid eligible special education and related services based on an actual cost method, the local or regional board of education shall submit documentation of the costs and utilization of Medicaid eligible special education and related services for all students receiving such services to the Commissioner of Social Services or to the commissioner's authorized agent at such time and in such manner as prescribed. The commissioner or such agent may use information received from local or regional boards of education for the purposes of (I) ascertaining students' Medicaid eligibility status, (II) submitting Medicaid claims, (III) complying with state and federal audit requirements, and (IV) determining Medicaid rates for Medicaid eligible special education and related services. No child shall be denied special education and related services in the event the parent or guardian refuses to apply for Medicaid.\n\n(5) Beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2004, the Commissioner of Social Services shall make grant payments to local or regional boards of education in amounts representing fifty per cent of the federal portion of Medicaid claims processed for Medicaid eligible special education and related services provided to Medicaid eligible students in the school district. Beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009, the commissioner shall exclude any enhanced federal medical assistance percentages in calculating the federal portion of such Medicaid claims processed. Such grant payments shall be made on at least a quarterly basis and may represent estimates of amounts due to local or regional boards of education. Any grant payments made on an estimated basis, including payments made by the Department of Education for the fiscal years prior to the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, shall be subsequently reconciled to grant amounts due based upon filed and accepted Medicaid claims and Medicaid rates. If, upon review, it is determined that a grant payment or portion of a grant payment was made for ineligible or disallowed Medicaid claims, the local or regional board of education shall reimburse the Department of Social Services for any grant payment amount received based upon ineligible or disallowed Medicaid claims.\n\n(6) Pursuant to federal law, the Commissioner of Social Services, as the state's Medicaid agent, shall determine rates for Medicaid eligible special education and related services pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection. The Commissioner of Social Services may request and the Commissioner of Education and towns and regional school districts shall provide information as may be necessary to set such rates.\n\n(7) Based on school district special education and related services expenditures, the state's Medicaid agent shall report and certify to the federal Medicaid authority the state match required by federal law to obtain Medicaid reimbursement of eligible special education and related services costs.\n\n(8) Payments received pursuant to this section shall be paid to the local or regional board of education which has incurred such costs in addition to the funds appropriated by the town to such board for the current fiscal year.\n\n(9) (A) The planning and placement team shall, in accordance with the provisions of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, 20 USC 1400, et seq., as amended from time to time, develop and include a statement of transition service needs in the individualized education program for each child requiring special education, beginning not later than the first individualized education program to be in effect when such child becomes fourteen years of age, or younger if the planning and placement team determines it is appropriate. Such individualized education program shall include (i) appropriate measurable postsecondary goals based upon age-appropriate transition assessments related to training, education, employment and, where appropriate, independent living skills; and (ii) the transition services, including courses of study, needed to assist such child in reaching those goals. Such individualized education program shall be updated annually thereafter in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed as requiring the Department of Aging and Disability Services to lower the age of transitional services for a child with disabilities from sixteen to fourteen years of age.\n\n(B) At the first planning and placement team meeting when a child reaches the age of fourteen and has a statement of transition service needs included in such child's individualized education program pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, the planning and placement team shall for each public transition program, as defined in section 10-74o and each program for adults for which such child may be eligible after graduation, (i) upon the approval of the parent or guardian of such child, or a surrogate parent of such child appointed pursuant to section 10-94g, or such child if such child is an emancipated minor, notify the state agency that provides such program about the potential eligibility of such child, and (ii) provide such parent, guardian, surrogate parent or child a listing of such programs that includes, but is not limited to, (I) a plain language description of such program, (II) eligibility requirements for such program, and (III) deadlines and instructions for applications for such programs.\n\n(C) Not later than the planning and placement team meeting that occurs approximately two years prior to a child's anticipated graduation from high school or the end of the school year in which a child will reach twenty-two years of age, whichever is expected to occur first based on such child's individualized education program, the planning and placement team shall (i) upon the approval of the parent or guardian of such child, or a surrogate parent of such child appointed pursuant to section 10-94g or such child if such child is an emancipated minor or eighteen years of age or older, (I) notify any state agency that provides a program for adults for which such child may be eligible about the potential eligibility of such child, (II) invite a representative from each such agency to attend the planning and placement team meeting for the purpose of establishing contact with and counseling the parent, guardian, surrogate parent or child on the process for the anticipated transfer of services upon such child graduating from high school or upon the end of the school year in which such child reaches twenty-two years of age, whichever is sooner, and (III) permit and facilitate contact and coordination between each such agency and such parent, guardian, surrogate parent or child for the purpose of easing the process for the transfer of services, (ii) provide such parent, guardian, surrogate parent or child a listing of each program for adults for which such child may be eligible that includes, but is not limited to, (I) a plain language description of such program, (II) eligibility requirements for such program, and (III) deadlines and instructions for applications to such programs, and (iii) assist such parent, guardian, surrogate parent or child in completing an application to any such programs.\n\n(10) (A) Each local and regional board of education responsible for providing special education and related services to a child or pupil shall notify the parent or guardian of a child who requires or who may require special education, a pupil if such pupil is an emancipated minor or eighteen years of age or older who requires or who may require special education or a surrogate parent appointed pursuant to section 10-94g, in writing, at least five school days before such board proposes to, or refuses to, initiate or change the child's or pupil's identification, evaluation or educational placement or the provision of a free appropriate public education to the child or pupil.\n\n(B) Upon request by a parent, guardian, pupil or surrogate parent, the responsible local or regional board of education shall provide such parent, guardian, pupil or surrogate parent an opportunity to meet with a member of the planning and placement team designated by such board prior to the referral planning and placement team meeting at which the assessments and evaluations of the child or pupil who requires or may require special education is presented to such parent, guardian, pupil or surrogate parent for the first time. Such meeting shall be for the sole purpose of discussing the planning and placement team process and any concerns such parent, guardian, pupil or surrogate parent has regarding the child or pupil who requires or may require special education.\n\n(C) Such parent, guardian, pupil or surrogate parent shall (i) be given at least five school days' prior notice of any planning and placement team meeting conducted for such child or pupil, (ii) have the right to be present at and participate in all portions of such meeting at which an educational program for such child or pupil is developed, reviewed or revised, (iii) have the right to have (I) advisors of such person's own choosing and at such person's own expense, (II) the school paraprofessional assigned to such child or pupil, if any, (III) such child or pupil's birth-to-three service coordinator, if any, and (IV) a language interpreter, including a registered interpreter for persons who are deaf, hard of hearing or deafblind, who is present in person or available by telephone or through an online technology platform, or through an Internet web site or other electronic application approved by the State Board of Education, provided by the responsible local or regional board of education if there is an apparent need or upon the request of such parent, guardian, pupil or surrogate parent, who shall attend and participate or be available in all portions of such meeting at which an educational program for such child or pupil is developed, reviewed or revised, and (iv) have the right to have each recommendation made in such child or pupil's birth-to-three individualized transition plan, as required by section 17a-248e, if any, addressed by the planning and placement team during such meeting at which an educational program for such child or pupil is developed.\n\n(D) Immediately upon the formal identification of any child as a child requiring special education and at each planning and placement team meeting for such child, the responsible local or regional board of education shall inform the parent or guardian of such child or surrogate parent or, in the case of a pupil who is an emancipated minor or eighteen years of age or older, the pupil of (i) the laws relating to special education, (ii) the rights of such parent, guardian, surrogate parent or pupil under such laws and the regulations adopted by the State Board of Education relating to special education, including the right of a parent, guardian or surrogate parent to (I) withhold from enrolling such child in kindergarten, in accordance with the provisions of section 10-184, (II) have advisors and the school paraprofessional assigned to such child or pupil attend and participate in all portions of such meeting at which an educational program for such child or pupil is developed, reviewed or revised, in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (C) of this subdivision, (III) obtain the plain language resources available on the Department of Education's Internet web site pursuant to subsection (g) of section 10-76h explaining the hearing and appeals process, as provided in section 10-76h, available to such child or pupil if there is a disagreement about the individualized education program, identification, evaluation or educational placement of or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child or pupil, and (IV) receive information regarding free and low-cost legal assistance, and (iii) any relevant information and resources relating to individualized education programs created by the Department of Education, including, but not limited to, information relating to transition resources and services for high school students and the Parent's Guide to Special Education in Connecticut developed by the department. If such parent, guardian, surrogate parent or pupil does not attend a planning and placement team meeting, the responsible local or regional board of education shall mail such information to such person. Each responsible local or regional board of education shall provide a child or pupil's individualized education program, any documents relating to such program and all the information required pursuant to this subparagraph translated into the primary language spoken by such parent, guardian, surrogate parent or pupil if there is an apparent need or upon the request of the parent guardian, surrogate parent or pupil.\n\n(E) Each local and regional board of education shall have in effect at the beginning of each school year an educational program for each child or pupil who has been identified as eligible for special education, and shall provide (i) the informational handout described in section 10-74v to each child with an individualized education program or plan pursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and (ii) the Parent's Guide to Special Education in Connecticut developed by the Department of Education and the rights and resources available to such child in the provision of special education and related services.\n\n(F) (i) At each initial planning and placement team meeting for a child or pupil, the responsible local or regional board of education shall inform the parent, guardian, surrogate parent or pupil of the laws relating to physical restraint and seclusion pursuant to section 10-236b and the rights of such parent, guardian, surrogate parent or pupil under such laws and the regulations adopted by the State Board of Education relating to physical restraint and seclusion and the right of such parent, guardian, surrogate parent or pupil, during such meeting at which an educational program for such child or pupil is developed, to have (I) such child or pupil's birth-to-three service coordinator attend and participate in all portions of such meeting, and (II) each recommendation made in the transition plan, as required by section 17a-248e, by such child or pupil's birth-to-three service coordinator addressed by the planning and placement team.\n\n(ii) At the first planning and placement team meeting after a child who requires special education and related services reaches the age of fourteen, each responsible local or regional board of education shall provide information to the child and the parent, guardian or surrogate parent about the full range of decision-making supports, including alternatives to guardianship and conservatorship, and the online resource developed by the Department of Education pursuant to section 10-74s. The responsible local or regional board of education shall continue to provide such information to the child and the parent, guardian or surrogate parent at least annually thereafter.\n\n(iii) Each responsible local or regional board of education shall provide the notice created by the Mediation Services Coordinator pursuant to subdivision (7) of subsection (a) of section 10-76z to each parent, guardian or surrogate parent of any child who requires special education by (I) distributing such notice to such parents, guardians or surrogate parents at the beginning of each school year, and (II) reading such notice out loud at the conclusion of the first planning and placement team meeting at the beginning of each school year.\n\n(G) Upon request by a parent, guardian, pupil or surrogate parent, the responsible local or regional board of education shall provide the results of the assessments and evaluations used in the determination of eligibility for special education for a child or pupil to such parent, guardian, surrogate parent or pupil at least three school days before the referral planning and placement team meeting at which such results of the assessments and evaluations will be discussed for the first time.\n\n(H) Each local or regional board of education shall monitor the development of each child who, pursuant to subsection (a) of section 17a-248e, has been (i) referred for a registration on a mobile application designated by the Commissioner of Early Childhood, in partnership with such child's parent, guardian or surrogate parent, or (ii) provided a form for such child's parent, guardian or surrogate parent to complete and submit to such local or regional board of education that screens for developmental and social-emotional delays using a validated screening tool, such as the Ages and Stages Questionnaire and the Ages and Stages Social-Emotional Questionnaire, or its equivalent. If such monitoring results in suspecting a child of having a developmental delay, the board shall schedule a planning and placement team meeting with such child's parent, guardian or surrogate parent for the purposes of identifying services for which such child may be eligible, including, but not limited to, a preschool program under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Act, 20 USC 1471 et seq. If a parent, guardian or surrogate parent of any child referred for a registration on the mobile application or provided a form to complete and submit, pursuant to subsection (a) of section 17a-248e, fails to complete such registration or complete and submit such form after a period of six months from the date of such referral or provision of such form, the board shall send a reminder, in the form and manner determined by the board, to such parent, guardian or surrogate parent to complete such registration or complete and submit such form. The board shall send another reminder after a period of one year from such referral or provision of such form if such registration remains incomplete or such form is not submitted.\n\n(I) Prior to any planning and placement team meeting for a child or pupil in which an educational program for such child or pupil is developed, reviewed or revised, if the parent, guardian, pupil or surrogate parent has requested that the school paraprofessional assigned to such child or pupil attend such meeting, then the responsible local or regional board of education shall provide (i) adequate notice of such meeting to such school paraprofessional so that such school paraprofessional may adequately prepare for such meeting, and (ii) training, upon request of such school paraprofessional, on the role of such school paraprofessional at such meeting. Following such meeting, such school paraprofessional, or any other paraprofessional who is providing special education or related services to such child, shall review such educational program with a supervisor, as needed, and be permitted to view such educational program in order to be able to provide special education or related services to such child or pupil in accordance with such educational program.\n\n(11) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, for purposes of Medicaid reimbursement, when recommended by the planning and placement team and specified on the individualized education program, a service eligible for reimbursement under the Medicaid program shall be deemed to be authorized by a practitioner of the healing arts under 42 CFR 440.130, provided such service is recommended by an appropriately licensed or certified individual and is within the individual's scope of practice. Certain items of durable medical equipment, recommended pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, may be subject to prior authorization requirements established by the Commissioner of Social Services. Diagnostic and evaluation services eligible for reimbursement under the Medicaid program and recommended by the planning and placement team shall also be deemed to be authorized by a practitioner of the healing arts under 42 CFR 440.130 provided such services are recommended by an appropriately licensed or certified individual and are within the individual's scope of practice.\n\n(12) The Commissioner of Social Services shall implement the policies and procedures necessary for the purposes of this subsection while in the process of adopting such policies and procedures in regulation form, provided notice of intent to adopt the regulations is published in the Connecticut Law Journal within twenty days of implementing the policies and procedures. Such policies and procedures shall be valid until the time final regulations are effective.\n\n(b) In accordance with the regulations of the State Board of Education, each local and regional board of education shall: (1) Provide special education for school-age children requiring special education who are described in subparagraph (A) of subdivision (5) of section 10-76a. The obligation of the school district under this subsection shall terminate when such child is graduated from high school or at the end of the school year during which such child reaches age twenty-two, whichever occurs first; and (2) provide special education for children requiring special education who are described in subparagraph (A) or (C) of subdivision (5) of section 10-76a. The State Board of Education shall define the criteria by which each local or regional board of education shall determine whether a given child is eligible for special education pursuant to this subdivision, and such determination shall be made by the board of education when requested by a parent or guardian, or upon referral by a physician, clinic or social worker, provided the parent or guardian so permits. To meet its obligations under this subdivision, each local or regional board of education may, with the approval of the State Board of Education, make agreements with any private school, agency or institution to provide the necessary preschool special education program, provided such private facility has an existing program which adequately meets the special education needs, according to standards established by the State Board of Education, of the preschool children for whom such local or regional board of education is required to provide such an education and provided such district does not have such an existing program in its public schools. Such private school, agency or institution may be a facility which has not been approved by the Commissioner of Education for special education, provided such private facility is approved by the commissioner as an independent school or licensed by the Office of Early Childhood as a child care center, group child care home or family child care home, as described in section 19a-77, or be both approved and licensed. The State Board of Education shall adopt or update regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to implement the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(c) Each local or regional board of education may provide special education for children requiring it who are described by subparagraph (B) of subdivision (5) of section 10-76a and for other exceptional children for whom provision of special education is not required by law.\n\n(d) To meet its obligations under sections 10-76a to 10-76g, inclusive, any local or regional board of education may make agreements with another such board or subject to the consent of the parent or guardian of any child affected thereby, make agreements, or on and after July 1, 2019, enter into a contract with any private provider of special education services, as defined in section 10-91g, private school, or public or private agency or institution, including a group home to provide the necessary programs or services, but no expenditures made pursuant to a contract with a private provider of special education services, private school, agency or institution for such special education shall be paid under the provisions of section 10-76g, unless (1) such contract includes a description of the educational program and other treatment the child is to receive, a statement of minimal goals and objectives which it is anticipated such child will achieve, an estimated time schedule for returning the child to the community or transferring such child to another appropriate facility, and an explanation of how the tuition or costs for services provided under the agreement or contract are to be calculated, (2) subject to the provisions of this subsection, the educational needs of the child for whom such special education is being provided cannot be met by public school arrangements in the opinion of the commissioner who, before granting approval of such contract for purposes of payment, shall consider such factors as the particular needs of the child, the appropriateness and efficacy of the program offered by such private school, agency or institution, and the economic feasibility of comparable alternatives, and (3) commencing with the 1987-1988 school year and for each school year thereafter, each such private provider of special education services, private school, agency or institution has been approved for special education by the Commissioner of Education or by the appropriate agency for facilities located out of state, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection or any regulations adopted by the State Board of Education setting placement priorities, placements pursuant to this section and payments under section 10-76g may be made pursuant to such a contract if the public arrangements are more costly than the private provider of special education services, private school, institution or agency, provided the private provider of special education services, private school, institution or agency meets the educational needs of the child and its program is appropriate and efficacious. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection to the contrary, nothing in this subsection shall (A) require the removal of a child from a nonapproved facility if the child was placed there prior to July 7, 1987, pursuant to the determination of a planning and placement team that such a placement was appropriate and such placement was approved by the Commissioner of Education, or (B) prohibit the placement of a child at a nonapproved facility if a planning and placement team determines prior to July 7, 1987, that the child be placed in a nonapproved facility for the 1987-1988 school year. Each child placed in a nonapproved facility as described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subdivision (3) of this subsection may continue at the facility provided the planning and placement team or hearing officer appointed pursuant to section 10-76h determines that the placement is appropriate. Expenditures incurred by any local or regional board of education to maintain children in nonapproved facilities as described in said subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall be paid pursuant to the provisions of section 10-76g. Any local or regional board of education may enter into a contract with the owners or operators of any sheltered workshop or rehabilitation center for provision of an education occupational training program for children requiring special education who are at least sixteen years of age, provided such workshop or institution shall have been approved by the appropriate state agency. Whenever any child is identified by a local or regional board of education as a child requiring special education and such board of education determines that the requirements for special education could be met by a program provided within the district or by agreement with another board of education except for the child's need for services other than educational services such as medical, psychiatric or institutional care or services, such board of education may meet its obligation to furnish special education for such child by paying the reasonable cost of special education instruction in a private provider of special education services, private school, hospital or other institution provided such board of education or the commissioner concurs that placement in such institution is necessary and proper and no state institution is available to meet such child's needs. Any such private provider of special education services, private school, hospital or other institution receiving such reasonable cost of special education instruction by such board of education shall submit all required documentation to such board of education for purposes of submitting claims to the Medicaid School Based Child Health Program administered by the Department of Social Services.\n\n(e) (1) Any local or regional board of education which provides special education pursuant to any mandates in this section shall provide transportation, to and from, but not beyond the curb of, the residence of the child, unless otherwise agreed upon by the board and the parent or guardian of the child, tuition, room and board and other items necessary to the provision of such special education except for children who are placed in a residential facility because they need services other than educational services, in which case the financial responsibility of the school district and payment to such district shall be limited to the reasonable costs of special education instruction as defined in the regulations of the State Board of Education. If a hearing board, pursuant to subsection (d) of section 10-76h, rejects the educational program prescribed by the local or regional board of education and determines that a placement by a parent or guardian was appropriate, the local or regional board of education shall reimburse the parent or guardian for the reasonable costs incurred for the provision of special education pursuant to this section from the initiation of review procedures as provided by said section 10-76h.\n\n(2) For purposes of this subdivision, “public agency” includes the offices of a government of a federally recognized Native American tribe. Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1987, and each fiscal year thereafter, whenever a public agency, other than a local or regional board of education, the State Board of Education or the Superior Court acting pursuant to section 10-76h, places a child in a foster home, group home, hospital, state institution, receiving home, custodial institution or any other residential or day treatment facility, and such child requires special education, the local or regional board of education under whose jurisdiction the child would otherwise be attending school or, if no such board can be identified, the local or regional board of education of the town where the child is placed, shall provide the requisite special education and related services to such child in accordance with the provisions of this section. Within one business day of such a placement by the Department of Children and Families or offices of a government of a federally recognized Native American tribe, said department or offices shall orally notify the local or regional board of education responsible for providing special education and related services to such child of such placement. The department or offices shall provide written notification to such board of such placement within two business days of the placement. Such local or regional board of education shall convene a planning and placement team meeting for such child within thirty days of the placement and shall invite a representative of the Department of Children and Families or offices of a government of a federally recognized Native American tribe to participate in such meeting. (A) The local or regional board of education under whose jurisdiction such child would otherwise be attending school shall be financially responsible for the reasonable costs of such special education and related services in an amount equal to the lesser of one hundred per cent of the costs of such education or the average per pupil educational costs of such board of education for the prior fiscal year, determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of section 10-76f. The State Board of Education shall pay on a current basis, except as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection, any costs in excess of such local or regional board's basic contributions paid by such board of education in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision. (B) Whenever a child is placed pursuant to this subdivision, on or after July 1, 1995, by the Department of Children and Families and the local or regional board of education under whose jurisdiction such child would otherwise be attending school cannot be identified, the local or regional board of education under whose jurisdiction the child attended school or in whose district the child resided at the time of removal from the home by said department shall be responsible for the reasonable costs of special education and related services provided to such child, for one calendar year or until the child is committed to the state pursuant to section 46b-129 or 46b-140 or is returned to the child's parent or guardian, whichever is earlier. If the child remains in such placement beyond one calendar year the Department of Children and Families shall be responsible for such costs. During the period the local or regional board of education is responsible for the reasonable cost of special education and related services pursuant to this subparagraph, the board shall be responsible for such costs in an amount equal to the lesser of one hundred per cent of the costs of such education and related services or the average per pupil educational costs of such board of education for the prior fiscal year, determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of section 10-76f. The State Board of Education shall pay on a current basis, except as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection, any costs in excess of such local or regional board's basic contributions paid by such board of education in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision. The costs for services other than educational shall be paid by the state agency which placed the child. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to the school districts established within the Department of Children and Families, pursuant to section 17a-37 or the Department of Correction, pursuant to section 18-99a, provided in any case in which special education is being provided at a private residential institution, including the residential components of regional educational service centers, to a child for whom no local or regional board of education can be found responsible under subsection (b) of this section, Unified School District #2 shall provide the special education and related services and be financially responsible for the reasonable costs of such special education instruction for such children. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2004, to June 30, 2007, inclusive, and for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010, and each fiscal year thereafter, the amount of the grants payable to local or regional boards of education in accordance with this subdivision shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of subsections (d) and (e) of section 10-76g if the total of such grants in such year exceeds the amount appropriated for the purposes of this subdivision for such year.\n\n(3) Payment for children who require special education and who reside on state-owned or leased property, and who are not the educational responsibility of the unified school districts established pursuant to section 17a-37 or section 18-99a, shall be made in the following manner: The State Board of Education shall pay to the school district which is responsible for providing instruction for each such child pursuant to the provisions of this subsection one hundred per cent of the reasonable costs of such instruction. In the fiscal year following such payment, the State Board of Education shall deduct from the special education grant due the local or regional board of education under whose jurisdiction the child would otherwise be attending school, where such board has been identified, the amount for which such board would otherwise have been financially responsible pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection. No such deduction shall be made for any school district which is responsible for providing special education instruction for children whose parents or legal guardians do not reside within such district. The amount deducted shall be included as a net cost of special education by the Department of Education for purposes of the state's special education grant calculated pursuant to section 10-76g. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2004, and June 30, 2005, and for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2012, and June 30, 2013, the amount of the grants payable to local or regional boards of education in accordance with this subdivision shall be reduced proportionately if the total of such grants in such year exceeds the amount appropriated for the purposes of this subdivision for such year.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services shall provide regular education and special education and related services to eligible residents in facilities operated by the department who are eighteen to twenty-one years of age. In the case of a resident who requires special education, the department shall provide the requisite identification and evaluation of such resident in accordance with the provisions of this section. The department shall be financially responsible for the provision of educational services to eligible residents. The Departments of Mental Health and Addiction Services, Children and Families and Education shall develop and implement an interagency agreement which specifies the role of each agency in ensuring the provision of appropriate education services to eligible residents in accordance with this section. The Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services shall be responsible for one hundred per cent of the reasonable costs of such educational services provided to eligible residents of such facilities.\n\n(5) Application for the grant to be paid by the state for costs in excess of the local or regional board of education's basic contribution shall be made by such board of education by filing with the State Board of Education, in such manner as prescribed by the Commissioner of Education, annually on or before December first a statement of the cost of providing special education, as defined in subdivision (2) of this subsection, for a child of the board placed by a state agency in accordance with the provisions of said subdivision or, where appropriate, a statement of the cost of providing educational services other than special educational services pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) or (g) of section 10-253, provided a board of education may submit, not later than March first, claims for additional children or costs not included in the December filing. Payment by the state for such excess costs shall be made to the local or regional board of education as follows: Seventy-five per cent of the cost in February and the balance in May. The amount due each town pursuant to the provisions of this subsection and the amount due to each town as tuition from other towns pursuant to this section shall be paid to the treasurer of each town entitled to such aid, provided the treasurer shall treat such grant or tuition received, or a portion of such grant or tuition, which relates to special education expenditures incurred pursuant to subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection in excess of such board's budgeted estimate of such expenditures, as a reduction in expenditures by crediting such expenditure account, rather than town revenue. The state shall notify the local or regional board of education when payments are made to the treasurer of the town pursuant to this subdivision.\n\n(f) No children placed out primarily for special education services shall be placed in a private school, agency or institution outside of the state, except when in the opinion of the Commissioner of Education it is determined that: (1) No public or approved private facility which can reasonably provide appropriate special education programs for such children is available in the state; (2) no public or approved private facility which can reasonably provide appropriate special education programs for such children is available in the state and the out-of-state placement is required for a period of time not to exceed two years, during which time the local or regional board of education responsible for providing such children with a special education shall develop an appropriate special education program or cause such program to be developed within the state; or (3) an out-of-state placement is more economically feasible than an existing special education program in the state or any such program that could be developed within the state within a reasonable period of time. No placement in an out-of-state private special education school, agency or facility shall be approved unless such school, agency or facility first agrees in writing to submit to the state Department of Education any such financial program and student progress reports as the commissioner may require for the purpose of making an annual determination as to the economic feasibility and program adequacy of the special education program provided. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to children placed out primarily for services other than educational services as described in subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(g) (1) Each local or regional board of education shall review annually and make a report as to the progress of each child for whom such board is obligated to provide a special education and who receives special education services in any private school, agency or institution and shall, upon request of the commissioner, submit such reports to the State Board of Education.\n\n(2) Whenever a local or regional board of education determines that a child who has for three years received special education services in private facilities pursuant to subsection (d) of section 10-76d must receive such services from private facilities for an additional period of time, the State Board of Education, shall annually thereafter review the progress of such child prior to approving or disapproving for purposes of reimbursement, pursuant to subsection (d) of section 10-76d, any continuation of private placement, considering such factors as the educational and other needs of the child.\n\n(h) The provisions of this section and sections 10-76a, 10-76b, 10-76c, 10-76f and 10-76g shall not be construed to relieve any insurer or provider of health or welfare benefits from paying any otherwise valid claim.\n\n(i) (1) No local or regional board of education shall discipline, suspend, terminate or otherwise punish any member of a planning and placement team employed by such board who discusses or makes recommendations concerning the provision of special education and related services for a child during a planning and placement team meeting for such child.\n\n(2) No birth-to-three service coordinator or qualified personnel, as those terms are defined in section 17a-248, who discusses or makes recommendations concerning the provision of special education and related services for a child during a planning and placement team meeting for such child or in a transition plan, as required by section 17a-248e, shall be subject to discipline, suspension, termination or other punishment on the basis of such recommendations.\n\n(3) No local or regional board of education shall discipline, suspend, terminate or otherwise punish any school employee, as defined in section 10-222d, who discusses or makes recommendations concerning the provision of services or accommodations for a student as part of a plan pursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended from time to time, during any meeting held to discuss such plan for such student.\n\n(1967, P.A. 627, S. 4, 11; 1969, P.A. 793, S. 2; P.A. 73-111; P.A. 75-255; 75-364; 75-521, S. 3, 6; 75-585; P.A. 76-310, S. 1, 2; 76-341; P.A. 77-36; 77-614, S. 302, 610; P.A. 78-218, S. 65; P.A. 79-128, S. 19, 36; P.A. 80-113, S. 1, 2; 80-138, S. 2, 3; P.A. 81-187; 81-432, S. 1, 11; P.A. 82-311, S. 1, 4; P.A. 83-169, S. 8; 83-265, S. 1, 2; P.A. 84-255, S. 7, 21; P.A. 85-473, S. 1, 3; 85-491, S. 1, 3; P.A. 86-333, S. 6, 32; P.A. 87-324, S. 1, 2; 87-499, S. 2, 25, 26, 34; P.A. 88-360, S. 11, 12, 63; P.A. 89-315, S. 1, 3; P.A. 90-230, S. 14, 101; P.A. 91-16, S. 1, 2; 91-277, S. 4, 6; P.A. 92-170, S. 8, 26; 92-262, S. 10, 11, 42; P.A. 93-91, S. 1, 2; 93-352, S. 1, 3; 93-353, S. 47, 52; 93-381, S. 9, 39; P.A. 94-245, S. 29, 41, 46; May Sp.

(1) In conducting an evaluation of the child, the local or regional board of education shall: (A) Use a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant functional, developmental and academic information, including information provided by the child's parent or guardian, that may assist in determining (i) whether the child is a child, (I) who requires special education and related services pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (C) of subdivision (5) of section 10-76a, (II) whose disability has an adverse effect on his educational performance, and (III) who, by reason of such adverse effect requires special education and related services, and (ii) the content of the child's individualized education program, including information related to enabling the child to be involved in and progress in the general curriculum or, for preschool children, to participate in appropriate activities; (B) not use any single measure or assessment as the sole criterion for determining whether a child is a child with a disability or determining an appropriate educational program for the child; and (C) use technically sound instruments that may assess the relative contribution of cognitive and behavioral factors, in addition to physical or developmental factors. (2) Each local and regional board of education shall ensure that: (A) Assessments and other evaluation materials used to assess the child are (i) selected and administered so as not to be discriminatory on a racial or cultural basis, and (ii) provided and administered in the language and form most likely to yield accurate information on what the child knows and can do academically, developmentally and functionally, unless it is not feasible to so provide or administer; (B) assessments and other evaluation materials used to assess a child (i) are used for purposes for which the assessments or measures are valid and reliable, (ii) are administered by trained and knowledgeable personnel, and (iii) are administered in accordance with any instructions provided by the producer of such tests; (C) the child is assessed in all areas of suspected disability; (D) assessment tools and strategies that provide relevant information that directly assists persons in determining the educational needs of the child are provided; and (E) assessments of children with disabilities who transfer from one school district to another school district in the same academic year are coordinated with such children's prior and subsequent schools, as necessary and as expeditiously as possible, to ensure prompt completion of full evaluations. (3) In accordance with section 10-76d and applicable federal law and regulations, upon completion of administration of assessments and other evaluation measures, the determination of whether the child is a child requiring special education and related services shall be made by a team consisting of qualified professionals and the parent or guardian of the child and a copy of the evaluation report and the documentation for such determination shall be given to the parent or guardian of the child. (4) The local or regional board of education shall not determine that a child requires special education and related services if the dominant factor for determining eligibility is (A) a lack of instruction in reading, including the essential components of reading instruction, as defined in Section 1208(3) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, or mathematics or limited English proficiency, or (B) evidence that the child's behavior violates the school's disciplinary policies or evidence that is derived from the contents of discipline records.\n\n(b) (1) The planning and placement team, as part of an initial evaluation, if appropriate, and as part of any reevaluations, shall review existing evaluation data on the child, including evaluations and information provided by the parent or guardian or the child, classroom-based assessments and observations and teacher and related services provider observations. On the basis of such review, and input from the child's parent or guardian, the planning and placement team shall identify what additional data, if any, is needed to determine: (A) Whether the child has a particular category of disability, or in the case of a reevaluation, whether the child continues to have such a disability; (B) the present levels of performance and educational needs of the child; (C) whether the child needs special education and related services, or in the case of a reevaluation, whether the child continues to need special education and related services or whether the child is able to be served within the regular education program with existing supplemental services, available in the school district; and (D) whether any additions or modifications to the special education and related services are needed to enable the child to meet the measurable annual goals set out in the individualized education program of the child and to participate, as appropriate, in the general curriculum. (2) The local or regional board of education shall administer such tests and other evaluation materials as may be needed to produce the data identified by the planning and placement team pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection. (3) If the planning and placement team decides that no additional data is needed to determine that the child continues to be a child requiring special education and related services, the local or regional board of education shall notify the parent or guardian of the child of (A) the decision and the reasons for it, and (B) the right of the parent or guardian to request an assessment to determine whether the child continues to be a child requiring special education and related services. The local or regional board of education shall not be required to conduct such an assessment unless requested to do so by the parent or guardian of the child. (4) A local or regional board of education shall evaluate a child identified as requiring special education and related services, in accordance with this section, prior to determining that such child no longer requires such special education or related services, except that such evaluation shall not be required before the termination of a child's eligibility for special education due to graduation from high school with a regular education diploma, or due to exceeding the age eligibility for a free appropriate public education. For a child whose eligibility for special education terminates due to graduation from high school with a regular high school diploma or such child exceeds the age of eligibility for a free appropriate public education, the local or regional board of education shall provide the child with a summary of the child's academic achievement and functional performance, which shall include recommendations on how to assist the child in meeting the child's postsecondary goals.\n\n(c) The use of the word disability pursuant to this section shall not be the basis for limiting the services or programs, including regular education, available to such child.\n\n(P.A. 98-168, S. 5, 26; P.A. 06-18, S. 6; P.A. 11-235, S. 1; P.A. 23-137, S. 37.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 98-168 effective July 1, 1998; P.A. 06-18 amended Subsec.

Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) of this section, the State Board of Education shall, within available appropriations, pay on a current basis any costs in excess of the local or regional board's basic contribution paid by such board in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. Any amounts paid by the State Board of Education on a current basis pursuant to this subsection shall not be reimbursable in the subsequent year.

Such grant shall be equal to the product of a town's eligible excess costs and the town's base aid ratio, as defined in section 10-262f, provided each town's grant shall be adjusted proportionately if necessary to stay within the appropriation. Payment pursuant to this subsection shall be made in June.

The local or regional board of education or unified school district shall provide a copy of the request to the Department of Education. In the event a planning and placement team proposes private placement for a child or pupil who requires or may require special education and related services and the parent, guardian, pupil if such pupil is an emancipated minor or is eighteen years of age or older or surrogate parent appointed pursuant to section 10-94g withholds or revokes consent for such placement, the local or regional board of education shall request a hearing in accordance with this section and may request mediation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, provided such action may be taken only in the event such parent, guardian, pupil or surrogate parent has consented to the initial receipt of special education and related services and subsequent to the initial placement of the child, the local or regional board of education seeks a private placement. For purposes of this section, a “local or regional board of education or unified school district” includes any public agency which is responsible for the provision of special education and related services to children requiring special education and related services.\n\n(3) The request for a hearing shall contain a statement of the specific issues in dispute.\n\n(4) A party shall have two years to request a hearing from the time the board of education proposed or refused to initiate or change the identification, evaluation or educational placement or the provision of a free appropriate public education placement to such child or pupil provided, if the parent, guardian, pupil or surrogate parent is not given notice of the procedural safeguards, in accordance with regulations adopted by the State Board of Education, including notice of the limitations contained in this section, such two-year limitation shall be calculated from the time notice of the safeguards is properly given.\n\n(b) Upon receipt of a written request for a special education hearing made in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, the Department of Education shall appoint an impartial hearing officer who shall schedule a hearing which shall be held and the decision written and mailed not later than forty-five days after the commencement of the hearing pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 USC 1400 et seq., as amended from time to time. An extension of the forty-five-day time limit may be granted by the hearing officer at the request of either party to the hearing.\n\n(c) (1) The Department of Education shall provide training to hearing officers in administrative hearing procedures, including due process, and in the special educational needs of children. Hearing officers and members of hearing boards shall not be employees of the Department of Education or any local or regional board of education, unified school district or public agency involved in the education or care of the child.

Except for good cause shown, the hearing officer shall limit each party to such documentary evidence and witnesses as were properly disclosed and are relevant to the issues in dispute. A hearing officer may bar any party who fails to comply with the requirements concerning disclosure of evaluations and recommendations from introducing any undisclosed evaluation or recommendation at the hearing without the consent of the other party.\n\n(3) The hearing officer or board shall hear testimony relevant to the issues in dispute offered by the party requesting the hearing and any other party directly involved, and may hear any additional testimony the hearing officer or board deems relevant. The hearing officer or board shall hear the testimony offered by the local or regional board of education or the unified school district responsible for providing special education to a child or pupil first in any dispute concerning the provision of free appropriate public education. The hearing officer or board may require a complete and independent evaluation or prescription of educational programs by qualified persons, the cost of which shall be paid by the board of education or the unified school district.

If the parent or guardian of such a child who previously received special education and related services from the district enrolls the child, or the pupil who previously received special education and related services from the district enrolls in a private elementary or secondary school without the consent of or referral by the district, a hearing officer may, in accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 USC 1400 et seq., as amended from time to time, require the district to reimburse the parents or the pupil for the cost of that enrollment if the hearing officer finds that the district had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child or pupil in a timely manner prior to that enrollment.

Such action may include application to the Superior Court for injunctive relief to compel such local or regional board or school district to implement the findings or prescription of the hearing officer or board without the necessity of establishing irreparable harm or inadequate remedy at law.\n\n(3) If the hearing officer or board upholds the local or regional board of education or the unified school district responsible for providing special education and related services for such child or pupil who requires or may require special education on the issue of evaluation, reevaluation or placement in a private school or facility, such board or district may evaluate or provide such services to the child or pupil without the consent of the parent or guardian, pupil if such pupil is an emancipated minor or is eighteen years of age or older, or the surrogate parent appointed pursuant to section 10-94g, subject to an appeal pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection.\n\n(4) Appeals from the decision of the hearing officer or board shall be taken in the manner set forth in section 4-183, except the court shall hear additional evidence at the request of a party.
