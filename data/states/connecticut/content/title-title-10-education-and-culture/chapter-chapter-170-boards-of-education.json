(N) require the appointment of (i) a superintendent, approved by the Commissioner of Education, or (ii) a district improvement officer, selected by the commissioner, whose authority is consistent with the provisions of section 138 of public act 11-61*, and whose term shall be for one school year, except that the State Board of Education may extend such period;

If a school or district fails to make acceptable progress toward meeting such benchmarks established by the State Board of Education or fails to make adequate yearly progress pursuant to the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act, P.L. 107-110, for two consecutive years while designated as a low achieving school district, the State Board of Education, after consultation with the Governor and chief elected official or officials of the district, may (1) request that the General Assembly enact legislation authorizing that control of the district be reassigned to the State Board of Education or other authorized entity, or (2) notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 146, any special act, charter or ordinance, grant the Commissioner of Education the authority to reconstitute the local or regional board of education for such school district in accordance with the provisions of subsection (i) of this section.\n\n(g) Any school district or elementary school after two successive years of failing to make adequate yearly progress shall be designated as a low achieving school district or school and shall be evaluated by the Commissioner of Education. After such evaluation, the commissioner may require that such school district or school provide full-day kindergarten classes, summer school, extended school day, weekend classes, tutorial assistance to its students or professional development to its administrators, principals, teachers and paraeducators if (1) on any subpart of the mastery examination administered to students in grade three, pursuant to section 10-14n, thirty per cent or more of the students in any subgroup, as defined by the No Child Left Behind Act, P.L. 107-110, do not achieve the level of proficiency or higher, or (2) the commissioner determines that it would be in the best educational interests of the school or the school district to have any of these programs. In ordering any educational program authorized by this subsection, the commissioner may limit the offering of the program to the subgroup of students that have failed to achieve proficiency as determined by this subsection, those in particular grades or those who are otherwise at substantial risk of educational failure. The costs of instituting the ordered educational programs shall be borne by the identified low achieving school district or the school district in which an identified low achieving school is located. The commissioner shall not order an educational program that costs more to implement than the total increase in the amount of the grant that a town receives pursuant to section 10-262i in any fiscal year above the prior fiscal year.\n\n(h) The Commissioner of Education shall conduct a study, within the limits of the capacity of the Department of Education to perform such study, of academic achievement of individual students over time as measured by performance on mastery examinations administered to students in grades three to eight, inclusive, pursuant to section 10-14n. If this study evidences a pattern of continuous and substantial growth in educational performance on said examinations for individual students, then the commissioner may determine that the school district or elementary school shall not be subject to the requirements of subsection (g) of this section, but shall still comply with the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act, P.L. 107-110, if applicable.\n\n(i) (1) The State Board of Education may authorize the Commissioner of Education to reconstitute a local or regional board of education pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (f) of this section and in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection, for a period of not more than five years. The board shall not grant such authority to the commissioner unless the board has required the local or regional board of education to complete the training described in subparagraph (M) of subdivision (2) of subsection (e) of this section. Upon such authorization by the board, the commissioner shall terminate the existing local or regional board of education and appoint the members of a new local or regional board of education for the school district. Upon the termination of an existing local or regional board of education, the electoral process for such board shall be suspended during the period of reconstitution. Such appointed members may include members of the board of education that was terminated. The terms of the members of the new board of education shall be three years. The Department of Education shall offer training to the members of the new board of education. The new board of education shall annually report to the commissioner regarding the district's progress toward meeting the benchmarks established by the State Board of Education pursuant to subsection (e) of this section and making adequate yearly progress, as defined in the state accountability plan prepared in accordance with subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of this section. Not later than one hundred eighty days before the conclusion of the three-year term of the reconstituted board of education, the commissioner may reappoint the members of the new board of education or appoint new members to such board of education for terms of two years, to commence at the conclusion of the initial three-year term, if the district fails to show adequate improvement, as determined by the State Board of Education, after three years.\n\n(2) Upon terminating an existing local or regional board of education pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the commissioner shall notify the town clerk in the school district, or in the case of a regional board of education, the town clerk of each member town, and the office of the Secretary of the State of such termination. Such notice shall include the date of such termination and the positions terminated.\n\n(3) Not later than one hundred seventy-five days before the conclusion of the term of the reconstituted board of education, the commissioner shall notify the town clerk in the school district, or in the case of a regional board of education, the town clerk of each member town, and the office of the Secretary of the State of the date that such period of reconstitution will conclude. Upon receipt of such notice by the Secretary of the State, the electoral process shall commence in accordance with the provisions of section 9-164, except that if such notice is delivered before the time specified in section 9-391 to nominate candidates for municipal office in the year of a municipal election, such offices may be placed on the ballot of a regular election, as defined in section 9-1, with the approval of the legislative body of the municipality. Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 146 and section 10-46, the legislative body of the municipality or municipalities involved shall determine the terms of office of the new members to be elected for such office.\n\n(4) For purposes of this subsection, “electoral process” includes, but is not limited to, the nominations of candidates by political parties, nominating petitions, write-in candidacies and the filling of vacancies on the board of education.\n\n(May 9 Sp.

(1) designator was inserted editorially by the Revisors for clarity); P.A. 13-207 amended Subsec. (g) by replacing “third grade state-wide mastery examination” with “mastery examination administered to students in grade three, pursuant to section 10-14n” and amended Subsec. (h) by replacing “the state-wide mastery examination” with “mastery examinations administered to students” and adding reference to Sec. 10-14n, effective July 1, 2013; P.A. 15-215 amended Subsec. (e)(2)(N)(ii) by replacing “special master” with “district improvement officer”, effective July 1, 2015; June Sp. Sess. P.A. 15-5 amended Subsec. (a) by replacing former Subdivs. (1) to (5) re definitions of “school performance index”, “school subject performance index for mathematics”, “school subject performance index for reading”, “school subject performance index for writing” and “school subject performance index for science” with new Subdivs. (1) to (3) re definitions of “accountability index”, “performance index” and “mastery test data of record”, and redesignating existing Subdivs. (6) to (11) as new Subdivs. (4) to (9) and amending same by redefining “category five schools”, “category four schools”, “category three schools”, “category two schools”, “category one schools” and “focus school”, and amended Subsec.

(d)(2)(F) and (g) by replacing “paraprofessionals” and “paraprofessional teacher aides”, respectively, with “paraeducators”, effective July 1, 2024.\n\nTraining provision in Subsec. (h) is a condition precedent to State Board of Education's authority to authorize reconstitution; failure to satisfy such training provision renders the State Board powerless to authorize reconstitution, and because training provision concerns the scope of the legislature's grant of power to the State Board, the local board, as a separate agent of the state and a body inferior to the legislature, could not alter the scope of the grant by waiving such training provision. 304 C. 1.",

The commissioner shall provide funding, technical assistance and operational support to schools participating in the commissioner's network of schools and may provide financial support to teachers and administrators working at a school that is participating in the commissioner's network of schools. All costs attributable to developing and implementing a turnaround plan in excess of the ordinary operating expenses for such school shall be paid by the State Board of Education.\n\n(b) (1) Upon the selection by the Commissioner of Education of a school for participation in the commissioner's network of schools, the local or regional board of education for such school shall establish a turnaround committee for the school district. The turnaround committee shall consist of the following members: (A) Two appointed by the local or regional board of education, at least one of whom shall be an administrator employed by such board of education and at least one of whom shall be the parent or guardian of a student enrolled in the school district for such board of education; (B) three appointed by the exclusive bargaining unit for teachers chosen pursuant to section 10-153b, at least two of whom shall be teachers employed by such board of education and at least one of whom shall be the parent or guardian of a student enrolled in the school district for such board of education; and (C) the Commissioner of Education, or the commissioner's designee.

Such turnaround plan may include proposals changing the hours and schedules of teachers and administrators at such school, the length and schedule of the school day, the length and calendar of the school year, the amount of time teachers shall be present in the school beyond the regular school day and the hiring or reassignment of teachers or administrators at such school. If a turnaround committee does not develop a turnaround plan, or if the commissioner determines that a turnaround plan developed by a turnaround committee is deficient, the commissioner may develop a turnaround plan for such school in accordance with the provisions of this subsection and, if the commissioner deems necessary, the commissioner may appoint a district improvement officer for such school to implement the provisions of the turnaround plan developed by the commissioner. The turnaround plan shall direct all resources and funding to programs and services delivered at such school for the educational benefit of the students enrolled at such school and be transparent and accountable to the local community.

Such turnaround plan shall be implemented for the school year commencing July 1, 2012.\n\n(3) The commissioner shall permit not more than four total turnaround plans for schools selected to participate in the commissioner's network of schools implementing turnaround plans beginning in the school year commencing July 1, 2013, or July 1, 2014, to assign the management, administration or governance of such school to an approved not-for-profit educational management organization, provided the commissioner shall not permit such assignment in a turnaround plan to more than three schools in a single school year. If the commissioner does not approve a turnaround plan under subdivision (2) of this subsection, the commissioner may approve one additional turnaround plan for a school selected to participate in the commissioner's network of schools that assigns the management, administration or governance of such school to an approved not-for-profit educational management organization to be implemented in the school year commencing July 1, 2013, or July 1, 2014.\n\n(4) For purposes of this section, and section 10-223i, “approved not-for-profit educational management organization” means a not-for-profit organization that is exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, that (A) operates a state charter school located in the state that has a record of student academic success for students enrolled in such state charter school, or (B) has experience and a record of success in improving student achievement for low income or low performing students through measures, including, but not limited to, reconstituting schools while, if applicable, respecting existing contracts of employees of such schools.\n\n(f) The Commissioner of Education may partner with any public or private institution of higher education in the state, for a period not to exceed twelve months, to assist the Department of Education in collecting, compiling and replicating strategies, methods and best practices that have been proven to be effective in improving student academic performance in public schools, interdistrict magnet schools and charter schools. The commissioner shall make such strategies, methods and best practices available to local and regional boards of education and turnaround committees for use in developing a turnaround model, pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, and in implementing the turnaround plan for a school that is participating in the commissioner's network of schools.\n\n(g) Nothing in this section shall alter the collective bargaining agreements applicable to the administrators and teachers employed by the local or regional board of education, subject to the provisions of sections 10-153a to 10-153n, inclusive, and such collective bargaining agreements shall be considered to be in operation at schools participating in the commissioner's network of schools, except to the extent the provisions are modified by any memorandum of understanding between the local or regional board of education and the representatives of the exclusive bargaining units for certified employees, chosen pursuant to section 10-153b, or are modified by a turnaround plan, including, but not limited to, any election to work agreement pursuant to such turnaround plan for such schools and negotiated in accordance with the provisions of section 10-153s.\n\n(h) Each school participating in the commissioner's network of schools shall participate for three school years, and may continue such participation for an additional year, not to exceed two additional years, upon approval from the State Board of Education.

The criminal history records checks required by this subsection shall be conducted in accordance with section 29-17a, the federal National Child Protection Act of 1993 and the federal Volunteers for Children Act of 1998. If the nongovernmental school operator receives notice of a conviction of a crime which has not previously been disclosed by such person to the nongovernmental school operator, the nongovernmental school operator may (A) terminate the contract of a certified employee, in accordance with the provisions of section 10-151, if applicable, and (B) dismiss a noncertified employee, provided such employee is notified of the reason for such dismissal. If the nongovernmental school operator receives notice of a conviction of a crime by a person holding a certificate, authorization or permit issued by the State Board of Education, the nongovernmental school operator shall send such notice to the State Board of Education. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to cause a nongovernmental school operator to disseminate the results of any national criminal history records check.\n\n(c) If a nongovernmental school operator requests, a regional educational service center shall arrange for the fingerprinting of any person required to submit to state and national criminal history records checks pursuant to this section or for conducting any other method of positive identification required by the State Police Bureau of Identification or the Federal Bureau of Investigation and shall forward such fingerprints or other positive identifying information to the State Police Bureau of Identification which shall conduct criminal history records checks in accordance with section 29-17a, the federal National Child Protection Act of 1993 and the federal Volunteers for Children Act of 1998. Such regional educational service center shall maintain such fingerprints or other positive identifying information, which may be in an electronic format, for a period of four years, at the end of which such fingerprints and positive identifying information shall be destroyed. The State Police Bureau of Identification shall provide the results of such checks to such nongovernmental school operator. No regional educational service center shall charge a fee for services under this subsection that exceeds any fee that the center may charge any applicant for a position with such center.\n\n(d) State and national criminal history records checks for substitute teachers completed within one year prior to the date of employment with a nongovernmental school operator and submitted to the employing nongovernmental school operator shall meet the requirements of subsection (b) of this section. A nongovernmental school operator shall not require substitute teachers to submit to state and national criminal history records checks pursuant to subsection (b) of this section if they are continuously employed by such nongovernmental school operator, provided a substitute teacher is subjected to such checks at least once every five years. For purposes of this section, substitute teachers shall be deemed to be continuously employed by a nongovernmental school operator if they are employed at least one day of each school year by such nongovernmental school operator.\n\n(e) The provisions of this section shall not apply to (1) a student employed by the nongovernmental school operator that operates a school which the student attends, or (2) a person employed by a nongovernmental school operator as a teacher for a noncredit adult class or adult education activity, as defined in section 10-67, who is not required to hold a teaching certificate pursuant to section 10-145b for his or her position.\n\n(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (g) of section 31-51i, and to the extent permissible under state and federal laws regarding the dissemination of criminal history records, the State Board of Education shall, upon request of a nongovernmental school operator, make available to such nongovernmental school operator requesting information concerning an applicant for a position with such nongovernmental school operator, (1) any information concerning the applicant's eligibility for employment in a position with such nongovernmental school operator requiring a certificate, authorization or permit issued pursuant to chapter 166, (2) whether the department has knowledge that the applicant has been disciplined for a finding of abuse or neglect or sexual misconduct, as defined in section 10-222c, and any information concerning such a finding, and (3) whether the department has received notification that the applicant has been convicted of a crime or of criminal charges pending against the applicant and any information concerning such charges. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to cause the state board to investigate any such request or disseminate the results of any national criminal history records check.\n\n(P.A. 19-91, S. 2; P.A. 21-144, S. 5.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 19-91 effective July 1, 2019; P.A. 21-144 amended Subsec.

In making a determination as to whether conduct is seriously disruptive of the educational process, the administration may consider, but such consideration shall not be limited to: (1) Whether the incident occurred within close proximity of a school; (2) whether other students from the school were involved or whether there was any gang involvement; (3) whether the conduct involved violence, threats of violence or the unlawful use of a weapon, as defined in section 29-38, and whether any injuries occurred; and (4) whether the conduct involved the use of alcohol. Any such board may authorize the administration to suspend transportation services for a pupil whose conduct while awaiting or receiving transportation to and from school endangers persons or property or is violative of a publicized policy of such board. Unless an emergency exists, no pupil shall be suspended without an informal hearing by the administration, at which such pupil shall be informed of the reasons for the disciplinary action and given an opportunity to explain the situation, provided nothing herein shall be construed to prevent a more formal hearing from being held if the circumstances surrounding the incident so require, and further provided no pupil shall be suspended more than ten times or a total of fifty days in one school year, whichever results in fewer days of exclusion, unless such pupil is granted a formal hearing pursuant to sections 4-176e to 4-180a, inclusive, and section 4-181a.

In making a determination as to whether conduct is seriously disruptive of the educational process, the board of education or impartial hearing board may consider, but such consideration shall not be limited to: (A) Whether the incident occurred within close proximity of a school; (B) whether other students from the school were involved or whether there was any gang involvement; (C) whether the conduct involved violence, threats of violence or the unlawful use of a weapon, as defined in section 29-38, and whether any injuries occurred; and (D) whether the conduct involved the use of alcohol.\n\n(2) Expulsion proceedings pursuant to this section, except as provided in subsection (i) of this section, shall be required for any pupil in grades kindergarten to twelve, inclusive, whenever there is reason to believe that any pupil (A) on school grounds or at a school-sponsored activity, was in possession of a firearm, as defined in 18 USC 921, as amended from time to time, or deadly weapon, dangerous instrument or martial arts weapon, as defined in section 53a-3, (B) off school grounds, did possess such a firearm in violation of section 29-35 or did possess and use such a firearm, instrument or weapon in the commission of a crime under chapter 952, or (C) on or off school grounds, offered for sale or distribution a controlled substance, as defined in section 21a-240, whose manufacture, distribution, sale, prescription, dispensing, transporting or possessing with intent to sell or dispense, offering, or administering is subject to criminal penalties under sections 21a-277 and 21a-278. Such a pupil shall be expelled for one calendar year if the local or regional board of education or impartial hearing board finds that the pupil did so possess or so possess and use, as appropriate, such a firearm, instrument or weapon or did so offer for sale or distribution such a controlled substance, provided the board of education or the hearing board may modify the period of expulsion for a pupil on a case-by-case basis, and as provided for in subdivision (2) of subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(3) Unless an emergency exists, no pupil shall be expelled without a formal hearing held pursuant to sections 4-176e to 4-180a, inclusive, and section 4-181a, provided whenever such pupil is a minor, the notice required by section 4-177 and section 4-180 shall also be given to the parents or guardian of the pupil at least five business days before such hearing. If an emergency exists, such hearing shall be held as soon after the expulsion as possible. The notice shall include information concerning the parent's or guardian's and the pupil's legal rights and concerning legal services provided free of charge or at a reduced rate that are available locally and how to access such services. An attorney or other advocate may represent any pupil subject to expulsion proceedings. The parent or guardian of the pupil shall have the right to have the expulsion hearing postponed for up to one week to allow time to obtain representation, except that if an emergency exists, such hearing shall be held as soon after the expulsion as possible.\n\n(b) For purposes of conducting expulsion hearings as required by subsection (a) of this section, any local or regional board of education or any two or more of such boards in cooperation may establish an impartial hearing board of one or more persons. No member of any such board or boards shall be a member of the hearing board. The hearing board shall have the authority to conduct the expulsion hearing and render a final decision in accordance with the provisions of sections 4-176e to 4-180a, inclusive, and section 4-181a.\n\n(c) (1) In determining the length of an expulsion and the nature of the alternative educational opportunity to be offered under subsection (d) of this section, the local or regional board of education, or the impartial hearing board established pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, may receive and consider evidence of past disciplinary problems that have led to removal from a classroom, suspension or expulsion of such pupil.\n\n(2) For any pupil expelled for the first time pursuant to this section and who has never been suspended pursuant to section 10-233c, except for a pupil who has been expelled based on possession of a firearm or deadly weapon as described in subsection (a) of this section, the local or regional board of education may shorten the length of or waive the expulsion period if the pupil successfully completes a board-specified program and meets any other conditions required by the board. Such board-specified program shall not require the pupil or the parent or guardian of the pupil to pay for participation in the program.\n\n(d) No local or regional board of education is required to offer an alternative educational opportunity, except in accordance with this section. Any pupil under sixteen years of age who is expelled shall be offered an alternative educational opportunity, which shall be (1) alternative education, as defined by section 10-74j, with an individualized learning plan, if such board provides such alternative education, or (2) in accordance with the standards adopted by the State Board of Education, pursuant to section 10-233o, during the period of expulsion, provided any parent or guardian of such pupil who does not choose to have such parent's or guardian's child enrolled in an alternative educational opportunity shall not be subject to the provisions of section 10-184. Any pupil expelled for the first time who is between the ages of sixteen and eighteen and who wishes to continue such pupil's education shall be offered such an alternative educational opportunity if such pupil complies with conditions established by such pupil's local or regional board of education. Such alternative educational opportunity may include, but shall not be limited to, the placement of a pupil who is at least seventeen years of age in an adult education program pursuant to section 10-69. Any pupil participating in any such adult education program during a period of expulsion shall not be required to withdraw from school under section 10-184. A local or regional board of education shall count the expulsion of a pupil when the pupil was under sixteen years of age for purposes of determining whether an alternative educational opportunity is required for such pupil when such pupil is between the ages of sixteen and eighteen. A local or regional board of education may offer an alternative educational opportunity to a pupil for whom such alternative educational opportunity is not required pursuant to this section.\n\n(e) If a pupil is expelled pursuant to this section for possession of a firearm, as defined in 18 USC 921, as amended from time to time, or deadly weapon, dangerous instrument or martial arts weapon, as defined in section 53a-3, the board of education shall report the violation to the local police department or in the case of a student enrolled in a technical education and career school to the state police. If a pupil is expelled pursuant to this section for the sale or distribution of a controlled substance, as defined in section 21a-240, whose manufacture, distribution, sale, prescription, dispensing, transporting or possessing with the intent to sell or dispense, offering, or administration is subject to criminal penalties under sections 21a-277 and 21a-278, the board of education shall refer the pupil to an appropriate state or local agency for rehabilitation, intervention or job training, or any combination thereof, and inform the agency of its action.\n\n(f) Whenever a pupil is expelled pursuant to the provisions of this section, notice of the expulsion and the conduct for which the pupil was expelled shall be included on the pupil's cumulative educational record. Such notice, except for notice of an expulsion of a pupil in grades nine to twelve, inclusive, based on possession of a firearm or deadly weapon as described in subsection (a) of this section, (1) shall be expunged from the cumulative educational record by the local or regional board of education if a pupil graduates from high school, or (2) may be expunged from the cumulative educational record by the local or regional board of education before a pupil graduates from high school if (A) in the case of a pupil for which the length of the expulsion period is shortened or the expulsion period is waived pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (c) of this section, such board determines that an expungement is warranted at the time such pupil completes the board-specified program and meets any other conditions required by such board pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (c) of this section, or (B) such pupil has demonstrated to such board that the conduct and behavior of such pupil in the years following such expulsion warrants an expungement. A local or regional board of education, in determining whether to expunge such notice under subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, may receive and consider evidence of any subsequent disciplinary problems that have led to removal from a classroom, suspension or expulsion of such pupil.\n\n(g) A local or regional board of education may adopt the decision of a pupil expulsion hearing conducted by another school district provided such local or regional board of education or impartial hearing board shall hold a hearing pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section which shall be limited to a determination of whether the conduct which was the basis for the expulsion would also warrant expulsion under the policies of such board. The pupil shall be excluded from school pending such hearing. The excluded student shall be offered an alternative educational opportunity in accordance with the provisions of subsections (d) and (e) of this section.\n\n(h) Whenever a pupil against whom an expulsion hearing is pending withdraws from school after notification of such hearing but before the hearing is completed and a decision rendered pursuant to this section, (1) notice of the pending expulsion hearing shall be included on the pupil's cumulative educational record, and (2) the local or regional board of education or impartial hearing board shall complete the expulsion hearing and render a decision. If such pupil enrolls in school in another school district, such pupil shall not be excluded from school in the other district pending completion of the expulsion hearing pursuant to this subsection unless an emergency exists, provided nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority of the local or regional board of education for such district to suspend the pupil or to conduct its own expulsion hearing in accordance with this section.\n\n(i) Prior to conducting an expulsion hearing for a child requiring special education and related services described in subparagraph (A) of subdivision (5) of section 10-76a, a planning and placement team shall convene to determine whether the misconduct was caused by the child's disability. If it is determined that the misconduct was caused by the child's disability, the child shall not be expelled. The planning and placement team shall reevaluate the child for the purpose of modifying the child's individualized education program to address the misconduct and to ensure the safety of other children and staff in the school. If it is determined that the misconduct was not caused by the child's disability, the child may be expelled in accordance with the provisions of this section applicable to children who do not require special education and related services. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (d) and (e) of this section, whenever a child requiring such special education and related services is expelled, an alternative educational opportunity, consistent with such child's educational needs shall be provided during the period of expulsion.\n\n(j) An expelled pupil may apply for early readmission to school. Except as provided in this subsection, such readmission shall be at the discretion of the local or regional board of education. The board of education may delegate authority for readmission decisions to the superintendent of schools for the school district. If the board delegates such authority, readmission shall be at the discretion of the superintendent. Readmission decisions shall not be subject to appeal to Superior Court. The board or superintendent, as appropriate, may condition such readmission on specified criteria.\n\n(k) Local and regional boards of education shall submit to the Commissioner of Education such information on expulsions for the possession of weapons as required for purposes of the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994, 20 USC 8921 et seq., as amended from time to time.\n\n(l) (1) Any student who commits an expellable offense and is subsequently placed in a juvenile residential center or any other residential placement for such offense may be expelled by a local or regional board of education in accordance with the provisions of this section. The period of expulsion shall run concurrently with the period of placement in a juvenile residential center or other residential placement.\n\n(2) If a student who committed an expellable offense seeks to return to a school district after participating in a diversionary program or having been placed in a juvenile residential center or any other residential placement and such student has not been expelled by the local or regional board of education for such offense under subdivision (1) of this subsection, the local or regional board of education for the school district to which the student is returning shall allow such student to return and may not expel the student for additional time for such offense.\n\n(P.A. 75-609, S. 4; P.A. 78-218, S. 165; P.A. 79-115, S. 2, 3; 79-369, S. 1, 2; P.A. 81-215, S. 1, 3; P.A. 82-118, S. 1, 2; P.A. 83-218, S. 1, 2; 83-587, S. 70, 96; P.A. 84-546, S. 25, 173; P.A. 86-398, S. 2; P.A. 88-317, S. 57, 107; P.A. 92-37, S. 1, 2; P.A. 93-35, S. 1–3; P.A. 94-221, S. 2; P.A. 95-304, S. 5, 9; P.A. 96-146, S. 9, 12; 96-244, S. 19–21, 63; P.A. 98-139, S. 2, 3; P.A. 00-157, S. 4, 8; P.A. 07-122, S. 2; 07-217, S. 45; June Sp.
