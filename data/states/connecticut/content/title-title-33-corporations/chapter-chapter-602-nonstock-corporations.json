Bylaw that calls for expulsion for “conduct inconsistent with a gentleman and a man of honor” is not undefined and vague and therefore not unreasonable; fact that expulsion is only penalty available under bylaw does not render it unreasonable on its face and plaintiff's argument that bylaw is not germane to purposes of the society fails where plaintiff incorrectly equates a principle actuating a nonprofit organization with a purpose of the organization and moreover where members could reasonably have believed that one of the society's “immutable principles” is germane to the bylaw.
