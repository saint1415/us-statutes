In submitting the plan of merger or share exchange to the shareholders for approval, the board of directors shall recommend that the shareholders approve the plan, or, in the case of an offer referred to in subparagraph (B) of subdivision (10) of this section, that the shareholders tender their shares to the offeror in response to the offer, unless (a) the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, or (B) section 33-754 applies. If either subparagraph (a) or (B) of this subdivision applies, the board of directors shall inform the shareholders of the basis for its so proceeding.\n\n(3) The board of directors may set conditions for the approval of the plan of merger or share exchange by the shareholders or the effectiveness of the plan of merger or share exchange.\n\n(4) If the plan of merger or share exchange is required to be approved by the shareholders, and if the approval is to be given at a meeting, the corporation shall notify each shareholder, regardless of whether entitled to vote, of the meeting of shareholders at which the plan is to be submitted for approval. The notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan and must contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan. If the corporation is to be merged into an existing foreign or domestic corporation, the notice must also include or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of that corporation.

An election pursuant to this section shall be irrevocable unless the court determines that it is equitable to set aside or modify the election.\n\n(b) An election to purchase pursuant to this section may be filed with the court at any time within ninety days after the filing of the petition under subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 33-896 or at such later time as the court in its discretion may allow. If the election to purchase is filed by one or more shareholders, the corporation shall, within ten days thereafter, give written notice to all shareholders, other than the petitioner. The notice must state the name and number of shares owned by the petitioner and the name and number of shares owned by each electing shareholder and must advise the recipients of their right to join in the election to purchase shares in accordance with this section. Shareholders who wish to participate must file notice of their intention to join in the purchase no later than thirty days after the effective date of the notice to them. All shareholders who have filed an election or notice of their intention to participate in the election to purchase thereby become parties to ownership of shares as of the date the first election was filed, unless they otherwise agree or the court otherwise directs. After an election has been filed by the corporation or one or more shareholders, the proceeding under subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 33-896 may not be discontinued or settled, nor may the petitioning shareholder sell or otherwise dispose of his shares, unless the court determines that it would be equitable to the corporation and the shareholders, other than the petitioner, to permit such discontinuance, settlement, sale or other disposition.\n\n(c) If, within sixty days of the filing of the first election, the parties reach agreement as to the fair value and terms of purchase of the petitioner's shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase of petitioner's shares upon the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties.\n\n(d) If the parties are unable to reach an agreement as provided for in subsection (c) of this section, the court, upon application of any party, shall stay the proceedings under subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 33-896 and determine the fair value of the petitioner's shares as of the day before the date on which the petition was filed or as of such other date as the court deems appropriate under the circumstances.\n\n(e) Upon determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase upon such terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate, which may include payment of the purchase price in installments, where necessary in the interests of equity, provision for security to assure payment of the purchase price and any additional costs, fees and expenses as may have been awarded, and, if the shares are to be purchased by shareholders, the allocation of shares among them. In allocating the petitioner's shares among holders of different classes of shares, the court should attempt to preserve the existing distribution of voting rights among holders of different classes insofar as practicable and may direct that holders of a specific class or classes shall not participate in the purchase. Interest may be allowed at the rate and from the date determined by the court to be equitable, but if the court finds that the refusal of the petitioning shareholder to accept an offer of payment was arbitrary or otherwise not in good faith, no interest shall be allowed. In a proceeding under subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 33-896, if the court finds that the petitioning shareholder had probable grounds for relief under said subdivision, it may award to the petitioning shareholder reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and of any experts employed by him.\n\n(f) Upon entry of an order under subsection (c) or (e) of this section, the court shall dismiss the petition to dissolve the corporation under section 33-896, and the petitioning shareholder shall no longer have any rights or status as a shareholder of the corporation, except the right to receive the amounts awarded to him by the order of the court which shall be enforceable in the same manner as any other judgment.\n\n(g) The purchase ordered pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be made within ten days after the date the order becomes final unless before that time the corporation files with the court a notice of its intention to adopt a certificate of dissolution pursuant to sections 33-881 and 33-882, which certificate of dissolution must then be adopted and filed within fifty days thereafter. Upon filing of such certificate of dissolution, the corporation shall be dissolved in accordance with the provisions of sections 33-884 to 33-887, inclusive, and the order entered pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall no longer be of any force or effect, except that the court may award the petitioning shareholder reasonable fees and expenses in accordance with the provisions of the last sentence of subsection (e) of this section and the petitioner may continue to pursue any claims previously asserted on behalf of the corporation.\n\n(h) Any payment by the corporation pursuant to an order under subsection (c) or (e) of this section, other than an award of fees and expenses pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, is subject to the provisions of section 33-687.\n\n(P.A. 94-186, S. 177, 215; P.A. 96-271, S. 128, 254; P.A. 97-246, S. 28, 99; June Sp.

      "text": "(a) The registered agent of a foreign corporation authorized to transact business in this state is the corporation's agent for service of process, notice or demand required or permitted by law to be served on the foreign corporation. When the registered agent is other than the Secretary of the State and his successors in office, service may be effected by any proper officer or other person lawfully empowered to make service by leaving a true and attested copy of the process, notice or demand with such agent or, in the case of an agent who is a natural person, by leaving it at such agent's usual place of abode in this state.\n\n(b) A foreign corporation may be served by any proper officer or other person lawfully empowered to make service by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the secretary of the foreign corporation at its principal office shown in its application for a certificate of authority or in its most recent annual report if the foreign corporation: (1) Has no registered agent or its registered agent cannot with reasonable diligence be served; (2) has withdrawn from transacting business in this state under section 33-932; or (3) has had its certificate of authority revoked under section 33-936.\n\n(c) When the Secretary of the State and his successors in office have been appointed a foreign corporation's registered agent, a foreign corporation may be served by any proper officer or other person lawfully empowered to make service by leaving two true and attested copies thereof together with the required fee at the office of the Secretary of the State or depositing the same in the United States mail, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed to said office. The Secretary of the State shall file one copy of such process and keep a record of the date and hour of such receipt. He shall, within two business days after such service, forward by registered or certified mail the copy of such process to the corporation at the address of its principal office as last shown on his records.\n\n(d) Service is effective under subsection (b) of this section at the earliest of: (1) The date the foreign corporation receives the mail; (2) the date shown on the return receipt, if signed on behalf of the foreign corporation; and (3) five days after its deposit in the United States mail, as evidenced by the postmark, if mailed postage prepaid and correctly addressed. In the case of service on the Secretary of the State, service so made shall be effective as of the date and hour received by the Secretary of the State as shown on his records.\n\n(e) Every foreign corporation which transacts business in this state in violation of section 33-920 shall be subject to suit in this state upon any cause of action arising out of such business.\n\n(f) Every foreign corporation shall be subject to suit in this state, by a resident of this state or by a person having a usual place of business in this state, whether or not such foreign corporation is transacting or has transacted business in this state and whether or not it is engaged exclusively in interstate or foreign commerce, on any cause of action arising as follows: (1) Out of any contract made in this state or to be performed in this state; (2) out of any business solicited in this state by mail or otherwise if the corporation has repeatedly so solicited business, whether the orders or offers relating thereto were accepted within or without the state; (3) out of the production, manufacture or distribution of goods by such corporation with the reasonable expectation that such goods are to be used or consumed in this state and are so used or consumed, regardless of how or where the goods were produced, manufactured, marketed or sold or whether or not through the medium of independent contractors or dealers; or (4) out of tortious conduct in this state, whether arising out of repeated activity or single acts, and whether arising out of misfeasance or nonfeasance.\n\n(g) In any action brought under subsection (e) or (f) of this section, or in any foreclosure or other action involving real property located in this state in which a foreign corporation, although not transacting business in this state, owns or claims to own an interest, service of process on such corporation may be made as provided in subsection (b) of this section, except that the service shall be addressed to the corporation at its principal office or, if it has no such office or the address of such office is not known, to such corporation's last office as shown in the official registry of the state or country of its incorporation, which address shall be set forth in the writ or other process.\n\n(h) This section does not prescribe the only means, or necessarily the required means, of serving a foreign corporation.\n\n(P.A. 94-186, S. 193, 215; P.A. 96-271, S. 140, 141, 254; P.A. 97-246, S. 36, 99; June Sp. Sess. P.A. 98-1, S. 23, 121.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 94-186 effective January 1, 1997; P.A. 96-271 amended Subsec. (a) to add provision authorizing service to be effected by leaving a copy with the agent or, in the case of an agent who is a natural person, at the agent's usual place of abode and amended Subsec. (c) to make technical changes, effective January 1, 1997; P.A. 97-246 amended Subsec. (a) to provide that the manner of service specified is applicable when the registered agent is other than the Secretary of the State and his successors in office and authorize service by any proper officer or other person lawfully empowered to make service, amended Subsec. (b) to authorize service by any proper officer or other person lawfully empowered to make service, designated as Subsec. (c) provisions formerly part of Subsec. (b) re manner of service when the Secretary of the State has been appointed registered agent and amended said Subsec. to delete provision that limited applicability to service of foreign corporations authorized to transact business in this state, replace “executive offices” with “principal office” and make technical changes, redesignated former Subsec. (c) as Subsec. (d) and amended said Subsec. to make provision re effective date and time of service on the Secretary of the State a separate sentence rather than Subdiv. (4) and make technical changes, redesignated former Subsecs. (d) and (e) as Subsecs. (e) and (f), respectively, added new Subsec. (g) re the manner of service in an action under Subsec. (e) or (f) or in certain actions involving real property and redesignated former Subsec. (f) as Subsec. (h), effective June 27, 1997; June Sp. Sess. P.A. 98-1 made a technical change in Subsec. (c), effective June 24, 1998.\n\nSee Sec. 1-2a re construction of references to “United States mail”, “postmark” or “registered or certified mail”.\n\nSubsec. (f):\n\nSubdiv. (1): “To be performed” refers to the performance that the parties to the contract contemplated in the contract, without regard to whether such performance has actually been performed. 329 C. 249.\n\nAllegation of negligent misrepresentation qualifies as tortious conduct under Subdiv. (4), but plaintiff failed to present facts sufficient to establish trial court's jurisdiction. 54 CA 506. Foreign corporation may be subject to suit in this state on a cause of action arising out of business solicited in this state or out of tortious conduct in this state; third party complaint against foreign corporation that contained only one conclusory allegation of jurisdictional fact properly dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction because it failed to satisfy burden of establishing that court had personal jurisdiction over foreign corporation. 70 CA 309. When a foreign corporation is authorized to conduct business in this state and appoints a registered agent under Sec. 33-926, it has consented to the exercise of jurisdiction over it by the courts of the state, and nothing in Subsec. limits a court's exercise of personal jurisdiction. 113 CA 845. To empower plaintiff to sue a foreign corporation under the usual place of business prong, this state need not be plaintiff's primary or sole place of business but it must, at the very least, be customary or expected that plaintiff conducts business here; the general long arm jurisdiction provisions of Sec. 52-59b, rather than the corporation specific provisions of Subsec., apply to foreign limited liability companies. 149 CA 513. Because Rhode Island town is not a foreign corporation within the meaning of our general statutes, Subsec. does not confer personal jurisdiction over the town. 192 CA 759.\n\nCorporate defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction denied where trial court concluded that defendant provided plaintiffs with employment packets that specified the terms and conditions of employment and defendant had a continuing obligation to ensure that plaintiffs were paid in full compliance with state's minimum wage law. 49 CS 441.",
