All moneys collected from the sale of animals sold by the Commissioner of Agriculture through such open advertised bid process shall be deposited in the animal abuse cost recovery account established in subsection (j) of this section. All moneys collected from the sale of animals sold by a municipality through such open advertised bid process shall be deposited by the town treasurer or other fiscal officer in the town's general fund. The commissioner or the municipality may also vest ownership of any such animal in an individual or a public or private nonprofit animal rescue or adoption organization.\n\n(j) There is established a separate, nonlapsing account within the General Fund, to be known as the “animal abuse cost recovery account”. All moneys collected from sales at public auction of animals seized by the Department of Agriculture pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the account. Deposits of moneys may be made into the account from public or private sources, including, but not limited to, the federal government or municipal governments.\n\n(k) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, any moneys received by the Department of Agriculture pursuant to subsection (j) of this section shall be deposited in the General Fund and credited to the animal abuse cost recovery account. The account shall be available to the Commissioner of Agriculture for the purpose of the housing, care and welfare of any animal seized by the department, until final disposition of such animal. Additionally, the account may be used for the purpose of providing reimbursement to any municipality for the costs of providing temporary care to such animal if such temporary care exceeded thirty days in duration and such costs exceeded the amount of any surety bond or cash bond posted pursuant to subsection (f) of this section provided the total annual reimbursement to municipalities from said account for such purpose shall not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars.

      "text": "(a) When any person sustains damage by dogs to such person's sheep, goats, horses, hogs, cattle, poultry or domestic rabbits kept in enclosures as described in subsection (f) of this section, such person shall report such damage to the chief administrative officer of the town in which such damage was sustained, or the chief administrative officer's agent, or, if such damage was sustained on land located in two or more towns, such person shall report such damage to such authority of either of such towns. Upon receiving such report, the authority, with the person claiming to have sustained such damage, shall estimate the amount of such damage, including expenses of veterinary care, the fair monetary value of the animals or poultry killed, injured or damaged by such dogs and burial expenses for the animals or poultry killed by such dogs. If such authority and the person claiming to have sustained such damage are unable to agree as to the amount thereof, they shall choose some disinterested third person to assist in estimating the damage. Information required by this subsection shall be given within twenty-four hours after the person claiming under this section has or should have had knowledge of the same or, if the intervention of a Sunday or holiday prevents the reporting thereof, on the next succeeding business day. No claim for such damages shall be allowed to any person (1) who owns, keeps or has in possession any unlicensed dog, (2) whose employee, living on the premises, keeps an unlicensed dog which is six months of age or over, or (3) who fails to report such damage within the time limited by this section. The burden of proving the allegations of any claim under this section shall be on the person claiming under this section.\n\n(b) The amount of damage agreed upon or estimated by any two of such three persons shall be paid by such town, and the town may recover such amount, when paid, with the compensation of such disinterested third person, from the owners, keepers or harborers of such dogs, if such persons are the residents of the town. If the owners, keepers or harborers of such dogs are not residents of the town in which the damage has been done, the town paying the damage may recover such damage and compensation from the town or towns where such owners, keepers or harborers reside, unless such owners, keepers or harborers, or such town or towns, on notice, pay to the treasurer of the town which paid such damage the amount of such damage and compensation. Any town which is obliged to pay any such damage may recover the amount thereof from the owners, keepers or harborers of the dogs doing such damage.\n\n(c) When additional or increased damages are claimed to sheep, goats, horses, hogs, cattle, poultry or domestic rabbits, which damages were not apparent at, and accrued subsequent to, the first appraisal of damage, a supplemental notice of such claim for additional damage may be given to such authority at any time within thirty days from the discovery of the original damage. The supplemental notice of claim shall set forth the facts upon which such claim is based. The claim shall be made to such authority and shall be acted upon in the manner provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section.\n\n(d) Any authority who has received notice pursuant to the provisions of this section and within a period of fifteen days after receiving such notice, fails to estimate the amount of such damage, or if such authority is unable, within a period of five days, to agree with the person claiming to have sustained such damage as to the amount thereof, or fails to agree with such person on a disinterested third person to assist in estimating such damage, or if such authority and such person agree on such disinterested third person and two of such three persons fail to agree as to the amount of such damage, the person who claims to have sustained damage may institute a civil action against the town in which the damage was sustained for the recovery of such damage. No such action shall be maintained unless brought within one year from the date the damage was sustained.\n\n(e) When the selectmen, town manager or other chief executive officer of the town receives notice from any person claiming to have sustained damage by dogs to his sheep, goats, horses, hogs, cattle, poultry or domestic rabbits in excess of one hundred dollars, such authority shall, within twenty-four hours, report the same to the commissioner for investigation and shall call upon the commissioner or his agent to act for the town in appraising the damage as provided in subsections (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this section. The fact that said commissioner or his agent has acted for such authority shall not bar an action for the recovery of the damage as provided in subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(f) Sheep, goats, horses, hogs, cattle, poultry and domestic rabbits shall be confined or shall be enclosed by a fence or wall of material and height sufficient to restrain them from roaming. In any case in which any town has paid an amount in excess of one hundred dollars for such damage to the owner of any such animal or poultry, and the amount of such damage cannot be collected from the owners, keepers or harborers of such dogs, the selectmen, town manager or other chief executive officer of such town, city or borough shall forward to the commissioner a statement of the facts, showing the amount so paid, and the State Treasurer, at the request of the commissioner, shall reimburse such town, city or borough for the amount of such damage, from the funds received by the state under the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 3402; 1953, S. 1840d; 1963, P.A. 613, S. 26; 1971, P.A. 74, S. 1, 2; P.A. 85-145, S. 1; June Sp.

(d) which had allowed issuance of order to kill dog if established damage claim not paid within 10 days of notice to dog owner, relettering remaining Subsecs. accordingly, changed time limit for reports to commissioner in new Subsec. (e) to within 48 hours rather than 5 days and made commissioner's appraisal mandatory rather than optional; 1971 act stated that burden of proof is on claimant in Subsec. (a) and in Subsec. (e) made basis for report to commissioner any damage to sheep, goats, horses, etc. rather than a claim for more than $50 and reduced time for report from 48 to 24 hours; P.A. 85-145 amended Subsec. (f) by deleting obsolete references to the payment of expenses for Pasteur treatment; June Sp. Sess. P.A. 91-10 amended Subsecs.

Only actual damage not to exceed the amount paid may be recovered by a town. 48 C. 335. Provision for recovery from town held valid as a police regulation. Id., 335–337. Nature of obligation on the part of the town created by the statute. 59 C. 531; 62 C. 107. The bona fide estimate of damages is conclusive against the resident sustaining the damage. 62 C. 106. “Owner” defined. 74 C. 85. All steps in statute must be strictly followed. 86 C. 568; 108 C. 156; 133 C. 289. Estimate made by sheep owner and selectman inoperative under former statute. 108 C. 158. No right to recover regardless of commissioner's approval, where such appraisal is a condition precedent to recovery. 133 C. 288.\n\nSection is applicable only to damage caused by dogs and cannot be read to require that horses be fenced in. 85 CA 627.\n\nA claimant who is not satisfied with the award need not accept it but may seek his remedy against the persons owning or keeping the dogs. 14 CS 98.",

If the owner or keeper is a minor, the parent or guardian of such minor, shall be liable for the amount of such damage.

In an action under this section against a household member of a law enforcement officer to whom has been assigned a dog owned by a law enforcement agency of the state, any political subdivision of the state or the federal government for damage done by such dog, it shall be presumed that such household member is not a keeper of such dog and the burden of proof shall be upon the plaintiff to establish that such household member was a keeper of such dog and had exclusive control of such dog at the time such damage was sustained.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 3404; 1953, S. 1842d; 1969, P.A. 439, S. 1; P.A. 13-223, S. 1; P.A. 15-26, S. 1; P.A. 17-12, S. 1; P.A. 18-131, S. 1; P.A. 24-18, S. 8; 24-108, S. 40.)\n\nHistory: 1969 act added provision re actions brought on behalf of minors; P.A. 13-223 added provision defining “property” and “the amount of such damage” re a companion animal, and made conforming changes; P.A. 15-26 added provision re action brought against household member of law enforcement officer assigned a dog owned by law enforcement agency of the state, political subdivision of the state or federal government; P.A. 17-12 added Subsec.

Statute held constitutional; elements of damage. 105 C. 89. Scope of exception. 106 C. 202. Negligence in operation of automobile not a “tort” within exception; owner of dog held liable where dog jumped in front of automobile causing it to swerve into ditch and overturn. 107 C. 626. Complaint should negative the existence of circumstances which would bring plaintiff within exception. 117 C. 107. Defendant who pleaded an affirmation of exception assumed burden of proof thereof. Id., 103. “Trespass or tort” construed; conduct not within exceptions, although it might be held contributorily negligent, is not a defense under statute. Id., 310. Cited. 119 C. 648. Wife, co-owner, liable with husband who thrust dog toward plaintiff's face. 129 C. 210. “Trespass or tort” means more than mere entry; statute bars recovery where plaintiff is committing or intends to commit an injurious act. 133 C. 509; 140 C. 358. Plaintiff may recover where menacing attitude of dog frightened him and caused him to fall. 138 C. 718. Friendly playing with a dog is not “teasing, tormenting or abusing”. 142 C. 516. Plaintiff must bring himself clearly within provisions because it creates a cause of action that did not exist at common law. Id., 719. Phrase “trespass or other tort” interpreted; that plaintiff was on a public highway did not eliminate the possibility that she was committing a trespass within the meaning of statute. 148 C. 125.

Action under section barred by parental immunity doctrine. 34 CA 866. Cited. 42 CA 239. Absent specific language in Sec. 52-557n modifying common law rule of governmental immunity for claims of strict liability, section should not be so construed. 58 CA 702. Because defendant did not exercise dominion and control over the dog in any manner other than by placing a limit on when and where the dog could be let outside, defendant was not a “keeper” of the dog as provided in section. 94 CA 617. In action where plaintiff claimed damages as a result of potential exposure to rabies, strict liability under section does not extend to damage caused by a dog's merely passive, and, thus, innocent or involuntary, behavior. 135 CA 76. Under 2013 revision, exuberant unleashed dog was proximate cause of plaintiff falling and injuring herself, and defendant's claim that dog's actions were innocent are without merit. 187 CA 528.

Any local director of health may order the humane euthanasia of any unowned animal that is not currently vaccinated for rabies for the purpose of rabies testing if the director finds that the animal has bitten a person and the health or life of such person may be threatened.\n\n(b) The commissioner or any animal control officer appointed pursuant to section 22-328, 22-331 or 22-331a shall quarantine any animal in a public pound, veterinary hospital, kennel or other building or enclosure approved by the commissioner for such purpose, if in the determination of the commissioner or such officer, such animal is rabid or is suspected of being rabid, or has been bitten by, or may have been bitten by, or has been in contact with or exposed to, a rabid animal or an animal suspected of carrying rabies or any wild animal as defined in subsection (d) of this section. The length of such quarantine period shall be determined by the commissioner or the State Veterinarian who shall take into account the age, general health and vaccination history of the animal as well as current accepted veterinary practices.

During such quarantine such biting or attacking dog, cat or ferret shall be observed for clinical signs of rabies. On the tenth day of such quarantine, such dog, cat or ferret shall be examined by the State Veterinarian or a person designated by the State Veterinarian to determine whether such quarantine shall be continued or removed. The quarantine of a biting or attacking dog, cat or ferret shall conform to one of the following: (1) When the biting or attacking dog, cat or ferret has a current rabies vaccination, the biting or attacking dog, cat or ferret shall be quarantined in a public pound or in a veterinary hospital or in a commercial kennel approved by the State Veterinarian for such purpose or on the premises of the owner or keeper of such biting dog, cat or ferret when such premises is adequate for the confinement of such animal, as determined by the authority that issued such order; or (2) when the biting or attacking dog, cat or ferret does not have a current rabies vaccination, the biting or attacking dog, cat or ferret shall be quarantined in a public pound or in a veterinary hospital or in a commercial kennel approved by the State Veterinarian for such purpose, or the dog, cat or ferret may be quarantined or confined on the premises of the owner or keeper of the biting or attacking dog, cat or ferret due to medical necessity determined by a licensed veterinarian when such premises is adequate for the confinement of such animal and acceptable to the municipality or agency issuing the quarantine order and provided such animal is vaccinated for rabies by a licensed veterinarian on the tenth day of such quarantine.\n\n(d) The management, confinement, quarantine or disposition of biting or attacking animals other than dogs, cats or ferrets shall be determined by the State Veterinarian who shall take into account the age, general health, rabies vaccination status of the biting or attacking animal, the rabies vaccination status of the animal exposed to or bitten by rabid or suspected rabid wildlife and the current national recommendations for the prevention and control of rabies.\n\n(e) The owner or keeper of any animal that has been quarantined or confined pursuant to this section may authorize the humane euthanasia of such animal by a licensed veterinarian at any time before the end of the quarantine or confinement period for the purpose of testing such animal for rabies.

The veterinarian performing the euthanasia shall be responsible for ensuring that the head of the euthanized animal is delivered to the appropriate laboratory for rabies examination not later than forty-eight hours after such euthanasia. The costs of any such quarantine, veterinary examination, rabies vaccination, euthanasia and rabies testing shall be the responsibility of the owner or keeper of any animal quarantined or confined pursuant to this section.\n\n(f) Any dog, cat or other animal held in quarantine that is clinically diagnosed as rabid by a licensed veterinarian or the State Veterinarian shall be humanely euthanized immediately without prior notice to the owner or keeper of same.

The animal may only be sold or given away as a pet to a person who satisfies such officer that the animal will be given a good home and proper care. The municipal animal control officer may retain possession of such animal for such additional period of time as necessary to place such animal. Any animal, other than a dog, that is quarantined pursuant to this section and that is not claimed by its owner or keeper not later than five days after the expiration of such quarantine and that is not sold by the municipal or regional animal control officer not later than five days after the expiration of such quarantine, may be disposed of at the direction of the State Veterinarian.
