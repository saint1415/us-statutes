      "text": "(a) The Commissioner of Agriculture, at the request and expense of the authority in charge of any animal drawing contest, shall provide for the administration of a program to test, immediately before or after a drawing contest, for the presence of drugs in any animals participating in such contest. The authority may charge the owner of the animal being tested for the cost of such test. The commissioner may, within available appropriations, on the commissioner's own initiative and at state expense test animals participating in such contest on a random basis for the presence of drugs. The authority in charge of such contest shall provide well-lighted facilities, removed from the public, for the administration of such test. The owner or trainer or both the owner and trainer of any animal to be tested shall submit such animal for testing and shall provide assistance and proper restraint for confining such animal for and during the administration of such test. If the animal continues to resist the test after restraint is applied and the person administering the test determines a danger exists to the animal or persons present at the test, an alternative test shall be administered. No prize money shall be paid until the result of the test is known. If any such test reveals the presence of a drug in any such animal, such animal shall be disqualified to participate in such contest, shall be ineligible to receive any prize money awarded in such contest and shall be barred from participating in any such contest held in this state for a period of one year from the date of receipt by the commissioner of the results of the test. The owner or trainer or both the owner and trainer of any such animal shall be barred from entering any other animal in any such contest held in this state for a period of not less than one year nor more than two years at the commissioner's discretion from the date of receipt by the commissioner of the results of the test for the first finding of the presence of a drug and for a period of not less than two years nor more than three years at the commissioner's discretion for a second such finding. The owner of any such animal shall reimburse the authority in charge of such animal drawing contest or the state, as the case may be, for the expense of such test. The owner may appeal, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, any action by the commissioner authorized by this section.
