      "text": "It is hereby found and declared that a Connecticut Equestrian Center located in Keney Park in the capital city of this state will attract a significant share of equestrian events, thereby promoting the economic development of the state, increasing tourism by creating a nationally competitive center which will attract regional, national and international equestrian events and promoting business activity and employment in hotels, restaurants and recreational and support facilities. It is further found and declared that preliminary economic feasibility analyses respecting the planning for a new equestrian center in Hartford have shown that new spending by visitors to anticipated horse shows should generate an increase in revenues to the state from taxes on dollars spent by visitors and exhibitors of equine activities, and that this project will recapture Connecticut-based equestrian show activities currently being diverted to other states for the lack of a modern equine center, thereby improving the state's economy and increasing the state's tax revenues, promote equestrian activities for the enjoyment and health of Connecticut's citizens and provide a center which can assist in the advancement of Connecticut's husbandry industries through research and educational programs.\n\n(P.A. 95-231, S. 2, 5.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 95-231 effective July 1, 1995.",
