      "text": "(a) On and after July 1, 1989, no person shall commence an intensive poultry farming operation without a permit from the Commissioner of Agriculture. Any person seeking such a permit shall apply on forms provided by the commissioner and pay an application fee of twenty dollars. Upon receipt of a completed application the commissioner shall cause an inspection to be made of the premises where the applicant desires to conduct an intensive poultry farming operation. If the commissioner finds that such premises meet the requirements of sections 22-323a to 22-324a, inclusive, and applicable regulations and may reasonably be expected to continue to meet such requirements, he shall issue the permit. If the commissioner finds that the premises do not meet such requirements, or may not reasonably be expected to continue to meet such requirements, the application shall be denied. When any permit has been denied the applicant may, within ten days of the notification of the denial, request in writing a hearing and appeal before the commissioner or his designee. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the commissioner after a hearing may appeal to the superior court for the judicial district in which he seeks to conduct such farming operation. No permit granted under this section shall be transferable by the permittee, and each permit shall apply to only one premise, which shall be specified in the permit. The commissioner may issue only one permit for a premise.\n\n(b) The commissioner may require a surety bond in an amount not exceeding ten thousand dollars as a condition of the permit described in subsection (a) of this section. The bond shall indemnify the commissioner for expenses he may incur in carrying out the provisions of section 22-326d.\n\n(c) The commissioner may suspend or revoke a permit issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for failure to operate in compliance with the provisions of sections 22-323a to 22-324a, inclusive, and applicable regulations. Whenever the commissioner is satisfied of the existence of one or more reasons for suspending or revoking a permit, he shall give notice to the permittee by registered mail of a hearing to be held in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 at the time stated in the notice. The commissioner may compel the attendance of witnesses and the person complained against shall have the opportunity to produce witnesses or other evidence in his behalf. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the commissioner after a hearing may appeal to the superior court for the judicial district in which he conducts such farming operation.\n\n(P.A. 89-226, S. 4, 6; June 30 Sp.
