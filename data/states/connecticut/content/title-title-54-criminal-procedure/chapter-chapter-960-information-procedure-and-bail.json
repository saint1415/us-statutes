      "text": "(a) The Superior Court may, when necessary, order a grand jury of eighteen electors of the judicial district where said court is sitting to be summoned, impaneled and sworn to inquire after and present such offenses as are cognizable by said court. Said court may, in its discretion, order one or two additional electors to be added to the grand jury as alternate grand jurors. Such alternate jurors shall be sworn separately from those constituting the regular panel and shall not counsel or confer with members of the regular panel as to any matters before the grand jury unless they become a part of the regular panel as hereinafter provided. They shall attend the sessions of the grand jury and shall be seated with or near the members of the regular panel, with equal opportunity to see and hear all matters adduced in the proceedings. If for any reason a grand juror is unable to further perform his duty, the court may excuse him and, if any grand juror is so excused or dies, the court may order that the alternate juror or, if more than one, that one who is designated by lot drawn by the clerk of the Superior Court, shall become a part of the regular panel and the inquiry shall then proceed as though such grand juror had been a member of the regular panel from the beginning of the inquiry.\n\n(b) No person shall be put to plea or held to trial for any crime the punishment of which may be death or imprisonment for life, charged by the state before May 26, 1983, unless an indictment has been found against him for such crime by a grand jury legally impaneled and sworn, and no bill shall be presented by any grand jury unless at least twelve of the jurors agree to it.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 8747; February, 1965, P.A. 173; P.A. 73-116, S. 1; 73-667, S. 1, 2; P.A. 78-280, S. 2, 127; P.A. 80-313, S. 3; P.A. 83-210, S. 3, 5.)\n\nHistory: 1965 act added provisions for alternate grand jurors; P.A. 73-116 added reference to judicial districts; P.A. 73-667 changed effective date of P.A. 73-116 from October 1, 1973, to April 25, 1973; P.A. 78-280 deleted reference to counties; P.A. 80-313 divided section into Subsecs; P.A. 83-210 amended Subsec. (b) to require a grand jury indictment for crimes punishable by death or imprisonment for life “charged by the state before May 26, 1983” to reflect the establishment of a probable cause hearing pursuant to Sec. 54-46a in place of a grand jury proceeding for persons accused of such crimes.\n\nSee Sec. 1-25 re forms of oaths for jurors.\n\nPowers and duties of grand jury. 1 C. 428. Where death or imprisonment for life is not penalty, no grand jury necessary. 3 C. 112. Inquiry before grand jury must be secret. 16 C. 467. Not necessary that accused be present. 21 C. 279. Quaere, whether member of grand jury may be challenged for favor; if absolute disqualification is discovered after indictment found, it may be pleaded in avoidance. 47 C. 106. The endorsement of a “true bill” on an indictment cannot be contradicted by parol evidence on habeas corpus proceedings; 67 C. 553; and, in habeas corpus proceedings in U.S. courts, failure to so endorse is not regarded. 160 U.S. 231. When required, an interpreter may be present in the grand jury room. 106 C. 721. When an accused person is confined for a crime punishable by death or life imprisonment, it is the duty of the court to order a grand jury; and this may be done before opening of term to which accused was bound over. Id., 719. When court may select members of grand jury. 126 C. 64. In a general investigation by grand jury, state's attorney may be present to aid in examination of witnesses. Id., 66. Jury may have stenographer present; what evidence jury may elicit. Id., 71. Constitution does not protect a person from being questioned by grand jury but only gives immunity from answering particular questions; history and nature of grand jury. Id., 72. Cited. 135 C. 269. Requires an indictment by a grand jury in all cases in which the penalty to be imposed may be life imprisonment. 144 C. 295. Grand jury in which 7 out of 18 are attorneys not in itself illegal where there is no evidence of an intentional and systematic exclusion of any group. 146 C. 137. Cited. Id., 227; 153 C. 325. There is no federal constitutional impediment to dispensing entirely with grand jury in state prosecutions. 155 C. 367. In absence of contrary evidence, presumption arises that selection of grand jury was made without discrimination and fairly by officer in charge of selection. 158 C. 341.

(a) is made available under the inherent supervisory powers of the Superior Court and evidentiary uses of it by defendant are restricted to impeaching a witness, attacking the credibility of a witness or proving inconsistent statements of a witness. 187 C. 281. Trial court's denial of motion to quash the ordering of second grand jury is not one of those few presentence orders deemed final for purposes of appeal. 191 C. 27. During period between November 24, 1982, and May 26, 1983, statute provided authorization for use of grand juries in cases punishable by death or life imprisonment. 192 C. 671. Cited.

Person not given right to counsel before grand jury decision; this is not “critical stage” in proceedings against him. 25 CS 61. Grand jury is not prohibited from receiving hearsay evidence; that such evidence may have been considered by the grand jury would not entitle one who had been indicted to have the indictment quashed. Id., 388. Counsel for the accused may not accompany him before the grand jury. Id., 389. Section was fully complied with by the court and its officers in summoning grand jury in absence of a showing that any of the members were disqualified for any reason. 26 CS 211. Nature of grand jury discussed; not the state's burden to prove that the method of selection of grand jury was fair and nondiscriminatory. Id., 213. Charge to grand jury that presumption of sanity was adequate basis on which to find, so far as element of soundness of mind was concerned, probable cause to hold accused for trial, was accurate; constitutional right of accused to counsel does not include representation by counsel before a grand jury. Id., 214. Indictment insufficient in law may be attacked by demurrer; provision that grand jurors come from county where court sits is broad enough to comply with federal constitutional requirement that there must be no intentional or systematic exclusion of group or class from grand jury. 29 CS 119. Exclusion of aliens from grand jury service does not make statute unconstitutional since citizenship requirement bears rational relationship to demands of jury service. 35 CS 98.

The court shall be confined to the rules of evidence, except that written reports of expert witnesses shall be admissible in evidence and matters involving chain of custody shall be exempt from such rules.

A law enforcement official may apply for an ex parte order from a judge of the Superior Court allowing the installation and use of a cell site simulator device to obtain geo-location data. The judge shall grant such order if the law enforcement official swears in a statement under oath that there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been or is being committed and the geo-location data associated with a subscriber's or customer's call-identifying information is relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation, in which case such order shall authorize the installation or use of a cell site simulator device to obtain geo-location data. Any order entered pursuant to this subdivision shall state upon its face the case number assigned to such investigation, the date and time of issuance of the order and the name of the judge authorizing the order.

If the law enforcement official seeks to install and use a cell site simulator device to obtain geo-location data relating to the same criminal investigation for a period of time exceeding forty-eight hours, such official shall apply for an ex parte order in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection. In addition, the law enforcement official shall file as part of the application, a statement under oath attesting to the facts and beliefs concerning the exigent circumstances that existed and supported the use of the cell site simulator device for a period of time not exceeding forty-eight hours.

The law enforcement official shall maintain a true copy of such certification. During such ninety-day period, the law enforcement official may request the court to extend such period of delayed notification. Such period may be extended beyond ninety days only upon approval of the court. The applicant shall file a copy of the notice with the clerk of the court for the geographical area within which any person who may be arrested in connection with or subsequent to the execution of the order would be presented, and such notice shall include the case number assigned to such investigation pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.

Any information provided in response to the court order shall be disclosed to the defense counsel.\n\n(g) A telecommunications carrier or provider of electronic communication service or remote computing service that provides information pursuant to an order issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or pursuant to an application made pursuant to subsection (d) of this section shall be compensated for the reasonable expenses incurred in providing such information.\n\n(h) Any telecommunications carrier or provider of electronic communication service or remote computing service that provides information pursuant to an order issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or an application made pursuant to subsection (d) of this section shall be afforded the legal protections provided under 18 USC 3124, as amended from time to time, with regard to such actions.\n\n(i) No information obtained pursuant to subsections (b) to (d), inclusive, of this section shall be retained for a period in excess of fourteen days, unless such information relates to an ongoing criminal investigation. Any information provided pursuant to subsections (b) to (d), inclusive, of this section shall be disclosed to the defense counsel.\n\n(j) Not later than January fifteenth of each year, each law enforcement official shall report to the Chief State's Attorney the information required by this subsection with respect to each order issued pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of this section and each application made pursuant to subsection (d) of this section in the preceding calendar year. The Chief State's Attorney shall, based upon the reports filed by each law enforcement official and not later than January thirty-first of each year, submit a report, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a, to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to criminal law and procedure concerning orders issued pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of this section and applications made pursuant to subsection (d) of this section in the preceding calendar year.

Within five calendar days of the conclusion of the hearing, the investigatory grand jury shall render its decision, and shall send copies thereof to all those to whom it gave notice of the hearing. It shall deny any such motion unless it makes specific findings of fact on the record that there is a substantial probability that one of the following interests will be prejudiced by publicity that nondisclosure would prevent, and that reasonable alternatives to nondisclosure cannot adequately protect that interest: (1) The right of a person to a fair trial; (2) the prevention of potential defendants from fleeing; (3) the prevention of subornation of perjury or tampering with witnesses; or (4) the protection of the lives and reputations of innocent persons which would be significantly damaged by the release of uncorroborated information.

State's right of access to testimony of grand jury witness includes right to use that testimony in its case-in-chief in subsequent criminal prosecution of that witness; to the extent that trial court's ruling is predicated on grand juror's order of secrecy, it lacks support in record because defendant never established that he relied to his detriment on grand juror's order of secrecy. 250 C. 188.

A defendant and the defendant's counsel may waive the court hearing only if the examiners, in the written report, determine without qualification that the defendant is competent. Nothing in this subsection shall limit any other release or use of information from said database permitted by law.\n\n(f)Court finding of competency or incompetency.If the court, after the hearing, finds that the defendant is competent, the court shall continue with the criminal proceedings. If the court finds that the defendant is not competent, the court shall also find whether there is a substantial probability that the defendant, if provided with a course of treatment, will regain competency within the maximum period of any placement order permitted under this section.\n\n(g)Court procedure if finding that defendant will not regain competency.If, at the hearing, the court finds that there is not a substantial probability that the defendant, if provided with a course of treatment, will regain competency within the period of any placement order under this section, the court shall follow the procedure set forth in subsection (m) of this section.\n\n(h)Court procedure if finding that defendant will regain competency. Placement of defendant for treatment or pending civil commitment proceedings. Progress report.(1) If, at the hearing, the court finds that there is a substantial probability that the defendant, if provided with a course of treatment, will regain competency within the period of any placement order under this section, the court shall either (A) order placement of the defendant for treatment for the purpose of rendering the defendant competent, or (B) order placement of the defendant at a treatment facility pending civil commitment proceedings pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n(2) (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, if the court makes a finding pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection and does not order placement pursuant to subparagraph (A) of said subdivision, the court shall, on its own motion or on motion of the state or the defendant, order placement of the defendant in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services at a treatment facility pending civil commitment proceedings. The treatment facility shall be determined by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services. Such order shall: (i) Include an authorization for the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services to apply for civil commitment of such defendant pursuant to sections 17a-495 to 17a-528, inclusive; (ii) permit the defendant to agree to request voluntarily to be admitted under section 17a-506 and participate voluntarily in a treatment plan prepared by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, and require that the defendant comply with such treatment plan; and (iii) provide that if the application for civil commitment is denied or not pursued by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, or if the defendant is unwilling or unable to comply with a treatment plan despite reasonable efforts of the treatment facility to encourage the defendant's compliance, the person in charge of the treatment facility, or such person's designee, shall submit a written progress report to the court and the defendant shall be returned to the court for a hearing pursuant to subsection (k) of this section. Such written progress report shall include the status of any civil commitment proceedings concerning the defendant, the defendant's compliance with the treatment plan, an opinion regarding the defendant's current competency to stand trial, the clinical findings of the person submitting the report and the facts upon which the findings are based, and any other information concerning the defendant requested by the court, including, but not limited to, the method of treatment or the type, dosage and effect of any medication the defendant is receiving. The Court Support Services Division shall monitor the defendant's compliance with any applicable provisions of such order. The period of placement and monitoring under such order shall not exceed the period of the maximum sentence which the defendant could receive on conviction of the charges against such defendant, or eighteen months, whichever is less. If the defendant has complied with such treatment plan and any applicable provisions of such order, at the end of the period of placement and monitoring, the court shall approve the entry of a nolle prosequi to the charges against the defendant or shall dismiss such charges.\n\n(B) This subdivision shall not apply: (i) To any person charged with a class A felony, a class B felony, except a violation of section 53a-122 that does not involve the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against another person, or a violation of section 53a-70b of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2019, or section 14-227a or 14-227m, subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of section 14-227n, subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 53-21 or section 53a-56b, 53a-60d, 53a-70, 53a-70a, 53a-71, 53a-72a or 53a-72b; (ii) to any person charged with a crime or motor vehicle violation who, as a result of the commission of such crime or motor vehicle violation, causes the death of another person; or (iii) unless good cause is shown, to any person charged with a class C felony.\n\n(i)Placement for treatment. Conditions.(1) The placement of the defendant for treatment for the purpose of rendering the defendant competent shall comply with the following conditions: (A) The period of placement under the order or combination of orders shall not exceed the period of the maximum sentence which the defendant could receive on conviction of the charges against the defendant or eighteen months, whichever is less; (B) the placement shall be either (i) in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services, except that any defendant placed for treatment with the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services may remain in the custody of the Department of Correction pursuant to subsection (p) of this section; or, (ii) if the defendant or the appropriate commissioner agrees to provide payment, in the custody of any appropriate mental health facility or treatment program which agrees to provide treatment to the defendant and to adhere to the requirements of this section; and (C) the court shall order the placement, on either an inpatient or an outpatient basis, which the court finds is the least restrictive placement appropriate and available to restore competency.\n\n(2) In determining the least restrictive placement appropriate and available to restore competency, the court shall consider the following factors: (A) The nature and circumstances of the alleged crime; (B) such defendant's record of criminal convictions; (C) such defendant's record of appearance in court; (D) such defendant's family and community ties; (E) such defendant's willingness and ability to engage with treatment ordered under this section; (F) whether such defendant's use of substances would interfere with such defendant's ability to be successful in such placement; (G) any psychiatric symptoms experienced by such defendant and the nature and severity of the symptoms; and (H) any other relevant factors specific to the defendant and such defendant's circumstances.\n\n(3) If the defendant is not charged with a felony, the court shall presume that outpatient treatment is the least restrictive placement appropriate and available to restore competency, unless the court has good cause to find otherwise based on review of the factors in subdivision (2) of this subsection. If outpatient treatment is the least restrictive placement for a defendant who has not yet been released from a correctional facility, the court shall consider whether the availability of such treatment is a sufficient basis on which to release the defendant on a promise to appear, conditions of release, cash bail or bond. If the court determines that the defendant may not be so released, the court shall order treatment of the defendant on an inpatient basis at a mental health facility or facility for persons with intellectual disability. Not later than twenty-four hours after the court orders placement of the defendant for treatment for the purpose of rendering the defendant competent, the examiners shall transmit information obtained about the defendant during the course of an examination pursuant to subsection (d) of this section to the health care provider named in the court's order.\n\n(j)Progress reports re treatment.The person in charge of the treatment facility, or such person's designee, or the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services with respect to any defendant who is in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction pursuant to subsection (p) of this section, shall submit a written progress report to the court (1) at least seven days prior to the date of any hearing on the issue of the defendant's competency; (2) whenever he or she believes that the defendant has attained competency; (3) whenever he or she believes that there is not a substantial probability that the defendant will attain competency within the period covered by the placement order; (4) whenever, within the first one hundred twenty days of the period covered by the placement order, he or she believes that the defendant would be eligible for civil commitment pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (h) of this section; or (5) whenever he or she believes that the defendant is still not competent but has improved sufficiently such that continued inpatient commitment is no longer the least restrictive placement appropriate and available to restore competency. The progress report shall contain: (A) The clinical findings of the person submitting the report and the facts on which the findings are based; (B) the opinion of the person submitting the report as to whether the defendant has attained competency or as to whether the defendant is making progress, under treatment, toward attaining competency within the period covered by the placement order; (C) the opinion of the person submitting the report as to whether the defendant appears to be eligible for civil commitment to a hospital for psychiatric disabilities pursuant to subsection (m) of this section and the appropriateness of such civil commitment, if there is not a substantial probability that the defendant will attain competency within the period covered by the placement order; and (D) any other information concerning the defendant requested by the court, including, but not limited to, the method of treatment or the type, dosage and effect of any medication the defendant is receiving. Not later than five business days after the court finds either that the defendant will not attain competency within the period of any placement order under this section or that the defendant has regained competency, the person in charge of the treatment facility, or such person's designee, or the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services with respect to any defendant who is in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction pursuant to subsection (p) of this section, shall provide a copy of the written progress report to the examiners who examined the defendant pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(k)Reconsideration of competency. Hearing. Involuntary medication. Appointment and duties of health care guardian.(1) Whenever any placement order for treatment is rendered or continued, the court shall set a date for a hearing, to be held within ninety days, for reconsideration of the issue of the defendant's competency. Whenever the court (A) receives a report pursuant to subsection (j) of this section which indicates that (i) the defendant has attained competency, (ii) the defendant will not attain competency within the remainder of the period covered by the placement order, (iii) the defendant will not attain competency within the remainder of the period covered by the placement order absent administration of psychiatric medication for which the defendant is unwilling or unable to provide consent, (iv) the defendant would be eligible for civil commitment pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (h) of this section, or (v) the defendant is still not competent but has improved sufficiently such that continued inpatient commitment is no longer the least restrictive placement appropriate and available to restore competency, or (B) receives a report pursuant to subparagraph (A)(iii) of subdivision (2) of subsection (h) of this section which indicates that (i) the application for civil commitment of the defendant has been denied or has not been pursued by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, or (ii) the defendant is unwilling or unable to comply with a treatment plan despite reasonable efforts of the treatment facility to encourage the defendant's compliance, the court shall set the matter for a hearing not later than ten days after the report is received. The hearing may be waived by the defendant only if the report indicates that the defendant is competent. With respect to a defendant who is in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction pursuant to subsection (p) of this section, the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services shall retain responsibility for providing testimony at any hearing under this subsection. The court shall determine whether the defendant is competent or is making progress toward attaining competency within the period covered by the placement order. If the court finds that the defendant is competent, the defendant shall be returned to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction or released, if the defendant has met the conditions for release, and the court shall continue with the criminal proceedings. If the court finds that the defendant is still not competent but that the defendant is making progress toward attaining competency, the court may continue or modify the placement order. If the court finds that the defendant is still not competent but that the defendant is making progress toward attaining competency and inpatient placement is no longer the least restrictive placement appropriate and available to restore competency, the court shall consider whether the availability of such less restrictive placement is a sufficient basis on which to release the defendant on a promise to appear, conditions of release, cash bail or bond and may order continued treatment to restore competency on an outpatient basis. If the court finds that the defendant is still not competent and will not attain competency within the remainder of the period covered by the placement order absent administration of psychiatric medication for which the defendant is unwilling or unable to provide consent, the court shall proceed as provided in subdivisions (2), (3) and (4) of this subsection. If the court finds that the defendant is eligible for civil commitment, the court may order placement of the defendant at a treatment facility pending civil commitment proceedings pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (h) of this section.\n\n(2) If the court finds that the defendant will not attain competency within the remainder of the period covered by the placement order absent administration of psychiatric medication for which the defendant is unwilling or unable to provide consent, and after any hearing held pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection, the court may order the involuntary medication of the defendant if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that: (A) To a reasonable degree of medical certainty, involuntary medication of the defendant will render the defendant competent to stand trial, (B) an adjudication of guilt or innocence cannot be had using less intrusive means, (C) the proposed treatment plan is narrowly tailored to minimize intrusion on the defendant's liberty and privacy interests, (D) the proposed drug regimen will not cause an unnecessary risk to the defendant's health, and (E) the seriousness of the alleged crime is such that the criminal law enforcement interest of the state in fairly and accurately determining the defendant's guilt or innocence overrides the defendant's interest in self-determination.\n\n(3) (A) If the court finds that the defendant is unwilling or unable to provide consent for the administration of psychiatric medication, and prior to deciding whether to order the involuntary medication of the defendant under subdivision (2) of this subsection, the court shall appoint a health care guardian who shall be a licensed health care provider with specialized training in the treatment of persons with psychiatric disabilities to represent the health care interests of the defendant before the court. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 52-146e, such health care guardian shall have access to the psychiatric records of the defendant. Such health care guardian shall file a report with the court not later than thirty days after his or her appointment. The report shall set forth such health care guardian's findings and recommendations concerning the administration of psychiatric medication to the defendant, including the risks and benefits of such medication, the likelihood and seriousness of any adverse side effects and the prognosis with and without such medication. The court shall hold a hearing on the matter not later than ten days after receipt of such health care guardian's report and shall, in deciding whether to order the involuntary medication of the defendant, take into account such health care guardian's opinion concerning the health care interests of the defendant.\n\n(B) The court, in anticipation of considering continued involuntary medication of the defendant under subdivision (4) of this subsection, shall order the health care guardian to file a supplemental report updating the findings and recommendations contained in the health care guardian's report filed under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision.\n\n(4) If, after the defendant has been found to have attained competency by means of involuntary medication ordered under subdivision (2) of this subsection, the court determines by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant will not remain competent absent the continued administration of psychiatric medication for which the defendant is unable to provide consent, and after any hearing held pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection and consideration of the supplemental report of the health care guardian, the court may order continued involuntary medication of the defendant if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that: (A) To a reasonable degree of medical certainty, continued involuntary medication of the defendant will maintain the defendant's competency to stand trial, (B) an adjudication of guilt or innocence cannot be had using less intrusive means, (C) the proposed treatment plan is narrowly tailored to minimize intrusion on the defendant's liberty and privacy interests, (D) the proposed drug regimen will not cause an unnecessary risk to the defendant's health, and (E) the seriousness of the alleged crime is such that the criminal law enforcement interest of the state in fairly and accurately determining the defendant's guilt or innocence overrides the defendant's interest in self-determination. Continued involuntary medication ordered under this subdivision may be administered to the defendant while the criminal charges against the defendant are pending and the defendant is in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction or the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services. An order for continued involuntary medication of the defendant under this subdivision shall be reviewed by the court every one hundred eighty days while such order remains in effect. The court shall order the health care guardian to file a supplemental report for each such review. After any hearing held pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection and consideration of the supplemental report of the health care guardian, the court may continue such order if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the criteria enumerated in subparagraphs (A) to (E), inclusive, of this subdivision are met.\n\n(5) The state shall hold harmless and indemnify any health care guardian appointed by the court pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection from financial loss and expense arising out of any claim, demand, suit or judgment by reason of such health care guardian's alleged negligence or alleged deprivation of any person's civil rights or other act or omission resulting in damage or injury, provided the health care guardian is found to have been acting in the discharge of his or her duties pursuant to said subdivision and such act or omission is found not to have been wanton, reckless or malicious. The provisions of subsections (b), (c) and (d) of section 5-141d shall apply to such health care guardian. The provisions of chapter 53 shall not apply to a claim against such health care guardian.\n\n(l)Failure of defendant to return to treatment facility in accordance with terms and conditions of release.If a defendant who has been ordered placed for treatment on an inpatient basis at a mental health facility or a facility for persons with intellectual disability is released from such facility on a furlough or for work, therapy or any other reason and fails to return to the facility in accordance with the terms and conditions of the defendant's release, the person in charge of the facility, or such person's designee, shall, within twenty-four hours of the defendant's failure to return, report such failure to the prosecuting authority for the court location which ordered the placement of the defendant. Upon receipt of such a report, the prosecuting authority shall, within available resources, make reasonable efforts to notify any victim or victims of the crime for which the defendant is charged of such defendant's failure to return to the facility. No civil liability shall be incurred by the state or the prosecuting authority for failure to notify any victim or victims in accordance with this subsection. The failure of a defendant to return to the facility in which the defendant has been placed may constitute sufficient cause for the defendant's rearrest upon order by the court.\n\n(m)Release or placement of defendant who will not attain competency. Report to court prior to release from placement.(1) If at any time the court determines that there is not a substantial probability that the defendant will attain competency within the period of treatment allowed by this section, or if at the end of such period the court finds that the defendant is still not competent, the court shall consider any recommendation made by the examiners pursuant to subsection (d) of this section and any opinion submitted by the treatment facility pursuant to subparagraph (C) of subsection (j) of this section regarding eligibility for, and the appropriateness of, civil commitment to a hospital for psychiatric disabilities and shall either release the defendant from custody or order the defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services. If the court orders the defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services, the commissioner given custody, or the commissioner's designee, shall then apply for civil commitment in accordance with sections 17a-75 to 17a-83, inclusive, or 17a-270 to 17a-282, inclusive. If the court orders the defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the court may order the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, to apply for civil commitment in accordance with sections 17a-495 to 17a-528, inclusive, or order the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, to provide services to the defendant in a less restrictive setting, provided the examiners have determined in the written report filed pursuant to subsection (d) of this section or have testified pursuant to subsection (e) of this section that such services are available and appropriate. If the court orders the defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services and orders the commissioner to apply for civil commitment pursuant to this subsection, the court may order the commissioner to give the court notice when the defendant is released from the commissioner's custody if such release is prior to the expiration of the time within which the defendant may be prosecuted for the crime with which the defendant is charged, provided such order indicates when such time expires. If the court orders the defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Developmental Services for purposes of commitment under any provision of sections 17a-270 to 17a-282, inclusive, the court may order the Commissioner of Developmental Services to give the court notice when the defendant's commitment is terminated if such termination is prior to the expiration of the time within which the defendant may be prosecuted for the crime with which the defendant is charged, provided such order indicates when such time expires.\n\n(2) The court shall hear arguments as to whether the defendant should be released or should be placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services.\n\n(3) If the court orders the release of a defendant charged with the commission of a crime that resulted in the death or serious physical injury, as defined in section 53a-3, of another person, or with a violation of section 53a-70b of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2019, or subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 53-21, subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 53a-60 or section 53a-60a, 53a-70, 53a-70a, 53a-71, 53a-72a or 53a-72b, or orders the placement of such defendant in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services or the Commissioner of Developmental Services, the court may, on its own motion or on motion of the prosecuting authority, order, as a condition of such release or placement, periodic examinations of the defendant as to the defendant's competency at intervals of not less than six months. If, at any time after the initial periodic examination, the court finds again, based upon an examiner's recommendation, that there is a substantial probability that the defendant, if provided with a course of treatment, will never regain competency, then any subsequent periodic examination of the defendant as to the defendant's competency shall be at intervals of not less than eighteen months. Such an examination shall be conducted in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. Periodic examinations ordered by the court under this subsection shall continue until the court finds that the defendant has attained competency or until the time within which the defendant may be prosecuted for the crime with which the defendant is charged, as provided in section 54-193, has expired, whichever occurs first.\n\n(4) Upon receipt of the written report as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the court shall, upon the request of either party filed not later than thirty days after the court receives such report, conduct a hearing as provided in subsection (e) of this section. Such hearing shall be held not later than ninety days after the court receives such report. If the court finds that the defendant has attained competency, the defendant shall be returned to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction or released, if the defendant has met the conditions for release, and the court shall continue with the criminal proceedings.\n\n(5) The court shall dismiss, with or without prejudice, any charges for which a nolle prosequi is not entered when the time within which the defendant may be prosecuted for the crime with which the defendant is charged, as provided in section 54-193, has expired. Notwithstanding the record erasure provisions of section 54-142a, police and court records and records of any state's attorney pertaining to a charge which is nolled or dismissed without prejudice while the defendant is not competent shall not be erased until the time for the prosecution of the defendant expires under section 54-193. A defendant who is not civilly committed as a result of an application made by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services pursuant to this section shall be released. A defendant who is civilly committed pursuant to such an application shall be treated in the same manner as any other civilly committed person.\n\n(n)Payment of costs.The cost of the examination effected by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services and of testimony of persons conducting the examination effected by the commissioner shall be paid by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services. The cost of the examination and testimony by physicians appointed by the court shall be paid by the Judicial Department. If the defendant is indigent, the fee of the person selected by the defendant to observe the examination and to testify on the defendant's behalf shall be paid by the Public Defender Services Commission. The expense of treating a defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (h) of this section or subsection (i) of this section shall be computed and paid for in the same manner as is provided for persons committed by a probate court under the provisions of sections 17b-122, 17b-124 to 17b-132, inclusive, 17b-136 to 17b-138, inclusive, 17b-194 to 17b-197, inclusive, 17b-222 to 17b-250, inclusive, 17b-263, 17b-340 to 17b-350, inclusive, 17b-689b and 17b-743 to 17b-747, inclusive.\n\n(o)Custody of defendant prior to hearing.Until the hearing is held, the defendant, if not released on a promise to appear, conditions of release, cash bail or bond, shall remain in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction unless hospitalized as provided in sections 17a-512 to 17a-517, inclusive.\n\n(p)Placement of defendant who presents significant security, safety or medical risk. Defendant remaining in custody of Commissioner of Correction.(1) This section shall not be construed to require the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services to place any defendant who presents a significant security, safety or medical risk in a hospital for psychiatric disabilities which does not have the trained staff, facilities or security to accommodate such a person, as determined by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services in consultation with the Commissioner of Correction.\n\n(2) If a defendant is placed for treatment with the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services pursuant to subsection (i) of this section and such defendant is not placed in a hospital for psychiatric disabilities pursuant to a determination made by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services under subdivision (1) of this subsection, the defendant shall remain in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction. The Commissioner of Correction shall be responsible for the medical and psychiatric care of the defendant, and the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services shall remain responsible to provide other appropriate services to restore competency.\n\n(3) If a defendant remains in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection and the court finds that the defendant is still not competent and will not attain competency within the remainder of the period covered by the placement order absent administration of psychiatric medication for which the defendant is unwilling or unable to provide consent, the court shall proceed as provided in subdivisions (2), (3) and (4) of subsection (k) of this section. Nothing in this subdivision shall prevent the court from making any other finding or order set forth in subsection (k) of this section.\n\n(q)Defense of defendant prior to trial.This section shall not prevent counsel for the defendant from raising, prior to trial and while the defendant is not competent, any issue susceptible of fair determination.\n\n(r)Credit for time in confinement on inpatient basis.Actual time spent in confinement on an inpatient basis pursuant to this section shall be credited against any sentence imposed on the defendant in the pending criminal case or in any other case arising out of the same conduct in the same manner as time is credited for time spent in a correctional facility awaiting trial.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 8748; 1959, P.A. 523, S. 2; 1967, P.A. 670; 1969, P.A. 828, S. 213; P.A. 74-306, S. 1–4; P.A. 75-476, S. 1–3, 6; P.A. 76-353; 76-436, S. 532, 681; P.A. 77-415, S. 1, 2; P.A. 78-280, S. 117, 127; P.A. 80-313, S. 32; P.A. 81-365; P.A. 83-183, S. 1–5; P.A. 84-506; P.A. 85-288; 85-613, S. 79, 154; P.A. 93-91, S. 1, 2; P.A. 94-27, S. 16, 17; P.A. 95-146; 95-257, S. 11, 58; P.A. 96-90; 96-180, S. 128, 166; 96-215, S. 3, 4; P.A. 98-88, S. 1, 2; P.A. 01-41; June 30 Sp.

Trial court improperly failed to canvass defendant personally and relied on old competency report despite defense counsel's representations that competency issues had newly surfaced; even when defendant is competent at commencement of trial, trial court must be alert to circumstances suggesting a change that would render defendant unable to meet the standards of competence to stand trial. 315 C. 151.\n\nCited. 5 CA 79; 6 CA 476; 8 CA 491; 9 CA 587; 14 CA 140; Id., 586; 17 CA 602; 20 CA 212; 22 CA 477; 25 CA 741; 28 CA 360; judgment reversed, see 229 C. 529; Id., 548; 30 CA 428; 32 CA 553; 34 CA 236; 36 CA 135; Id., 641; 54 CA 361. Defendant is presumed competent and burden to show otherwise is on party alleging incompetence. 62 CA 367. Trial court did not improperly fail to order competency hearing in light of court's observations of defendant at trial and various evaluation reports from mental health facility in which he had been treated, all of which concluded that he was competent to stand trial and that he was engaging in a deliberate pattern of behavior to delay his trial; trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining defendant was malingering in order to delay trial and that competency hearing under section was not required. 81 CA 294. Although defense counsel expressed concerns about defendant's competency, court had opportunity to observe defendant on numerous occasions and did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motion for a competency evaluation. 113 CA 651. To demonstrate that trial counsel was ineffective for purposes of this section, petitioner must show that trial counsel had substantial evidence to raise a reasonable doubt regarding petitioner's lack of competence, but failed to act on it by moving for a competency hearing, and such evidence required trial counsel to investigate petitioner's competence further, but failed to do so. 166 CA 707.\n\nCited. 44 CS 101.

(m):\n\nThe term “defendant” includes a respondent in a juvenile matter. 291 C. 556. Subdiv.

Section, as amended by P.A. 98-88, applies retroactively to authorize court to order periodic competency evaluations of incompetent defendant charged with the commission of a crime that resulted in death or serious physical injury; trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering periodic competency evaluations of defendant when there is no possibility that he will ever regain competence because the plain language of statute contains no such limitation and there is an interest in giving the state a formal mechanism of keeping abreast of possible improvements in defendant's mental condition that may allow prosecution to go forward. 126 CA 539; judgment affirmed, see 307 C. 548.",

The period of such probation or supervision, or both, shall not exceed two years. If the defendant has reached the age of sixteen years but has not reached the age of eighteen years, the court may order that as a condition of such probation the defendant be referred for services to a youth service bureau established pursuant to section 10-19m, provided the court finds, through an assessment by a youth service bureau or its designee, that the defendant is in need of and likely to benefit from such services. When determining any conditions of probation to order for a person entering such program who was charged with a misdemeanor that did not involve the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against another person or a motor vehicle violation, the court shall consider ordering the person to perform community service in the community in which the offense or violation occurred. If the court determines that community service is appropriate, such community service may be implemented by a community court established in accordance with section 51-181c if the offense or violation occurred within the jurisdiction of a community court established by said section. If the defendant is charged with a violation of section 46a-58, 53-37a, 53a-181j, 53a-181k or 53a-181l, the court may order that as a condition of such probation the defendant participate in a hate crimes diversion program as provided in subsection (e) of this section. If a defendant is charged with a violation of section 53-247, the court may order that as a condition of such probation the defendant undergo psychiatric or psychological counseling or participate in an animal cruelty prevention and education program provided such a program exists and is available to the defendant.\n\n(e) If the court orders the defendant to participate in a hate crimes diversion program as a condition of probation, the defendant shall pay to the court a participation fee of four hundred twenty-five dollars, except as provided in subsection (g) of this section. The Judicial Department shall contract with service providers, develop standards and oversee appropriate hate crimes diversion programs to meet the requirements of this section. Any defendant whose employment or residence makes it unreasonable to attend a hate crimes diversion program in this state may attend a program in another state which has standards substantially similar to, or higher than, those of this state, subject to the approval of the court and payment of the application and program fees as provided in this section. The hate crimes diversion program shall consist of an educational program and supervised community service.\n\n(f) If a defendant released to the supervision of the Court Support Services Division satisfactorily completes such defendant's period of probation, such defendant may apply for dismissal of the charges against such defendant and the court, on finding such satisfactory completion, shall dismiss such charges. If the defendant does not apply for dismissal of the charges against such defendant after satisfactorily completing such defendant's period of probation, the court, upon receipt of a report submitted by the Court Support Services Division that the defendant satisfactorily completed such defendant's period of probation, may on its own motion make a finding of such satisfactory completion and dismiss such charges. If a defendant transferred to the court handling the criminal docket for drug-dependent persons satisfactorily completes such defendant's period of supervision, the court shall release the defendant to the supervision of the Court Support Services Division under such conditions as the court shall order or shall dismiss such charges. Upon dismissal, all records of such charges shall be erased pursuant to section 54-142a. An order of the court denying a motion to dismiss the charges against a defendant who has completed such defendant's period of probation or supervision or terminating the participation of a defendant in such program shall be a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\n\n(g) The court shall waive any application or participation fee under this section for any person who (1) files with the court an affidavit of indigency or inability to pay, assisted by the Court Support Services Division, to the extent requested by such person, and the court enters a finding of inability to pay, or (2) has been determined indigent and eligible for representation by a public defender who has been appointed on behalf of such person pursuant to section 51-296. The court shall not require a person to perform community service in lieu of payment of such fee, if such fee is waived.\n\n(P.A. 73-641, S. 1, 2; P.A. 74-38; P.A. 76-53; 76-179; P.A. 79-581, S. 11; 79-585, S. 10, 15; P.A. 81-446, S. 4; P.A. 82-9; P.A. 83-534, S. 7; P.A. 85-350, S. 2; 85-374; P.A. 87-343, S. 3, 4; P.A. 87-567, S. 5, 7; P.A. 88-145; P.A. 89-219, S. 7, 10; P.A. 91-24, S. 6; May Sp.

Unless good cause is shown, a person shall be ineligible for participation in such pretrial alcohol education program if such person's alleged violation of section 14-227a, 14-227g or 14-227m, subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of section 14-227n or subsection (d) of section 15-133 caused the serious physical injury, as defined in section 53a-3, of another person.\n\n(3) The application fee imposed under this subsection shall be credited to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund established under section 54-215. The evaluation fee imposed under this subsection shall be credited to the pretrial account established under section 54-56k.\n\n(b) The court, after consideration of the recommendation of the state's attorney, assistant state's attorney or deputy assistant state's attorney in charge of the case, may, in its discretion, grant such application. If the court grants such application, the court shall refer such person to the Court Support Services Division for assessment and confirmation of the eligibility of the applicant and to the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services for evaluation. The Court Support Services Division, in making its assessment and confirmation, may rely on the representations made by the applicant under oath in open court with respect to convictions in other states of offenses specified in subsection (a) of this section. Upon confirmation of eligibility and receipt of the evaluation report, the defendant shall be referred to the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services by the Court Support Services Division for placement in an appropriate alcohol intervention program for one year, or be placed in a state-licensed substance abuse treatment program. The alcohol intervention program shall include a ten-session intervention program and a fifteen-session intervention program. Any person who enters the pretrial alcohol education program shall agree: (1) To the tolling of the statute of limitations with respect to such crime, (2) to a waiver of such person's right to a speedy trial, (3) to complete ten or fifteen counseling sessions in an alcohol intervention program or successfully complete a substance abuse treatment program of not less than twelve sessions pursuant to this section dependent upon the evaluation report and the court order, (4) to commence participation in an alcohol intervention program or substance abuse treatment program not later than ninety days after the date of entry of the court order unless granted a delayed entry into a program by the court, (5) upon completion of participation in the alcohol intervention program, to accept placement in a substance abuse treatment program upon the recommendation of a provider under contract with the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services pursuant to subsection (f) of this section or placement in a state-licensed substance abuse treatment program which meets standards established by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, if the Court Support Services Division deems it appropriate, and (6) if ordered by the court, to participate in at least one victim impact panel. The suspension of the motor vehicle operator's license of any such person pursuant to section 14-227b shall be effective during the period such person is participating in the pretrial alcohol education program, provided such person shall have the option of not commencing the participation in such program until the period of such suspension is completed. If the Court Support Services Division informs the court that the defendant is ineligible for such program and the court makes a determination of ineligibility or if the program provider certifies to the court that the defendant did not successfully complete the assigned program or is no longer amenable to treatment and such person does not request, or the court denies, program reinstatement under subsection (e) of this section, the court shall order the court file to be unsealed, enter a plea of not guilty for such defendant and immediately place the case on the trial list. If such defendant satisfactorily completes the assigned program, such defendant may apply for dismissal of the charges against such defendant and the court, on reviewing the record of the defendant's participation in such program submitted by the Court Support Services Division and on finding such satisfactory completion, shall dismiss the charges. If the defendant does not apply for dismissal of the charges against such defendant after satisfactorily completing the assigned program the court, upon receipt of the record of the defendant's participation in such program submitted by the Court Support Services Division, may on its own motion make a finding of such satisfactory completion and dismiss the charges. Upon motion of the defendant and a showing of good cause, the court may extend the one-year placement period for a reasonable period for the defendant to complete the assigned program. A record of participation in such program shall be retained by the Court Support Services Division for a period of ten years from the date the court grants the application for participation in such program. The Court Support Services Division shall transmit to the Department of Motor Vehicles a record of participation in such program for each person who satisfactorily completes such program. The Department of Motor Vehicles shall maintain for a period of ten years the record of a person's participation in such program as part of such person's driving record. The Court Support Services Division shall transmit to the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection the record of participation of any person who satisfactorily completes such program who has been charged with a violation of the provisions of subsection (d) of section 15-133 or section 15-140n. The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection shall maintain for a period of ten years the record of a person's participation in such program as a part of such person's boater certification record.\n\n(c) (1) At the time the court grants the application for participation in the pretrial alcohol education program, such person shall also pay to the court a nonrefundable program fee of three hundred fifty dollars if such person is ordered to participate in the ten-session intervention program and a nonrefundable program fee of five hundred dollars if such person is ordered to participate in the fifteen-session intervention program. If the court grants the application for participation in the pretrial alcohol education program and such person is ordered to participate in a substance abuse treatment program, such person shall be responsible for the costs associated with participation in such program. No person may be excluded from either program for inability to pay such fee or cost, and the court shall waive any such fee or cost for any intervention program if such person is found eligible to have such fee or cost waived under subsection (i) of this section.\n\n(2) If the court finds that a person is indigent or unable to pay for a treatment program using the method for determining indigency described in subsection (i) of this section, the costs of such program shall be paid from the pretrial account established under section 54-56k.\n\n(3) If the court denies the application, such person shall not be required to pay the program fee. If the court grants the application and such person is later determined to be ineligible for participation in such pretrial alcohol education program or fails to complete the assigned program, the program fee shall not be refunded. All program fees shall be credited to the pretrial account established under section 54-56k.\n\n(d) If a person returns to court with certification from a program provider that such person did not successfully complete the assigned program or is no longer amenable to treatment, the provider, to the extent practicable, shall include a recommendation to the court as to whether a ten-session intervention program, a fifteen-session intervention program or placement in a state-licensed substance abuse treatment program would best serve such person's needs. The provider shall also indicate whether the current program referral was an initial referral or a reinstatement to the program.\n\n(e) When a person subsequently requests reinstatement into an alcohol intervention program or a substance abuse treatment program and the Court Support Services Division verifies that such person is eligible for reinstatement into such program and thereafter the court favorably acts on such request, such person shall pay a nonrefundable program fee of one hundred seventy-five dollars if ordered to complete a ten-session intervention program or two hundred fifty dollars if ordered to complete a fifteen-session intervention program, as the case may be, except as provided in subsection (i) of this section. If the court grants a person's request to be reinstated into a treatment program, such person shall be responsible for the costs, if any, associated with being reinstated into the treatment program. All program fees collected in connection with a reinstatement to an intervention program shall be credited to the pretrial account established under section 54-56k. No person shall be permitted more than two program reinstatements pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(f) The Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services shall contract with service providers, develop standards and oversee appropriate alcohol programs to meet the requirements of this section. Said department shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to establish standards for such alcohol programs. Any person ordered to participate in a treatment program shall do so at a state-licensed treatment program which meets the standards established by said department. Any defendant whose employment or residence makes it unreasonable to attend an alcohol intervention program or a substance abuse treatment program in this state may attend a program in another state which has standards substantially similar to, or higher than, those of this state, subject to the approval of the court and payment of the application, evaluation and program fees and treatment costs, as appropriate, as provided in this section.\n\n(g) The court may, as a condition of granting such application, require that such person participate in a victim impact panel program approved by the Court Support Services Division of the Judicial Department. Such victim impact panel program shall provide a nonconfrontational forum for the victims of alcohol-related or drug-related offenses and offenders to share experiences on the impact of alcohol-related or drug-related incidents in their lives. Such victim impact panel program shall be conducted by a nonprofit organization that advocates on behalf of victims of accidents caused by persons who operated a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, or both. Such organization may assess a participation fee of not more than seventy-five dollars on any person required by the court to participate in such program, provided such organization shall offer a waiver when such person has been determined indigent and eligible for representation by a public defender who has been appointed on behalf of such person pursuant to section 51-296.\n\n(h) The provisions of this section shall not be applicable in the case of any person charged with a violation of section 14-227a or 14-227m or subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of section 14-227n (1) while operating a commercial motor vehicle, as defined in section 14-1, or (2) who holds a commercial driver's license or commercial learner's permit at the time of the violation.\n\n(i) The court shall waive any fee or cost under subsection (a), (c) or (e) of this section for any person who (1) files with the court an affidavit of indigency or inability to pay, has such indigency confirmed by the Court Support Services Division and the court enters a finding thereof, or (2) has been determined indigent and eligible for representation by a public defender who has been appointed on behalf of such person pursuant to section 51-296. The court shall not require a person to perform community service in lieu of payment of such fee or cost, if such fee or cost is waived.\n\n(j) A court may not grant an application to participate in the pretrial alcohol education program under this section on or after April 1, 2022. Anyone participating in the program on April 1, 2022, may continue such participation until successful completion of the program or termination of participation in the program after any possible reinstatements in the program.\n\n(P.A. 81-446, S. 1; P.A. 82-408, S. 1; 82-472, S. 166, 183; P.A. 83-508, S. 1, 5; 83-571, S. 1; P.A. 85-350, S. 3; 85-417; 85-529, S. 1, 4; 85-596, S. 3; P.A. 86-403, S. 91, 132; P.A. 89-110, S. 1–3; 89-219, S. 8, 10; 89-314, S. 4, 5; P.A. 91-24, S. 7; 91-243; May Sp.

The pretrial drug education and community service program shall include a fifteen-session drug education program and a substance abuse treatment program of not less than fifteen sessions, and the performance of community service.\n\n(b) Upon application by any such person for participation in such program, the court shall, but only as to the public, order the court file sealed, and such person shall pay to the court an application fee of one hundred dollars and a nonrefundable evaluation fee of one hundred fifty dollars, except as provided in subsection (l) of this section. A person shall be ineligible for participation in such pretrial drug education and community service program if such person has twice previously participated in (1) the pretrial drug education program established under the provisions of this section in effect prior to October 1, 2013, (2) the community service labor program established under section 53a-39c, (3) the pretrial drug education and community service program established under this section, or (4) any of such programs, except that the court may allow a person who has twice previously participated in such programs to participate in the pretrial drug education and community service program one additional time, for good cause shown. The evaluation and application fee imposed under this subsection shall be credited to the pretrial account established under section 54-56k.\n\n(c) The court, after consideration of the recommendation of the state's attorney, assistant state's attorney or deputy assistant state's attorney in charge of the case, may, in its discretion, grant such application. If the court grants such application, the court shall refer such person (1) to the Court Support Services Division for confirmation of the eligibility of the applicant, (2) to the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services for evaluation and determination of an appropriate drug education or substance abuse treatment program for the first or second time such application is granted, and (3) to a state-licensed substance abuse treatment program for evaluation and determination of an appropriate substance abuse treatment program for the third time such application is granted, except that, if such person is a veteran, the court may refer such person to the Department of Veterans Affairs or the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, as applicable, for any such evaluation and determination. For the purposes of this subsection and subsection (d) of this section, “veteran” has the same meaning as provided in section 27-103.\n\n(d) (1) (A) Upon confirmation of eligibility and receipt of the evaluation and determination required under subsection (c) of this section, such person shall be placed in the pretrial drug education and community service program and referred by the Court Support Services Division for the purpose of receiving appropriate drug education services or substance abuse treatment program services, as recommended by the evaluation conducted pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and ordered by the court, to the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services or to a state-licensed substance abuse treatment program for placement in the appropriate drug education or substance abuse treatment program, except that, if such person is a veteran, the division may refer such person to the Department of Veterans Affairs or the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, subject to the provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n(B) Persons who have been granted entry into the pretrial drug education and community service program for the first time shall participate in either a fifteen-session drug education program or a substance abuse treatment program of not less than fifteen sessions, as ordered by the court on the basis of the evaluation and determination required under subsection (c) of this section. Persons who have been granted entry into the pretrial drug education and community service program for the second time shall participate in either a fifteen-session drug education program or a substance abuse treatment program of not less than fifteen sessions, as ordered by the court based on the evaluation and determination required under subsection (c) of this section. Persons who have been granted entry into the pretrial drug education and community service program for a third time shall be referred to a state-licensed substance abuse program for evaluation and participation in a course of treatment as ordered by the court based on the evaluation and determination required under subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(C) Persons who have been granted entry into the pretrial drug education and community service program shall also participate in a community service program administered by the Court Support Services Division pursuant to section 53a-39c.

If such person does not apply for dismissal of the charges against such person after satisfactorily completing the assigned program, the court, upon receipt of the record of such person's participation in such program submitted by the Court Support Services Division, may on its own motion make a finding of such satisfactory completion and dismiss the charges. Upon motion of such person and a showing of good cause, the court may extend the placement period for a reasonable period of time to allow such person to complete the assigned program. A record of participation in such program shall be retained by the Court Support Services Division for a period of ten years from the date the court grants the application for participation in the program.\n\n(g) At the time the court grants the application for participation in the pretrial drug education and community service program, any person ordered to participate in such drug education program shall pay to the court a nonrefundable program fee of six hundred dollars. If the court orders participation in a substance abuse treatment program, such person shall pay to the court a nonrefundable program fee of one hundred dollars and shall be responsible for the costs associated with such program. No person may be excluded from any such program for inability to pay such fee or cost, and the court shall waive any such fee or cost if such person is found eligible to have such fee or cost waived under subsection (l) of this section. If the court waives the costs for a substance abuse treatment program, the costs of such program shall be paid from the pretrial account established under section 54-56k. If the court denies the application, such person shall not be required to pay the program fee. If the court grants the application, and such person is later determined to be ineligible for participation in such pretrial drug education and community service program or fails to complete the assigned program, the program fee shall not be refunded. All program fees shall be credited to the pretrial account established under section 54-56k.\n\n(h) If a person returns to court with certification from a program provider that such person did not successfully complete the assigned program or is no longer amenable to treatment, the provider, to the extent practicable, shall include a recommendation to the court as to whether placement in a drug education program or placement in a substance abuse treatment program would best serve such person's needs. The provider shall also indicate whether the current program referral was an initial referral or a reinstatement to the program.\n\n(i) When a person subsequently requests reinstatement into a drug education program or a substance abuse treatment program and the Court Support Services Division verifies that such person is eligible for reinstatement into such program and thereafter the court favorably acts on such request, any person reinstated into such drug education program shall pay a nonrefundable program fee of two hundred fifty dollars, and any person reinstated into a substance abuse treatment program shall be responsible for the costs, if any, associated with being reinstated into the treatment program, unless such person is found eligible to have such fee or costs waived under subsection (l) of this section. All program fees collected in connection with a reinstatement to a drug education program shall be credited to the pretrial account established under section 54-56k. No person shall be permitted more than two program reinstatements pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(j) The Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services shall develop standards and oversee appropriate drug education programs that it administers to meet the requirements of this section and may contract with service providers to provide such programs. The department shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to establish standards for such drug education programs.\n\n(k) Any person whose employment or residence or schooling makes it unreasonable to attend a drug education program or substance abuse treatment program in this state may attend a program in another state that has standards similar to, or higher than, those of this state, subject to the approval of the court and payment of the program fee or costs as provided in this section.\n\n(l) The court shall waive any fee or cost under subsection (b), (g) or (i) of this section for any person who (1) files with the court an affidavit of indigency or inability to pay, has such indigency confirmed by the Court Support Services Division and the court enters a finding thereof, or (2) has been determined indigent and eligible for representation by a public defender who has been appointed on behalf of such person pursuant to section 51-296. The court shall not require a person to perform community service in lieu of payment of such fee or cost, if such fee or cost is waived.\n\n(m) A court may not grant an application to participate in the pretrial drug education and community service program under this section on or after April 1, 2022. Anyone participating in the program on April 1, 2022, may continue such participation until successful completion of the program or termination of participation in the program after any possible reinstatements in the program.\n\n(P.A. 97-248, S. 7, 12; June 18 Sp.

Court personnel shall provide notice, on a form prescribed by the Office of the Chief Court Administrator, to any victim of such crime or motor vehicle violation, by registered or certified mail, that such person has applied to participate in the program and that such victim has an opportunity to be heard by the court on the matter.\n\n(d) The court shall refer such person to the Court Support Services Division for confirmation of eligibility and assessment of the person's mental health condition.

Except as provided in subsection (j) of this section, upon dismissal, all records of such charges shall be erased pursuant to section 54-142a. An order of the court denying a motion to dismiss the charges against a person who has completed such person's period of probation or supervision or terminating the participation of a person in such program shall be a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\n\n(j) The Court Support Services Division shall develop and maintain a database of information concerning persons admitted to the supervised diversionary program that shall be available to the state police and organized local police departments for use by sworn police officers when responding to incidents involving such persons. Such information shall include the person's name, date of birth, Social Security number, the violation or violations with which the person was charged, the dates of program participation and whether a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument was involved in the violation or violations for which the program was granted.

and (B) direct such person to attend the recommended drug education or substance use treatment component within ninety days after referral unless the division determines that a later start date is appropriate.\n\n(2) If any person placed in the program is a veteran, the division (A) may refer such person to the Department of Veterans Affairs or the United States Department of Veterans Affairs for the applicable drug education or substance use treatment component recommended by the evaluation conducted pursuant to subparagraph (A) of subdivision (2) of subsection (c) of this section if: (i) the division determines that services for such component will be provided in a timely manner under standards substantially similar to, or higher than, the standards for services provided by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services or a state-licensed substance use treatment provider, and (ii) the applicable department agrees to submit timely component participation and completion reports to the division in the manner required by the division;

All program fees shall be credited to the pretrial account established under section 54-56k.\n\n(2) (A) No person may be excluded from any component of the program because such person is indigent and unable to pay the associated fee or costs, provided (i) such person files with the court an affidavit of indigency and the court enters a finding of such indigency, or (ii) such person has been determined indigent and eligible for representation by a public defender who has been appointed on behalf of such person pursuant to section 51-296. The court shall not require a person to perform community service in lieu of payment of any fee or cost, if such fee or cost is waived.\n\n(B) If the court finds that a person is indigent and unable to pay for the program application or the evaluation fee for the program, the court may waive all or any portion of these fees.\n\n(C) If the court finds that a person is indigent and unable to pay for the drug education component of the program, the court may waive all or any portion of the program fee for that component, provided that such person participates in such drug education services offered by a provider located in this state.\n\n(D) If the court finds that a person is indigent and unable to pay for the substance use treatment component of the program, the court may waive all or any portion of the program fee for that component and the costs of such treatment, provided that such person participates in such treatment at a substance use treatment provider licensed by and located in this state. Any costs waived under this subparagraph shall be paid by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services.\n\n(E) Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the court shall not waive any fee or cost required by any out-of-state program component provider, and the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services shall not pay any costs associated with education or substance use treatment provided outside of this state.\n\n(f) (1) If the Court Support Services Division returns to court the case of any person placed in the program whom the division has determined is not eligible for the program, and the court finds that such person is not eligible to participate in the program, the court shall revoke such person's placement in the program.\n\n(2) If the Court Support Services Division returns to court the case of any person placed in the program whom the division has learned has failed to comply with requirements of any component of the program in which the court has ordered such person to participate, or engaged in any conduct that constitutes a violation of section 21a-257, 21a-267, 21a-279 or 21a-279a, and the court finds that such person is no longer eligible to continue participating in the program, the court shall terminate such person's participation in the program.\n\n(3) If the court revokes any person's placement in the program or terminates any person's participation in the program, the court shall order the court file to be unsealed, enter a plea of not guilty for such person, and immediately place the case on the trial list, unless such person is eligible for, such person requests and the court grants such person reinstatement into the program pursuant to subsection (k) of this section.\n\n(4) (A) If the court revokes any person's placement in the program, such person shall not be required to pay any program fee or participation costs specified in subsection (e) of this section.\n\n(B) If the court terminates any person's participation in the program, no program fees or substance use treatment costs imposed pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be refunded.\n\n(g) The Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services shall administer the drug education component of the program and shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to establish standards for such drug education component. The department may contract with service providers to provide the appropriate drug education component in accordance with the provisions of this section. The department may combine the services for the drug education component of the program under the provisions of this section with the services for the alcohol education component of the impaired driving intervention program under the provisions of section 54-56r, if necessary to ensure the appropriate and timely access to court ordered education components. Participation by a person in any combined drug and alcohol education services provided by the department for the drug education component of the program under the provisions of this section shall not be deemed participation in, nor shall affect such person's eligibility for, the impaired driving intervention program under the provisions of section 54-56r.\n\n(h) (1) All program component providers shall provide the Court Support Services Division with a certification regarding the participation of each person referred to such provider pursuant to this section in the manner required by the division. (A) If such person has successfully completed the applicable program component, the certification shall indicate such successful completion and state whether additional substance use treatment is recommended. (B) If such person has failed to successfully complete the applicable program component, the certification shall indicate the reasons for such failure, whether the person is no longer amenable to education or treatment, and whether the current referral was an initial referral under subsection (d) of this section or a reinstatement under subsection (k) of this section for the program component. The certification of failure shall also, to the extent practicable, include a recommendation as to whether an alternative drug education or substance use treatment component would best serve such person's needs.\n\n(2) Except as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection, upon receipt of a participation certification from any program component provider pursuant to this subsection, the Court Support Services Division shall provide the court with a final progress report indicating whether such person has successfully completed any components of the program ordered by the court, whether the division required such person to participate in any additional substance use treatment in accordance with subdivision (3) of this subsection and whether such person successfully completed any such additional substance use treatment. The final progress report shall also include any other information the division obtained during the supervision of such person relevant to such person's participation in the program, including whether the results of a criminal history record check, which the division shall complete prior to the submission of the final progress report, reveals that such person has engaged in any conduct that constitutes a violation of section 21a-257, 21a-267, 21a-279 or 21a-279a, during such person's period of participation in the program.\n\n(3) If a participation certification indicates that a person who was placed in the program successfully completed the drug education or substance use treatment component ordered by the court, but the program component provider recommends additional substance use treatment for such person, the Court Support Services Division may, if it deems such additional treatment appropriate, require such person to participate in the recommended additional substance use treatment in order to satisfactorily complete the pretrial drug intervention and community service program. If the division requires such additional substance use treatment, the division shall provide the court with a final progress report in accordance with subdivision (2) of this subsection upon receipt of the participation certification from the substance use treatment provider for such additional treatment.\n\n(i) (1) If any person successfully completes all components of the program ordered by the court and any additional substance use treatment required by the Court Support Services Division, such person may apply for dismissal of the charges against such person at the conclusion of such person's period of participation in the program. Upon application, the court shall review the final progress report submitted by the division regarding such person and any other relevant information. If the court finds that such person has satisfactorily completed the pretrial drug intervention and community service program, the court shall dismiss the charges.\n\n(2) If any person who has successfully completed all components of the program ordered by the court and any additional substance use treatment required by the Court Support Services Division does not apply for dismissal of the charges against such person at the conclusion of such person's period of participation in the program, the court may, upon its own motion, review the final progress report regarding such person submitted by the division and any other relevant information. If the court finds that such person has satisfactorily completed the pretrial drug intervention and community service program, the court shall dismiss the charges.\n\n(3) Upon the motion of any person placed in the program and a showing of good cause, the court may extend the program placement period for a reasonable period of time to allow such person to complete the applicable program components.\n\n(j) If, upon review of the final progress report submitted by the Court Support Services Division or any other relevant information, the court finds that any person placed in the program has failed to successfully complete any component of the program ordered by the court, is no longer amenable to treatment or is otherwise ineligible to continue participating in the program, the court shall terminate such person's participation in the program. No program fees or substance use treatment costs imposed pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be refunded to any person whose participation in the program is terminated. Unless such person requests, and the court grants, reinstatement into the program pursuant to subsection (k) of this section, the court shall order the court file of any person whose participation in the program is terminated to be unsealed, enter a plea of not guilty for such person and immediately place the case on the trial list.\n\n(k) (1) Any person whose participation in the program is terminated may ask the court to reinstate such person into the program up to two times. If a person requests reinstatement into the program, the Court Support Services Division shall verify that such person is eligible for such reinstatement. If a person requesting reinstatement into the program is eligible for reinstatement, the court may, in its discretion, grant such person reinstatement into the program. When granting such reinstatement, the court shall order the person to participate in an appropriate drug education, substance use treatment or community service component of the program.\n\n(2) Any person reinstated into the program shall (A) if ordered to participate in the drug education component of the program, pay to the court a nonrefundable program fee of two hundred fifty dollars, which shall be credited to the pretrial account established under section 54-56k, or (B) if ordered to participate in the substance use treatment component of the program, pay the costs of any substance use treatment. The court shall not waive the program fee or the costs of substance use treatment associated with reinstatement into the program unless such person is found eligible to have such fee or costs waived under subdivision (2) of subsection (e) of this section and such person participates in the applicable drug education at a service provider located in this state or substance use treatment at a substance use treatment provider licensed by and located in this state.\n\n(l) (1) If any person applies for both the pretrial drug intervention and community service program under the provisions of this section and the pretrial impaired driving intervention program pursuant to section 54-56r, for charges arising from the same arrest, and the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services has already completed the required evaluation and determination of the appropriate alcohol education or substance use treatment component pursuant to section 54-56r, the court and the Court Support Services Division may rely on such evaluation and determination for the purposes of ordering participation and directing attendance in the drug education or substance use treatment component of the program under the provisions of this section. If the court and the division rely on such evaluation and determination, such person shall not be required to pay the evaluation fee under the provisions of subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of this section, provided that such person has paid, or the court has waived, the evaluation fee pursuant to section 54-56r.\n\n(2) If any person is placed in both the pretrial drug intervention and community service program under the provisions of this section and the pretrial impaired driving intervention program under section 54-56r, for charges arising from the same arrest, the court may find that:\n\n(A) Such person's successful completion of the alcohol education component of the pretrial impaired driving intervention program pursuant to section 54-56r, satisfies such person's required participation in the drug education component of the pretrial drug intervention and community service program under the provisions of this section; or\n\n(B) Such person's successful completion of the substance use treatment component of the pretrial impaired driving intervention program under section 54-56r, satisfies such person's required participation in the substance use treatment component of the pretrial drug intervention and community service program under the provisions of this section.\n\n(3) Nothing in this subsection shall relieve any person placed in both the pretrial drug intervention and community service program pursuant to this section and the pretrial impaired driving intervention program pursuant to section 54-56r, for charges arising from the same arrest, from the requirement to participate in the:\n\n(A) Community service component of the pretrial drug intervention and community service program under the provisions of this section, in order to satisfactorily complete the pretrial drug intervention and community service program, or\n\n(B) Victim impact component of the pretrial impaired driving intervention program, if ordered by the court pursuant to section 54-56r, in order to satisfactorily complete the pretrial impaired driving intervention program.\n\n(m) The Court Support Services Division shall retain a record of participation in the pretrial drug intervention and community service program for a period of ten years from the date the court grants the application for, and places the applicant in, the program pursuant to the provisions of this section.\n\n(n) For purposes of this section, “veteran” has the same meaning as provided in subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 27-103.\n\n(June Sp.

The department may contract with service providers to provide the appropriate alcohol education component in accordance with the provisions of this section. The department may combine the services for the alcohol education component of the program under the provisions of this section with the services for the drug education component of the drug intervention and community service program under section 54-56q, if necessary to ensure the appropriate and timely access to court ordered education components. Participation by a person in any combined alcohol and drug education services provided by the department for the alcohol education component of the program under the provisions of this section shall not be deemed participation in, nor shall affect such person's eligibility for, the drug intervention and community service program under the provisions of section 54-56q.\n\n(j) (1) All program component providers shall provide the Court Support Services Division with a certification regarding the participation of each person referred to such provider pursuant to this section in the manner required by the division. (A) If such person has successfully completed the applicable program component, the certification shall indicate such successful completion and state whether additional substance use treatment is recommended. (B) If such person has failed to successfully complete the applicable program component, the certification shall indicate the reasons for such failure, whether the person is no longer amenable to education or treatment and whether the current referral was an initial referral under subsection (e) of this section or a reinstatement under subsection (m) of this section for the program component. The certification of failure shall also, to the extent practicable, include a recommendation as to whether an alternative alcohol education or substance use treatment component would best serve such person's needs.\n\n(2) Except as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection, upon receipt of a participation certification from any program component provider pursuant to this subsection, the Court Support Services Division shall provide the court with a final progress report indicating whether such person has successfully completed any components of the program ordered by the court, whether the division required such person to participate in any additional substance use treatment in accordance with subdivision (3) of this subsection and whether such person successfully completed any such additional substance use treatment. The final progress report shall also include any other information the division obtained during the supervision of such person relevant to such person's participation in the program, including whether the results of a criminal history record check, which the division shall complete prior to the submission of the final progress report, reveals that such person has engaged in any conduct that constitutes a violation of (A) any statutory provision set forth in subparagraph (B) of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section; or (B) any statutory provision in any other state the essential elements of which are substantially the same as any statutory provision set forth in subparagraph (B) of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section, during such person's period of participation in the program.\n\n(3) If a participation certification indicates that a person who was placed in the program successfully completed the alcohol education or substance use treatment component ordered by the court, but the program component provider recommends additional substance use treatment for such person, the Court Support Services Division may, if it deems such additional treatment appropriate, require such person to participate in the recommended additional substance use treatment in order to satisfactorily complete the pretrial impaired driving intervention program. If the division requires such additional substance use treatment, the division shall provide the court with a final progress report in accordance with subdivision (2) of this subsection upon receipt of the participation certification from the substance use treatment provider for such additional treatment.\n\n(k) (1) If any person successfully completes all components of the program ordered by the court and any additional substance use treatment required by the Court Support Services Division, such person may apply for dismissal of the charges against such person at the conclusion of such person's period of participation in the program. Upon application, the court shall review the final progress report submitted by the division regarding such person and any other relevant information. If the court finds that such person has satisfactorily completed the pretrial impaired driving intervention program, the court shall dismiss the charges.\n\n(2) If any person who has successfully completed all components of the program ordered by the court and any additional substance use treatment required by the Court Support Services Division does not apply for dismissal of the charges against such person at the conclusion of such person's period of participation in the program, the court may, upon its own motion, review the final progress report regarding such person submitted by the division and any other relevant information. If the court finds that such person has satisfactorily completed the pretrial impaired driving intervention program, the court shall dismiss the charges.\n\n(3) Upon the motion of any person placed in the program and a showing of good cause, the court may extend the program placement period for a reasonable period of time to allow such person to complete the applicable program components.\n\n(l) If, upon review of the final progress report submitted by the Court Support Services Division or any other relevant information, the court finds that any person placed in the program has failed to successfully complete any component of the program ordered by the court, is no longer amenable to treatment or is otherwise ineligible to continue participating in the program, the court shall terminate such person's participation in the program. No program fees or substance use treatment costs imposed pursuant to subsection (f) of this section shall be refunded to any person whose participation in the program is terminated. Unless such person requests, and the court grants, reinstatement into the program pursuant to subsection (m) of this section, the court shall order the court file of any person whose participation in the program is terminated to be unsealed, enter a plea of not guilty for such person and immediately place the case on the trial list.\n\n(m) (1) Any person whose participation in the program is terminated may ask the court to reinstate such person into the program up to two times. If a person requests reinstatement into the program, the Court Support Services Division shall verify that such person is eligible for such reinstatement. If a person requesting reinstatement into the program is eligible for reinstatement, the court may grant such person reinstatement into the program. When granting such reinstatement, the court shall order the defendant to participate in an appropriate alcohol education, substance use treatment or victim impact component of the program.\n\n(2) Any person reinstated into the program shall: (A) If ordered to participate in the alcohol education component of the program, pay to the court a nonrefundable program fee of two hundred fifty dollars, which shall be credited to the pretrial account established under section 54-56k, or (B) if ordered to participate in the substance use treatment component of the program, pay the costs of any substance use treatment. The court shall not waive the program fee or the costs of substance use treatment associated with reinstatement into the program unless such person is found eligible to have such fee or cost waived under subdivision (3) of subsection (f) of this section and such person participates in the applicable alcohol education at a service provider located in this state or substance use treatment at a substance use treatment provider licensed by and located in this state.\n\n(n) (1) If any person applies for both the pretrial impaired driving intervention program under the provisions of this section and the pretrial drug intervention and community service program pursuant to section 54-56q, for charges arising from the same arrest, and the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, a licensed substance use treatment provider, the Department of Veterans Affairs or the United States Department of Veterans Affairs has already completed the required evaluation and determination of the appropriate drug education or substance use treatment component pursuant to section 54-56q, the court and the Court Support Services Division may rely on such evaluation and determination for the purposes of ordering participation and directing attendance in the alcohol education or substance use treatment component of the program under the provisions of this section. If the court and the division rely on such evaluation and determination, such person shall not be required to pay the evaluation fee under the provisions of subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of this section, provided that such person has paid, or the court has waived, the evaluation fee pursuant to section 54-56q.\n\n(2) If any person is placed in both the pretrial impaired driving intervention program under the provisions of this section and the pretrial drug intervention and community service program pursuant to section 54-56q, for charges arising from the same arrest, the court may find that (A) such person's successful completion of the drug education component of the pretrial drug intervention and community service program pursuant to section 54-56q, satisfies such person's required participation in the alcohol education component of the pretrial impaired driving intervention program under the provisions of this section; or (B) such person's successful completion of the substance use treatment component of the pretrial drug intervention and community service program pursuant to section 54-56q, satisfies such person's required participation in the substance use treatment component of the pretrial impaired driving intervention program under the provisions of this section.\n\n(3) Nothing in this subsection shall relieve any person placed in both the pretrial impaired driving intervention program pursuant to this section and the pretrial drug intervention and community service program pursuant to section 54-56q, for charges arising from the same arrest, from the requirement to participate in the:\n\n(A) Victim impact component of the pretrial impaired driving intervention program, if ordered by the court under the provisions of this section, in order to satisfactorily complete the pretrial impaired driving intervention program, or\n\n(B) Community service component of the pretrial drug intervention and community service program pursuant to section 54-56q, in order to satisfactorily complete the pretrial drug intervention and community service program.\n\n(o) (1) The Court Support Services Division shall retain a record of participation in the pretrial impaired driving intervention program for a period of ten years from the date the court grants the application for, and places the applicant in, the program pursuant to the provisions of this section.\n\n(2) For any person charged with a violation of section 14-227a, 14-227g, 14-227m or 14-227n whose charges were dismissed pursuant to the provisions of this section, the division shall transmit to the Department of Motor Vehicles the record of such person's participation in the program. The Department of Motor Vehicles shall maintain the record of any person's participation in such program as part of such person's driving record for a period of ten years.\n\n(3) For any person charged with a violation of subsection (d) of section 15-133 or section 15-140n whose charges were dismissed pursuant to the provisions of this section, the division shall transmit to the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection the record of such person's participation in the program. The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection shall maintain the record of any person's participation in such program as a part of such person's boater certification record for a period of ten years.\n\n(June Sp.

The prosecutorial official shall petition for the arrested person to deposit at least thirty per cent of the bond amount directly with the court, and there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the safety of other persons will be endangered without the granting of such petition. Additionally, the court may, when it has reason to believe that the person is drug-dependent and where necessary, reasonable and appropriate, order the person to submit to a urinalysis drug test and to participate in a program of periodic drug testing and treatment. The results of any such drug test shall not be admissible in any criminal proceeding concerning such person.\n\n(2) When any arrested person charged with the commission of a serious firearm offense, as defined in section 53a-3, other than a person described in subdivision (1) of this subsection, is presented before the Superior Court, the court shall, in bailable offenses, promptly order the release of such person upon the first of the following conditions of release found sufficient to reasonably ensure the appearance of the arrested person in court and that the safety of any other person will not be endangered: (A) Upon such person's execution of a written promise to appear without special conditions, (B) upon such person's execution of a written promise to appear with nonfinancial conditions, (C) upon such person's execution of a bond without surety in no greater amount than necessary, or (D) upon such person's execution of a bond with surety in no greater amount than necessary, but in no event shall a judge prohibit a bond from being posted by surety. The prosecutorial official may petition the court to deem such person a serious risk to the safety of another person or persons. The prosecutorial official may present any information developed by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies in the course of a criminal investigation or enforcement action, including, but not limited to, social media posts, pictures or videos threatening violence, claiming responsibility for violence or suggesting possession of a firearm. If the court finds that the arrested person poses a serious risk to the safety of another person or persons, the arrested person may only be released pursuant to subparagraph (C) or (D) of this subdivision and the arrested person shall be required to deposit at least thirty per cent of any bond amount directly with the court. Additionally, the court may, when it has reason to believe that the person is drug-dependent and where necessary, reasonable and appropriate, order the person to submit to a urinalysis drug test and to participate in a program of periodic drug testing and treatment. The results of any such drug test shall not be admissible in any criminal proceeding concerning such person.\n\n(3) The court may, in determining what conditions of release will reasonably ensure the appearance of the arrested person in court and that the safety of any other person will not be endangered, consider the following factors: (A) The nature and circumstances of the offense, (B) such person's record of previous convictions, (C) such person's past record of appearances in court after being admitted to bail, (D) such person's family ties, (E) such person's employment record, (F) such person's financial resources, character and mental condition, (G) such person's community ties, (H) the number and seriousness of charges pending against the arrested person, (I) the weight of the evidence against the arrested person, (J) the arrested person's history of violence, (K) whether the arrested person has previously been convicted of similar offenses while released on bond, and (L) the likelihood based upon the expressed intention of the arrested person that such person will commit another crime while released.\n\n(4) When imposing conditions of release under this subsection, the court shall state for the record any factors under subdivision (3) of this subsection that it considered and the findings that it made as to the danger, if any, that the arrested person might pose to the safety of any other person upon the arrested person's release that caused the court to impose the specific conditions of release that the court imposed.\n\n(d) If the court determines that a nonfinancial condition of release should be imposed pursuant to subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, the court shall order the pretrial release of the person subject to the least restrictive condition or combination of conditions that the court determines will reasonably ensure the appearance of the arrested person in court and, with respect to the release of the person pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section, that the safety of any other person will not be endangered, which conditions may include an order that the arrested person do one or more of the following: (1) Remain under the supervision of a designated person or organization; (2) comply with specified restrictions on such person's travel, association or place of abode; (3) not engage in specified activities, including the use or possession of a dangerous weapon, an intoxicant or a controlled substance; (4) provide sureties of the peace pursuant to section 54-56f under supervision of a designated bail commissioner or intake, assessment and referral specialist employed by the Judicial Branch; (5) avoid all contact with an alleged victim of the crime and with a potential witness who may testify concerning the offense; (6) maintain employment or, if unemployed, actively seek employment; (7) maintain or commence an educational program; (8) be subject to electronic monitoring; or (9) satisfy any other condition that is reasonably necessary to ensure the appearance of the person in court and that the safety of any other person will not be endangered.

If the court finds that the person subject to electronic monitoring is indigent and unable to pay the costs of electronic monitoring services, the court shall waive such costs. Any contract entered into by the Judicial Branch and the electronic monitoring service provider shall include a provision stating that the total cost for electronic monitoring services shall not exceed five dollars per day. Such amount shall be indexed annually to reflect the rate of inflation.\n\n(1961, P.A. 38; 1963, P.A. 11; 1967, P.A. 549, S. 12; P.A. 74-183, S. 146, 291; P.A. 76-436, S. 546, 681; P.A. 77-452, S. 39, 72; P.A. 80-313, S. 16; P.A. 81-437, S. 9, 12; P.A. 89-390, S. 13, 37; P.A. 90-213, S. 51; 90-261, S. 9; P.A. 91-406, S. 13, 29; P.A. 99-186, S. 5; 99-187, S. 2; P.A. 00-141, S. 2, 3; P.A. 01-84, S. 25, 26; P.A. 03-278, S. 107; Jan.
