Such alternate jurors shall have the same qualifications and be selected and subject to examination and challenge in the same manner and to the same extent as the jurors constituting the regular panel, provided, in any case when the court directs the selection of alternate jurors, the number of peremptory challenges allowed shall be as follows: In any criminal prosecution the state and the accused may each peremptorily challenge thirty jurors if the offense for which the accused is arraigned is punishable by death or life imprisonment without the possibility of release, eighteen jurors if the offense is punishable by life imprisonment, eight jurors if the offense is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year and for less than life, and four jurors in any other case.\n\n(b) Alternate jurors shall be sworn separately from those constituting the regular panel, and the oaths to be administered shall be as provided in section 1-25.\n\n(c) Alternate jurors shall attend at all times upon trial of the cause. They shall be seated when the case is on trial with or near the jurors constituting the regular panel, with equal opportunity to see and hear all matters adduced in the trial of the case. If, at any time, any juror shall, for any reason, become unable to further perform the duty of a juror, the court may excuse such juror and, if any juror is so excused or dies, the court may order that an alternate juror who is designated by lot to be drawn by the clerk shall become a part of the regular panel and the trial or deliberation shall then proceed with appropriate instructions from the court as though such juror had been a member of the regular panel from the time when the trial or deliberation began. If the alternate juror becomes a member of the regular panel after deliberations began, the jury shall be instructed by the court that deliberations by the jury shall begin anew. A juror who has been selected to serve as an alternate shall not be segregated from the regular panel except when the case is given to the regular panel for deliberation at which time such alternate juror may be dismissed from further service on said case or may remain in service under the direction of the court.\n\n(P.A. 80-313, S. 41; P.A. 82-307, S. 5, 8; P.A. 00-116, S. 6; P.A. 12-5, S. 28.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 82-307 amended Subsec. (a) by changing the number of alternate jurors from “one or two” to two “or more” and amended Subsec. (c) to reflect this change; P.A. 00-116 amended Subsec. (c) by making technical changes, by permitting alternate juror to become part of the deliberation and proceed with appropriate instructions from the court as though alternate juror was part of the regular panel when the trial or deliberation began, by providing if alternate juror becomes member of panel after deliberations began, the jury shall be instructed by the court that deliberations by the jury shall begin anew, and by adding provision allowing alternate juror to remain in service under the direction of the court during deliberation of regular panel; P.A. 12-5 amended Subsec.

Statute now explicitly permits substitution of a juror after deliberations have begun. 257 C. 192. Process for selecting and dismissing alternate jurors, including under Subsec., does not implicate constitutional rights. 272 C. 432.

Defendant's constitutional right to fair trial before jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community was not violated where trial court excused alternate juror for financial hardship after deliberations had begun. 110 CA 263. Section not violated when court, after learning that an unidentified and unauthorized person permitted sick juror to leave courthouse, excused such juror and replaced her with an alternate juror because, for purposes of section, such juror was not excused from jury service when unidentified person permitted her to leave, but after court heard from counsel and decided to replace her with an alternate juror. 166 CA 304.

      "text": "(a)Definitions.The following words, when used in this section, have the meaning specified, unless the context otherwise indicates: “Witness” means a person whose testimony is desired in any proceeding or investigation by a grand jury or in a criminal action, prosecution or proceeding; “state” includes any territory of the United States and the District of Columbia, and “summons” means a subpoena, order or other notice requiring the appearance of a witness.\n\n(b)Summoning witness in this state to testify in another state.If a judge of a court of record in any state which by its laws has made provision for commanding persons within that state to attend and testify in this state certifies, under the seal of such court, that there is a criminal prosecution pending in such court, or that a grand jury investigation has commenced or is about to commence, that a person being within this state is a material witness in such prosecution or grand jury investigation and that the presence of such witness will be required for a specified number of days, upon presentation of such certificate to any judge of a court of record in the judicial district in which such person is, such judge shall fix a time and place for a hearing and shall make an order directing the witness to appear at such time and place for such hearing. If, at such hearing, the judge determines that the witness is material and necessary, that it will not cause undue hardship to the witness to be compelled to attend and testify in the prosecution or a grand jury investigation in the other state and that the laws of such other state and the laws of any other state through which the witness may be required to pass by ordinary course of travel will give to such witness protection from arrest and from the service of civil or criminal process, the judge shall issue a summons, with a copy of the certificate attached, directing the witness to attend and testify in the court where the prosecution is pending, or where a grand jury investigation has commenced or is about to commence at a time and place specified in the summons, except that no judge shall issue a summons in a case where prosecution is pending, or where a grand jury investigation has commenced or is about to commence for a criminal violation of a law of such other state involving the provision or receipt of or assistance with reproductive health care services or gender-affirming health care services, as defined in section 52-571n, that are legal in this state, unless the acts forming the basis of the prosecution or investigation would also constitute an offense in this state. At any such hearing, the certificate shall be prima facie evidence of all the facts stated therein. If such certificate recommends that the witness be taken into immediate custody and delivered to an officer of the requesting state to assure the attendance of the witness in such state, such judge may, in lieu of notification of the hearing, direct that such witness be forthwith brought before such judge for such hearing, and, being satisfied, at such hearing, of the desirability of such custody and delivery, of which desirability such certificate shall be prima facie proof, may, in lieu of issuing a subpoena or summons, order that such witness be forthwith taken into custody and delivered to an officer of the requesting state. If such witness, after being paid or tendered by an authorized person the same amount per mile as provided for state employees pursuant to section 5-141c for each mile by the ordinary traveled route to and from the court where the prosecution is pending and five dollars each day that such witness is required to travel and attend as a witness, fails, without good cause, to attend and testify as directed in the summons, the witness shall be punished in the manner provided for the punishment of any witness who disobeys a summons issued from a court of record in this state.\n\n(c)Witness from another state summoned to testify in this state.If a person in any state, which by its laws has made provision for commanding persons within its borders to attend and testify in criminal prosecutions or in grand jury investigations commenced or about to commence in this state, is a material witness in a prosecution pending in a court of record in this state, or in a grand jury investigation which has commenced or is about to commence, a judge of such court may issue a certificate under the seal of the court, stating such facts and specifying the number of days the witness will be required. Such certificate may include a recommendation that the witness be taken into immediate custody and delivered to an officer of this state to assure the attendance of the witness in this state. Such certificate shall be presented to a judge of a court of record in the judicial district in which the witness is found. If the witness is summoned to attend and testify in this state, the witness shall be tendered the same amount per mile as provided for state employees pursuant to section 5-141c for each mile by the ordinary traveled route to and from the court where the prosecution is pending, and five dollars for each day that such witness is required to travel and attend as a witness. A witness who has appeared in accordance with the provisions of the summons shall not be required to remain within this state a longer period of time than the period mentioned in the certificate, unless otherwise ordered by the court. If such witness, after coming into this state, fails, without good cause, to attend and testify as directed in the summons, the witness shall be punished in the manner provided for the punishment of any witness who disobeys a summons issued from a court of record in this state.\n\n(d)Exemption from arrest and service of process.If a person comes into this state in obedience to a summons directing him to attend and testify in this state, he shall not, while in this state pursuant to such summons, be subject to arrest or the service of process, civil or criminal, in connection with matters which arose before his entrance into this state under such summons. If a person passes through this state while going to another state in obedience to a summons to attend and testify in that state or while returning therefrom, he shall not, while so passing through this state, be subject to arrest or the service of process, civil or criminal, in connection with matters which arose before his entrance into this state under such summons.\n\n(e)Interpretation.This section shall be so interpreted and construed as to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the laws of the states which enact it.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 8732; P.A. 78-280, S. 2, 127; P.A. 01-186, S. 10, 11; P.A. 22-19, S. 4; 22-118, S. 487.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 78-280 substituted “judicial district” for “county”; Sec. 54-22 transferred to Sec. 54-82i in 1981; P.A. 01-186 amended Subsec.

(c) by replacing “sum of ten cents for each mile” with provision allowing witness the same amount per mile as provided for state employees pursuant to Sec. 5-141c and making technical changes for purposes of gender neutrality; P.A. 22-19 amended Subsec. (b) to add exception re potential violation of a law involving the provision or receipt of or assistance with reproductive health care services, effective July 1, 2022; P.A. 22-118 amended Subsec.

Such declination shall set forth (1) the type of protective services offered, (2) that the offer of protective services has been explained in detail to the witness, and (3) a telephone number that the witness may call twenty-four hours a day if the witness has concerns for the witness's safety or reconsiders the witness's decision to decline protective services.\n\n(h) If the parent or parents or guardian of a child who is certified as a witness at risk of harm critical to a criminal investigation or prosecution as provided in subsection (b) of this section, declines the provision of protective services under this section, the Office of the Chief State's Attorney shall be notified within twenty-four hours after such declination. Upon receipt of such notice, the Chief State's Attorney shall make reasonable efforts to confer with a victim advocate providing services for the Office of Victim Services and shall, not later than three days after such declination, determine if the matter should be referred to the Department of Children and Families for investigation as to whether such child is neglected, as defined in section 46b-120, and whether the department should provide protective services or take other action pursuant to chapter 319a or 815t with respect to such child.\n\n(i) The costs of providing protective services to witnesses under this section shall be shared by the state and local agencies providing such services pursuant to the witness protection policy established by the Office of the Chief State's Attorney.\n\n(j) Any record of the Division of Criminal Justice or other governmental agency that, in the reasonable judgment of the Chief State's Attorney or a state's attorney, would disclose or would reasonably result in the disclosure of the identity or location of any person receiving or considered for the receipt of protective services under this section or of law enforcement techniques not otherwise known to the general public that are used in protecting witnesses, shall be confidential and not subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, as defined in section 1-200.\n\n(k) The Division of Criminal Justice may utilize the resources of other state agencies in order to provide protective services to witnesses under this section.

In context of entire jury charge re defendant's decision not to testify, reference to defendant's “failure to testify” was neither negative in substance nor improper; phrase “unless the defendant requests otherwise” does not obligate court to use defendant's requested language. 255 C. 581. When the jury charge contains no language that resembles the mandated instruction, it cannot be assumed that the jurors had sufficient knowledge of the law to be able to glean from the balance of instructions that they should draw no adverse inference from defendant's failure to testify. 322 C. 796. Although phrase “failure to testify” has slightly more negative connotation than the phrase “choice not to testify”, that slight difference does not have a material impact on a defendant's constitutional right to remain silent and Subsec. is not unconstitutional. 338 C. 705\n\nCited. 5 CA 79; 6 CA 124; 7 CA 477; 10 CA 302; 11 CA 425; 15 CA 342; Id., 749; 17 CA 490; 19 CA 48; Id., 618; 20 CA 721; 21 CA 162; 23 CA 28; Id., 151; 28 CA 290; 31 CA 688; judgment reversed, see 229 C. 516.

Where counsel had requested omission of instruction under section in the jury charge, it was not error for court to fail to inquire expressly of defendant if he also wanted the court to omit the instruction. 64 CA 340. Since trial court's instruction to jury not to draw any unfavorable inference from the fact that defendant did not testify given in the context of instructions concerning how jury was to find facts in general did not clearly inform jury that it could not use defendant's silence as a factor in its verdict and did not satisfy the statutory requirement that court convey a specific instruction to jury that no unfavorable inference could be drawn from the fact that defendant did not testify, and state failed to establish that the deficient instruction was clarified or remedied by the court and failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt, judgment was reversed and the case remanded for new trial. 97 CA 266. Where lower court had inquired about specific instruction re failure to testify and court and defense counsel discussed instruction, such discussion constituted a request for a no unfavorable inference instruction; reiterated previous holding that provisions are not required to be waived personally by defendant but can be waived by defense counsel. 109 CA 679.\n\nCited. 36 CS 583.",

Such evidence shall be admissible only after an in camera hearing on a motion to offer such evidence containing an offer of proof. If the proceeding is a trial with a jury, such hearing shall be held in the absence of the jury. If, after a hearing, the court finds that the evidence meets the requirements of this section and that the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect on the victim, the court may grant the motion. The testimony of the defendant during a hearing on a motion to offer evidence under this section may not be used against the defendant during the trial if such motion is denied, except that such testimony may be admissible to impeach the credibility of the defendant if the defendant elects to testify as part of the defense.\n\n(b) Any motion and supporting document filed pursuant to this section shall be filed under seal and may be unsealed only if the court rules the evidence is admissible and the case proceeds to trial. If the court determines that only part of the evidence contained in the motion is admissible, only that portion of the motion and any supporting document pertaining to the admissible portion may be unsealed. The court shall maintain any document remaining under seal for delivery to the Appellate Court in the event of an appeal.\n\n(c) The court shall seal each court transcript, recording and record of a proceeding of a hearing held pursuant to this section. The court may unseal a transcript, recording or record only if the court rules the evidence in such transcript, recording or record is admissible and the case proceeds to trial. If the court determines that only part of such evidence is admissible, only the portion of such transcript, record or recording pertaining to the admissible evidence may be unsealed.\n\n(d) Evidence described in subsection (a) of this section shall be subject to such other terms and conditions as the court may provide. No defendant, defense counsel or agent of the defendant or defense counsel shall further disclose such evidence disclosed by the state, except to persons employed by defense counsel in connection with the investigation or defense of the case or any successor counsel, without the prior approval of the prosecuting authority or the court.\n\n(P.A. 82-230; P.A. 83-113; P.A. 85-347; P.A. 15-207, S. 2.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 83-113 added requirement that motion to offer evidence of prior sexual conduct contain an offer of proof and provision re admissibility of testimony of defendant to impeach credibility if defendant elects to testify; P.A. 85-347 deleted “prior” before “sexual conduct” and added “any” before “evidence”; P.A. 15-207 designated existing provisions as Subsec.

Defendant failed to make an adequate preliminary showing of relevancy in order to justify cross examination of plaintiff's father about plaintiff's statement concerning a prior sexual assault investigation. 244 C. 640. Court sets forth standard applicable to child sexual abuse cases re determining whether prior sexual conduct should be admissible at trial for purposes of showing an alternative source for victim's sexual knowledge; standard also applicable for determining admissibility of evidence of prior sexual conduct for purposes of rebutting evidence offered by expert witness to show that a child exhibits behavior indicative of sexual abuse, by showing an alternative explanation for that behavior. 257 C. 156. Evidence of victim's prior history of prostitution admissible to establish consent to sexual relations or motive to provide false testimony but not to establish general unchaste character. 270 C. 826; overruled with respect to conclusion that “material” refers to the constitutional standard for materiality, see 320 C. 781. Court improperly excluded testimony proffered by defendant re victim's prior statements about past sexual conduct after victim testified to having no prior sexual experience at time of assault. 280 C. 36. Trial court properly exercised discretion by precluding inquiry into victim's prior sexual assaults, as they were not relevant to any critical issue in present case, and defendant never offered any specific evidence of falsity. 295 C. 758. Evidence of victim's prior sexual acts with a person other than defendant was not relevant to demonstrate alleged bias, motive or interest of victim and was properly excluded. 303 C. 589.\n\nCited. 3 CA 374; 8 CA 44; Id., 190; 11 CA 673; 14 CA 451; Id., 688; 20 CA 263; 21 CA 411; 23 CA 221; Id., 225; 29 CA 409; Id., 642; 30 CA 56; 34 CA 473; 35 CA 173; 38 CA 100; 42 CA 445; 43 CA 667; Id., 680; Id., 715; 45 CA 116. Defendant's rights under statute were impermissibly impaired when trial court excluded evidence of victim's consensual sexual relations with the lead detective investigating her claim of sexual assault; such evidence was relevant to the substantive issue of consent raised by defendant and was offered for sole purpose of determining victim's credibility and the inconsistency of her behavior following an alleged traumatic sexual assault. 57 CA 32. Court did not improperly exclude evidence of semen from third party on victim's clothing. 68 CA 470. Legislative intent of rape shield statute discussed; legislature also provided for exceptions in rare instances; defendant entitled to proffer direct testimony re physical evidence tending to show misidentification; Subdiv. (1) does not specify that such evidence offered by defendant may be rebuttal evidence only. 85 CA 96. Court did not improperly exclude evidence concerning victim's prior sexual conduct because court found that such evidence was not credible and therefore not relevant. 85 CA 575. Exclusion of evidence relating to victim's alleged sexual interactions with his brothers did not violate defendant's sixth amendment rights because such evidence was properly excluded as irrelevant. 99 CA 274. Trial court abused its discretion in refusing to grant evidentiary hearing to determine admissibility of evidence of plaintiff's prior sexual conduct; evidence from police reports of two prior allegations, which presented facts that tended to demonstrate the falsity of plaintiff's prior allegations, sufficient as offers of proof and relevant to the issue of whether defendant used force in committing the sexual assault. 106 CA 517; judgment reversed, see 295 C. 758. Defendant was properly prohibited from questioning victims about their sexual histories. 126 CA 437. Section abrogates common law rule that character of woman as to chastity is of considerable probative value in judging likelihood of consent. 177 CA 369.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nCourt improperly excluded DNA evidence re semen from individual other than defendant under Subdiv. (1) because evidence was offered by defendant to prove misidentification by victim, not to expose victim's past sexual conduct. 280 C. 285. Subdiv. (4): “Material” as used in section does not refer to the constitutional standard, but rather the evidentiary standard, that is, evidence is material when it has an influence, effect, or bearing on a fact in dispute at trial. 320 C. 781.\n\nPsychological injury is not recognized as an injury for purposes of Subdiv. (1); Subdiv. (2) does not apply where the only sexual conduct to which victim testifies is alleged sexual conduct by defendant; evidence admitted under Subdiv. (4) must be both material and relevant in order to be so critical that its exclusion could lead to a violation of defendant's constitutional rights. 99 CA 274. Subdiv. (4): Trial court improperly precluded evidence of minor victim's sexual relationship with boyfriend because state conceded that defendant showed that victim may have had a motive to lie about defendant's sexual assault. 121 CA 534.",

Only the judge, the defendant, the attorneys for the defendant and for the state, persons necessary to operate the equipment and any person who would contribute to the welfare and well-being of the child may be present in the room with the child during his testimony, except that the court may order the defendant excluded from the room or screened from the sight and hearing of the child only if the state proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that the child would be so intimidated, or otherwise inhibited, by the physical presence of the defendant that a compelling need exists to take the testimony of the child outside the physical presence of the defendant in order to insure the reliability of such testimony. If the defendant is excluded from the room or screened from the sight and hearing of the child, the court shall ensure that the defendant is able to observe and hear the testimony of the child, but that the child cannot see or hear the defendant. The defendant shall be able to consult privately with his attorney at all times during the taking of the testimony. The attorneys and the judge may question the child.

If any defendant is imprisoned after sentencing and before he is admitted to bail, such period of imprisonment shall be counted toward satisfaction of his sentence. If any defendant is admitted to bail and subsequently surrendered and remitted to custody while his appeal is pending, the period of imprisonment following thereafter shall be counted toward satisfaction of his sentence.\n\n(c) In any criminal prosecution in which the defendant has been sentenced to death and has taken an appeal to the Supreme Court of this state or the Supreme Court of the United States or brought a writ of error, writ of certiorari or petition for a new trial, the taking of the appeal, the making of the application for a writ of certiorari or the return into court of the writ of error or petition for a new trial shall, unless, upon application by the state's attorney and after hearing, the Supreme Court otherwise orders, stay the execution of the death penalty until the clerk of the court where the trial was had has received notification of the termination of any such proceeding by decision or otherwise, and for thirty days thereafter.

(e) by replacing “custody” of Court Support Services Division to “supervision” of said division and by making a technical change, effective May 10, 2022.\n\nPurpose of section is to further the regulatory, nonpunitive goal of maintaining a DNA data bank to assist in criminal investigations, not to punish those convicted of crimes by requiring them to submit a DNA sample; penalty provision of section does not render the entire statutory scheme punitive in fact; prior to the legislature's amendment of the section in 2011, section was ambiguous as to whether it was permissible for the trial court to authorize the state to use reasonable physical force to obtain a sample of a defendant's DNA, but the use of reasonable force to obtain a DNA sample from an unwilling individual was inherent in section; section is regulatory in nature, rather than punitive, and does not violate the federal constitution's bar on ex post facto laws under article one, section 10. 321 C. 821.\n\nSection is regulatory in nature and does not violate the ex post facto clause, and the state may use reasonable force to obtain a DNA sample. 143 CA 485; judgment affirmed, see 321 C. 821. Defendant's double jeopardy claim fails because refusal to provide DNA sample is new, postconviction conduct and constitutes a separate crime. Id., 510.",

In light of determination that defendant did not establish “reasonable probability” under Subsec. (b), trial court properly denied petition under Subsec. (c). Id., 74. Under Subsec. (b)(1), petitioner was not entitled to DNA testing as there was no reasonable probability that petitioner would not have been prosecuted or convicted if exculpatory DNA test results had been obtained prior to trial because even if the court assumed the most favorable result from DNA testing, it would not have undermined the confidence in the verdict given the strength of the state's case against petitioner. 309 C. 567.\n\nSubsec. (b)(1) requires court to consider the effect of the most favorable result possible from DNA testing of evidence, and in this case, petitioner did not establish a reasonable probability under Subsec. (b)(1) because evidence amply supported conclusion that petitioner, in fact, committed the crimes. 129 CA 833, see also Id., 842. Subsec. (a) requires petitioner to make a preliminary showing supported by a reasonable basis in fact that the evidence sought to be tested likely contains biological material. 131 CA 846.",

The provisions of said chapter shall be applicable to the presentment, hearing and determination of such claim except as otherwise provided in this section.\n\n(c) At the hearing on such claim, the claimant shall have the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that such claimant meets the eligibility requirements of subsection (a) of this section. In addition, such claimant shall present evidence as to (1) the claimant's age, income, vocational training and level of education at the time of conviction, (2) loss of familial relationships, (3) damage to reputation, (4) the severity of the crime for which such claimant was convicted and whether such claimant was under a sentence of death pursuant to section 53a-46a for any period of time, (5) whether such claimant was required to register pursuant to section 54-251 or 54-252, and for what length of time such claimant complied with the registration requirements of chapter 969, and (6) any other damages such claimant may have suffered arising from or related to such claimant's arrest, prosecution, conviction and incarceration. The Claims Commissioner shall determine whether a claimant meets such eligibility requirements not later than ninety days after such hearing.\n\n(d) (1) If the Claims Commissioner determines that such claimant has established such claimant's eligibility under subsection (a) of this section by a preponderance of the evidence, the Claims Commissioner shall order the immediate payment to such claimant of compensation for such wrongful incarceration in an amount determined pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection, unless (A) such compensation award is in an amount exceeding thirty-five thousand dollars, or (B) such claimant requests, in accordance with section 4-158, that the General Assembly review such compensation award. The Claims Commissioner shall submit any such compensation award described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of this subdivision and the claim from which such award arose to the General Assembly in the same manner as provided under section 4-159, not later than five business days after the commissioner issues such award determination or receives such request for review, whichever is sooner. The General Assembly shall review any such compensation award and the claim from which such award arose not later than forty-five days after such award and claim is submitted to the General Assembly and may deny or confirm such compensation award, or remand the claim to the Office of the Claims Commissioner for such further proceedings as the General Assembly may direct. If the General Assembly takes no action on such compensation award, the determination made by the Claims Commissioner shall be deemed confirmed.\n\n(2) (A) In determining the amount of such compensation, the Claims Commissioner shall award an amount that is two hundred per cent of the median family income for the state for each year the claimant was incarcerated, as determined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index for urban consumers, provided the amount for any partial year shall be prorated in order to compensate only for the portion of such year in which such claimant was incarcerated.

(b) in public act 18-63 were not intended to apply retroactively. 214 CA 511.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nRegardless of whether a person has been convicted of one offense or multiple offenses, legislature has used the phrase “period of special parole” to refer to that duration of time in which a person is transferred to the jurisdiction of the chairperson of the Board of Pardons and Paroles for supervision. 133 CA 140.\n\nSubsec. (c):\n\nWith respect to 1999 revision, when sentencing provisions of Sec. 54-128(c) and Subsec. conflict, legislature intended the maximum statutory limit in Sec. 54-128(c) to control; defendant's sentence of 10 years of imprisonment followed by 10 years of special parole violated Sec. 54-128(c) and was an illegal sentence because total length of terms of imprisonment and special parole combined exceeded maximum term of imprisonment authorized for sexual assault in the second degree by Sec. 53a-35a(6) and Sec. 53a-71(b). 279 C. 527. Subsec. can be given effect only to the extent that it does not conflict with Sec. 54-128(c). 292 C. 417. Legislature intended to provide trial court with authority to impose a sentence of up to 10 years of special parole for each offense for which defendant is convicted and has not expressed intention to prevent a trial court from imposing such sentences of special parole consecutively if it deems appropriate, regardless of whether such consecutive sentences impose a total effective sentence of more than 10 years of special parole. 310 C. 693.\n\nCourt exceeded its authority by sentencing defendant to 16 years of special parole, beyond the 10-year maximum, where defendant had not been convicted of one of the enumerated exceptions for which a longer period of special parole may be imposed. 133 CA 140; judgment reversed, see 310 C. 693.",

The members, officers, executive director and employees of the Interstate Commission shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for any claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties or responsibilities; provided, that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to protect any such person from suit and/or liability for any damage, loss, injury or liability caused by the intentional or wilful and wanton misconduct of any such person.\n\n2. The Interstate Commission shall defend the commissioner of a compacting state, or his or her representatives or employees, or the Interstate Commission's representatives or employees, in any civil action seeking to impose liability, arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that the defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties or responsibilities; provided, that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from intentional wrongdoing on the part of such person.\n\n3. The Interstate Commission shall indemnify and hold the commissioner of a compacting state, the appointed designee or employees, or the Interstate Commission's representatives or employees, harmless in the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against such persons arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that such persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties or responsibilities, provided, that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from gross negligence or intentional wrongdoing on the part of such person.\n\nACTIVITIES OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION\n\n1. The Interstate Commission shall meet and take such actions as are consistent with the provisions of this compact.\n\n2. Except as otherwise provided in this compact and unless a greater percentage is required by the bylaws, in order to constitute an act of the Interstate Commission, such act shall have been taken at a meeting of the Interstate Commission and shall have received an affirmative vote of a majority of the members present.\n\n3. Each member of the Interstate Commission shall have the right and power to cast a vote to which that compacting state is entitled and to participate in the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission. A member shall vote in person on behalf of the state and shall not delegate a vote to another member state. However, a State Council shall appoint another authorized representative, in the absence of the commissioner from that state, to cast a vote on behalf of the member state at a specified meeting. The bylaws may provide for members' participation in meetings by telephone or other means of telecommunication or electronic communication. Any voting conducted by telephone or other means of telecommunication or electronic communication shall be subject to the same quorum requirements of meetings where members are present in person.\n\n4. The Interstate Commission shall meet at least once during each calendar year. The chairperson of the Interstate Commission may call additional meetings at any time and, upon the request of a majority of the members, shall call additional meetings.\n\n5. The Interstate Commission's bylaws shall establish conditions and procedures under which the Interstate Commission shall make its information and official records available to the public for inspection or copying. The Interstate Commission may exempt from disclosure any information or official records to the extent they would adversely affect personal privacy rights or proprietary interests. In promulgating such rules, the Interstate Commission may make available to law enforcement agencies records and information otherwise exempt from disclosure, and may enter into agreements with law enforcement agencies to receive or exchange information or records subject to nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions.\n\n6. Public notice shall be given of all meetings and all meetings shall be open to the public, except as set forth in the rules or as otherwise provided in the compact. The Interstate Commission shall promulgate rules consistent with the principles contained in the “Government in Sunshine Act”, 5 USC Section 552(b), as may be amended. The Interstate Commission and any of its committees may close a meeting to the public where it determines by two-thirds vote that an open meeting would be likely to: a. Relate solely to the Interstate Commission's internal personnel practices and procedures; b. disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute; c. disclose trade secrets or commercial or financial information which is privileged or confidential; d. involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring any person; e. disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; f. disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes; g. disclose information contained in or related to examination, operating or condition reports prepared by, or on behalf of or for the use of, the Interstate Commission with respect to a regulated entity for the purpose of regulation or supervision of such entity; h. disclose information, the premature disclosure of which would significantly endanger the life of a person or the stability of a regulated entity; i. specifically relate to the Interstate Commission's issuance of a subpoena, or its participation in a civil action or proceeding.\n\n7. For every meeting closed pursuant to this provision, the Interstate Commission's chief legal officer shall publicly certify that, in his or her opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public, and shall reference each relevant exemptive provision. The Interstate Commission shall keep minutes which shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in any meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons therefor, including a description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of any roll call vote (reflected in the vote of each member on the question). All documents considered in connection with any action shall be identified in such minutes.\n\n8. The Interstate Commission shall collect standardized data concerning the interstate movement of offenders as directed through its bylaws and rules which shall specify the data to be collected, the means of collection and data exchange and reporting requirements.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nRULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION\n\n1. The Interstate Commission shall promulgate rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the compact including transition rules governing administration of the compact during the period in which it is being considered and enacted by the states.\n\n2. Rulemaking shall occur pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article and the bylaws and rules adopted pursuant thereto. Such rulemaking shall substantially conform to the principles of the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 USC Section 551 et seq., and the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 USC App. 2, Section 1 et seq., as may be amended (hereinafter “APA”).\n\n3. All rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified in each rule or amendment.\n\n4. If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.\n\n5. When promulgating a rule, the Interstate Commission shall: a. Publish the proposed rule stating with particularity the text of the rule which is proposed and the reason for the proposed rule; b. allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which information shall be publicly available; c. provide an opportunity for an informal hearing; and d. promulgate a final rule and its effective date, if appropriate, based on the rulemaking record.\n\n6. Not later than sixty days after a rule is promulgated, any interested person may file a petition in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the federal district court where the Interstate Commission's principal office is located for judicial review of such rule. If the court finds that the Interstate Commission's action is not supported by substantial evidence, as defined in the APA, in the rulemaking record, the court shall hold the rule unlawful and set it aside.\n\n7. Subjects to be addressed within twelve months after the first meeting must at a minimum include: a. Notice to victims and opportunity to be heard; b. offender registration and compliance; c. violations/returns; d. transfer procedures and forms; e. eligibility for transfer; f. collection of restitution and fees from offenders; g. data collection and reporting; h. the level of supervision to be provided by the receiving state; i. transition rules governing the operation of the compact and the Interstate Commission during all or part of the period between the effective date of the compact and the date on which the last eligible state adopts the compact; j. mediation, arbitration and dispute resolution.\n\nThe existing rules governing the operation of the previous compact superseded by this compact shall be null and void twelve months after the first meeting of the Interstate Commission created hereunder.\n\n8. Upon determination by the Interstate Commission that an emergency exists, it may promulgate an emergency rule which shall become effective immediately upon adoption, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided hereunder shall be retroactively applied to said rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety days after the effective date of the rule.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\nOVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT AND DISPUTE RESOLUTIONBY THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION\n\nSection A. Oversight\n\n1. The Interstate Commission shall oversee the interstate movement of adult offenders in the compacting states and shall monitor such activities being administered in noncompacting states which may significantly affect compacting states.\n\n2. The courts and executive agencies in each compacting state shall enforce this compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent. In any judicial or administrative proceeding in a compacting state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Interstate Commission, the Interstate Commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes.\n\nSection B. Dispute resolution\n\n1. The compacting states shall report to the Interstate Commission on issues or activities of concern to them, and cooperate with and support the Interstate Commission in the discharge of its duties and responsibilities.\n\n2. The Interstate Commission shall attempt to resolve any disputes or other issues which are subject to the compact and which may arise among compacting states and noncompacting states.\n\n3. The Interstate Commission shall enact a bylaw or promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes among the compacting states.\n\nSection C. Enforcement\n\nThe Interstate Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this compact using any or all means set forth in Article XI, Section B, of this compact.\n\n1. The Interstate Commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization and ongoing activities.\n\n2. The Interstate Commission shall levy on and collect an annual assessment from each compacting state to cover the cost of the internal operations and activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission's annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, taking into consideration the population of the state and the volume of interstate movement of offenders in each compacting state and shall promulgate a rule binding upon all compacting states which governs said assessment.\n\n3. The Interstate Commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the Interstate Commission pledge the credit of any of the compacting states, except by and with the authority of the compacting state.\n\n4. The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Interstate Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.\n\nCOMPACTING STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND AMENDMENT\n\n1. Any state, as defined in Article II of this compact, is eligible to become a compacting state.\n\n2. The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less than thirty-five of the states. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2001, or upon enactment into law by the thirty-fifth jurisdiction. Thereafter it shall become effective and binding, as to any other compacting state, upon enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of nonmember states or their designees will be invited to participate in Interstate Commission activities on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states and territories of the United States.\n\n3. Amendments to the compact may be proposed by the Interstate Commission for enactment by the compacting states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the compacting states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the compacting states.\n\nWITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT, TERMINATION AND JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT\n\nSection A. Withdrawal\n\n1. Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state; provided, that a compacting state may withdraw from the compact (“withdrawing state”) by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law.\n\n2. The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.\n\n3. The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state.\n\n4. The Interstate Commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within sixty days of its receipt thereof.\n\n5. The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.\n\n6. Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.\n\nSection B. Default\n\n1. If the Interstate Commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted (“defaulting state”) in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, the bylaws or any duly promulgated rules, the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:\n\na. Fines, fees and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the Interstate Commission;\n\nb. Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the Interstate Commission;\n\nc. Suspension and termination of membership in the compact. Suspension shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the Chief Justice or chief judicial officer of the state; the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the State Council. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, Interstate Commission bylaws, or duly promulgated rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission on the defaulting state pending a cure of the default. The Interstate Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Interstate Commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension.\n\n2. Within sixty days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the Interstate Commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice or chief judicial officer and the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature and the State Council of such termination.\n\n3. The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n4. The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.\n\n5. Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the rules.\n\nSection C. Judicial enforcement\n\nThe Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its duly promulgated rules and bylaws, against any compacting state in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys' fees.\n\nSection D. Dissolution of compact\n\n1. The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state which reduces membership in the compact to one compacting state.\n\n2. Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.\n\nARTICLE XII\n\nSEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION\n\n1. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.\n\n2. The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.\n\nARTICLE XIII\n\nBINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS\n\nSection A. Other laws\n\n1. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is not inconsistent with this compact.\n\n2. All compacting states' laws conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.\n\nSection B. Binding effect of the compact\n\n1. All lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the Interstate Commission, are binding upon the compacting states.\n\n2. All agreements between the Interstate Commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.\n\n3. Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of Interstate Commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the Interstate Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation.\n\n4. In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 8841; 1951, S. 3345d; P.A. 00-185, S. 3, 5.)\n\nHistory: (Revisor's note: In 1995 the indicators (a) and (b) in Subsec. (a)(1) were changed editorially by the Revisors to (A) and (B) respectively for consistency with statutory usage); P.A. 00-185 replaced former provisions re the “Uniform Act for Out-of-State Parolee Supervision” with the “Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision”, effective July 1, 2001, or upon enactment of the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision by thirty-five jurisdictions, whichever is later; Pennsylvania became the thirty-fifth enacting jurisdiction on June 19, 2002.\n\nSee Sec. 54-76b re youthful offenders.\n\nReceiving state terminates its supervision when parolee moves to another state after notice given to pending state of request of parolee to transfer; Connecticut could retake parolee who had moved from the receiving state of Maine to Massachusetts without reporting to Connecticut authorities and was convicted of drug possession in Massachusetts. 167 C. 639.
