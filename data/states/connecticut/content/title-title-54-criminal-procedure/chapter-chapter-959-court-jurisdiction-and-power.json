Trial court erred in finding that canvas of defendant substantially complied with Subsec. because trial court simply advised defendant that his conviction could result in his removal or deportation from United States, it did not ask defendant nor did it make a determination that defendant understood potential immigration consequences of his guilty plea before he entered it. 180 CA 48.\n\nSubsec.

The complaint shall identify the person on which or the property to, in or on which the tracking device is to be installed, and, if known, the owner of such property.\n\n(d) A warrant may issue only on affidavit sworn to by the complainant or complainants before the judge or judge trial referee, either in person or electronically with simultaneous sight and sound, and establishing the grounds for issuing the warrant, which affidavit shall be part of the arrest file. If the judge or judge trial referee is satisfied that grounds for the application exist or that there is probable cause to believe that grounds for the application exist, the judge or judge trial referee shall issue a warrant identifying the property and naming or describing the person, place or thing to be searched or authorizing the installation and use of a tracking device and identifying the person on which or the property to, in or on which the tracking device is to be installed. The warrant shall be directed to any police officer of a regularly organized police department or any state police officer, to an inspector in the Division of Criminal Justice, to a conservation officer, special conservation officer or patrolman acting pursuant to section 26-6 or to a sworn motor vehicle inspector acting under the authority of section 14-8. Except for a warrant for the installation and use of a tracking device, the warrant shall state the date and time of its issuance and the grounds or probable cause for its issuance and shall command the officer to search within a reasonable time the person, place or thing named, for the property specified. A warrant for the installation and use of a tracking device shall state the date and time of its issuance and the grounds or probable cause for its issuance and shall command the officer to complete the installation of the device within a specified period not later than ten days after the date of its issuance and authorize the installation and use of the tracking device, including the collection of data through such tracking device, for a reasonable period of time not to exceed thirty days from the date the tracking device is installed. Upon request and a showing of good cause, a judge or judge trial referee may authorize the use of the tracking device for an additional period of thirty days.\n\n(e) No police officer of a regularly organized police department or any state police officer, an inspector in the Division of Criminal Justice, a conservation officer, special conservation officer or patrolman acting pursuant to section 26-6 or a sworn motor vehicle inspector acting under the authority of section 14-8, shall seek, execute or participate in the execution of a no-knock warrant. A search warrant authorized under this section shall require that an officer provide notice of such officer's identity, authority and purpose prior to entering the place to be searched for the execution of such search warrant. Prior to undertaking any search or seizure pursuant to the search warrant, the executing officer shall read and give a copy of the search warrant to the person to be searched or the owner of the place to be searched or, if the owner is not present, to any occupant of the place to be searched. If the place to be searched is unoccupied, the executing officer shall leave a copy of the search warrant suitably affixed to the place to be searched. For purposes of this subsection, “no-knock warrant” means a warrant authorizing police officers to enter certain premises without first knocking and announcing their presence or purpose prior to entering the place to be searched.\n\n(f) A judge or judge trial referee may issue a warrant pursuant to this section for records or data that are in the actual or constructive possession of a foreign corporation or business entity that transacts business in this state, including, but not limited to, a foreign corporation or business entity that provides electronic communication services or remote computing services to the public. Such a warrant may be served on an authorized representative of the foreign corporation or business entity by hand, mail, commercial delivery, facsimile or electronic transmission, provided proof of delivery can be established. When properly served with a warrant issued pursuant to this section, the foreign corporation or business entity shall provide to the applicant all records or data sought by the warrant within fourteen business days of being served with the warrant, unless the judge or judge trial referee determines that a shorter or longer period of time is necessary or appropriate.\n\n(g) The inadvertent failure of the issuing judge or judge trial referee to state on the warrant the time of its issuance shall not in and of itself invalidate the warrant.\n\n(1963, P.A. 652, S. 1, 3; February, 1965, P.A. 439; 574, S. 46; P.A. 74-183, S. 138, 291; P.A. 76-436, S. 530, 681; P.A. 77-504; P.A. 79-14, S. 3; P.A. 80-313, S. 8; P.A. 81-227, S. 3; June Sp.

In no case may the judge or judge trial referee who signed the warrant preside at the hearing on the motion.\n\n(b) The motion shall be made before trial or hearing unless opportunity therefor did not exist or the defendant was not aware of the grounds for the motion, but the court in its discretion may entertain the motion at the trial or hearing.\n\n(c) The court shall receive evidence on any issue of fact necessary to the decision of the motion. If the motion is granted, the property shall be restored unless otherwise subject to lawful detention and it shall not be admissible in evidence at any hearing or trial.\n\n(1963, P.A. 652, S. 7; 1967, P.A. 4; 1969, P.A. 292, S. 1; P.A. 80-313, S. 10; P.A. 01-72, S. 6.)\n\nHistory: 1967 act added proviso prohibiting judge who signed warrant from presiding at hearing on motion; 1969 act authorized aggrieved person to make motion “in the court in which his case is pending” for return of property and to suppress its use as evidence; P.A. 80-313 reorganized provisions and divided section into Subsecs.; P.A. 01-72 amended Subsec. (a) by making technical changes for purposes of gender neutrality and adding reference to judge trial referee.\n\nHistory discussed. 152 C. 90. Cited. 154 C. 314, 321. Neither statement that affiant had information from reliable informant nor that apartment sought to be searched had been under police surveillance was sufficient grounds for issuance of warrant, hence search warrant was illegal. 155 C. 385. Motion to suppress evidence consisting of several marked bills found on defendant immediately after he was observed selling narcotics to an informer, obtained by search incident to his lawful arrest for commission of felony of illegal sale of narcotics, properly denied. Id., 516. Ruling denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence of narcotics seized by arresting officer from stolen car in defendant's possession without obtaining search warrant was superseded by ruling during trial admitting narcotics as evidence; where defendant driver of stolen car had been arrested and drugs were found in car on custodial search by arresting officer, motion to suppress use of drugs in evidence properly denied. 159 C. 201. Cited. 169 C. 322. Person aggrieved by search and seizure may move to suppress for use as evidence anything obtained upon warrant when there is not probable cause for believing the existence of grounds for warrant. 170 C. 618.

Motion to dismiss, motion to suppress, difference. 30 CS 211. Section implements fourth amendment of U.S. Constitution and Art. I, Sec. 7 of the Connecticut Constitution and is analogous to rule 41 of Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; purposes of rule. 33 CS 129.\n\nEvidence obtained by an immediate search of defendant's apartment after her arrest for liquor violation was admissible; search without warrant was an incident to a lawful arrest. 4 Conn. Cir. Ct. 125. Where officers went beyond directives of warrant for search of defendant and certain premises and searched automobiles, evidence obtained was suppressed, but articles taken were not returned in absence of demand or request. Id., 422, 423. Property sought to be suppressed was voluntarily handed over to police officers by defendant's wife who was not party to defendant's appeal; he has no standing to claim violation of wife's constitutional rights as these are personal to her. Id., 605. Testimony or information, although not tangible, come within purview of statute. 5 Conn. Cir. Ct. 44. Although not expressly required, it is better practice for motion to suppress to be in writing. Id., 51. Motion by defendant to suppress evidence seized in search of his car dismissed by Circuit Court where prosecuting attorney had instituted bindover proceedings in Superior Court. Id., 119. While it is better practice to test legality of seizure in preliminary hearing, court may entertain motion to suppress at trial; officers did not search for papers where they had defendant under surveillance in his store and saw him putting papers under rafters of hatchway and picked them up upon arrest. Id., 613. Where there was probable cause to believe that defendant was in business of pool selling from allegations of affidavit, search warrant was properly issued. Id, 669. Burden of proof relative to the illegality of search and seizure is on accused; newspaper, policy sheet and pen discarded by accused were abandoned property and apprehension of them by police is not seizure of defendant's property. 6 Conn. Cir. Ct. 17. Doctrine of retroactivity not applied to procedural problem of this kind. Id., 192, 194. Motion to suppress must specify item to be suppressed. Id., 454. Cited. Id., 574, 584.",

Such proceeding shall be deemed a civil suit in equity, in which the state shall have the burden of proving all material facts by clear and convincing evidence. The court shall identify the owner of such property and any other person as appears to have an interest in such property, and order the state to give notice to such owner and any interested person by certified or registered mail.\n\n(b) The court shall hold a hearing on the petition filed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section not more than two weeks after the criminal proceeding that occurred as a result of the arrest has been nolled, dismissed or otherwise disposed of. The court shall deny the petition and return the property to the owner if the criminal proceeding does not result in (1) a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to any offense charged in the same criminal information, (2) a guilty verdict after trial to a forfeiture-eligible offense for which the property was possessed, controlled, designed or intended for use, or which was or had been used as a means of committing such offense, or which constitutes the proceeds of the commission of such offense, or (3) a dismissal resulting from the completion of a pretrial diversionary program.\n\n(c) If the court finds the allegations made in such petition to be true and that the property has been possessed, controlled or designed for use, or is or has been or is intended to be used, with intent to violate or in violation of any of the criminal laws of this state, or constitutes the proceeds of a violation of any of the criminal laws of this state, except a violation of section 21a-267, 21a-277, 21a-278, 21a-278b or 21a-279, and that a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to such offense or another charge in the same criminal information, or a guilty verdict after trial for such forfeiture-eligible offense, or a dismissal resulting from the completion of a pretrial diversionary program has been entered, the court shall render judgment that such property is a nuisance and order the property to be destroyed or disposed of to a charitable or educational institution or to a governmental agency or institution, except that if any such property is subject to a bona fide mortgage, assignment of lease or rent, lien or security interest, such property shall not be so destroyed or disposed of in violation of the rights of the holder of such mortgage, assignment of lease or rent, lien or security interest.\n\n(d) (1) When the condemned property is money (A) on and after October 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2016, the court shall order that such money be distributed as follows: (i) Seventy per cent shall be allocated to the law enforcement agency, including the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection and local police departments, responsible for investigating the criminal violation and seizing the money, and such local police departments shall use such money for the detection, investigation, apprehension and prosecution of persons for the violation of criminal laws, and any money allocated to the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection shall be deposited in the General Fund; (ii) twenty per cent shall be deposited in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund established in section 54-215; and (iii) ten per cent shall be allocated to the Division of Criminal Justice and deposited in the General Fund; and (B) on and after July 1, 2016, such money shall be deposited in the General Fund.\n\n(2) When the condemned property is a valuable prize, which is subject to a bona fide mortgage, assignment of lease or rent, lien or security interest, such property shall remain subject to such mortgage, assignment of lease or rent, lien or security interest.\n\n(e) When any property or valuable prize has been declared a nuisance and condemned under this section, the court may also order that such property be sold in accordance with procedures approved by the Commissioner of Administrative Services. Proceeds of such sale shall first be allocated toward the balance of any mortgage, assignment of lease or rent, lien or security interest, and the remaining proceeds of such sale, if any, shall be allocated in accordance with subparagraphs (A) to (C), inclusive, of subdivision (1) of subsection (d) of this section. In any criminal prosecution, secondary evidence of property condemned and destroyed pursuant to this section shall be admissible against the defendant to the same extent as such evidence would have been admissible had the property not been condemned and destroyed.\n\n(f) If the court finds the allegations not to be true, irrespective of the findings in the criminal proceeding, or that the property has not been kept with intent to violate or in violation of the criminal laws of this state, or that the property does not constitute the proceeds of a violation of the criminal laws of this state, or that the property is the property of a person who is not a defendant, the court shall order the property returned to the owner forthwith and the party in possession of such property pending such determination shall be responsible and personally liable for such property from the time of seizure and shall immediately comply with such order.\n\n(g) Failure of the state to proceed against such property in accordance with the provisions of this section shall not prevent the use of such property as evidence in any criminal trial.\n\n(1963, P.A. 652, S. 8; February, 1965, P.A. 215; 574, S. 47; 1972, P.A. 49; P.A. 75-54, S. 1, 3; P.A. 76-77, S. 4; 76-436, S. 531, 681; P.A. 80-313, S. 11; P.A. 84-540, S. 4, 7; P.A. 87-294, S. 1; P.A. 89-269, S. 3; P.A. 14-233, S. 1; P.A. 17-193, S. 1; June Sp.

(b) to place on the state's attorney or assistant state's attorney “the burden of proving all material facts by clear and convincing evidence” and amended Subsec. (c) to add exception for “a violation of section 21a-267, 21a-277, 21a-278 or 21a-279”; P.A. 14-233 substantially revised section by amending Subsec. (a) to add provision making section applicable to proceeds of commission of a criminal offense and replacing provisions re judge or court issuing warrant and summons with provisions authorizing state's attorney to petition court, after seizure of property, for forfeiture order in a civil proceeding in rem after notice to owner or interested party by certified or registered mail, deleting former Subsec. (b) re owner of property claiming interest, redesignating existing Subsec. (c) as Subsec. (b), inserting new Subsec.

      "text": "(a) As used in this section, sections 53-278c and 54-36c: (1) “Contraband” means any property, the possession of which is prohibited by any provision of the general statutes; (2) “stolen property” shall include, but not be limited to, cash or the proceeds from the sale of such property obtained by theft or other illegal means; (3) “owner” means a person or persons entitled to seized property as a matter of law or fact.\n\n(b) (1) Whenever property is seized in connection with a criminal arrest or seized pursuant to a search warrant without an arrest, the law enforcement agency seizing such property shall file, on forms provided for this purpose by the Office of the Chief Court Administrator, an inventory of the property seized. The inventory, together with the uniform arrest report, in the case of an arrest, shall be filed with the clerk of the court for the geographical area in which the criminal offense is alleged to have been committed; except, when the property is stolen property and, in the opinion of the law enforcement officer, does not exceed one thousand dollars in value, or when an attempt was made to steal the property but the property at all times remained on the premises in a sealed container, the filing of an inventory shall not be required and such property may be returned to the owner. In the case of property seized in connection with a search warrant without an arrest, the inventory shall be attached to the warrant and shall be filed with the clerk of the court for the geographical area in which the search warrant was issued. If any criminal proceeding is transferred to another court location, then the clerk with whom the inventory is filed shall transfer such inventory to the clerk of the court location to which such action is transferred.\n\n(2) If the seized property is stolen property, within ten days of the seizure, the law enforcement agency seizing the property shall notify the owner of the property if known, or, if the owner of the property is unknown at the time of seizure, such agency shall within ten days of any subsequent ascertainment of the owner notify such owner, and, on a form prescribed by the Office of the Chief Court Administrator, advise the owner of such owner's rights concerning the property and the location of the property. Such written notice shall include a request form for the return of the property. The owner may request the return of the property by filing such request form with such law enforcement agency, and upon receipt of such request, the law enforcement agency shall forward it to the clerk of the court for the geographical area in which the criminal offense is alleged to have been committed. The clerk of the court shall notify the defendant or defendants of the request to return the property. The court shall order the return of the property within thirty days of the date of filing such return request by the owner, except that for good cause shown, the court may order retention of the property for a period to be determined by the court. Any secondary evidence of the identity, description or value of such property shall be admissible in evidence against such defendant in the trial of such case. The fact that the evidence is secondary in nature may be shown to affect the weight of such evidence, but not to affect its admissibility. If the stolen property is a motor vehicle, a photograph of the motor vehicle and a sworn affidavit attesting to the vehicle identification number of such motor vehicle shall be sufficient evidence of the identity of the motor vehicle. For the purposes of this subdivision, “motor vehicle” means a passenger or commercial motor vehicle or a motorcycle, as defined in section 14-1, and includes construction equipment, agricultural tractors and farm implements.\n\n(3) (A) If the seized property is currency and is stolen property, the law enforcement agency seizing the currency shall follow the procedures set forth in subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n(B) If the seized property is currency and is not stolen property, the law enforcement agency seizing the currency shall, within ten days of such seizure, notify the defendant or defendants, if such currency was seized in connection with a criminal arrest, or the person or persons having a possessory interest in the premises from which such currency was seized, if such currency was seized pursuant to a search warrant without an arrest, that such defendant or person has the right to a hearing before the Superior Court on the disposition of the currency. Such defendant or person may, not later than thirty days after receiving such notice, request a hearing before the Superior Court. The court may, after any such hearing, order that the law enforcement agency, after taking reasonable measures to preserve the evidentiary value of the currency, deposit the currency in a deposit account in the name of the law enforcement agency as custodian for evidentiary funds at a financial institution in this state or order, for good cause shown, that the currency be retained for a period to be determined by the court. If such defendant or person does not request a hearing, the law enforcement agency may, after taking reasonable measures to preserve the evidentiary value of the currency, deposit the currency in a deposit account in the name of the law enforcement agency as custodian for evidentiary funds at a financial institution in this state.\n\n(C) If the currency is deposited in a deposit account at a financial institution in this state pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, the financial institution at which such deposit account is established shall not be required to segregate the currency deposited in such deposit account. No funds may be withdrawn from such deposit account except pursuant to a court order directed to the financial institution. Any withdrawal of funds from such deposit account shall be in the form of a check issued by the financial institution to the law enforcement agency or to such other payee as the court may order. Nothing in this subdivision shall prohibit a financial institution from charging a fee for the maintenance and administration of such deposit account and for the review of the court order.\n\n(D) If the currency is deposited in a deposit account at a financial institution in this state pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, any secondary evidence of the identity, description or value of such currency shall be admissible in evidence against a defendant in the trial of a criminal offense. The fact that the evidence is secondary in nature may be shown to affect the weight of such evidence, but not to affect its admissibility.\n\n(c) Unless such seized property is stolen property and is ordered returned pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or unless such seized property is adjudicated a nuisance in accordance with section 54-33g, or unless the court finds that such property shall be forfeited or is contraband, or finds that such property is a controlled drug or controlled substance as defined in section 21a-240, or drug paraphernalia as defined in subdivision (20) of section 21a-240, it shall, at the final disposition of the criminal action or as soon thereafter as is practical, or, if there is no criminal action, at any time upon motion of the prosecuting official of such court, order the return of such property to its owner within six months upon proper claim therefor.\n\n(d) When the court orders the return of the seized property to the owner, the order shall provide that if the seized property is not claimed by the owner within six months, the property shall be destroyed or be given to a charitable or educational institution or to a governmental agency or institution, except that (1) if such property is money it shall be remitted to the state and shall be deposited in the General Fund or (2) if such property is a valuable prize it shall be disposed of by public auction or private sale in which case the proceeds shall become the property of the state and shall be deposited in the General Fund; provided any person who has a bona fide mortgage, assignment of lease or rent, lien or security interest in such property shall have the same right to the proceeds as such person had in the property prior to the sale.\n\n(e) If such seized property is adjudicated a nuisance or if the court finds that such property shall be forfeited or is contraband other than a controlled drug or controlled substance as defined in section 21a-240, or drug paraphernalia as defined in subdivision (20) of section 21a-240, the court shall order that such property be destroyed or be given to a charitable or educational institution or to a governmental agency or institution, except that (1) if such property is money, the court shall order that it be remitted to the state and be deposited in the General Fund, or (2) if such property is a valuable prize, the court shall order that it be disposed of by public auction or private sale in which case the proceeds shall become the property of the state and shall be deposited in the General Fund; provided any person who has a bona fide mortgage, assignment of lease or rent, lien or security interest in such property shall have the same right to the proceeds as such person had in the property prior to sale.\n\n(f) If the court finds that such seized property is fireworks as defined in section 29-356, the court shall order the forfeiture and destruction of such property. Any secondary evidence of the identity, description or value of such property shall be admissible in evidence against the defendant in the trial of the case. A photograph of the fireworks and a sworn affidavit describing such fireworks shall be sufficient evidence of the identity of the fireworks. The fact that the evidence is secondary in nature may be shown to affect the weight of such evidence, but not to affect its admissibility.\n\n(g) If the court finds that such seized property is a controlled drug or controlled substance as defined in section 21a-240, or drug paraphernalia as defined in subdivision (20) of section 21a-240, the court shall order the forfeiture and destruction of such property or order it delivered to the Commissioner of Consumer Protection pursuant to section 54-36g.\n\n(h) Any order made under the provisions of subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this section or section 54-33f or 54-33g, shall upon notification from the clerk, be complied with by the person or department having custody or possession of such property.\n\n(i) A return of compliance with the court order, on a form prescribed by the Office of the Chief Court Administrator, shall be filed with the clerk of the court by the person or department to whom notice is sent in accordance with the provisions of subsection (h) of this section. If the court ordered the seized property returned to the owner within six months upon proper claim therefor, the return of the compliance shall be filed within seventy-two hours of the return of the property to the owner. If the owner does not claim the property within six months, then the return of compliance shall be filed within seventy-two hours of compliance with the order of the court pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. Failure to comply with the court order within ninety days following expiration of the period within which the owner of the property may claim the property shall constitute criminal contempt. If the court renders an order concerning the disposition of the property other than an order to return the property to the owner, the return of compliance shall be filed with the clerk within seventy-two hours of compliance with the court order. Failure to comply with the court order within ninety days of receipt of such order shall constitute criminal contempt. Failure to file a return of compliance as set forth in this subsection shall constitute criminal contempt. Anyone convicted of criminal contempt may be punished by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars. Each failure to comply with a court order and each failure to file a return of compliance within the required period shall constitute a separate criminal contempt.\n\n(P.A. 74-221, S. 1–6; P.A. 75-530, S. 16, 17, 35; P.A. 76-77, S. 1; P.A. 78-280, S. 1, 127; P.A. 79-392; P.A. 81-240, S. 1, 3; P.A. 82-235; P.A. 85-263, S. 1; P.A. 87-243; 87-294, S. 2; P.A. 99-247, S. 5; P.A. 01-104; 01-186, S. 8; June 30 Sp.
