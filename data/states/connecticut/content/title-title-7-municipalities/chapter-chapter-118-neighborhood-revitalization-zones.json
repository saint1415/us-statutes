The plan shall include recommendations for waivers of state and local environmental, health and safety codes that unreasonably jeopardize implementation of the plan, provided any waiver shall be in accordance with section 7-605 and shall not create a substantial threat to the environment, public health, safety or welfare of residents or occupants of the neighborhood. The plan may include components for public safety, education, job training, youths, the elderly and the arts and culture. The plan may contain recommendations for the establishment by the municipality of multiagency collaborative delivery teams, including code enforcement teams.

Any such petition shall be in accordance with the strategic plan adopted pursuant to sections 7-601 and 7-602. The court or judge shall immediately issue an order to show cause why a receiver should not be appointed, which shall be served upon the owner, agent, lessor or manager in a manner most reasonably calculated to give notice to such owner, agent, lessor or manager as determined by such court or judge, including, but not limited to, a posting of such order on the premises in question. A hearing shall be had on such order no less than three days after its issuance and not more than ten days. The purpose of such a hearing shall be to determine the need for a receiver of the property, the condition of the property and the cost to bring it into compliance with such state and local codes and regulations or into compliance with any waivers approved under section 7-605. The court shall make a determination of such amount and there shall be an assignment of the rents of such property in the amount of such determination. A certificate shall be recorded in the land records of the town in which such property is located describing the amount of the assignment and the name of the party who owns the property. When the amount due and owing has been paid, the receiver shall issue a certificate discharging the assignment and shall file the certificate in the land records of the town in which such assignment was recorded. The receiver appointed by the court shall collect rents or payments for use and occupancy forthcoming from the occupants of the building in question in place of the owner, agent, lessor or manager. The receiver shall make payments from such rents or payments for use and occupancy for the cost of bringing the property into compliance with such state and local codes and regulations or into compliance with any waivers approved under section 7-605. The owner, agent, lessor or manager shall be liable for such reasonable fees and costs determined by the court to be due the receiver, which fees and costs may be recovered from the rents or payments for use and occupancy under the control of the receiver, provided no such fees or costs shall be recovered until after payment for current taxes, electric, gas, telephone and water services and heating oil deliveries have been made. The owner, agent, lessor or manager shall be liable to the petitioner for reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by the petitioner, provided no such fees or costs shall be recovered until after payment for current taxes, electric, gas, telephone and water services and heating oil deliveries have been made and after payments of reasonable fees and costs to the receiver. Any moneys remaining thereafter shall be turned over to the owner, agent, lessor or manager. The court may order an accounting to be made at such times as it determines to be just, reasonable and necessary.\n\n(b) Any receivership established pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall have priority over any other rights to receive rent and shall be terminated by the court upon its finding that the property complies with state and local environmental, health and safety codes and regulations or is in compliance with any waivers approved under section 7-605.\n\n(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the petitioner from pursuing any other action or remedy at law or equity that it may have against the owner, agent, lessor or manager.\n\n(d) Any owner, agent, lessor or manager who collects or attempts to collect any rent or payment for use and occupancy from any occupant of a building subject to an order appointing a receiver after due notice and hearing, shall be found to be in contempt of court.\n\n(e) If a proceeding is initiated pursuant to sections 47a-14a to 47a-14h, inclusive, or sections 47a-56 to 47a-56i, inclusive, or if a receiver of rents is appointed pursuant to chapter 735a or pursuant to any other action involving the making of repairs to real property under court supervision, rent or use and occupancy payments shall be made pursuant to such proceeding or action without regard to whether such proceeding or action is initiated before or after a receivership is established under this section, and such proceeding or action shall take priority over a receivership established under this section in regard to expenditure of such rent or use and occupancy payments.\n\n(P.A. 95-340, S. 8.)",
