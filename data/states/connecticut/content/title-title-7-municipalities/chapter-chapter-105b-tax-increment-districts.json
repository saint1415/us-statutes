If the municipality has a charter, the establishment of such tax increment district may not be in conflict with the provisions of such charter. Establishment of a tax increment district is effective upon approval by the municipal legislative body and upon adoption of a district master plan pursuant to section 7-339ff.\n\n(b) Within tax increment districts and consistent with the district master plan, the municipality, in addition to powers granted to it under the Constitution, the general statutes, any special act or sections 7-339cc to 7-339kk, inclusive, shall have the following powers:\n\n(1) To acquire, construct, reconstruct, improve, preserve, alter, extend, operate or maintain property or promote development intended to meet the objectives of the district master plan. The municipality may acquire property, land or easements through negotiation or by other means authorized for municipalities under the general statutes;\n\n(2) To execute and deliver contracts, agreements and other documents relating to the operation and maintenance of the tax increment district;\n\n(3) To issue bonds and other obligations of the municipality in accordance with the provisions set forth in section 7-339jj;\n\n(4) Acting through its board of selectmen, town council or other governing body, to enter into written agreements with a taxpayer fixing the assessment of real estate within a tax increment district, provided (A) the term of such agreement shall not exceed fifteen years from the date of the agreement; and (B) the assessment agreed on for the real estate plus future improvements shall not be less than the assessment of the real estate as of the last regular assessment date without such future improvements. Any such agreement shall be recorded on the land records in the municipality. Recording of the agreement constitutes notice of the agreement to a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer of the property or any part of it, whether voluntary or involuntary, and is binding upon a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer. If the municipality claims that the taxpayer is not complying with the terms of such agreement, the municipality may bring an action in the superior court for the judicial district in which the municipality is located to force compliance with such agreement;\n\n(5) Accept grants, advances, loans or other financial assistance from the federal government, the state, private entities or any other source, and do any and all things necessary or desirable to secure such financial aid; and\n\n(6) Upon such terms as the municipality determines, furnish service or facilities, provide property, lend, grant or contribute funds, and take any other action of a character that it is authorized to perform for other purposes.\n\n(c) The tax increment district may be dissolved, at any time, and the boundaries of such district may be changed, at any time, by a vote of the municipality's legislative body, except that the tax increment district may not be dissolved nor may the boundaries of the tax increment district be changed so long as any bonds or other indebtedness authorized and issued under sections 7-339cc to 7-339kk, inclusive, except for general obligation bonds of the municipality secured solely by the full faith and credit of the municipality, or any other obligations authorized and incurred under sections 7-339cc to 7-339kk, inclusive, remain outstanding.\n\n(P.A. 15-57, S. 2.)",

The municipality may provide for the payment of such benefit assessments in annual installments, not exceeding thirty years, and may forgive such benefit assessments in any given year without causing the remainder of installments of benefit assessments to be forgiven. Benefit assessments on real property where buildings or structures are constructed or expanded after the initial benefit assessment may be assessed as if the new or expanded buildings or structures on such real property had existed at the time of the original benefit assessment.\n\n(2) The benefit assessments shall be adopted and revised by the municipality at least annually not more than sixty days before the beginning of the fiscal year.
