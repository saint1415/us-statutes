No person may serve as a police officer during any period when such person's certification has been cancelled or revoked pursuant to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section. In addition to the requirements of this subsection, the council may establish other qualifications for the employment of police officers and require evidence of fulfillment of these qualifications. The certification of any police officer who is not employed by a law enforcement unit for a period of time in excess of two years, unless such officer is on leave of absence, shall be considered lapsed. Upon reemployment as a police officer, such officer shall apply for recertification in a manner provided by the council, provided such recertification process requires the police officer to submit to a urinalysis drug test that screens for controlled substances, including, but not limited to, anabolic steroids, and receive a result indicating no presence of any controlled substance not prescribed for the officer. The council shall certify any applicant who presents evidence of satisfactory completion of a program or course of instruction in another state or, if the applicant is a veteran or a member of the armed forces or the National Guard, as part of training during service in the armed forces, that is equivalent in content and quality to that required in this state, provided such applicant passes an examination or evaluation as required by the council. For the purposes of this section, “veteran” and “armed forces” have the same meanings as provided in section 27-103.\n\n(c) (1) The council may refuse to renew any certificate if the holder fails to meet the requirements for renewal of his or her certification.\n\n(2) The council may cancel or revoke any certificate if: (A) The certificate was issued by administrative error, (B) the certificate was obtained through misrepresentation or fraud, (C) the holder falsified any document in order to obtain or renew any certificate, (D) the holder has been convicted of a felony, (E) the holder has been found not guilty of a felony by reason of mental disease or defect pursuant to section 53a-13, (F) the holder has been convicted of a violation of section 21a-279, (G) the holder has been refused issuance of a certificate or similar authorization or has had his or her certificate or other authorization cancelled or revoked by another jurisdiction on grounds which would authorize cancellation or revocation under the provisions of this subdivision, (H) the holder has been found by a law enforcement unit, pursuant to procedures established by such unit, to have used a firearm in an improper manner which resulted in the death or serious physical injury of another person, (I) the holder has been found by a law enforcement unit, pursuant to procedures established by such unit and considering guidance developed under subsection (g) of this section, to have engaged in conduct that undermines public confidence in law enforcement, including, but not limited to, discriminatory conduct, falsification of reports, issuances of orders that are not lawful orders, failure to report or timely report a death in violation of section 7-294mm or a violation of the Alvin W. Penn Racial Profiling Prohibition Act pursuant to sections 54-1land 54-1m, provided, when evaluating any such conduct, the council considers such conduct engaged in while the holder is acting in such holder's law enforcement capacity or representing himself or herself to be a police officer to be more serious than such conduct engaged in by a holder not acting in such holder's law enforcement capacity or representing himself or herself to be a police officer, (J) the holder has been found by a law enforcement unit, pursuant to procedures established by such unit, to have used physical force on another person in a manner that is excessive or used physical force in a manner found to not be justifiable after an investigation conducted pursuant to section 51-277a, or (K) the holder has been found by a law enforcement unit, pursuant to procedures established by such unit, to have committed any act that would constitute tampering with or fabricating physical evidence in violation of section 53a-155, perjury in violation of section 53a-156 or false statement in violation of section 53a-157b. Whenever the council believes there is a reasonable basis for suspension, cancellation or revocation of the certification of a police officer, police training school or law enforcement instructor, it shall give notice and an adequate opportunity for a hearing prior to such suspension, cancellation or revocation. Such hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54. Any holder aggrieved by the decision of the council may appeal from such decision in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183. The council may cancel or revoke any certificate if, after a de novo review, it finds by clear and convincing evidence (i) a basis set forth in subparagraphs (A) to (G), inclusive, of this subdivision, or (ii) that the holder of the certificate committed an act set forth in subparagraph (H), (I), (J) or (K) of this subdivision. In any such case where the council finds such evidence, but determines that the severity of an act committed by the holder of the certificate does not warrant cancellation or revocation of such holder's certificate, the council may suspend such holder's certification for a period of up to forty-five days and may censure such holder of the certificate. Any police officer or law enforcement instructor whose certification is cancelled or revoked pursuant to this section may reapply for certification no sooner than two years after the date on which the cancellation or revocation order becomes final. Any police training school whose certification is cancelled or revoked pursuant to this section may reapply for certification at any time after the date on which such order becomes final. For purposes of this subdivision, a lawful order is an order issued by a police officer who is in uniform or has identified himself or herself as a police officer to the person such order is issued to at the time such order is issued, and which order is reasonably related to the fulfillment of the duties of the police officer who is issuing such order, does not violate any provision of state or federal law and is only issued for the purposes of (I) preventing, detecting, investigating or stopping a crime, (II) protecting a person or property from harm, (III) apprehending a person suspected of a crime, (IV) enforcing a law, (V) regulating traffic, or (VI) assisting in emergency relief, including the administration of first aid.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, (1) any police officer, except a probationary candidate, who is serving under full-time appointment on July 1, 1982, and (2) any sworn member of the Division of State Police within the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, except a probationary candidate, who is serving under full-time appointment on July 31, 2020, shall be deemed to have met all certification requirements and shall be automatically certified by the council in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of section 7-294e.\n\n(e) The provisions of this section shall apply to any person who performs police functions. As used in this subsection, “performs police functions” for a person who is not a police officer, as defined in section 7-294a, means that in the course of such person's official duties, such person carries a firearm and exercises arrest powers pursuant to section 54-1f or engages in the prevention, detection or investigation of crime, as defined in section 53a-24. The council shall establish criteria by which the certification process required by this section shall apply to police officers.\n\n(f) The provisions of this section shall not apply to (1) Connecticut National Guard security personnel, when acting within the scope of their National Guard duties, who have satisfactorily completed a program of police training conducted by the United States Army or Air Force, (2) employees of the Judicial Department, (3) municipal animal control officers appointed pursuant to section 22-331, or (4) fire police appointed pursuant to section 7-313a. The provisions of this section with respect to renewal of certification upon satisfactory completion of review training programs shall not apply to any chief inspector or inspector in the Division of Criminal Justice who has satisfactorily completed a program of police training conducted by the division. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, any police officer certified in accordance with subsection (a) of this section may accept employment with another police department within this state without repeating minimum basic training.\n\n(g) The council may develop and issue written guidance to law enforcement units concerning grounds for suspension, cancellation or revocation of certification. Such written guidance may include, but not be limited to, (1) reporting procedures to be followed by chief law enforcement officers for certificate suspension, cancellation or revocation, (2) examples of conduct that undermines public confidence in law enforcement, (3) examples of discriminatory conduct, and (4) examples of misconduct while the certificate holder may not be acting in such holder's law enforcement capacity or representing himself or herself to be a police officer, but may be serious enough for suspension, cancellation or revocation of the holder's certificate. Such written guidance shall be available on the council's Internet web site.\n\n(h) (1) The chief law enforcement officer of each law enforcement unit shall report to the council any violation where a certificate holder has been found by the law enforcement unit, pursuant to procedures established by such unit, to have: (A) Used unreasonable, excessive or illegal force that causes serious physical injury to or the death of another person, or used unreasonable, excessive or illegal force that was likely to cause serious physical injury or death to another person; (B) while acting in a law enforcement capacity, failed to intervene or stop the use of unreasonable, excessive or illegal force by another police officer that caused serious physical injury or death to another person, or unreasonable, excessive or illegal force that was likely to cause serious physical injury or death to another person, or to notify a supervisor and submit a written report of such acts where the holder has personal knowledge of such acts and had the ability to prevent such acts; (C) intentionally intimidated or harassed another person based upon actual or perceived protected class membership, identity or expression and in doing so threatened to commit or caused physical injury to another person; and (D) been terminated, dismissed, resigned or retired under circumstances described in section 7-291c.\n\n(2) If the chief law enforcement officer of any municipal police department or the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection fails to report to the council as required in subdivision (1) of this subsection, the council shall notify the Inspector General who shall investigate such failure to report. The Inspector General shall report the findings of the investigation to the Governor and joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to the judiciary in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a.\n\n(February, 1965, P.A. 575, S. 5; 1967, P.A. 669; P.A. 77-289; P.A. 81-426, S. 3; P.A. 82-357, S. 3, 8; P.A. 87-99; 87-560, S. 2; P.A. 91-186; P.A. 92-128, S. 1, 2; P.A. 93-271, S. 1, 3; 93-435, S. 1, 95; P.A. 94-44, S. 1, 2; May Sp.

      "text": "(a) As used in this section, “municipality” has the same meaning as provided in section 7-314; “fire duties” has the same meaning as provided in section 7-314; “ambulance service” means “ambulance service” as defined in section 7-314b; “volunteer ambulance member” means “active member of an organization certified as a volunteer ambulance service in accordance with section 19a-180” as defined in section 7-314b; and “fire police officer” means any active member of a volunteer fire police organization operating under a municipal fire department that provides support services to such department in accordance with section 7-313a.\n\n(b) Each municipality of this state, notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law, general, special or local, or any limitation contained in the provisions of any charter, shall protect and save harmless any volunteer firefighter, volunteer ambulance member or volunteer fire police officer of such municipality from financial loss and expense, including legal fees and costs, if any, arising out of (1) any claim, demand, suit or judgment by reason of alleged negligence on the part of such volunteer firefighter, volunteer ambulance member or volunteer fire police officer while performing fire, volunteer ambulance or fire police duties, and (2) any claim, demand or suit instituted against such volunteer firefighter, volunteer ambulance member or volunteer fire police officer by reason of alleged malicious, wanton or wilful act on the part of such volunteer firefighter, volunteer ambulance member or volunteer fire police officer while performing fire, volunteer ambulance or fire police duties. In the event that a court of law enters a judgment against such volunteer firefighter, volunteer ambulance member or volunteer fire police officer for a malicious, wanton or wilful act, such volunteer firefighter, volunteer ambulance member or volunteer fire police officer shall reimburse such municipality for any expenses that the municipality incurred in providing such defense, and such municipality shall be exempt from any liability to such volunteer firefighter, volunteer ambulance member or volunteer fire police officer for any financial loss resulting from such act. This section shall not apply to damages to a person caused by an employee to a fellow employee while both employees are engaged in the scope of their employment for such municipality if the employee suffering such damages or, in the case of his or her death, his or her dependent, has a right to benefits or compensation under chapter 568 by reason of such damages. If a firefighter or, in the case of his or her death, his or her dependent, has a right to benefits or compensation under chapter 568 by reason of injury or death caused by the negligence or wrong of a fellow employee while both employees are engaged in the scope of their employment for such municipality, such firefighter or, in the case of his or her death, his or her dependent, shall have no cause of action against such fellow employee to recover damages for such injury or death unless such wrong was wilful and malicious. Such municipality may arrange for and maintain appropriate insurance or may elect to act as a self-insurer to maintain such protection. No action or proceeding instituted pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be prosecuted or maintained against the municipality or firefighter, volunteer ambulance member or volunteer fire police officer unless at least thirty days have elapsed since the demand, claim or claims upon which such action or special proceeding is founded were presented to the clerk or corresponding officer of such municipality. No action for personal injuries or damages to real or personal property shall be maintained against such municipality and firefighter, volunteer ambulance member or volunteer fire police officer unless such action is commenced within one year after the cause of action therefor arose and notice of the intention to commence such action and of the time when and the place where the damages were incurred or sustained has been filed with the clerk or corresponding officer of such municipality and with the firefighter, volunteer ambulance member or volunteer fire police officer not later than six months after such cause of action has accrued. No action for trespass shall lie against any firefighter crossing or working upon lands of another to extinguish fire or for investigation of such fire. No action for trespass shall lie against any volunteer ambulance member crossing or working upon lands of another while performing ambulance services. No action for trespass shall lie against any volunteer fire police officer crossing or working upon lands of another while performing fire police services. Governmental immunity shall not be a defense in any action brought under this section. In any such action the municipality and the firefighter, or the municipality and the volunteer ambulance member, or the municipality and the volunteer fire police officer, may be represented by the same attorney.\n\n(1955, S. 266d; 1957, P.A. 401, S. 2; 1959, P.A. 446, S. 1; 1961, P.A. 355; February, 1965, P.A. 596; P.A. 98-108, S. 2; P.A. 03-278, S. 14; P.A. 11-243, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: 1959 act substituted reference to Sec. 7-314 for reference to Sec. 7-309 and defined “fire duties”; 1961 act added provisions re damages caused employee by fellow employee; 1965 act added provisions re representation of municipality and fireman by same attorney; P.A. 98-108 divided existing section into Subsecs. (a) and (b) and added provisions re volunteer ambulance members (Revisor's note: In Subsec. (a) the phrase “‘fire duties' mean ...” was changed editorially by the Revisors to “‘fire duties' means ...” for grammatical correctness); P.A. 03-278 replaced “verdict” with “final judgment” and made technical changes in Subsec. (b), effective July 9, 2003; P.A. 11-243 added definition of “fire police officer” in Subsec. (a), substantially revised Subsec. (b) re liability of volunteer firefighter, volunteer ambulance member or volunteer fire police officer and made technical changes.\n\nCited. 148 C. 27. Because reference in section to an action by a “fireman” includes an action by that fireman's administratrix, trial court did not err in concluding that statute applied to bar the action; section is capable of a reasonable interpretation; notwithstanding an inaccurate reference in it to a cause of action on the part of a deceased's “dependent”, it is not unconstitutionally void for vagueness; section is not superseded by Sec. 31-293a which permits an action against a fellow employee for injuries arising out of the negligent operation of a motor vehicle; because the purpose of section, which is to prevent double liability on the part of a municipality for the negligence of municipal firemen, bears a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental objective, it does not violate principles of equal protection. 187 C. 53. Cited. 189 C. 550; 196 C. 192; 209 C. 273. Because the prohibition in Subsec. (b) on a cause of action by a municipal firefighter against a fellow employee is rationally related to legitimate governmental interest of reducing municipal liability and fostering provision of effective firefighting services, it does not violate federal or state equal protection clause. 300 C. 395.\n\nCited. 12 CA 538; judgment reversed, see 209 C. 273.\n\nCited. 22 CS 240. To establish liability of municipality, plaintiff must allege and prove that conduct of employees was not wilful or wanton and that they were engaged in fire duties as defined in Sec. 7-314; necessity of allegation of presentation to municipality of demand is not satisfied by an allegation that required notice of injury was given municipality. 23 CS 149. Cited. Id., 229. Cause of action against a fireman and a municipality is not limited to a living fireman but extends to his executor or administrator in case he dies; section must be read in conjunction with Sec. 52-599. Id., 321. Identity of unknown fireman can be ascertained for purpose of instituting action by invoking Sec. 52-156 re depositions. 24 CS 452. Cited. 28 CS 507.

Such subcommittee shall review claims for wage replacement benefits submitted to the firefighters cancer relief program established pursuant to section 7-313j and provide wage replacement benefits, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of section 3-123, to any firefighter who the subcommittee determines is eligible for such wage replacement benefits pursuant to the provisions of section 7-313j. The subcommittee may determine the weekly wage replacement benefits provided to a firefighter in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and chapter 568.\n\n(b) A firefighter who is approved for wage replacement benefits by the subcommittee pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be eligible for such benefits on and after July 1, 2019, and for a period determined by the subcommittee, provided such period shall not exceed twenty-four months. The maximum weekly wage replacement benefit under this section shall be determined by the subcommittee, provided such maximum weekly wage replacement benefit shall not exceed one hundred per cent, raised to the next even dollar, of the average weekly earnings of all workers in the state for the year in which the condition of cancer was diagnosed. The average weekly earnings of all workers in the state shall be determined by the Labor Commissioner on or before the fifteenth day of August of each year, to be effective the following October first, and shall be the average of all workers' weekly earnings for the year ending the previous June thirtieth and shall be so determined in accordance with the standards for the determination of average weekly earnings of all workers established by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n(c) A firefighter may receive wage replacement benefits under this section concurrently with any employer-provided employment benefits, provided the total compensation of such firefighter during such period of receiving benefits under this section shall not exceed such firefighter's pay rate at the time such firefighter was diagnosed with a condition of cancer described in section 7-313j.\n\n(d) No firefighter shall receive compensation under this section concurrently with the provisions of chapter 567 or 568 or any other municipal, state or federal program that provides wage replacement benefits.\n\n(e) No approval of wage replacement benefits for a firefighter by the subcommittee pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be used as evidence, proof or an acknowledgment of liability or causation in any proceeding under chapter 568.\n\n(f) No approval of wage replacement benefits for a firefighter by the subcommittee pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall create a presumption that the firefighter's cancer was work related for purposes of chapter 568. Nothing in this section shall be construed to diminish or affect in any manner a firefighter's rights and benefits or any rights and defenses that an employer may have under chapter 568.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of the general statutes, any employer who provides accident and health insurance or life insurance coverage for a firefighter or makes payments or contributions at the regular hourly or weekly rate for the firefighter to an employee welfare plan, shall provide to the firefighter equivalent insurance coverage or welfare plan payments or contributions while the firefighter is eligible to receive or is receiving wage replacement compensation under this section.
