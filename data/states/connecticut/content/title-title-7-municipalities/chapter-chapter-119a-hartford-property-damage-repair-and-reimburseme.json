Such process and criteria shall be approved by the Comptroller. Such application shall include, but need not be limited to, if applicable, a copy of any determination made on any claim for such damage against any property and casualty insurance policy issued to an applicant, including any amounts paid to such applicant pursuant to such claim.

Such report shall be in a form and manner prescribed by the administrator, and shall include, but need not be limited to, a description of the damage to such eligible applicant's property and the estimated cost to repair such damage. Not later than thirty days after the receipt of such report, the administrator may award a grant to the eligible applicant in accordance with a formula established by the Comptroller, which shall include a reduction in the amount of any such award equal to any payments received by the applicant pursuant to any claim made against a property and casualty insurance policy held by such applicant for such damage.\n\n(4) Not later than thirty days after a determination that an applicant is eligible for reimbursement for costs associated with damage to personal property pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection, the administrator shall award a grant to the eligible applicant in accordance with a formula established by the Comptroller, which may include a reduction in the amount of any such award equal to any payments received by the applicant pursuant to any claim made against a property and casualty insurance policy held by such applicant for such damage.\n\n(5) Any eligible applicant that hires a licensed inspector pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection may request reimbursement for the costs of such inspection in a form and manner prescribed by the administrator.
