      "text": "(a) It is hereby found and declared that the development, maintenance and improvement of systems for the transportation of people and goods within the state, and particularly within the metropolitan areas of the state, by rail, motor carrier or other means of land transportation are essential for the welfare of the citizens of the state and for the development of the state's resources, commerce and industry, that the development and maintenance of modern, efficient and adequate systems of mass transportation are required; that private enterprise lacks financial or other resources necessary to provide such systems of mass transportation; and, that the formation and operation of transit districts with the powers enumerated in this chapter are thus a public necessity.\n\n(b) As used in this chapter:\n\n(1) “Transit facilities”, “transit services” and “transit system” include motorbus, minibus, tramline, monorail, rapid transit or other land transportation systems for the mass movement of persons and goods between locations within and between municipalities, including real property and interests therein, and equipment and facilities incident to the provision, operation, administration and maintenance of such transit system. The term “transit facilities” also includes a “transportation center”, as defined in subdivision (2) of this subsection, and “parking facilities”, as defined in subdivision (3) of this subsection;\n\n(2) “Transportation center” includes a station or terminal for passengers and goods in local, intrastate or interstate transit by any rail, bus or other land transportation system, land, buildings, structures, parking facilities, roads and other improvements, equipment and facilities, and includes a station or center containing commercial, office, retail or other facilities which are necessary or incidental to transportation purposes or uses or which the district, by its board of directors, determines are not presently needed for such transportation purposes but should be included in such center for use in the future as the need arises. Those portions of existing buildings and properties acquired for a transportation center which are not used or have no potential for future use for transportation purposes may be used and improved for such commercial, office, retail or other uses which the district, by its board of directors, determines are necessary or appropriate to finance or operate those portions of the transportation center which are devoted to such transportation purposes or to finance or operate other activities of the district; and\n\n(3) “Parking facilities” mean one or more lots, garages, parking terminals or other structures and accommodations for the parking of motor vehicles off any highway, as defined in section 14-1.\n\n(c) Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the continuation of any transit district formed under any special act.\n\n(d) Any town, city or borough may, by itself or in cooperation with one or more other municipalities, form a transit district, in the manner and for the purposes hereinafter provided. The district shall be a body corporate and politic, and may sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, hold and convey real or personal estate, adopt and alter a common seal, borrow on the faith and credit of the district for its purposes under this chapter, and, in addition to the powers authorized by this chapter or any other chapter of the general statutes, shall have such other powers as are necessary or incident to carrying out the powers and purposes of this chapter.\n\n(e) The legislative body of any municipality may vote to establish a transit district or to join with any one or more municipalities to form such a district. Any municipality may at any time be included in the district if the legislative body thereof so votes and if accepted by a majority vote of the directors of the transit district. Any municipality may be an ex-officio member of another transit district if the legislative body thereof so votes and if accepted by a majority vote of the directors of such other transit district. An ex-officio member shall not have the right to vote. The district may contract with any town to supply transit service therein. It may also provide charter service.\n\n(f) Any municipality included in the district may withdraw therefrom if the legislative body thereof votes to do so. In such case the board of directors of the district, including the members chosen from the withdrawing municipality, shall determine the share of the district's expenses and obligations remaining due from the municipality. The municipality shall pay or secure such amount to the district before such withdrawal shall become effective.\n\n(g) Whenever any transit district is formed under the provisions of this chapter, no provision of chapters 244, 244a, 244b, 277, 281 and 285 shall apply to the operation of transit systems by such district.\n\n(1961, P.A. 507, S. 1; 1972, P.A. 261, S. 1; P.A. 73-2, S. 6, 7, 11; P.A. 77-463, S. 1; P.A. 78-305, S. 1, 5; P.A. 83-469, S. 2, 5; P.A. 85-246, S. 2; P.A. 99-82, S. 1, 4.)\n\nHistory: 1972 act inserted new Subsecs. (a) to (c) re necessity for public transit, definitions and protection of previously formed transit districts, relettered former Subsec. (a) as Subsec. (d) and granted power to carry out provisions of chapter, deleted former Subsec. (b), relettered former Subsecs. (c) to (e) as Subsecs. (e) to (g) and replaced references to actions of electors with references to actions of the legislative body and extended scope of Subsec. (g) to include all transit systems; P.A. 73-2 amended Subsec. (d) to give districts borrowing power and amended Subsec. (e) to remove requirement that district members be contiguous municipalities; P.A. 77-463 redefined “transit facilities” to include transportation centers and defined “transportation center” in Subsec. (b); P.A. 78-305 added multiple-use provision re transportation centers in Subsec. (b); P.A. 83-469 redefined “transit facilities” to include parking facilities, changed the term “parking areas” to “parking facilities” and defined “parking facilities” in Subsec. (b); P.A. 85-246 redefined “transit facilities”, “transit services” and “transit system” in Subsec. (b)(1) to exclude street railways which were previously included; P.A. 99-82 amended Subsec. (e) to authorize any municipality that is a member of a transit district to become a nonvoting, ex-officio member of another transit district, effective July 1, 1999.\n\nCited. 235 C. 1.\n\nSubsec. (f):\n\nTrial court properly determined that where transit district ceased to exist after all four municipal members withdrew and formed a new transit authority, which assumed all assets and liabilities of the former transit district, the requirement that former transit district's board of directors determine the share of the district's expenses and obligations remaining due from each municipal member was obviated. 101 CA 243.",

The population of each municipality according to the most recent federal census shall be divided by the number of directors representing such municipality. Each member of the board of directors shall be entitled to cast that number of voting units which is the multiple the population he represents, rounded to the nearest one hundred, is of the smallest population represented by a member, rounded to the nearest one hundred.

Upon assuming such supervision the district, by its board of directors, shall establish passenger fares and any other rates to be charged and shall establish service standards, may order abandonment of uneconomic routes and shall exercise all powers of regulation and supervision over such transit system as are conferred on the department by title 16, in the same manner and under the same standards as are established by said title 16.

The party so appealing shall give bond to the state, with sufficient surety, for the benefit of the adverse party, in such sum as the board of directors fix, to pay all costs in case he or it fails to sustain such appeal. To the extent applicable, such appeal shall conform to the standards and procedure for appeals in contested cases under sections 4-176e to 4-182, inclusive. Where the department determines that the order, authorization or decision of the transit district would affect state-wide transportation policy adversely, such order, authorization or decision may be modified or overruled. The decision after hearing shall be final except that the applicant for such hearing, if aggrieved, may appeal therefrom in accordance with section 4-183.

      "text": "(a) If the directors deem it necessary to preserve or to develop a transit system, the district may establish, operate and maintain a transit system within the district or between the district and any municipality contiguous with its service area with which it contracts to furnish transit service, and for this purpose may establish a new system, or may acquire all or a portion of the property and franchises of any company or companies operating a transit service in the district, including that portion of the property and franchises used for operation within the district and also that portion of the property and franchises which is used outside the district but which is integrated into the service provided in the district. The district may establish, construct, acquire, operate and maintain transportation centers and parking facilities, as defined in subsection (b) of section 7-273b, in the district, and for such purposes may acquire, by purchase or otherwise, hold, sell, convey and obtain and exercise any and all rights of ownership or interest in or to any real or personal property as provided by this section, apply for and accept grants and gifts, lease all or any portion of such centers and parking facilities, charge and collect rent, use or other fees, make contracts and enter into management agreements and arrangements with others with respect to any transaction, operation or venture which the district has the power to conduct by itself in connection with exercising its powers under this section. Thereafter the district may contract, after competitive bidding, for the operation of all or any portion of the system and any transportation centers and parking facilities located therein by private management, under suitable incentives. The district shall fix the terms and conditions upon which transit services shall be provided, whether operated directly by the district or indirectly by contract, including the fixing of passenger fares and any other rates to be charged. The district shall, for its purposes under this section, so far as applicable, have the authority conferred on the Department of Transportation by the general statutes as applied to local transit.\n\n(b) In order to insure the continuance of adequate transit services when it appears that the holder of the franchise is or will be incapable of continuing to offer satisfactory service to meet present or future public passenger transportation requirements and it is improbable that such franchise will be sought by any other private concern, the Department of Transportation, on its own initiative, may or, on request of the transit district or the legislative body of one or more municipalities in the area served, shall fix a time and place for a hearing as to whether such franchise is suitable for acquisition by a transit district. Said department shall give written notice of such hearing to the board of selectmen of each town, or in the case of cities and boroughs to the chief executive of each, within the area not less than fourteen days prior to such hearing, and shall cause to be published twice, not more than fourteen nor less than seven days prior to such hearing, notice of such hearing in a newspaper or newspapers having a substantial circulation in each municipality within such area. Suitability of a franchise for acquisition by a transit district shall be determined from the following considerations: (1) That public convenience and necessity require the continuance of transit service within the area, (2) that the present franchise holder is or will be incapable of continuing to offer satisfactory service, (3) that it is improbable that such franchise will be sought by a private concern and (4) that continuance of transit service may require the operation of such service by a transit district. After a public hearing thereon and consideration of the above-mentioned factors, the department may declare such franchise suitable for acquisition by a transit district, provided such declaration shall not affect the authority of the municipalities in the area to establish such a district. Ability to offer satisfactory service shall be based upon the financial stability of the franchise holder as determined from past, current and projected net income and from an estimate of financial ability to meet future public passenger transportation requirements in the area. The department may make periodic inspections of transit system franchise holders to determine the financial stability of each and for this purpose may examine the books, accounts and other pertinent documents of such franchise holders and shall have the power to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, accounts and other pertinent documents by the issuance of a subpoena. With the written consent of the chief executive officer of each municipality within the area served, the district and the transit system franchise holder may execute an agreement to waive the holding of a hearing by the department, as described in this subsection and may exercise its power to acquire real property and interests and rights in real property in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(c) A transit district shall have the power to acquire real property and interests and rights in real property by eminent domain in the name of the transit district for the purposes of the transit district subject to the prior approval of the legislative body or bodies of the municipality or municipalities in which the real property is located. The owner shall be paid by the transit district for all damages. Where the transit district and the owner of such property cannot agree upon the amount to be paid to the owner for any property thus taken, the transit district shall proceed in the same manner specified for redevelopment agencies in accordance with sections 8-129 to 8-133, inclusive. Where either by hearing or waiver it has been determined that a franchise is suitable for acquisition pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the transit district shall have the power to acquire by eminent domain all or any part of the franchise and of the holder's transit system, including the holder's real estate or interests therein, personal property, and funds under the control or held for the use of or the benefit of such holder. Where the transit district and the holder of such franchise and property cannot agree upon the amount to be paid to the holder for any franchise or property thus taken, the transit district shall proceed in the same manner specified for redevelopment agencies in accordance with sections 8-129 to 8-133, inclusive.\n\n(1961, P.A. 507, S. 4; 1972, P.A. 261, S. 4; P.A. 75-486, S. 25, 69; P.A. 77-463, S. 2; 77-614, S. 162, 610; P.A. 79-246, S. 1, 2; P.A. 80-94, S. 2, 3; 80-482, S. 12, 348; P.A. 83-469, S. 3, 5.)\n\nHistory: 1972 act added provisions allowing acquisition of property and franchises of companies operating within the district and added Subsecs.

Any such bonds which are secured by the full faith and credit of the transit district or by both the full faith and credit of the transit district and a pledge of revenues shall be in serial form and may mature in annual installments which shall be substantially equal or shall be so arranged that no installments payable in any year shall be less than the amount of any installment payable in any subsequent year, or may mature in annual installments on a maturity schedule that will substantially equalize the payment of principal and interest annually. The first installment of any series of bonds shall mature not later than two years from the date of the issue of such series and the last installment of such series shall mature not later than forty years therefrom. Any revenue bonds may mature at term, which shall not exceed forty years from the date of issue, or in such installments prior thereto as the board of directors determines. The term of any anticipation notes issued pursuant to this chapter shall not be included in computing the time within which such bonds shall mature. The bonds of each issue may be sold at public or private sale, at or above or below par, may be fully registered, registrable as principal only or in bearer form, and may be made redeemable before maturity at such price or prices, and under such terms and conditions, all as shall be provided by the board of directors. The board of directors, or such officer as the board shall designate, shall determine the rate of interest which such bonds shall bear, the form of such bonds, the persons by whom such bonds are to be signed, the place or places for payment of principal and interest, and the manner of execution of such bonds.\n\n(b) A public hearing shall be held on any proposed resolution to authorize the issuance of bonds. Notice of the public hearing and a copy of the proposed resolution shall be published fifteen days before the date of the public hearing in a newspaper or newspapers having a substantial circulation in the district. All such bonds shall be authorized after such public hearing by resolution adopted by a majority of all the directors of the transit district, provided no resolution authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds exceeding two hundred fifty thousand dollars shall become effective until ninety days after publication of notice of passage of the resolution in a newspaper or newspapers having a substantial circulation in the district. Such resolution authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds exceeding two hundred fifty thousand dollars shall become effective ninety days after publication of notice of passage of the resolution by the board of directors of the transit district unless the legislative bodies of those constituent municipalities whose population comprises forty per cent of the population of all the constituent municipalities vote to disapprove such resolution within such ninety-day period, or unless the legislative bodies of one-third of the constituent municipalities vote to disapprove such resolution within such ninety-day period. The effective date of such resolution authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds exceeding two hundred fifty thousand dollars shall be suspended if petitions requesting a district-wide referendum on such resolution and signed by not less than ten per cent of the electors of any municipality which is a member of the transit district, or by not less than five per cent of the electors of all the municipalities which are members of the transit district, and complying with section 7-9, are filed with the clerk of any such municipalities within the sixty-day period following the publication of notice of passage. Each clerk with whom a petition is properly and timely filed shall notify the chairman or chief executive officer of the transit district in writing of the total number of electors in that municipality and the total number of such electors whose signatures appear on such a petition. Where the required number of signatures on such petition have been submitted, the chairman of the district shall designate a day and the hours of voting at such referendum, which referendum shall be held simultaneously in each member municipality, such day to be not more than fifty days after the last day to file such petitions, and not less than twenty days after notice of such referendum and a copy of such resolution are published in a newspaper or newspapers having a substantial circulation in the district. All electors in each of the municipalities which are members of the transit district shall be entitled to vote at such referendum. Such resolution shall become effective upon receiving the favorable vote of a majority of all electors voting thereon at such referendum.\n\n(c) “Annual receipts from taxation” means the receipts from taxation of all the municipalities which are members of the transit district for the fiscal year next preceding the date of issue. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 7-374, any transit district may issue bonds, provided the aggregate indebtedness of such district shall not exceed one times the annual receipts from taxation. Bonds and notes issued under the provisions of this section for the purposes of this chapter shall not be subject to section 7-374 or to any other statutory limitations on the indebtedness of any municipality which is a member of the transit district and shall not be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of any municipality which is a member of the transit district.\n\n(d) Whenever a transit district has been authorized to issue bonds as provided by this section, the board of directors of such district may authorize without public hearing the issuance of temporary notes in anticipation of the receipt of the proceeds from the sale of such bonds. Such notes shall be issued for a period of not more than four years, but notes issued for a shorter period of time may be renewed by the issue of other notes provided the period from the date of the original notes to the maturity of the last notes issued in renewal thereof shall not exceed four years, and, to the extent of the unpaid balance of federal and state grants as to which the transit district has a written commitment, notes may be renewed by the issue of other notes for such longer time pending receipt of such grant proceeds.\n\n(e) In the discretion of the board of directors, the revenue bonds of the transit district may be secured by a trust indenture between the transit district and a corporate trustee, which trustee may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company in the state. Such indenture may contain reasonable and adequate provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bond holders and may restrict their individual rights of action as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations.\n\n(f) The bonds and notes of a transit district issued pursuant to this chapter shall be lawful investments of the state and all governmental units and agencies thereof, of all banks, trust companies, savings banks, savings and loan associations, investment companies, insurance companies, insurance associations, and of all executors, administrators, guardians, trustees and other fiduciaries.\n\n(g) Bonds and notes issued under the provisions of this chapter, their transfer and the income therefrom, including any profit made on the sale thereof, shall at all times be free from taxation within the state.\n\n(h) If at any time the transit district is in default on the payment of the principal of or interest on general obligation bonds or bond anticipation notes of such transit district, the chief fiscal officer of the defaulting transit district shall set apart from the first revenues thereafter received by the transit district, from whatever source, except revenues pledged as security for other bonds or notes and those federal or state grants or loans which the grant agency restricts to uses other than debt service on the district's bonds or bond anticipation notes, an amount sufficient to pay the principal and interest due and owing on such bonds or bond anticipation notes and shall immediately apply such amount to such default.\n\n(i) If so recommended by the Commissioner of Transportation and if so authorized by resolution of the State Bond Commission, the state shall unconditionally guarantee the punctual payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds or notes of the transit district issued under the provisions of this chapter, provided the aggregate principal amount of such bonds or notes so guaranteed pursuant to this section shall not exceed fifty million dollars. Any such guarantee of bonds or notes of a transit district made pursuant to this section shall be evidenced by endorsement thereof on such bonds or notes, executed in the name of the state and on its behalf by such officer thereof as may be designated in said resolution of the State Bond Commission authorizing such guarantee. The execution of such a guarantee on any bonds or notes issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter as aforesaid shall obligate the state to pay the principal of and interest on said bonds or notes upon default in such payment by the transit district.\n\n(j) A district may issue bonds, notes or other obligations under this section, the interest on which may be includable in the gross income of the holder or holders thereof under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, or any subsequent such code. The district may issue such bonds, notes or obligations only upon finding that such issuance is necessary, in the public interest and furthers the purposes and powers of the district.\n\n(1961, P.A. 507, S. 6; 1972, P.A. 261, S. 6; P.A. 78-305, S. 2, 3, 5; P.A. 83-469, S. 4, 5; P.A. 89-211, S. 8.)\n\nHistory: 1972 act replaced all former provisions for issuing bonds with new Subsecs.
