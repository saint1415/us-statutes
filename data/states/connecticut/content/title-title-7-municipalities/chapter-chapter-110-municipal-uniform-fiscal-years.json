      "text": "(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any special act to the contrary, each municipality shall adopt the uniform fiscal year, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The legislative body of each municipality shall, by vote, determine the date upon which such municipality is to begin compliance with the uniform fiscal year, provided such date shall not be later than July 1, 1993, and each such municipality which has not begun compliance with the uniform fiscal year on or prior to July 1, 1983, shall be required to comply with the provisions of section 7-389 and each such municipality which has not begun compliance with the uniform fiscal year on or prior to July 1, 1993, shall be subject to a forfeiture as provided in subsection (b) of this section. Each such municipality shall, so far as is required of it by law, prepare a budget setting forth its anticipated cash, miscellaneous and tax receipts, and its anticipated expenditure and debt requirements for (1) a fiscal period commencing at the expiration of the fiscal year during which such vote is taken and ending on the thirtieth of June next ensuing if such vote is subsequent to the laying of the tax for such fiscal year or (2) a fiscal period commencing at the beginning of the fiscal year during which such vote was taken and ending on the thirtieth day of June next ensuing if such vote is prior to the laying of the tax for such fiscal year. Each such municipality may levy a special tax upon its last-completed grand list, which, together with receipts from other sources, including receipts from borrowing, if any, authorized under this chapter, will be sufficient to meet such appropriations, which tax shall be made due and payable on a specified date within such period. The fiscal year of each department and of each fund of each municipality shall be the same as that of the municipality.\n\n(b) Any municipality which has not begun compliance with the uniform fiscal year on or prior to July 1, 1993, shall forfeit ten per cent of the total amount of state grants-in-aid determined by statutory formula, as of the date certification of payment is required to be made to such municipality, for the fiscal year in which such municipality has failed to begin compliance with the uniform fiscal year as required by this section. Such forfeit shall be based upon the state grants-in-aid which are included in the estimate prepared by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management pursuant to section 4-71b. For each succeeding fiscal year in which such municipality is not in compliance with the requirements of this section, such municipality shall forfeit ten per cent of such state grants-in-aid. If the secretary determines that such a forfeit is required, he shall cause the certification made to the State Comptroller for each such grant-in-aid to the municipality, to reflect the amount of reduction in such grant-in-aid. The secretary may waive such forfeit if, in his opinion, there appears to be reasonable cause for the municipality not having complied with the uniform fiscal year as required by this section, provided the chief executive officer of the municipality submits a written request for such waiver. Such request shall include the reason for the failure of the municipality to comply with the requirements of this section. The secretary shall promptly consider such request and shall, within fifteen business days, notify the municipality of his decision to grant or deny a waiver of the forfeit.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 812; March, 1958, P.A. 1, S. 1; P.A. 74-299, S. 2, 4; P.A. 78-286, S. 1, 3; P.A. 83-551, S. 1, 4; P.A. 87-506, S. 5, 9; P.A. 89-370, S. 10, 15; P.A. 90-262, S. 1, 4.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 74-299 deleted former provision making July first beginning date for fiscal year optional, made adoption of July first date mandatory and imposed deadline of July 1, 1980; P.A. 78-286 changed deadline to July 1, 1985, and required those not meeting former deadline to comply with provisions of Sec. 7-389; P.A. 83-551 required that each municipality must be in compliance with uniform fiscal year not later than July 1, 1990, in lieu of July 1, 1985, as previously required and that any municipality must comply with Sec. 7-389 if not in compliance with uniform fiscal year on or prior to July 1, 1983, in lieu of July 1, 1980, as previously required; P.A. 87-506 provided that the fiscal year of each municipal fund would be the same as that of the municipality; P.A. 89-370 added provision that adoption of uniform fiscal year is required “notwithstanding the provisions of any special act to the contrary”; P.A. 90-262 required that each municipality must be in compliance with uniform fiscal year not later than July 1, 1993, in lieu of July 1, 1990, as previously required and added Subsec.
