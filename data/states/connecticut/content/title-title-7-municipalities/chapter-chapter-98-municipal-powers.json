Such ordinance shall establish procedures for disqualification which shall include notice and an opportunity for a hearing to the contractor who is the subject of the proceeding. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures for hearings on contested cases established in chapter 54. The hearing officer shall issue a written decision within ninety days of the last date of such hearing and state in the decision the reasons for the action taken and, if the contractor is being disqualified, the period of such disqualification. The existence of a cause for disqualification shall not be the sole factor to be considered in determining whether the contractor shall be disqualified. In determining whether to disqualify a contractor, the hearing officer shall consider the seriousness of the contractor's acts or omissions and any mitigating factors. The hearing officer shall send the decision to the contractor by certified mail, return receipt requested.\n\n(c) The ordinance shall provide that causes for disqualification from bidding on, applying for or participating in, contracts shall include the following:\n\n(1) Conviction or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere for or admission to commission of a criminal offense as an incident to obtaining or attempting to obtain a public or private contract or subcontract, or in the performance of such contract or subcontract;\n\n(2) Conviction or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or admission to the violation of any state or federal law for embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, receiving stolen property or any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty which affects responsibility as a municipal contractor;\n\n(3) Conviction or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or admission to a violation of any state or federal antitrust, collusion or conspiracy law arising out of the submission of bids or proposals on a public or private contract or subcontract;\n\n(4) A wilful failure to perform in accordance with the terms of one or more public contracts, agreements or transactions;\n\n(5) A history of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory performance of one or more public contracts, agreements or transactions; or\n\n(6) A wilful violation of a statutory or regulatory provision or requirement applicable to a public contract, agreement or transaction.\n\n(d) For purposes of a disqualification proceeding under an ordinance adopted under this section, conduct may be imputed as follows:\n\n(1) The fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee or other individual associated with a contractor may be imputed to the contractor when the conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of the contractor and the contractor knew of or had reason to know of such conduct. The term “other seriously improper conduct” does not include advice from an attorney, accountant or other paid consultant if it was reasonable for the contractor to rely on such advice.\n\n(2) The fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct of a contractor may be imputed to any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee or other individual associated with the contractor who participated in, knew of or had reason to know of the contractor's conduct.\n\n(3) The fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct of one contractor participating in a joint venture or similar arrangement may be imputed to other participating contractors if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the joint venture or similar arrangement and these contractors knew of or had reason to know of such conduct.\n\n(e) The municipality may reduce the period or extent of disqualification, upon the contractor's request, supported by documentation, for the following reasons:\n\n(1) Newly discovered material evidence;\n\n(2) Reversal of the conviction upon which the disqualification was based;\n\n(3) Bona fide change in ownership or management;\n\n(4) Elimination of other causes for which the disqualification was imposed; or\n\n(5) Other reasons the municipality deems appropriate.\n\n(f) The municipality may grant an exception permitting a disqualified contractor to participate in a particular contract or subcontract upon a written determination by the head of the contract awarding agency that there is good cause, in the interest of the public, for such action.\n\n(P.A. 95-353, S. 5, 7.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 95-353, S. 5, effective July 1, 1995.",

The Superior Court shall be authorized to enforce the assessments and judgments provided for under this section.\n\n(b) The chief executive officer of the town, city or borough shall appoint one or more parking violation hearing officers, other than policemen or persons who issue parking tickets or work in the police department, to conduct the hearings authorized by this section.\n\n(c) A town, city or borough may, at any time within two years from the expiration of the final period for the uncontested payment of fines, penalties, costs or fees for any alleged violation under any ordinance adopted pursuant to section 7-148 or sections 14-305 to 14-308, inclusive, send notice to the motor vehicle operator, if known, or the registered owner of the motor vehicle by first class mail at his address according to the registration records of the Department of Motor Vehicles or by electronic mail, if the operator or owner's electronic mail address is known. Such notice shall inform the operator or owner: (1) Of the allegations against him and the amount of the fines, penalties, costs or fees due; (2) that he may contest his liability before a parking violations hearing officer by delivering in person, by electronic mail or by mail written notice within ten days of the date thereof; (3) that if he does not demand such a hearing, an assessment and judgment shall enter against him; and (4) that such judgment may issue without further notice. Whenever a violation of such an ordinance occurs, proof of the registration number of the motor vehicle involved shall be prima facie evidence in all proceedings provided for in this section that the owner of such vehicle was the operator thereof; provided, the liability of a lessee under section 14-107 shall apply.\n\n(d) If the person who is sent notice pursuant to subsection (c) of this section wishes to admit liability for any alleged violation, such person may, without requesting a hearing, pay the full amount of the fines, penalties, costs or fees admitted to in person or by mail to an official designated by the town, city or borough. Such payment shall be inadmissible in any proceeding, civil or criminal, to establish the conduct of such person or other person making the payment. Any person who does not demand a hearing within ten days of the date of the first notice provided for in subsection (c) of this section shall be deemed to have admitted liability, and the designated town official shall certify such person's failure to respond to the hearing officer. The hearing officer shall thereupon enter and assess the fines, penalties, costs or fees provided for by the applicable ordinances and shall follow the procedures set forth in subsection (f) of this section.\n\n(e) Any person who requests a hearing shall be given written notice of the date, time and place for the hearing. Such hearing shall be held not less than fifteen days nor more than thirty days from the date of the mailing of notice, provided the hearing officer shall grant upon good cause shown any reasonable request by any interested party for postponement or continuance. An original or certified copy of the initial notice of violation issued by a policeman or other issuing officer shall be filed and retained by the town, city or borough, be deemed to be a business record within the scope of section 52-180 and be evidence of the facts contained therein. The presence of the policeman or issuing officer shall be required at the hearing if such person so requests. A person wishing to contest his liability shall appear at the hearing in person or by means of electronic equipment, and may present evidence in his behalf. A designated town official, other than the hearing officer, may present evidence on behalf of the town. If such person fails to appear, the hearing officer may enter an assessment by default against him upon a finding of proper notice and liability under the applicable statutes or ordinances. The hearing officer may accept from such person copies of police reports, Department of Motor Vehicles documents and other official documents by mail and may determine thereby that the appearance of such person is unnecessary. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in the order and form and with such methods of proof as he deems fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. The hearing officer shall announce his decision at the end of the hearing. If he determines that the person is not liable, he shall dismiss the matter and enter his determination in writing accordingly. If he determines that the person is liable for the violation, he shall forthwith enter and assess the fines, penalties, costs or fees against such person as provided by the applicable ordinances of that town, city or borough.\n\n(f) If such assessment is not paid on the date of its entry, the hearing officer shall send by first class mail a notice of the assessment to the person found liable and shall file, not less than thirty days or more than twelve months after such mailing, a certified copy of the notice of assessment with the clerk of a superior court facility designated by the Chief Court Administrator together with an entry fee of eight dollars. The certified copy of the notice of assessment shall constitute a record of assessment. Within such twelve-month period, assessments against the same person may be accrued and filed as one record of assessment. The clerk shall enter judgment, in the amount of such record of assessment and court costs of eight dollars, against such person in favor of the town, city or borough. Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, the hearing officer's assessment, when so entered as a judgment, shall have the effect of a civil money judgment and a levy of execution on such judgment may issue without further notice to such person.\n\n(g) A person against whom an assessment has been entered pursuant to this section is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal. An appeal shall be instituted within thirty days of the mailing of notice of such assessment by filing a petition to reopen assessment, together with an entry fee in an amount equal to the entry fee for a small claims case pursuant to section 52-259, at the Superior Court facility designated by the Chief Court Administrator, which shall entitle such person to a hearing in accordance with the rules of the judges of the Superior Court.\n\n(P.A. 81-438; P.A. 84-107; P.A. 00-191, S. 3; P.A. 02-132, S. 62; P.A. 03-278, S. 12; P.A. 07-217, S. 18; June Sp. Sess. P.A. 21-2, S. 162.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 84-107 extended the period for notification of hearing from 12 months to 2 years; (Revisor's note: In 1997 references throughout the general statutes to “Motor Vehicle(s) Commissioner” and “Motor Vehicle(s) Department” were replaced editorially by the Revisors with “Commissioner of Motor Vehicles” or “Department of Motor Vehicles”, as the case may be, for consistency with customary statutory usage); P.A. 00-191 amended Subsec. (f) by changing provision that copy of notice of assessment be filed with clerk of superior court facility designated by the Chief Court Administrator within boundaries of judicial district instead of superior court for the geographical area; P.A. 02-132 amended Subsec. (f) by deleting “within the boundaries of the judicial district in which the town, city or borough is located” and making a technical change and amended Subsec. (g) by replacing “in the superior court for the geographical area in which the town, city or borough is located” with “at the superior court facility designated by the Chief Court Administrator”; P.A. 03-278 made a technical change in Subsec. (f), effective July 9, 2003; P.A. 07-217 made technical changes in Subsec. (d), effective July 12, 2007; June Sp. Sess. P.A. 21-2 amended Subsec. (c) by permitting notice by electronic mail, Subsec. (d) by making a technical change, and Subsec. (e) by specifying that a person wishing to contest liability shall appear at the hearing in person or by means of electronic equipment.\n\nHearing officer's decision did not constitute an assessment for purposes of this section because hearing officer determined the petitioner violated a motor vehicle ordinance adopted pursuant to Sec. 14-150a, a statute not listed in Subsec. (c), and ordered the petitioner to remove the motor vehicles, as opposed to pay a monetary sum, and thus Subsec. (g) did not provide petitioner with a statutory right to appeal to the Superior Court. 198 CA 838.\n\nSubsec. (g):\n\nAlthough the parking ticket was voided by the town, the assessment remained and had independent legal significance from the parking ticket, and is appealable. 215 CA 1.",
