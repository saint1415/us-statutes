Such number shall be expressed as a percentage of the population of a town;\n\n(7) “Unemployment rate” means the average unemployment rate of a town as reported by the Labor Commissioner on the first day of July for the latest available twelve-month period;\n\n(8) “Eligibility index” is a measure of local burden determined by calculating a town's disparity in relation to all municipalities. Points shall be allocated for each of the following factors: (A) Per capita income, (B) adjusted equalized net grand list per capita, (C) equalized mill rate, (D) per capita temporary family assistance, and (E) unemployment rate. For each factor the variance shall be the difference between the first percentile and the one-hundredth percentile town factors. In calculating the eligibility index for unemployment rate, per capita temporary family assistance and equalized mill rate, the factor for the first percentile town shall be subtracted from the factor for the town and the result divided by the variance and multiplied by one hundred. In calculating the eligibility index for per capita income and adjusted equalized net grand list per capita, the factor for the first percentile town shall be subtracted from the factor for the town and the result shall be divided by the variance and multiplied by one hundred. The product of such multiplication shall then be subtracted from one hundred. The index points for all factors shall be totalled by town resulting in the overall eligibility index. The eligibility index listing shall be ranked for all towns from highest to lowest points according to need;\n\n(9) “Public investment communities” are municipalities requiring financial assistance to offset their service burdens with eligibility defined as one which is in the top quartile of the “eligibility index” scale;\n\n(10) “Grand levy” means the mill rate of the town multiplied by the net taxable grand list of the town and includes the value of special service districts if such districts contain fifty per cent or more of the value of total taxable property within the town;\n\n(11) “Population” of a town means that enumerated in the most recent federal decennial census of the population or that enumerated in the current population report series issued by the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census available on January first of the fiscal year two years prior to the fiscal year in which the eligibility index is prepared pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, whichever is most recent, except that for any town whose enumerated population residing in state or federal institutions within such town and attributed to such town by the census exceeds forty per cent of the population of such town, “population” shall not include persons who are incarcerated or in custodial situations, including, but not limited to, jails, prisons, hospitals or training schools or persons who reside in dormitory facilities in schools, colleges, universities or military bases.\n\n(b) On or before July 15, 1994, and annually thereafter, the secretary shall prepare the eligibility index for Connecticut municipalities. A municipality shall continue to be a public investment community for the fiscal year in which such municipality is not included in the top quartile of the eligibility index scale and for the following four fiscal years.\n\n(P.A. 92-213, S. 1, 5; May Sp.
