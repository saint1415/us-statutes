Any city or borough not consolidated with the town in which it is located and any town containing such a city or borough shall share the allocation to such town on the basis of the following ratio: The total taxes levied in the previous fiscal year by such town, city or borough shall be the numerator of the fraction. The total taxes levied by the town and all cities or boroughs located within such town shall be added together, and the sum shall be the denominator of the fraction. Any such city or borough may, by vote of its legislative body, direct the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management to reallocate all or a portion of the share of such city or borough to the town in which it is located.\n\n(P.A. 87-584, S. 3, 18; P.A. 96-237, S. 1, 3; P.A. 97-274, S. 3, 7.)\n\nHistory: (Revisor's note: In 1997 the Revisors editorially inserted the word “Trust” in the phrase “Local Property Tax Relief Trust Fund” in Subsec.
