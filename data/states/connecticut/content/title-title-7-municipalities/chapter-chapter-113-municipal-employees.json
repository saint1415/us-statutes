Statute serves a public purpose and is constitutional despite its conferring a direct benefit on a certain class of individuals. 168 C. 84. Cited. 177 C. 456. Statute is neither a workers' compensation law nor occupational disease law within meaning of insurance contract. 178 C. 664. Workers' compensation statutes are not the exclusive remedy for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment where injuries claimed are compensable under this statute. 193 C. 59. Benefits under statute may be taken into account in determining maximum amount payable from pension plan; history and interpretation discussed. 194 C. 139. Purpose not to remove benefits from realm of arm's-length collective bargaining but merely to ensure that they are provided for members of police and fire departments. 201 C. 577. Cited. 204 C. 563; 207 C. 665. Does not require payment of benefits to estate of a deceased recipient. 208 C. 576. Use of words “hypertensive” and “heart disease” on claim form sufficient to invoke award under section. 210 C. 423. Does not preclude award of special benefits under Sec. 31-308. 214 C. 181. Cited. Id., 189. Economic benefits qualified as “compensation” under section may include fringe benefits in certain circumstances. Id., 394. Cited. Id., 552; 217 C. 50; 220 C. 721; 222 C. 62; 224 C. 441; 231 C. 287. Benefits awarded under section are subject to review and modification procedures set forth in the Workers' Compensation Act. 252 C. 708. City employer's right to intervene in employee's negligence action against physician is incorporated into section pursuant to Sec. 31-293. 253 C. 429. Benefits paid under section are special compensation and not workers' compensation for purposes of reimbursement from Special Injury Fund pursuant to Sec. 31-306(a)(2)(A) and such a result does not deny employers a protected property interest without due process of law. 269 C. 763. Town constable was not regular member of a paid municipal police department for purposes of receiving benefits under Heart and Hypertension Act. 275 C. 246. Parties' mistake of law regarding applicability of section to their agreements was inaccurate but reasonable, and therefore agreements may not be opened. 296 C. 352. For purposes of determining limitation period under Sec. 31-294c, hypertension claim was properly treated as one for an accidental injury definitely located in time and place, rather than a repetitive trauma injury, because plaintiff failed to present evidence that hypertension was causally connected to employment; formal diagnosis of hypertension or heart disease, communicated to an employee by his or her physician, constitutes the “injury” that triggers the running of the limitation period of Sec. 31-294c. 299 C. 265. Evidence that claimant had elevated blood pressure readings, or had been advised by physician to monitor blood pressure, is insufficient to trigger one year filing period under Sec. 31-294c, rather there must be evidence that claimant knew he or she suffered from hypertension, ordinarily shown by proof claimant was informed of diagnosis by a medical professional. 302 C. 755. Hypertension diagnosis is sufficient to trigger one year filing period under Sec. 31-294c and prescription of hypertension medication is not required. Id., 767. Medical care exception in Sec. 31-294c does not apply to toll statute of limitations under this section because plaintiff failed to establish that employer previously furnished medical care for specific condition or later claimed condition was causally related to timely reported incident for which employer furnished medical care. 304 C. 571. Section's use of disjunctive “hypertension or heart disease” permits plaintiff to file a claim for benefits related to either hypertension or heart disease, and failure to timely file claim for benefits related to hypertension does not bar later timely claim for heart disease. 323 C. 607. NeitherMorgan v. East Haven, 208 C. 576, nor any other legal authority barred the substitution of executrix as party claimant to the extent executrix sought payment of matured benefits; under section, matured benefits that accrued during claimant's lifetime properly pass to claimant's estate. 331 C. 672. A claim for heart disease that occurred after an initial compensable claim for hypertension under section may qualify for benefits without the need to file a new notice of claim as long as there is a causal connection between the two injuries. 334 C. 857.\n\nPension benefits payable under the city's ordinances must be reduced by benefits awarded under statute. 1 CA 58. Purpose of statute is to protect firemen and policemen from economic loss; measure of the loss must be determined by extent to which claimant is precluded from rejoining work force in his former capacity or any other reasonable occupation due to his disability. 2 CA 255. Benefits not retroactively applied; also not applicable to those no longer in active service, either on or off duty. 4 CA 226. Cited. 6 CA 265; 7 CA 142; 12 CA 138. No requirement than an appointment be “permanent”. 13 CA 566. Cited. 17 CA 633; 21 CA 28; 26 CA 194. In order to be eligible for any benefits for either hypertension or heart disease, plaintiff must have successfully passed a preemployment physical showing no evidence of either hypertension or heart disease. 28 CA 754. Cited. 34 CA 307; 37 CA 835. Without evidence establishing claimant's injury is result of an occupational disease, 1-year statute of limitations applies. 38 CA 1. Cited. 43 CA 773. Language of statute clearly and unambiguously mandates that for claimant to be foreclosed from the benefits of the statute, results of the preemployment physical examination must contain evidence of hypertension or heart disease. 56 CA 235. Board incorrectly interpreted Sec. 31-284b as requiring city to continue insurance coverage for plaintiff and his family once plaintiff's compensation payments under section ended. 61 CA 9. Section demonstrates clear policy of creating additional benefits for certain classes of disabled municipal employees. 66 CA 105. Member of municipal fire or police department hired before July 1, 1996, may elect to be covered under either this section or Ch. 568; statute not intended to provide its beneficiaries with dual dollar benefits, but to eliminate two of the basic requirements for coverage under Workers' Compensation Act, i.e. the causal connection between hypertension and heart disease and the employment and requirement that the illness was suffered during the course of employment. 70 CA 321. The legislative history underlying the General Assembly's replacement of the rebuttable presumption with a conclusive presumption in 1996 reveals that the General Assembly intended for all police officers and firefighters hired prior to July 1, 1996, to be grandfathered in, in an effort to balance the financial concerns of municipalities with the expectations of those police officers and firefighters already employed. 190 CA 398. A claimant who forgoes filing a claim within one year of being informed by a medical professional that he or she has a heart disease and who later files a claim for a different heart disease is precluded from receiving benefits under section. Id., 718. The definition of “member” in Sec. 7-425(5) is inapplicable to section because applying that definition would reserve eligibility for heart and hypertension benefits solely for full-time firefighters, which is inconsistent with the plain language of the section and the clear intent of the legislature. 206 CA 223. Plaintiff's employment as chief of police did not constitute a new hire date since there was no break in employment with the police department; there is no language in the section to suggest that heart and hypertension benefits are not available to claimants who continue to serve as regular members of the police department while also receiving pension benefits for prior service with the same employer. 218 CA 720.\n\nPlaintiff not required to assume burden of proving compensability under Ch. 568 where he brought action under both Ch. 568 and this statute. 38 CS 359. Town must have organized police department under Sec. 7-274 in order for this statute to be operative. Id., 419. Cited. 39 CS 321. Claims under statute are subject to procedural requirements of Workers' Compensation Act. Id., 403.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nDefinition of word “member” in Sec. 7-425(5) applies to use of such word in phrase “a uniformed member of a paid municipal fire department” in Subsec. 346 C. 711.\n\nBenefits may not be awarded concurrently. 57 CA 472.",

The retirement allowance provided under this subsection shall be reduced by the amount of any retirement allowance concurrently payable under the provisions of section 7-431, and by the amount of any retirement allowance concurrently payable by the state employees' retirement system or the retirement system of any municipality not participating under the provisions of this part, on account of a period of service for which credit has been transferred to the Municipal Employees' Retirement Fund under the provisions of section 7-442b, or the monthly equivalent thereof if payable other than monthly. No retirement allowances under this section, before the reduction prescribed in the preceding sentence plus workers' compensation payments and benefits under the Old Age and Survivors Insurance System on account of service in a participating municipality, if any, shall exceed one-twelfth of the member's average annual pay during the three highest-paid years of municipal service, and, subject to the foregoing maximum limit, no such allowance plus payments shall be less than one thousand dollars annually.\n\n(e) Additional cost of living allowances for certain retirees. Each employee or spouse of a deceased employee retired under the Municipal Employees' Retirement Act Fund B prior to July 1, 1971, shall be entitled, in addition to his or her original monthly retirement allowance, to an additional cost of living monthly allowance computed on the basis of his or her monthly retirement allowance, less any prior cost of living increases to which he or she was previously entitled, using the table in subdivision (1) of this subsection.\n\n(1) Such cost of living allowances shall commence on July 1, 1973, and shall be computed at the rates set forth in the following table:\n\nFiscal YearOf Retirement YearEnding June 30thRates %Of Increase194940.0195042.7195141.2195233.9195330.9195430.4195530.0195630.4195728.3195824.8195921.9196021.1196119.5196218.1196316.8196415.1196514.6196614.1196712.919686.019694.019704.019714.0\n\n(2) The limitation of the maximum retirement allowance provided in subsection (a) of this section shall not be applicable to increases under this subsection.\n\n(f) Part-time employees. For purposes of determining eligibility for retirement benefits for part-time employees under this section, a member's part-time service shall be payable to a member whose service consists solely of part-time service without variation in the number of hours worked during all periods of his municipal service, such member's service shall be treated as full-time service. For purposes of computing the retirement benefit payable to a member whose service consists of part-time and full-time service or whose service consists of part-time service rendered in different proportions to a full-time schedule, such member's years of service and average salary shall be proportionately adjusted to produce a retirement benefit equivalent to that payable if his service had been rendered at an unvarying rate. As used in this subsection, “part-time service” means service by a member who customarily works less than a full-time schedule but no less than twenty hours per week.\n\n(g) Certain members not covered by Social Security who satisfy additional age and service requirements. (1) The provisions of this subsection shall apply only to members of the municipal employees' retirement system who (A) are not covered by the Old Age and Survivors Insurance System, and (B) retire on or after July 1, 2025, after (i) attaining the age of sixty years and completing at least thirty years of aggregate service, or (ii) attaining the age of fifty-five years and completing at least twenty-seven years of active service as a member of a paid municipal fire department or as a regular member of a paid municipal police department.\n\n(2) The monthly allowance for each such member shall be equal to the sum of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this subdivision as follows: (A) One-twelfth of two per cent of such member's average annual pay for the three highest-paid years of service, multiplied by three hundred sixty or, for a member of a municipal fire or police department, by three hundred twenty-four; and (B) one-twelfth of two and two-tenths per cent of such member's average annual pay for the three highest-paid years of service, multiplied by the number of months of the member's aggregate service in excess of three hundred sixty or, for a member of a municipal fire or police department, in excess of three hundred twenty-four.\n\n(h) Certain members covered by Social Security who satisfy additional age and service requirements. (1) The provisions of this subsection shall apply only to members of the municipal employees' retirement system who (A) are covered by the Old Age and Survivors Insurance System, and (B) retire on or after July 1, 2025, after (i) attaining the age of sixty years and completing at least thirty years of aggregate service, or (ii) attaining the age of fifty-five years and completing at least twenty-seven years of active service as a member of a paid municipal fire department or as a regular member of a paid municipal police department.\n\n(2) For a member who retires before attaining the age at which such member first becomes eligible to receive Social Security benefits and who has not qualified for a Social Security disability award, the monthly allowance for each such member until such member attains such age or qualifies for a Social Security disability award, if earlier, shall be equal to the sum of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this subdivision as follows: (A) One-twelfth of two per cent of such member's average annual pay for the three highest-paid years of service, multiplied by three hundred sixty or, for a member of a municipal fire or police department, by three hundred twenty-four; and (B) one-twelfth of two and two-tenths per cent of such member's average annual pay for the three highest-paid years of service, multiplied by the number of months of the member's aggregate service in excess of three hundred sixty or, for a member of a municipal fire or police department, in excess of three hundred twenty-four.\n\n(3) For a member who attains the age at which such member first becomes eligible to receive Social Security benefits or qualifies for a Social Security disability award, if earlier, the monthly allowance for each such member shall be equal to the sum of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this subdivision as follows: (A) One-twelfth of one and one-half per cent of such member's average annual pay for the three highest-paid years of service up to the breakpoint for the year in which such member separated from service, plus one-twelfth of two per cent of such member's average annual pay for the three highest-paid years of service in excess of the breakpoint for the year in which such member separated from service, multiplied by three hundred sixty or, for a member of a municipal fire or police department, by three hundred twenty-four; and (B) one-twelfth of one and seven-tenths per cent of such member's average annual pay for the three highest-paid years of service up to the breakpoint for the year in which such member separated from service, plus one-twelfth of two and two-tenths per cent of such member's average annual pay for the three highest-paid years of service in excess of the breakpoint for the year in which such member separated from service, multiplied by the number of months of the member's aggregate service in excess of three hundred sixty or, for a member of a municipal fire or police department, in excess of three hundred twenty-four.\n\n(1957, P.A. 447, S. 7; 1959, P.A. 316; 471, S. 2; 1967, P.A. 547, S. 1; 722, S. 1; 1969, P.A. 406; 1971, P.A. 644, S. 2; P.A. 73-619, S. 1, 3; P.A. 75-293, S. 5; P.A. 76-314; P.A. 77-102, S. 1, 2; P.A. 79-376, S. 14; P.A. 84-106, S. 3; P.A. 86-243, S. 1, 10; P.A. 93-356, S. 6; P.A. 01-80, S. 3; P.A. 07-217, S. 27; P.A. 23-182, S. 2.)\n\nHistory: 1959 acts provided for computation of retirement benefits on basis of five highest-paid years of municipal service rather than five years immediately preceding retirement and included benefits under old age and survivors insurance system in restriction on maximum allowance payable; 1967 acts based calculations on three highest-paid years rather than five highest-paid years and added provision concerning benefits for fund B members retired before January 1, 1960; 1969 act deleted provisions concerning temporary retirement allowances; 1971 act simplified description of formula; P.A. 73-619 added Subsecs.

A member who has been married at least one year shall be presumed to have elected the option provided in subdivision (1) of this subsection unless a contrary election is made by the member. All other members will be presumed to elect the option provided in subdivision (4) of this subsection unless a contrary election is made by the member. Any election or change of election must be filed before retirement income payments begin. Any election of the options provided in subdivision (2), if, under said subdivision the member's spouse is not named as contingent annuitant, subdivision (3) or subdivision (4) of this subsection by a member who has been married at least one year shall not be effective unless the member's spouse consents in writing to the election and such written consent acknowledges the effect of the election and is witnessed by a representative of the municipality or a notary public; or unless it is established to the satisfaction of the Retirement Commission that such consent cannot be obtained because the spouse cannot be located or due to such other circumstances as the commission may prescribe by regulations adopted in accordance with chapter 54. Any such consent or determination that consent cannot be obtained shall be effective only with respect to the spouse who has given such consent or from whom consent cannot be obtained. No option shall be effective until a member has retired, and in the event a member dies prior to the effective date of commencement of benefits, any election of an option shall be deemed cancelled except as provided in subsection (d) of this section. Any reduced retirement allowance under this subsection shall be in such amount as the Retirement Commission determines to be the actuarial equivalent of the retirement allowance that would have been payable had the election not been made. The retirement income options are as follows:\n\n(1) A reduced amount payable to the member for his lifetime, with the provision that after his death his spouse, if surviving, shall be entitled to receive a lifetime income equal to fifty per cent of the reduced monthly amount payable to the member;\n\n(2) A reduced amount payable to the member for his lifetime, with the provision that after his death, his contingent annuitant shall be entitled to receive a lifetime income equal to either fifty or one hundred per cent of the reduced amount payable to the member;\n\n(3) A reduced amount payable to the member for his lifetime, with the provision that if he shall die within either a ten or twenty-year period following the date his retirement income commences, whichever is selected by the member, the reduced amount continues to his contingent annuitant for the balance of the ten or twenty-year period; or\n\n(4) An amount payable to the member for his lifetime, with no payments continuing after the member's death, except for a lump sum death benefit as provided in section 7-440.\n\n(b) If a member who is continuing to accrue municipal service or who is on a leave authorized by the municipality, dies on or after July 1, 1985, and (1) after completion of the age and service requirements for retirement under section 7-428, 7-431 or 7-432 or, (2) after completing twenty-five years of service, his spouse, provided they are lawfully married at the time of the member's death and have been lawfully married for at least twelve months preceding his death, shall receive a lifetime income in an amount equal to fifty per cent of the average of the retirement income that the member would have been entitled to if he had retired the day he died had his benefits been paid under the option specified in subdivision (4) of subsection (a) of this section and the retirement income that the member would have been entitled to if he had retired the day he died and had his benefit been paid under the option specified in subdivision (1) of said subsection. The spouse's eligibility for such benefits shall commence from the day next following the member's date of death. If such member was not eligible to retire at the time of his death, such benefit shall be calculated as if he had reached age fifty-five, but based on his service and final average earnings at his date of death.\n\n(c) If a member who has terminated with at least twenty-five years of service or retired pursuant to section 7-428, 7-431 or 7-432, but whose benefits in either event are not yet being paid, dies prior to the commencing date of his benefits, his spouse, provided they have been lawfully married for at least the twelve months preceding his death, shall receive a lifetime income equal to fifty per cent of the average of the retirement income that the member would have been entitled to if his benefits had commenced the date he died had his benefit been paid under the option specified in subdivision (4) of subsection (a) of this section and the retirement income that the member would have been entitled to with such benefits being paid under the option specified in subdivision (1) of said subsection. If such member was not eligible to retire at the time of his death, such benefit shall be calculated as if he had reached age fifty-five. The spouse's eligibility for such benefits shall commence from the day next following the member's date of death.\n\n(d) On and after July 1, 1986, if a member who has completed the age and service requirements for retirement under section 7-428, 7-431 or 7-432, and who has elected to receive his retirement benefits under subdivision (2) or (3) of subsection (a) of this section, dies prior to the effective date of commencement of benefits but within ninety days after he first elects to receive his retirement benefits under subdivision (2) or (3) of said subsection (a), then his beneficiary or contingent annuitant shall receive an income in an amount equal to the benefit that would have been payable to the survivor had the member retired the day he died and had his benefit been paid under the option he had elected at the time of his death. This subsection shall not apply after ninety days after the date the member first elects to receive his benefit under subdivision (2) or (3) of subsection (a) of this section.

      "text": "(a) For purposes of this section:\n\n(1) “General obligation” means an obligation issued by a municipality and secured by the full faith and credit and taxing power of such municipality;\n\n(2) “Municipal employees' retirement system pension funding bond” means an obligation issued by a municipality to fund, in whole or in part, an outstanding unfunded accrued liability to the system;\n\n(3) “Obligation” means any bond or any other transaction which constitutes debt in accordance with both municipal reporting standards in section 7-394a and the regulations prescribing municipal financing reporting adopted by the secretary pursuant to section 7-394a;\n\n(4) “Unfunded accrued liability to the system” means the amount necessary for the payment of future pensions based upon the service of members rendered prior to their becoming members of the system, less any amount transferred to the fund from any other retirement fund on account of such members, as determined by the Retirement Commission upon sound actuarial principles consistently applied; and\n\n(5) “Weighted average maturity” means (A) the sum of the products, determined separately for each maturity or sinking fund payment date and taking into account any mandatory redemptions of the obligation, of (i) with respect to a serial obligation, the principal amount of each serial maturity of such obligation and the number of years to such maturity, or (ii) with respect to a term obligation, the dollar amount of each mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to such obligation and the number of years to such payment, divided by (B) the aggregate principal amount of such obligation.\n\n(b) Each participating municipality shall be liable to the fund for an amount determined by the Retirement Commission on sound actuarial principles to be necessary for the payment of future pensions based upon the service of members rendered prior to their becoming members, less any amount transferred to the fund from any other retirement fund on account of such members, and for any increases in future benefits provided by amendments to this chapter to the extent that such increases are based on service prior to the effective date of such amendments; and in the case of a transfer of service credit between two participating municipalities under the provisions of section 7-442a where an increase in benefits results, the municipality to which the employee is transferred shall be liable to the fund for an amount so determined to be necessary for the payment of the increase in future pensions, based upon the service of the transferred member rendered subsequent to the commencement of his membership and prior to the effective date of transfer. The municipality shall pay annually to the Retirement Commission to be credited to the fund such amounts fixed by said commission as shall discharge such liability over a period not exceeding thirty years from the earliest effective date of participation as to any department in the Connecticut Municipal Employees' Retirement Fund, or a period not exceeding twenty years from the date of such transfer or increase in benefits, or entrance of a member into membership, whichever period shall be longer, except that the Retirement Commission may approve one consolidated amortized payment for the discharge of two or more separate liabilities running for different periods, such payments to be made over a period terminating not later than the latest date prescribed for the discharge of any one of such liabilities.\n\n(c) All participating municipalities shall pay monthly to the Retirement Commission to be credited to the fund such proportion of the pay of all members employed by such municipality as is determined from time to time by the Retirement Commission on sound actuarial principles to be necessary in addition to the contributions by members to provide future pensions based on service rendered by members subsequent to the effective date of participation as defined in section 7-427 other than the excess pensions referred to in subsection (b) of this section. In the case of members serving with the armed forces of the United States in time of war or hostilities or national emergency, whether declared or undeclared, or any acts incident thereto, as provided in section 7-434, the municipality shall forward to the Retirement Commission to be credited to the fund a like contribution based on the pay of such member at the time of entering such service, in addition to paying the member's contribution as provided in section 7-440. If such member is not reemployed within six months following the termination of such service, unless this period is further extended by reason of disability incurred in such service, the municipality shall be entitled to receive from the fund, on application to the Retirement Commission, the amount of such contributions. If the Retirement Commission should find that the payments made to it under this subsection by any municipality have been more than sufficient because such municipality has elected to provide Social Security coverage for its employees, the commission, using sound actuarial principles, shall determine a refund, or a credit which shall be applied to the payments required of the same municipality under subsection (b) of this section in a manner to be determined by the commission.\n\n(d) All municipalities shall contribute on account of retirement allowances for disability an additional proportion of the pay of members employed in such municipality to be determined by the Retirement Commission upon sound actuarial principles.\n\n(e) Each municipality shall also pay to the Retirement Commission annually a proportionate share of the cost of the administration of the fund or funds in which it participates, as determined by the commission on the basis of the number of members employed by such municipality and the number of members retired from employment with such municipality, or their beneficiaries, who are currently receiving benefits from the retirement system established by this part.\n\n(f) The rates of contribution provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section shall be varied among policemen and firemen in fund B participating in the Old Age and Survivors Insurance System, other members of fund B so participating, policemen and firemen in fund B not so participating and other members of fund B not so participating, but each rate shall be uniform within each such class.\n\n(g) If any payment due under this section is not paid within two months from the date when due, interest shall be added to such payment at the prevailing rate of interest as determined by the Retirement Commission. Such interest shall be paid by the municipality.\n\n(h) A municipality shall pay annually to the Retirement Commission, to be credited to fund B, such amounts fixed by the commission as shall discharge said municipality's liabilities for its contributions under this subsection and section 7-436 over a period not exceeding twenty years, provided no such payments shall be due until July 1, 1974.\n\n(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of the general statutes, any special act, charter, special act charter, home-rule ordinance, local ordinance or local law governing the authorization and issuance of bonds, notes or other obligations and the appropriation of the proceeds thereof, a municipality participating in the system that has an unfunded accrued liability to the system as of July 1, 2017, may authorize and issue municipal employees' retirement system pension funding bonds to fund all or a portion of such municipality's outstanding unfunded accrued liability to the system, as determined by the Retirement Commission upon sound actuarial principles consistently applied, and the payment of costs related to the issuance of such bonds, in accordance with the following requirements:\n\n(1) The municipality shall, not later than thirty days prior to the issuance of municipal employees' retirement system pension funding bonds, notify the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, State Treasurer and Retirement Commission of such municipality's intent to issue such bonds, and include with such notice (A) the amount of the outstanding unfunded accrued liability to the system based on the existing schedule of pension amortization payments, as determined by the Retirement Commission based on sound actuarial principles consistently applied; (B) the amount of any remaining annual pension amortization payments scheduled for payment by the municipality for the portion of the outstanding unfunded accrued liability to the system that will not be defrayed by such bonds; (C) a comparison of the anticipated effects of funding the outstanding unfunded accrued liability to the system through the issuance of such bonds with the funding of such liability through the annual payments scheduled for payment as determined by the Retirement Commission pursuant to subsection (b) of this section; (D) documentation of the municipality's authorization of the issuance of such bonds, including, but not limited to, a certified copy of the resolution or ordinance of the municipality authorizing the issuance of such bonds and the opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel as to the due authorization of the issuance of such bonds; and (E) other information and documentation required or requested by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, State Treasurer or Retirement Commission to carry out the provisions of this section; and\n\n(2) Not later than ten days after the sale of such bonds, the municipality shall provide the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, State Treasurer and Retirement Commission with a final financing summary. Such final financing summary shall include, but not be limited to, (A) the final official statement, if any, with respect to the issuance of such bonds, and (B) a comparison of the anticipated effects of funding the outstanding unfunded accrued liability to the system through the issuance of such bonds with the funding of such liability through the annual payments scheduled for payment, as determined by the Retirement Commission pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(j) Except as otherwise provided by this section, the provisions of this chapter apply to any municipal employees' retirement system pension funding bonds issued pursuant to this section. Such bonds shall be general obligations of the municipality, and shall be serial bonds maturing in annual or semiannual installments of principal or term bonds with mandatory annual or semiannual deposits of sinking fund payments into a sinking fund. Notwithstanding the provisions of the general statutes, any special act, charter, special act charter, home-rule ordinance, local ordinance or local law, (1) the first installment of any series of such bonds shall mature or the first sinking fund payment of any series of such bonds shall be due not later than eighteen months from the date of issuance of such series, and the last installment of any series of such bonds shall mature or the last sinking fund payment of any series of such bonds shall be due not later than thirty years from the date of issuance of such series; (2) any such bonds may be sold at public sale on sealed proposal, by negotiation or private placement in such manner and at such price or prices, at such time or times and on such terms or conditions as the municipality or the officers or board of the municipality delegated the authority to issue such bonds, determines to be in the best interest of the municipality; and (3) no municipality shall issue temporary notes in anticipation of the receipt of proceeds from the sale of such bonds.\n\n(k) Proceeds of municipal employees' retirement system pension funding bonds, to the extent not applied to the payment of costs related to the issuance thereof, shall be paid to the Retirement Commission, not later than thirty days after the date of issuance of such bonds, to fund all or a portion of the outstanding unfunded accrued liability to the system for which such bonds were issued.\n\n(l) A municipality may, pursuant to section 7-370c, authorize and issue refunding bonds to pay, fund or refund prior to maturity any municipal employees' retirement system pension funding bonds, provided, notwithstanding the provisions of section 7-370c, the weighted average maturity of such refunding bonds shall not exceed the weighted average maturity of the municipal employees' retirement system pension funding bonds being paid, funded or refunded by such refunding bonds. The municipality shall notify the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, State Treasurer and Retirement Commission of such municipality's intention to issue refunding bonds pursuant to this subsection not less than ten days prior to the issuance of such bonds, and shall provide said Secretary, State Treasurer and Retirement Commission with copies of the final official statement, if any, prepared for such bonds not later than ten days after the issuance of such bonds.\n\n(m) The Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, in consultation with the State Treasurer, may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to establish guidelines concerning compliance by municipalities with the provisions of this section.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 895; 1957, P.A. 447, S. 10; September, 1957, P.A. 10, S. 2; 1959, P.A. 320; 1967, P.A. 398; 1969, P.A. 277; 283; 407, S. 1, 2; P.A. 73-232, S. 1, 2; 73-234; 73-619, S. 2, 3; P.A. 75-29; P.A. 87-269, S. 1, 3; P.A. 93-356, S. 11; P.A. 17-107, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: 1959 act changed the phrase at the end of Subsec.

If the town, city or borough has twenty or more employees, the terms of any such plan shall entitle any employee who has attained the age of sixty-five and any employee's spouse who has attained the age of sixty-five to group hospital, surgical or medical insurance coverage under the same conditions as any covered employee or spouse who is under the age of sixty-five.\n\n(c) A self-insured town, city or borough that provides group health benefits for its employees has a lien on that part of a judgment or settlement that represents payment for economic loss for medical, hospital and prescription expenses incurred by its employees and their covered dependents and family members when such expenses result from the negligence or recklessness of a third party. The self-insured town, city or borough may recover such paid health benefits from any tortfeasor recovery but only upon the following terms and conditions:\n\n(1) In no event shall any commercial insurance company which provides health insurance benefits to the employees of a town, city or borough and their covered dependents and family members, including, but not limited to, stop loss insurance beyond a municipal self-funded medical expense amount, be entitled to any reimbursement from a tortfeasor recovery. The provisions of this subsection shall be construed to only permit a self-insured town, city or borough to recover medical expenses paid from its own revenues. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to permit a self-insured town, city or borough to recover medical expenses paid from an insured plan, whether insured in whole or in part.\n\n(2) No lien shall exist against any tortfeasor recovery when the self-insured town, city or borough paid an amount equal to or less than fifteen thousand dollars for medical, hospital and prescription expenses incurred by its employee, covered dependent or family member.\n\n(3) Any lien permitted under this subsection shall be limited to that portion of any settlement or judgment that represents payment for economic loss for medical, hospital and prescription expenses paid as of the time of settlement or judgment, and reduced as set forth in subdivision (4) of this subsection.\n\n(4) The lien shall be reduced by:\n\n(A) Any percentage of comparative negligence attributed to the employee under section 52-572h;\n\n(B) The percentage ratio that the employee's legal fees and costs bear to the total judgment or settlement recovered; and\n\n(C) Application of equitable defenses to the lien amount claimed including, but not limited to, the make whole doctrine and unjust enrichment. If agreement cannot be reached on the application of equitable defenses to the claimed lien amount, then either the employee, covered dependent, family member or the self-insured town, city or borough may petition the Superior Court for resolution on the application of equitable defenses. Any such petition to the Superior Court shall be heard by a judge of the Superior Court and shall be privileged for a hearing assignment and any such hearing shall be held not later than thirty days after the date of filing the application.\n\n(5) The lien shall be effective when written notice of the lien is provided to the employee or his or her attorney but only if written notice of the lien is provided prior to any settlement or the entry of judgment. Written notice shall be deemed effective if the group health plan coverage booklet provided to the employee, covered dependent or family member contains clear language in conspicuous boldface font that the employee, covered dependent or family member shall reimburse the self-insured town, city or borough from any tortfeasor recovery for medical, hospital and prescription expenses paid due to the negligence of a third party as limited by the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(6) Upon written request from the employee, covered dependent family member or such individual's attorney after settlement or the entry of judgment, the self-insured town, city or borough shall have thirty days to provide the employee or his or her attorney with the total amount of the lien claimed.

      "text": "(a) Any town, city or borough, notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law, general, special or local, shall pay on behalf of any employee of such municipality, except firemen covered under the provisions of section 7-308, and on behalf of any member from such municipality of a local emergency planning district, appointed pursuant to section 22a-601, all sums which such employee becomes obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon such employee by law for damages awarded for infringement of any person's civil rights or for physical damages to person or property, except as set forth in this section, if the employee, at the time of the occurrence, accident, physical injury or damages complained of, was acting in the performance of his duties and within the scope of his employment, and if such occurrence, accident, physical injury or damage was not the result of any wilful or wanton act of such employee in the discharge of such duty. This section shall not apply to physical injury to a person caused by an employee to a fellow employee while both employees are engaged in the scope of their employment for such municipality if the employee suffering such injury or, in the case of his death, his dependent, has a right to benefits or compensation under chapter 568 by reason of such injury. If an employee or, in the case of his death, his dependent, has a right to benefits or compensation under chapter 568 by reason of injury or death caused by the negligence or wrong of a fellow employee while both employees are engaged in the scope of their employment for such municipality, such employee or, in the case of his death, his dependent, shall have no cause of action against such fellow employee to recover damages for such injury or death unless such wrong was wilful and malicious or the action is based on the fellow employee's negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle, as defined in section 14-1. This section shall not apply to libel or slander proceedings brought against any such employee and, in such cases, there is no assumption of liability by any town, city or borough. Any employee of such municipality, although excused from official duty at the time, for the purposes of this section shall be deemed to be acting in the discharge of duty when engaged in the immediate and actual performance of a public duty imposed by law. Such municipality may arrange for and maintain appropriate insurance or may elect to act as a self-insurer to maintain such protection. No action for personal physical injuries or damages to real or personal property shall be maintained against such municipality and employee jointly unless such action is commenced within two years after the cause of action therefor arose and written notice of the intention to commence such action and of the time when and the place where the damages were incurred or sustained has been filed with the clerk of such municipality within six months after such cause of action has accrued. Governmental immunity shall not be a defense in any action brought under this section. In any such action the municipality and the employee may be represented by the same attorney. As used in this section, “employee” includes (1) a member of a town board of education and any teacher, including a student teacher doing practice teaching under the direction of such a teacher, or other person employed by such board, and (2) a member of the local emergency planning committee from such municipality appointed pursuant to section 22a-601. Nothing in this section shall be construed to abrogate the right of any person, board or commission which may accrue under section 10-235.\n\n(b) Each town, city or borough which has joined with other towns, cities or boroughs to form a district department of health, pursuant to chapter 368f, or a regional council of governments, pursuant to section 4-124j, shall jointly assume the liability imposed upon any officer, agent or employee of such district department of health or such regional council of governments, acting in the performance of his duties and in the scope of his employment, under, and in the manner and in accordance with the procedures set forth in, subsection (a) of this section. Such joint assumption of liability shall be proportionately shared by the towns, cities and boroughs in such district or regional council of governments, on the same basis that the expenses of such district are shared as determined under section 19a-243.\n\n(1957, P.A. 401, S. 1; 1959, P.A. 651, S. 1; 1961, P.A. 375; 1963, P.A. 97; February, 1965, P.A. 277; 1971, P.A. 226, S. 1; P.A. 73-610; P.A. 75-408, S. 3; P.A. 77-502, S. 1; P.A. 81-229, S. 2; P.A. 82-472, S. 20, 183; P.A. 85-521, S. 1; P.A. 89-212, S. 12; P.A. 03-278, S. 19; P.A. 13-247, S. 273; P.A. 15-85, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: 1959 act added qualifying word “physical” before “damages” and “injury,” added exception for libel and slander and reduced time for filing notice from 6 months to 60 days; 1961 act incorporated provisions re case where injured person is an employee injured by fellow employee and restored notice period to 6 months; 1963 act removed waiting period of 30 days after notice to municipality before action could be commenced and deleted provision for notice to employee as well as to municipality; 1965 act added provisions concerning representation of municipality and employee by same attorney; 1971 act required that action must be brought within two years rather than one year and required that notice be written, effective October 1, 1971, and applicable to injuries first sustained on and after said date; P.A. 73-610 defined “employee” and protected rights of persons, boards and commissions under Sec. 10-235; P.A. 75-408 included awards for infringement of civil rights; P.A. 77-502 added Subsec.

(a) to require assumption of liability for members of local emergency planning districts; P.A. 03-278 replaced “verdict” with “final judgment” and made technical changes in Subsec. (a), effective July 9, 2003; P.A. 13-247 amended Subsec. (b) by substituting “council of governments” for “planning agency”, replacing reference to Ch. 127 with reference to Sec. 4-124j and deleting “or such regional planning agency as determined under section 8-34a”, effective January 1, 2015; P.A. 15-85 amended Subsec. (a) by deleting provision re municipality to file a statement with the court if the municipality and municipal employee are represented by the same attorney as defendants in a civil action.\n\nSee Sec. 7-101a re indemnification of municipal officers and employees.\n\nSee Sec. 10-235 re indemnification of school personnel.\n\nSee Sec. 52-557n re liability of an employee, officer or agent of a political subdivision of the state.\n\nA complaint brought under section should be in two counts, one alleging facts essential to legal liability of employee, and the other facts essential to legal liability of municipality under section; since interests of municipality and employee may be antagonistic, they should be represented by separate counsel. 148 C. 27. Municipality may not be held liable unless employee himself becomes obligated to pay for damages. 151 C. 402. Plaintiff who was injured by negligence of fellow employee who had a right to workmen's compensation before 1961 amendment became effective was not barred from bringing a common law action against his fellow employee. 152 C. 42. Cited. 159 C. 509; 167 C. 464, 471. Municipal employee has no cause of action against a fellow municipal employee to recover damages for an injury caused by the act of such fellow employee while both are engaged within the scope of their employment if such injured employee is covered by workmen's compensation unless the act causing such injury was willful or malicious. 169 C. 630.

Statute does not apply to plaintiff's allegations of breach of contract, nuisance and violation of state constitution and various local statutes made directly against defendant borough. 53 CA 791. Although trial court improperly analyzed plaintiff's claims under Sec. 52-557n(a), which concerns claims brought directly against a municipality, rather than under the applicable municipal indemnification statute (Sec. 7-465), which provides that qualified municipal immunity does not apply to claims for indemnification for acts by municipal employees unless the acts are willful or wanton, she could not prevail on her claim that trial court improperly granted motion for a directed verdict because there is no recognized right to a claim for emotional distress resulting to a person from loss of a pet. 84 CA 395. Defendant's pleadings met standard for summary judgment; court properly granted defendant's motion for summary judgment on the ground of municipal immunity because plaintiffs brought suit under section without also suing a municipal employee or agent. 87 CA 353.\n\nCited. 19 CS 395; 21 CS 193. A broadside allegation of negligence on part of “agents and servants” of defendant, a town, was insufficient to bring an action within purview of statute; to make statute one of indemnification, applicable recovery must be had against specific employees of a town for specific acts covered by statute, and all statutory conditions, including notice, must be met. 22 CS 239. Plaintiff must allege and prove, as to both defendant employee and defendant municipality, due care or freedom from contributory negligence. 23 CS 130; Id., 133. Cited. Id., 152. Municipal employee is not relieved from consequences of his own negligence even though his employer may be exempt; furthermore, he is not indemnified under section unless complaint is drawn so as to invoke section; even if municipality is immune under section from liability for negligence, it may be liable in nuisance. Id., 158. Burden of alleging and proving contributory negligence remains with defendant employee as provided in Sec. 52-114; plaintiff not obliged to allege due care; because interests of municipality and employee may be antagonistic, each should be represented by independent counsel. Id., 228. Under former section, notice to employee and municipality was condition precedent to bringing action against both. 25 CS 70. Where plaintiff brought action under statute against local board of education to recover for injuries resulting from school bus accident, held action should have been brought under Sec. 13a-149; complaint under statute should be in two counts: The first, alleging the facts essential to the legal liability of the employee and the second, the facts essential to the legal liability of the municipality under the statute; in action under former statute, it may appear that interests of municipality and its employee are antagonistic and therefore they should be represented by independent counsel; to establish liability of municipality under statute, plaintiff must prove compliance with requirements as to demand and notice. Id., 302. In count directed against municipality, it is necessary to allege the conduct of the employee was not willful or wanton. Id., 339. History discussed. 26 CS 83. Sec. 52-114, establishing presumption of due care on part of injured person, is applicable to suit against town and its employee under this section. 28 CS 506. Statute was not intended to enlarge the liability of the municipality for the acts or omissions of its employees in courses of action in which they would not formerly have been liable; obligation of town employee, once established against him, shall be assumed by town; employee against whom action is brought is indemnified by town if cause arose while he was performing his duties and within the scope of employment. 29 CS 74. Validation by legislature of a late notice held valid although section cited was incorrect; legislative intent held to be to subject municipal employees and municipalities by way of indemnification for discretionary as well as ministerial acts performed within the scope of employment. 31 CS 442. City not liable for nonfeasance of its police officers where the duty owed is to the public as a whole rather than to the plaintiff individually. 32 CS 258. Written notice of intent to sue municipality and of time and place where alleged damages occurred must be filed with clerk of municipality within 6 months from date cause of action accrued. 33 CS 197. Cited. 39 CS 102; 41 CS 420; Id., 548; 42 CS 22. Town's liability is dependent on and derivative of finding of negligence on the part of municipal employee. 49 CS 15.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nCited. 185 C. 616, 622, 623. Sec. 52-557n precludes joint action seeking damages against municipality and its officers under this section. 219 C. 179.\n\nCited. 3 CA 343; 30 CA 742. Except for indemnification actions, statute does not permit separate cause of action to be brought against a town, and in this case, plaintiff could not prevail on grounds that town failed to give timely notice of intent to represent both the municipality and employee. 85 CA 383.",

      "heading": "Powers of State Board of Labor Relations.",
      "text": "The State Board of Labor Relations shall have the following power and authority in relation to collective bargaining in municipal employment:\n\n(1) Whenever, in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by the board, a petition has been filed (A) by an employee or group of employees or any employee organization acting in their behalf alleging that a substantial number of employees (i) wish to be represented for collective bargaining by an employee organization as exclusive representative, or (ii) assert that the employee organization which has been certified or is currently being recognized by their municipal employer as the bargaining representative is no longer the representative of a majority of employees in the unit; (B) by a municipal employer alleging that one or more employee organizations have presented to him a claim to be recognized as the representative of a majority of employees in an appropriate unit; or (C) by either an employee organization or a municipal employer in accordance with subdivision (4) of this section, the board shall refer the petition to its agent who shall investigate the petition and issue a direction of election and conduct a secret ballot election to determine whether and by which employee organization the employees desire to be represented if he has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation exists, or issue a recommendation to dismiss the petition if he finds that there is not such reasonable cause, or refer the petition to the board for a hearing without having conducted an election or issuing a recommendation of dismissal, in which event the board shall conduct an appropriate hearing upon due notice. The agent shall report his action to the board. The board shall issue an order confirming the agent's direction of election and certifying the results of the election, or issue an order confirming the agent's recommendation for dismissal, or order a further investigation, or provide for an appropriate hearing upon due notice. Before taking any of the aforesaid actions, the board shall provide the parties with an opportunity to file briefs on the questions at issue and shall fully consider any such briefs filed. After a hearing, the board shall order any of the aforesaid actions on the petition or shall, upon good cause, order any other suitable method to determine whether and by which employee organization the employees desire to be represented. The board shall certify the results. No election shall be directed in any bargaining unit or any subdivision thereof within which in the preceding twelve-month period a valid election has been held. No election shall be directed by the board during the term of a written collective bargaining agreement, except for good cause. In any election where none of the choices on the ballot receives a majority, a runoff shall be conducted, the ballot providing for a selection between the two choices receiving the largest and the second largest number of valid votes cast in the election. An employee organization which receives a majority of votes cast in an election confirmed or ordered by the board shall be designated by the board as exclusive representative of the employees in the unit.\n\n(2) The board shall have the power to determine whether a position is covered by sections 7-467 to 7-477, inclusive, in the event of a dispute between the municipal employer and an employee organization. In determining whether a position is supervisory the board shall consider, among other criteria, whether the principal functions of the position are characterized by not fewer than two of the following: (A) Performing such management control duties as scheduling, assigning, overseeing and reviewing the work of subordinate employees; (B) performing such duties as are distinct and dissimilar from those performed by the employees supervised; (C) exercising judgment in adjusting grievances, applying other established personnel policies and procedures and in enforcing the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement; and (D) establishing or participating in the establishment of performance standards for subordinate employees and taking corrective measures to implement those standards. The above criteria for supervisory positions shall not necessarily apply to police or fire departments.\n\n(3) The board shall decide in each case whether, in order to insure to employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed by sections 7-467 to 7-477, inclusive, and in order to insure a clear and identifiable community of interest among employees concerned, the unit appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining shall be the municipal employer unit or any other unit thereof, provided no unit shall include both supervisory and nonsupervisory employees except there shall be a single unit for each fire department consisting of the uniformed and investigatory employees of each such fire department and a single unit for each police department consisting of the uniformed and investigatory employees of each such police department. No existing units shall be altered or modified to conform to this provision. No unit shall include both professional and nonprofessional employees unless a majority of such professional employees vote for inclusion in such unit, provided employees who are members of a profession may be included in a unit which includes nonprofessional employees if an employee organization has been designated by the board or has been recognized by the municipal employer as the exclusive representative of such unit and a majority of the employees in such profession vote for inclusion in such unit, in which event all of the employees in such profession shall be included in such unit. The term “professional employee” means: (A) Any employee engaged in work (i) predominantly intellectual and varied in character as opposed to routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical work; (ii) involving the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment in its performance; (iii) of such a character that the output produced or the result accomplished cannot be standardized in relation to a given time period; (iv) requiring knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study in an institution of higher learning or a hospital, as distinguished from a general academic education or from an apprenticeship or from training in the performance of routine mental, manual or physical processes; or (B) any employee who (i) has completed the courses of specialized intellectual instruction and study described in subparagraph (A)(iv) of this subdivision, and (ii) is performing related work under the supervision of a professional person to qualify himself or herself to become a professional employee as defined in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision.\n\n(4) An employee organization or a municipal employer may file a petition with the board seeking a clarification or modification of an existing unit. The power of the board to make such clarifications and modifications shall be limited to those times when a petition for clarification or modification is filed by either an employee organization or a municipal employer. No petition seeking a clarification or modification of an existing unit shall be considered to be timely by the board during the term of a written collective bargaining agreement, except that a petition for clarification or modification filed by an employee organization concerning either (A) a newly created position, or (B) any employee who is not represented by an employee organization, may be filed at any time.\n\n(5) Whenever a question arises as to whether a practice prohibited by sections 7-467 to 7-477, inclusive, has been committed by a municipal employer or employee organization, the board shall consider that question in accordance with the following procedure: (A) When a complaint has been made to the board that a prohibited practice has been or is being committed, the board shall refer such complaint to its agent. Upon receiving a report from the agent, the board may issue an order dismissing the complaint or may order a further investigation or a hearing thereon. When a hearing is ordered, the board shall set the time and place for the hearing, which time and place may be changed by the board at the request of one of the parties for cause shown. Any complaint may be amended with the permission of the board. The municipal employer, the employee organization and the person so complained of shall have the right to file an answer to the original or amended complaint within five days after the service of such complaint or within such other time as the board may limit. Such municipal employer, such employee organization and such person shall have the right to appear in person or otherwise to defend against such complaint. In the discretion of the board any person may be allowed to intervene in such proceeding. In any hearing the board shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence prevailing in the courts. A transcript of the testimony taken at any hearing before the board shall be filed with the board. (B) If, upon all the testimony, the board determines that a prohibited practice has been or is being committed, it shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on the party committing the prohibited practice an order requiring it or him to cease and desist from such prohibited practice, and shall take such further affirmative action as will effectuate the policies of sections 7-467 to 7-477, inclusive, including but not limited to: (i) Withdrawal of certification of an employee organization established or assisted by any action defined in said sections as a prohibited practice, (ii) reinstatement of an employee discriminated against in violation of said sections with or without back pay, or (iii) if either party is found to have refused to bargain collectively in good faith, ordering arbitration and directing the party found to have refused to bargain to pay the full costs of arbitration under section 7-473c, resulting from the negotiations in which the refusal to bargain occurred. (C) If, upon all of the testimony, the board determines that a prohibited practice has not been or is not being committed, it shall state its finding of fact and shall issue an order dismissing the complaint. (D) For the purposes of hearings and enforcement of orders under sections 7-467 to 7-477, inclusive, the board shall have the same power and authority as it has in sections 31-107, 31-108 and 31-109, and the municipal employer and the employee organization shall have the right of appeal as provided therein. (E) If, by the thirtieth day following the date on which a complaint citing a violation of section 7-470 was made to the board, said board has not determined whether a prohibited practice has been or is being committed and if the violation is of an ongoing nature, said board may issue and cause to be served on the party committing the act or practice cited in such complaint an order requiring such party to cease and desist from such act or practice until said board has made its determination.\n\n(February, 1965, P.A. 159, S. 5; 1967, P.A. 491, S. 3, 4; P.A. 78-375, S. 2; P.A. 79-313; P.A. 81-29, S. 3; P.A. 91-255, S. 2; P.A. 92-170, S. 16, 26; P.A. 07-217, S. 28.)\n\nHistory: 1967 act amended Subdiv.

If the twenty-fifth day specified in this subdivision falls on a weekend or a holiday, such deadline shall be extended through the next business day following the twenty-fifth day.\n\n(13) Within ten days after such rejection, the legislative body or its authorized representative shall be required to state, in writing, the reasons for such vote and shall submit such written statement to the State Board of Mediation and Arbitration and the municipal employee organization. Within ten days after receipt of such notice, the municipal employee organization shall prepare a written response to such rejection and shall submit it to the legislative body and the State Board of Mediation and Arbitration.\n\n(14) Within ten days after receipt of such rejection notice, the State Board of Mediation and Arbitration shall select a review panel of three arbitrators or, if the parties agree, a single arbitrator who are residents of Connecticut and labor relations arbitrators approved by the American Arbitration Association and not members of the panel who issued the rejected award. Such arbitrators or single arbitrator shall review the decision on each such rejected issue. The review conducted pursuant to this subdivision shall be limited to the record and briefs of the hearing pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the written explanation of the reasons for the vote and a written response by either party. In conducting such review, the arbitrators or single arbitrator shall be limited to consideration of the criteria set forth in subdivision (9) of this subsection. Such review shall be completed within twenty days of the appointment of the arbitrators or single arbitrator. The arbitrators or single arbitrator shall accept the last best offer of either of the parties.\n\n(15) Within five days after the completion of such review the arbitrators or single arbitrator shall render a decision with respect to each rejected issue which shall be final and binding upon the municipal employer and the employee organization except that a motion to vacate or modify such award may be made in accordance with sections 52-418 and 52-419. The decision of the arbitrators or single arbitrator shall be in writing and shall include specific reasons and standards used by each arbitrator in making a decision on each issue.

Except where the legislative body is the town meeting, a request for funds necessary to implement such written agreement and for approval of any provisions of the agreement which are in conflict with any charter, special act, ordinance, rule or regulation adopted by the municipal employer or its agents, such as a personnel board or civil service commission, or any general statute directly regulating the hours of work of policemen or firemen or any general statute providing for the method or manner of covering or removing employees from coverage under the Connecticut municipal employees' retirement system or under the Policemen and Firemen Survivors' Benefit Fund shall be submitted by the bargaining representative of the municipality within fourteen days of the date on which such agreement is reached to the legislative body which may approve or reject such request as a whole by a majority vote of those present and voting on the matter; but, if rejected, the matter shall be returned to the parties for further bargaining.
