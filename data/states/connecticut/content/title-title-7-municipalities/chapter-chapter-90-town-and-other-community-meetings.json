Special town meetings may be convened when the selectmen deem it necessary, and they shall warn a special town meeting on application of twenty inhabitants qualified to vote in town meetings, such meeting to be held within twenty-one days after receiving such application. Any town meeting may be adjourned from time to time as the interest of the town requires.\n\n(b) Where any town's public buildings do not contain adequate space for holding annual or special town meetings, any such town may hold any such meeting outside the boundaries of the town, provided such meetings are held at the nearest practical locations to the town.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 491, 492; 1953, S. 205d; 1957, P.A. 226, S. 1; P.A. 73-412; P.A. 77-56.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 73-412 deleted requirement that annual meeting be held on first Monday in October barring other provisions in law; P.A. 77-56 added Subsec. (b) re meetings held outside of town.\n\nVote may be rescinded at subsequent meeting. 34 C. 108. Calling of special meeting for legal purpose is obligatory; immaterial that application names a day. 41 C. 245. Mandamus to compel calling of special meeting; reasonable certainty enough in application. 89 C. 561. Cited. 139 C. 209. Mandamus lies for directing selectmen to call town meeting for acceptance of street as public highway. 151 C. 372. Cited. 204 C. 551. Provisions of section do not preempt provisions of town charters delineating the circumstances requiring town meeting involvement. 234 C. 513.\n\nCited. 21 CA 351. Plaintiff's application to warn town meeting concerning dismissal of town planner was not proper under section. 85 CA 555.\n\nNo duty on the selectman to call a meeting pursuant to a petition where object is unlawful, frivolous or improper. 16 CS 486; 19 CS 216. While the board of selectmen is required to warn a town meeting on petition of twenty inhabitants qualified to vote, there is no duty to warn a meeting pursuant to such petition unless the board is reasonably certain that the object of the petition is lawful, proper, and not frivolous. 32 CS 237.",

Notice of a town meeting shall be given by posting, upon a signpost or other exterior place near the office of the town clerk of such town and at such other place or places as may be designated as hereinafter provided, a printed or written warning signed by the selectmen, or a majority of them, and by publishing a like warning in a newspaper published in such town or having a circulation therein, such posting and such publication to be at least five days previous to holding the meeting, including the day that notice is given and any Sunday and any legal holiday which may intervene between such posting and such publication and the day of holding such meeting, but not including the day of holding such meeting; but any town may, at an annual meeting, designate any other place or places, in addition to the signpost or other exterior place, at which such warnings shall be set up. The selectmen shall, on or before the day of such meeting, cause a copy of each such warning to be left with the town clerk, who shall record the same. Notice of a meeting of a city or borough shall be given by posting, upon a signpost or other exterior place nearest to the office of the clerk of such city or borough or at such place or places as may be designated by special charter provision, a written or printed warning signed by the mayor or clerk in the case of a city or by the warden or clerk in the case of a borough, and by publishing a like warning in a newspaper published within the limits of such city or borough, or having a circulation therein, at least five days previous to holding the meeting, including the day that notice is given and any Sunday and any legal holiday which may intervene between such posting and such publication and the day of holding such meeting, but not including the day of holding such meeting.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 493; 1953, S. 211d; 1963, P.A. 212; P.A. 84-146, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: 1963 act deleted provisions for posting warnings on signposts in the municipality and substituted posting on signpost or other exterior place nearest clerk's office; P.A. 84-146 made technical grammatical change.\n\nBoth warning and notice are requisite for legal meeting. 4 D. 62; 5 C. 391; 37 C. 392; 44 C. 157; 52 C. 483; 58 C. 488; 60 C. 165; 121 U.S. 121.

The hour of meeting presumed to be a proper hour. 13 C. 227. The notice should fairly state the purpose of meeting. Id.; 15 C. 327; 36 C. 83; 53 C. 577; 58 C. 488. Town may act within the limits of the warning. 55 C. 245. The statute prescribed method of notice, while by its vote the society prescribed more general notice; held that the society vote was merely directory. 15 C. 327. A validating act of the General Assembly cures all defects incident to the act validated. 52 C. 45. “Soldier's bounty” validating acts, so held. 32 C. 47; 37 C. 225. Town has no inherent legal powers; warning needs no address, but addressed “to the inhabitants” is valid. 32 C. 47. Clerk's certificate imports verity only as to matters of lawful consideration. 44 C. 158; 51 C. 22. 5 days before the meeting means 5 days before the day of meeting. Id. A meeting illegally warned voted a guarantee; a subsequent legal meeting voted “to let conditions of former vote remain as they now stand”; held not to be a ratification. Id.; see 121 U.S. 121. Town is not estopped by erroneous record of town clerk, as against one acting under it. Id. Meeting voted to adjourn “to Wednesday evening”; held to mean the next Wednesday. 52 C. 45. Unless restrictive in terms, a subsequent board of selectmen may carry out the purpose of a vote. Id., 498. As to what constitutes an appropriation. 58 C. 486. Town may by acquiescence ratify unauthorized act of selectmen. 59 C. 447. General notice sufficient as to action required by law. 77 C. 197.
