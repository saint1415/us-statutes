Bonds issued pursuant to sections 7-620 to 7-620e, inclusive, shall be special obligations of the municipality and shall not be payable from or charged upon any funds other than the revenues pledged to the payment thereof, nor shall the municipality issuing the same be subject to any liability thereon except to the extent of such pledged revenues. No holder or holders of any bonds shall have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the municipality to pay any bonds or the interest thereon, or to enforce payment thereon against any property of the municipality and the bonds shall not constitute a charge, lien or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the municipality. The substance of such limitation shall be plainly stated on the face of each bond. Bonds issued pursuant to sections 7-620 to 7-620e, inclusive, shall not be subject to any statutory limitation on the indebtedness of the municipality and such bonds when issued shall not be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of the municipality in respect to and to the extent of any such limitation.\n\n(P.A. 00-122, S. 2, 7.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 00-122 effective May 26, 2000.",

Such bonds shall: (1) Be issued and sold in such manner, bear interest at such rate or rates, including variable rates, as determined in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds; (2) provide for the payment of interest on such dates, whether before or at maturity; (3) be issued at, above or below par; (4) mature at such time or times not exceeding thirty years from their date; (5) have such rank or priority, be payable in such medium of payment, be issued in such form, including, without limitation, registered or book-entry form, carry such registration and transfer privileges and be made subject to purchase or redemption before maturity at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions, including the condition that such bonds be subject to purchase or redemption on the demand of the owner thereof, and contain such other terms and particulars as the legislative body of the municipality or the board, officers or agency delegated such authority by the legislative body of the municipality shall determine.\n\n(b) The proceedings under which bonds are authorized to be issued may, subject to the provisions of the general statutes, contain any or all of the following: (1) Provisions respecting custody of the proceeds from the sale of the bonds, including any requirements that such proceeds be held separate from or not be commingled with other funds of the municipality; (2) provisions for the investment and reinvestment of bond proceeds until such proceeds are used to pay project costs and for the disposition of any excess bond proceeds or investment earnings thereon; (3) provisions for the execution of reimbursement agreements, or similar agreements, in connection with credit facilities, including, but not limited to, letters of credit or policies of bond insurance, remarketing agreements, debt service reserve fund surety bonds and interest rate swap agreements; (4) provisions for the collection, custody, investment, reinvestment and use of the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged for payment of the bonds as provided in sections 7-620 to 7-620e, inclusive; (5) provisions regarding the establishment and maintenance of reserves, sinking funds and any other funds and accounts and the regulation and disposition thereof, including requirements that any such funds and accounts be held separate from or not be commingled with other funds of the municipality; (6) covenants for the establishment or maintenance requirements with respect to facilities and properties; (7) provisions for the issuance of additional bonds on a parity with bonds issued prior to the issuance of such additional bonds, including establishment of coverage requirements, if appropriate, with respect to such bonds; (8) provisions regarding the rights and remedies available to the bond owners or any trustee under any contract, loan agreement, document, instrument or trust indenture in case of a default, including the right to appoint a trustee to represent their interests upon occurrence of any event of default, as defined in any such default proceedings, provided if any bonds are secured by a trust indenture, the respective owners of such bonds shall have no authority except as set forth in such trust indenture to appoint a separate trustee to represent them; and (9) other provisions or covenants of like or different character from the foregoing which are consistent with sections 7-620 to 7-620e, inclusive, and which the legislative body of the municipality or the board, officers or agency delegated such authority by the legislative body of the municipality shall determine in such proceedings are necessary, convenient or desirable in order to better secure the bonds, or will tend to make the bonds more marketable, and which are in the best interests of such municipality.\n\n(c) Any provisions which may be included in proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds under sections 7-620 to 7-620e, inclusive, may be included in an indenture of trust duly approved in accordance with sections 7-620 to 7-620e, inclusive, which secures the bonds, and in such case the provisions of such indenture shall be deemed to be a part of such proceedings as though they were expressly included therein. Any pledge made by a municipality for the issuance of bonds hereunder shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made, and any revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys so pledged and thereafter received by a municipality shall be subject immediately to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the municipality, irrespective of whether such parties have notice of such lien. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded. The municipality may enter into a trust indenture with a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state, containing such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bond owners as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the municipality in relation to the exercise of its powers pursuant to sections 7-620 to 7-620e, inclusive, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. The municipality may provide by such trust indenture for the payment of the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys to the trustee under such trust indenture or to any other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as project costs. As used in sections 7-620 to 7-620e, inclusive, “bonds” means any bonds, including refunding bonds, notes, bond anticipation notes, interim certificates, debentures or other obligations of indebtedness.\n\n(P.A. 00-122, S. 3, 7.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 00-122 effective May 26, 2000.",
