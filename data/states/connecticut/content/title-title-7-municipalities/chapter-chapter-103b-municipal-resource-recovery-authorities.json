The body having power to authorize such bonds shall determine the maximum authorized amount of such bonds and may determine or may authorize an officer or board or commission of the municipality to determine the form of such bonds, their date, the dates of principal and interest payments, the manner of issuing such bonds and by whom such bonds shall be signed or countersigned and, as otherwise provided herein, all other particulars thereof. Such body may determine the rate or rates of interest for each issue of bonds or the manner of determining such rate or rates. Bonds may be issued in coupon, registered or book-entry form. If coupon bonds, they may be registrable as to principal only or as to both principal and interest. Bonds may be sold at such prices as the issuer shall determine.\n\n(b) An authority created pursuant to this chapter may issue bonds from time to time and use the proceeds thereof for the purposes and powers of the authority and to accomplish the purposes of this chapter, or for the purpose of refunding such bonds, including providing for payment of the costs of any project of the authority, providing for payment of any and all costs of the authority incident to and otherwise necessary to the construction of the project, including administrative, legal and financing expenses, and providing for the establishment and maintenance of reserves, sinking funds and any other funds and accounts for such bonds. The authority shall secure such bonds as to both principal and interest by any or all of the following: (1) From its revenues generally; (2) a pledge of the revenues to be derived from the operation of a facility; (3) a mortgage covering all or any part of the facility from which the revenues so pledged may be derived; or (4) a pledge of any lease of such facility or of the payments on any loan of the proceeds of such bonds. Prior to the issuance of any bonds the municipality designating or creating the authority, or each of the respective municipalities designating or creating the regional authority, shall have approved by resolution or by concurrent resolutions of the legislative bodies thereof, the issuance by the authority of such bonds. Each such resolution shall specify the maximum authorized amount of such bonds and shall authorize the authority to determine the form of such bonds, including provisions as to registration thereof, their date, the dates of principal and interest payments, the rate or rates of interest for each issue of bonds or the manner of determining such rate or rates, the manner of issuance and sale of such bonds and by whom such bonds shall be signed or countersigned, and, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, all other particulars thereof. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may authorize the issuance of interim receipts or temporary bonds, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery. If any of the officers whose signatures appear on the bonds cease to be officers before the delivery of any such bonds, such signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such officers had remained in office until delivery. Nothing herein shall prevent any series of bonds issued under this chapter from being issued in coupon form, in which case references to the bonds herein also shall refer to the coupons attached thereto where appropriate, and references to owners of bonds shall include holders of such bonds where appropriate.\n\n(c) An authority is authorized to provide for the issuance of its bonds for the purpose of refunding any bonds of the authority then outstanding, including the payment of any redemption premium thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue to the earliest or any subsequent date of redemption, purchase or maturity of such bonds, and, if deemed advisable by the authority, for the additional purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of a project or any portion thereof. The proceeds of any such bonds issued for the purpose of refunding outstanding bonds, may, in the discretion of the authority, be applied to the purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption of such outstanding bonds either on their earliest or any subsequent redemption date, and may, pending such application, be placed in escrow to be applied to such purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption on such date as may be determined by the authority.\n\n(d) Whenever the issuance of bonds has been authorized pursuant to this chapter, an authority may, pending the issuance thereof, and, subject to any applicable terms or provisions of the proceedings authorizing such issuance, issue bonds in the form of bond anticipation notes and any renewals thereof. The principal of and interest on any bonds issued as bond anticipation notes pursuant to this subsection may be repaid from pledged revenues or other pledged receipts, funds or moneys, to the extent not paid from the proceeds of renewals thereof or of bonds. Upon the sale of bonds, the proceeds thereof, to the extent required, shall be applied forthwith to the payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds issued as bond anticipation notes or shall be deposited in trust for such purpose. The date or dates of such bond anticipation notes, the maturities, denominations, form, details and other particulars of such bond anticipation notes, including the method, terms and conditions for the issue and sale thereof, shall be determined by the authority.\n\n(e) Bonds issued pursuant to this chapter may be issued pursuant to a resolution or indenture, which resolution or indenture may contain any agreements and the provisions deemed necessary or appropriate by the municipality or the authority in connection with the issuance of such bonds and to provide for the terms and security thereof, including any or all of the following: (1) Provisions respecting the fixing and collection of all revenues from any facility or facilities covered by such indenture; (2) provisions respecting custody of the proceeds from the sale of such bonds, including any requirements that such proceeds be held separate from or not to be commingled with other funds of the municipality or the authority; (3) provisions for the investment and reinvestment of bond proceeds until used to pay costs of a project and for the disposition of any excess bond proceeds or investment earnings thereon; (4) provisions for the execution of reimbursement agreements or similar agreements in connection with credit facilities, including, but not limited to, letters of credit or policies of bond insurance, remarketing agreements and agreements for the purpose of moderating interest rate fluctuations; (5) provisions for the collection, custody, investment, reinvestment and use of revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged therefor as provided in this chapter; (6) provisions regarding the establishment and maintenance of reserves, sinking funds and any other funds and accounts as shall be approved by the municipality or the authority in such amounts as the municipality or the authority may establish and the regulation and disposition thereof, including requirements that any such funds and accounts be held separate from or not be commingled with other funds of the municipality or the authority; (7) covenants for the establishment of pledged revenue coverage requirements for such bonds; (8) covenants for the establishment of maintenance and insurance requirements with respect to a facility or facilities; (9) provision for the issuance of additional bonds on a parity with bonds theretofore issued, including establishment of coverage requirements with respect thereto as herein provided; (10) the terms to be incorporated in any loan of the proceeds of such bonds, and in any lease of a facility or facilities; (11) the creation and maintenance of special funds from the revenues of a facility or facilities; and (12) the rights and remedies available in event of default to the bondowners or to the trustee under an indenture, all as the municipality or the authority shall deem advisable and as shall not be in conflict with the provisions of this chapter and the general statutes.\n\n(P.A. 81-213, S. 5, 18; P.A. 85-478, S. 4, 10.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 85-478 deleted detailed provision re determination of interest rates, substituting provision authorizing authority to determine rates or manner of determination, authorized issuance of bonds in book-entry form, deleted prior provisions re discounted bonds and added Subsecs.

Any such contract or agreement may require the continuation of such payments by the municipality whether or not the agreed services are being provided but only until all bonds issued by any of the contracting parties for development and construction of solid waste facilities or resource recovery facilities have been paid or provided for and may require or permit one or more of the contracting municipalities to pay obligations of another contracting municipality in the event such other municipality fails to make such payments and to bring appropriate legal action against the defaulting municipality to recover the amounts so paid, together with the costs and expenses of such action. The obligation of a contracting municipality to make payments pursuant to any such agreement shall not be included in the aggregate indebtedness of the municipality for purposes of any state statutory provision limiting the aggregate indebtedness of the municipality. Any such agreement shall be valid, binding and enforceable against the municipality or the authority if approved by action of the legislative body of such municipality.\n\n(e) All required payments of fees and charges, interest on loans, principal of loans and necessary fees and assessments related thereto required under any contract or agreement entered into pursuant to the provisions of this section, shall be considered expenditures for public purposes by a municipality and, notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, any necessary general or special taxes or cost sharing or other assessments authorized to be levied or assessed and collected by municipalities within the state may be levied or collected by said municipality without limitation as to rate or amount for the purpose of making such required payments.\n\n(P.A. 81-213, S. 7, 18; P.A. 85-478, S. 6, 10.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 85-478 provided that the existing section, now Subsec.
