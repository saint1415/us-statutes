The port authority may hold, pledge, cancel or resell such bonds, subject to and in accordance with agreements with bondholders.\n\n(g) A port authority shall cause a copy of any bond resolution adopted by it to be filed for public inspection in its office and in the office of the clerk of each participating municipality and may thereupon cause to be published at least once in a newspaper published or circulating in each participating municipality a notice stating the fact and date of such adoption and the places where such bond resolution has been so filed for public inspection and also the date of the first publication of such notice and also stating that any action or proceeding of any kind or nature in any court questioning the validity or proper authorization of bonds provided for by the bond resolution, or the validity of any covenants, agreements or contracts provided for by the bond resolution, shall be commenced within twenty days after the first publication of such notice. If any such notice is published and if no action or proceeding questioning the validity or proper authorization of bonds provided for by the bond resolution referred to in such notice, or the validity of any covenants, agreements or contracts provided for by the bond resolution is commenced or instituted within twenty days after the first publication of said notice, then all residents and taxpayers and owners of property in each participating municipality and all other persons shall be forever barred and foreclosed from instituting or commencing any action or proceeding in any court, or from pleading any defense to any action or proceeding, questioning the validity or proper authorization of such bonds, or the validity of such covenants, agreements or contracts, and said bonds, covenants, agreements and contracts shall be conclusively deemed to be valid and binding obligations in accordance with their terms and tenor.\n\n(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of the general statutes, (1) the state shall not, now or in the future, have any liability or responsibility with regard to any obligation issued by the port authority, and (2) no political subdivision of the state shall, now or in the future, have any liability or responsibility with regard to any obligation issued by the port authority except as expressly provided in sections 7-329a to 7-329u, inclusive.\n\n(P.A. 98-240, S. 7; P.A. 06-196, S. 40.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 06-196 made a technical change in Subsec.
