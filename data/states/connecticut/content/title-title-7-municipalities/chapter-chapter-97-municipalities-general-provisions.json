All lands or interests in land acquired under this program shall be preserved in perpetuity predominantly in their natural scenic and open condition for the protection of natural resources while allowing for recreation consistent with such protection and, for lands acquired by water companies, allowing for the improvements necessary for the protection or provision of potable water.\n\n(b) Grants may be made under the protected open space and watershed land acquisition grant program established under subsection (a) of this section or under the Charter Oak open space grant program established under section 7-131t to match funds for the purchase of land or permanent interests in land which purchase meets one of the following criteria: (1) Protects land identified as being especially valuable for recreation, forestry, fishing, conservation of wildlife or natural resources; (2) protects land which includes or contributes to a prime natural feature of the state's landscape, including, but not limited to, a shoreline, a river, its tributaries and watershed, an aquifer, mountainous territory, ridgelines, an inland or coastal wetland, a significant littoral or estuarine or aquatic site or other important geological feature; (3) protects habitat for native plant or animal species listed as threatened or endangered or of special concern, as defined in section 26-304; (4) protects a relatively undisturbed outstanding example of a native ecological community which is now uncommon; (5) enhances and conserves water quality of the state's lakes, rivers and coastal water; (6) preserves local agricultural heritage; or (7) in the case of grants to water companies, protects land which is eligible to be classified as class I land or class II land after acquisition. The commissioner may make a grant under the protected open space and watershed land acquisition grant program to a distressed municipality or a targeted investment community, as defined in section 32-9p, for restoration or protection of natural features or habitats on open space already owned by the municipality, including, but not limited to, wetland or wildlife or plant habitat restoration or restoration of other sites to a more natural condition, or replacement of vegetation, provided the total amount of grants to such municipalities for such purposes may not exceed twenty per cent of the total amount of grants made in any fiscal year.\n\n(c) No grant may be made under the protected open space and watershed land acquisition grant program established under subsection (a) of this section or under the Charter Oak open space grant program established under section 7-131t for: (1) Land to be used for commercial purposes or for recreational purposes requiring intensive development, including, but not limited to, golf courses, driving ranges, tennis courts, ballfields, swimming pools and uses by motorized vehicles other than vehicles needed by water companies to carry out their purposes, provided trails or pathways for pedestrians, motorized wheelchairs or nonmotorized vehicles shall not be considered intensive development; (2) land with environmental contamination over a significant portion of the property provided grants for land requiring remediation of environmental contamination may be made if remediation will be completed before acquisition of the land or any interest in the land and an environmental assessment approved by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection has been completed and no environmental use restriction applies to the land; (3) land which has already been committed for public use, except as provided in subsection (c) of section 7-131g; (4) development costs, including, but not limited to, construction of ballfields, tennis courts, parking lots or roadways; (5) land to be acquired by eminent domain; or (6) reimbursement of in-kind services or incidental expenses associated with the acquisition of land. This subsection shall not prohibit the continuation of agricultural activity, the activities of a water company for public water supply purposes or the selling of timber incidental to management of the land which management is in accordance with approved forest management practices provided any proceeds of such timber sales shall be used for management of the land. In the case of land acquired under this section which is designated as a state park, any fees charged by the state for use of such land shall be used by the state in accordance with the provisions of title 23.\n\n(d) Any municipality or group of contiguous municipalities may apply to the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection for a grant-in-aid of a program established to preserve or restrict to conservation or recreation purposes the use of open space land. Such grant shall be used for the acquisition of land, or easements, interests or rights therein, or for the development of such land, or easements, interests or rights therein, for purposes set forth in this section, or both, in accordance with a plan of development adopted by the municipal planning commission of the municipality within which the land is located. Any application for a grant-in-aid relating to land located beyond the territorial limits of the applying municipality shall be subject to approval of the legislative body of the municipality within whose territorial limits the land is located. A municipality applying for aid under this section, may designate its conservation commission as its agent to make such application.\n\n(e) At closing, a permanent conservation easement, as defined in section 47-42, shall be executed for any property purchased with grant funds, which conservation easement shall provide that the property shall remain forever predominantly in its natural and open condition for the specific conservation, open space or water supply purposes for which it was acquired provided any improvements or changes to the property shall be supportive of such condition or purposes. The permanent conservation easement shall be in favor of the state acting through the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection, or his designee, which may be a municipality or a land conservation organization. In the case of land acquired for water supply protection, a water company may hold an easement in conjunction with the state or a nonprofit entity to protect the water supply. Such permanent conservation easement shall also include a requirement that the property be made available to the general public for appropriate recreational purposes, the maintenance of which recreational access shall be the responsibility of the grantee provided such access shall not be required for land which will be classified as class I or class II land by a water company if such access is inconsistent with the provision of pure drinking water to the public. An exception to the provision of public recreational access may be made at the discretion of the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection when provision for public access would be unreasonably detrimental to the wildlife or plant habitat or other natural features of the property or, for land where development rights have been purchased, would be disruptive of agricultural activity occurring on the land. Any instrument conveying an interest in land less than fee which interest is purchased under this section shall provide for the permanent preservation of the land and public access consistent with the land's use or protection and with any restrictions prescribed by the Department of Public Health in order to protect a public drinking water source.\n\n(1963, P.A. 649, S. 2; February, 1965, P.A. 367, S. 1; 1971, P.A. 842, S. 2; 872, S. 404; P.A. 78-359, S. 1, 8; P.A. 98-157, S. 3, 15; P.A. 00-203, S. 3, 11; P.A. 01-195, S. 106, 181; June Sp.

The municipalities may issue such types of bonds as they may determine, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, bonds payable as to principal and interest: (1) From their revenues generally; (2) exclusively from the income and revenues of a particular project; or (3) exclusively from the income and revenues of certain designated projects, whether or not they are financed in whole or in part from the proceeds of such bonds. Any such bonds may be additionally secured by a pledge of any grant or contribution from a participating municipality, the state or any political subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, any federal agency or any private corporation, copartnership, association or individual, or a pledge of any income or revenues of the municipalities, or a mortgage on any project or other property of the municipalities. Whenever and for as long as the municipalities have issued and have outstanding bonds pursuant to sections 7-136n to 7-136s, inclusive, the municipalities shall fix, charge and collect rates, rents, fees and other charges. No person executing the bonds shall be liable personally on the bonds by reason of the issuance thereof. The bonds and other obligations of the municipalities, and such bonds and obligations shall so state on their face, shall not be a debt of the state or any political subdivision thereof except the municipalities issuing such bonds, and no person other than the municipalities shall be liable thereon, nor shall such bonds or obligations be payable out of any funds or properties other than those of a participating municipality. Except to the extent and for the purpose therein expressly provided by other laws, such bonds shall not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any statutory limitation on the indebtedness of any participating municipality. Bonds of participating municipalities are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose. In anticipation of the sale of such revenue bonds the municipalities may issue negotiable bond anticipation notes and may renew the same from time to time, but the maximum maturity of any such note, including renewals thereof, shall not exceed five years from the date of issue of the original note. Such notes shall be paid from any revenues of the municipalities available therefor and not otherwise pledged, or from the proceeds of sale of the revenue bonds of the municipalities in anticipation of which they were issued. The notes shall be issued in the same manner as the revenue bonds. Such notes and the resolution or resolutions authorizing the same may contain any provisions, conditions or limitations which a bond resolution of the municipalities may contain.\n\n(b) Bonds of the municipalities may be issued as serial bonds or as term bonds, or the municipalities, in their discretion, may issue bonds of both types. Bonds shall be authorized by resolution of the members of the municipality and shall bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times, not exceeding fifty years from their respective dates, bear interest at such rate or rates, or have provisions for the manner of determining such rate or rates, payable at such time or times, be in such denominations, be in such form, either coupon or registered, carry such registration privileges, be executed in such manner, be payable in lawful money of the United States of America at such place or places, and be subject to such terms of redemption, as such resolution or resolutions may provide. The revenue bonds or notes may be sold at public or private sale for such price or prices as the municipalities shall determine. Pending preparation of the definitive bonds, the municipalities may issue interim receipts or certificates which shall be exchanged for such definitive bonds.\n\n(c) Any resolution or resolutions authorizing any revenue bonds or any issue of revenue bonds may contain provisions, which shall be a part of the contract with the holders of the revenue bonds to be authorized, as to: (1) Pledging all or any part of the revenues of a project or any revenue-producing contract or contracts made by the municipalities with any individual, partnership, corporation or association or other body, public or private, to secure the payment of the revenue bonds or of any particular issue of revenue bonds, subject to such agreements with bondholders as may then exist; (2) the rentals, fees and other charges to be charged, and the amounts to be raised in each year thereby, and the use and disposition of the revenues; (3) the setting aside of reserves or sinking funds or other funds or accounts as the municipalities may establish and the regulation and disposition thereof, including requirements that any such funds and accounts be held separate from or not be commingled with other funds of the municipalities; (4) limitations on the right of the municipalities or its agent to restrict and regulate the use of the project; (5) limitations on the purpose to which the proceeds of sale of any issue of revenue bonds then or thereafter to be issued may be applied and pledging such proceeds to secure the payment of the revenue bonds or any issue of the revenue bonds; (6) limitations on the issuance of additional bonds; the terms upon which additional bonds may be issued and secured; the refunding of outstanding bonds; (7) the procedure, if any, by which the terms of any contract with bondholders may be amended or abrogated, the amount of bonds the holders of which must consent thereto, and the manner in which such consent may be given; (8) limitations on the amount of moneys derived from the project to be expended for operating, administrative or other expenses of the municipalities; (9) defining the acts or omissions to act which shall constitute a default in the duties of the municipalities to holders of its obligations and providing the rights and remedies of such holders in the event of a default; (10) the mortgaging of a project and the site thereof for the purpose of securing the bondholders; and (11) provisions for the execution of reimbursement agreements or similar agreements in connection with credit facilities including but not limited to, letters of credit or policies of bond insurance, remarketing agreements and agreements for the purpose of moderating interest rate fluctuations.\n\n(d) If any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature appears on any bonds or coupons ceases to be such officer before delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. All such bonds shall be deemed to be negotiable instruments under the provisions of the general statutes.\n\n(e) Bonds may be issued without obtaining the consent of any commission, board, bureau or agency of the state or of any political subdivision, and without any other proceedings or the happening of other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions or things which are specifically required by said sections.\n\n(f) The municipalities shall have power out of any funds available therefor to purchase its bonds or notes. The municipalities may hold, pledge, cancel or resell such bonds, subject to and in accordance with agreements with bondholders.\n\n(g) The municipalities shall cause a copy of any bond resolution adopted by it to be filed for public inspection in its office and in the office of the clerk of each participating municipality and may thereupon cause to be published at least once in a newspaper published or circulating in each participating municipality a notice stating the fact and date of such adoption and the places where such bond resolution has been so filed for public inspection and also the date of the first publication of such notice and also stating that any action or proceeding of any kind or nature in any court questioning the validity or proper authorization of bonds provided for by the bond resolution, or the validity of any covenants, agreements or contracts provided for by the bond resolution, shall be commenced within twenty days after the first publication of such notice. If any such notice is published and if no action or proceeding questioning the validity or proper authorization of bonds provided for by the bond resolution referred to in such notice, or the validity of any covenants, agreements or contracts provided for by the bond resolution is commenced or instituted within twenty days after the first publication of said notice, then all residents and taxpayers and owners of property in each participating municipality and all other persons shall be forever barred and foreclosed from instituting or commencing any action or proceeding in any court, or from pleading any defense to any action or proceeding, questioning the validity or proper authorization of such bonds, or the validity of such covenants, agreements or contracts, and said bonds, covenants, agreements and contracts shall be conclusively deemed to be valid and binding obligations in accordance with their terms and tenor.\n\n(P.A. 98-237, S. 6; P.A. 06-196, S. 38.)\n\nHistory: (Revisor's note: In codifying this section, an incorrect reference in section 6(a) of P.A. 98-237 to “... pursuant to sections 10 to 15, inclusive, of this act, ...” was deemed by the Revisors to read “... pursuant to sections 6 to 11, inclusive, of this act, ...” and codified accordingly); P.A. 06-196 made a technical change in Subsec.

In establishing such lines, the legislative body or such board, commission, department or inland wetlands agency shall base their location on the boundaries of the area which would be inundated by a flood similar in size to one or more recorded floods which have caused extensive damages in such area or on a size of flood computed by accepted methods applicable generally throughout the state or a region thereof. The determination of the size of the flood and the boundaries of the inundated area shall take into consideration the effects of probable future developments. The position of the lines may vary from the boundaries of the inundated area so as to minimize the area of land to be regulated when a portion of the inundated area does not contribute to the flood-carrying capacity of the waterway. The position of the lines shall, insofar as practical, equitably affect riparian properties and interests depending upon existing topography and shall be interdependent throughout the reaches of the waterway, and shall conform with the requirements of the federal government imposed as conditions for the construction of flood control projects. When the existing waterway, because of natural or man-made constrictions, is such that such lines cannot be established by standard engineering methods, a channel may be adopted, whereby the removal of such constrictions may be anticipated so that reasonable lines can be established by methods applicable to the state generally. When the flood boundary falls along the channel banks, the lines shall be placed at the top of the bank.\n\n(b) The legislative body or such board, commission, department or inland wetlands agency may grant or deny permission based on a finding of the effect of the obstruction or encroachment on the flood-carrying and water storage capacity of the waterways and flood plains, flood heights, hazards to life and property, the protection and preservation of the natural resources and ecosystems of the municipality including, but not limited to, ground and surface water, animal, plant and aquatic life, nutrient exchange and energy flow with due consideration given to the results of similar encroachments constructed along the reach of the waterway. Wherever there is a city or borough within a town, the town shall have authority to establish such lines for such of its area as is not within such city or borough, and the city or borough shall have such authority within its boundaries. Any two or more adjoining municipalities shall have authority to investigate jointly the desirability of establishing lines on either or both sides of a waterway within their jurisdiction. Any private person or any firm or corporation aggrieved by any decision of a legislative body or any such board, commission, department or inland wetlands agency made in accordance with this section may, within thirty days after notice thereof, appeal from such decision in the manner provided by section 8-8 for appeal from the decisions of a municipal zoning board of appeals. Nothing contained in this section shall limit or restrict the Commissioner of Transportation in exercising his authority over the harbors and navigable waters of the state, nor apply to any dam, bridge, pipeline or other similar structure, and appurtenances thereto, extending across any waterway, which are otherwise in compliance with law.\n\n(c) The provisions of this section shall not be construed to limit or alter the authority of the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection over the tidal, coastal and navigable waters of the state and within stream channel encroachment lines established by said commissioner pursuant to section 22a-343.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 708; 1957, P.A. 13, S. 25; 1969, P.A. 768, S. 64; P.A. 88-327, S. 1, 3; P.A. 11-80, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: 1969 act gave power over harbors and navigable waters to commissioner of transportation and deleted reference to state board of harbor commissioners for New Haven Harbor; P.A. 88-327 redesignated provisions of section as Subsecs.
