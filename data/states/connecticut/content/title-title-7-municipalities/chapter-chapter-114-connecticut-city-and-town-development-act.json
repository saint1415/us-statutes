      "text": "(a) It is hereby found and declared that there continues to exist in the state in many of its municipalities conditions of substantial and persistent unemployment; that many existing residential, industrial, commercial and manufacturing facilities within many municipalities are either obsolete, inefficient or dilapidated or are located without regard to the master plans of such municipalities; that the obsolescence and abandonment of existing facilities will increase with technological advances, the provision of modern, efficient facilities in other states and the difficulty which many municipalities have in attracting and holding new facilities; and that many existing and planned industrial, manufacturing and commercial facilities are far from or not easily accessible to the places of residence of substantial numbers of unemployed and underemployed persons.\n\n(b) It is further found and declared that there exists a critical shortage of adequate housing in many municipalities which is the result of declines in new housing starts and the existing large number of substandard, unsafe and unsanitary dwellings; that a large and significant number of residents of many municipalities have been and will be subject to hardship in finding adequate, safe and sanitary housing unless new facilities are constructed and existing housing, where appropriate, is rehabilitated; that unless the supply of housing is increased significantly and expeditiously, a large number of such residents will be compelled to live in unsanitary, overcrowded and unsafe conditions to the detriment of the health, welfare and well being of these persons and of such municipalities or such residents will abandon such municipalities to find suitable housing elsewhere, thus further contributing to the decline of such municipalities; and that by increasing the housing supply in such municipalities and the ability of their residents to obtain decent, safe and sanitary housing, the critical shortage of adequate housing will be ameliorated.\n\n(c) It is further found and declared that such conditions combined with the existence in many municipalities within the state of residential, nonresidential, commercial, industrial, vacant or predominantly vacant areas which are slum or blighted because of substandard, unsanitary, deteriorated or deteriorating conditions which accelerate the decline of population in such municipalities, retard sound economic growth and physical development, erode the financial position of such municipalities and their residents by shrinking their tax base, increasing the share of the tax burden which each taxpayer must bear and reducing the incentive for investment in such municipalities, and adversely affect the health, safety, welfare and prosperity of the state and more particularly the people of such municipalities.\n\n(d) It is further found and declared that, by virtue of their architectural and cultural heritage, their positions as principal centers of communication and transportation and their concentration of productive and energy efficient facilities, many municipalities are capable of ameliorating the conditions of deterioration which impede sound community growth and development; that building a proper balance of housing, industrial and commercial facilities and increasing the attractiveness of such municipalities to persons of all income levels are essential to restoring such municipalities as desirable places to live, work, shop and enjoy life's amenities; that the accomplishment of these objectives is beyond remedy solely by the regulatory process in the exercise of the police power and cannot be dealt with effectively by the ordinary operations of private enterprise without the powers provided herein; and that the exercise of the powers herein provided is critical to continuing the process of revitalizing such municipalities and will serve an urgent public use and purpose.\n\n(e) The necessity in the public interest and for the public benefit and good of the provisions of this chapter is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.\n\n(July Sp.

The refunding bonds may be exchanged for the bonds to be refunded or sold and the proceeds applied to the purchase, redemption or payment of such bonds.\n\n(c) The notes and bonds shall be authorized by resolution of the municipality, shall bear such date or dates and shall mature at such time or times not exceeding forty years from the date thereof in the case of bonds issued to finance housing and facilities related thereto or thirty years from the date thereof in all other cases, as such resolution may provide. The bonds may be issued as serial bonds or as term bonds or as a combination thereof. The notes and bonds shall bear interest at such rate or rates, be in such denominations, be in such form, either bearer or registered, carry such exchange, transfer and registration privileges, be executed in such manner, be payable in such medium of payment, at such place or places, and be subject to such terms of redemption as such resolution may provide. The notes and bonds may be sold by the municipality at public or private sale, at such price or prices as the municipality shall determine.\n\n(d) Any resolution authorizing notes or bonds or any issue thereof may contain provisions, which shall be a part of the contract or contracts with the holders thereof, as to: (1) Pledging all or part of any revenues to secure the payment of the notes or bonds or of any issue thereof, subject to such agreements with noteholders or bondholders as may then exist; (2) pledging all or any part of the development property in which the municipality has acquired an interest from the proceeds of bonds and notes to secure the payment of the notes or bonds or of any issue of notes or bonds, subject to such agreements with noteholders or bondholders as may then exist; (3) the use and disposition of the gross income from mortgages owned by the municipality for the purposes of this chapter and payment of principal of mortgages owned by the municipality for the purposes of this chapter; (4) the setting aside of reserves or sinking funds and the regulation and disposition thereof; (5) limitations on the purposes to which the proceeds of sale of notes or bonds may be applied and pledging such proceeds to secure the payment of the notes or bonds or of any issue thereof; (6) limitations on the issuance of additional notes or bonds; the terms upon which additional notes or bonds may be issued and secured; and the refunding of outstanding or other notes or bonds; (7) the procedure, if any, by which the terms of any contract with noteholders or bondholders may be amended or abrogated, the amount of notes or bonds the holders of which must consent thereto, and the manner in which such consent may be given; (8) limitations on the amount of moneys to be expended by the municipality for its operating expenses; (9) vesting in a trustee or trustees property, rights, powers and duties in trust as the municipality may determine, which may include any or all of the rights, powers and duties of the trustee appointed by the bondholders pursuant to this chapter, and limiting or abrogating the right of the bondholders to appoint a trustee under this chapter or limiting the rights, powers and duties of such trustee; (10) the acts or omissions to act which shall constitute a default in the obligations and duties of the municipality to the holders of the notes or bonds and providing for the rights and remedies of the holders of the notes or bonds in the event of such default, including the right to appointment of a receiver; provided, however, such rights and remedies shall not be inconsistent with the general laws of the state and the other provisions of this chapter; (11) any other matters, of like or different character, which in any way affect the security or protection of the holders of the notes or bonds.\n\n(e) If the resolution of a municipality authorizing the issuance of bonds or notes so states, the validity of such bonds or notes may be contested only if an action, suit or proceeding contesting such validity is commenced within sixty days after the date of publication of such resolution.\n\n(f) Prior to the issuance of any bonds and notes, a municipality shall find and determine that the intended use of the proceeds of such bonds and notes is in the public interest and will advance the carrying out of the purposes of this chapter. Such determination shall be based upon a record of proceedings which shall include such matters as the municipality shall consider relevant to such determination.\n\n(g) Any pledge made by the municipality shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made, and the revenues or property so pledged and thereafter received by the municipality shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the municipality, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded.\n\n(h) Neither the officials nor members of the legislative body of the municipality nor any other authorized person executing such notes or bonds shall be subject to any personal liability by reason of the issuance thereof.\n\n(i) The municipality, subject to such agreements with noteholders or bondholders as may then exist, shall have power, out of any funds available therefor, to purchase notes or bonds of the municipality, which shall thereupon be cancelled, at a price not exceeding (1) if the notes or bonds are then redeemable, the redemption price then applicable plus accrued interest to the next interest payment date thereof or (2) if the notes or bonds are not then redeemable, the redemption price applicable on the first date after such purchase upon which the notes or bonds become subject to redemption plus accrued interest to such date.\n\n(j) In the discretion of the municipality, the bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the municipality and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the municipality in relation to the exercise of its powers pursuant to this chapter and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. The municipality may provide by such trust indenture for the payment of the proceeds of the bonds and the revenues to the trustee under such trust indenture or other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the operating expenses of the municipality. If the bonds shall be secured by a trust indenture, the bondholders shall have no authority to appoint a separate trustee to represent them.\n\n(k) Whether or not the notes and bonds are of such form and character as to be negotiable instruments under the terms of the Uniform Commercial Code, the notes and bonds are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, subject only to the provisions of the notes and bonds for registration.\n\n(July Sp.

All moneys held in the capital reserve fund, except as hereinafter provided, shall be used, as required, solely for the payment of the principal of bonds secured by the capital reserve fund as the same mature or the annual sinking fund payments, the purchase or redemption of such bonds, the payment of interest on such bonds or the payment of any redemption premium required to be paid when such bonds are redeemed prior to maturity; provided moneys in such fund shall not be withdrawn therefrom at any time in such amount as would reduce the amount of such fund to less than the maximum capital reserve fund requirement, except for the purposes of paying interest on such bonds, principal of such bonds and annual sinking fund payments, as the same become due and for the payment of which other moneys of the municipality are not available. Any income or interest earned by, or increment to, the capital reserve fund due to the investment thereof or any amount in excess of the maximum capital reserve fund requirement may be transferred by the municipality to other funds or accounts of the municipality established pursuant to this chapter to the extent it does not reduce the amount of the capital reserve fund below the maximum capital reserve fund requirement.\n\n(2) A municipality shall not issue bonds secured by the capital reserve fund at any time if upon issuance the amount in the capital reserve fund will be less than the maximum capital reserve fund requirement, unless the municipality, at the time of issuance of such bonds, shall deposit in such fund from the proceeds of the bonds so to be issued, or otherwise, an amount which, together with the amount then in such fund, will not be less than the maximum capital reserve fund requirement.\n\n(3) In computing the amount of the capital reserve fund for the purposes of this section, securities held as a part thereof shall be valued in the manner provided in the resolution or resolutions authorizing the issuance of bonds secured by the capital reserve fund.\n\n(4) In order to further secure bonds and notes secured by a capital reserve fund and to assure order in its budgeting process, a municipality may, if deemed necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter, include in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds and notes provision for the municipality to covenant and agree with the holders of such bonds and notes that on or before the first day in April in each year the amount necessary to restore the capital reserve fund to the maximum capital reserve fund requirement, as such amount shall be certified by the treasurer or other officer acting as the chief financial officer of the municipality on or before the first day of December next preceding, shall be paid from the general fund of the municipality and shall constitute a legal pledge, charge and lien upon its income and receipts, and next upon its real property, any general statute, special act or municipal charter or ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding. Such covenant and agreement shall constitute a pledge of the credit and taxing power of the municipality and the holders of bonds and notes so secured shall have the specific right to compel the exercise of the taxing power of the municipality. Any provision of this subdivision to the contrary notwithstanding, any such deficiency in the capital reserve fund so certified by the treasurer or other such financial officer of the municipality shall be satisfied first from the revenues of the development property specifically pledged to the payment of bonds or notes secured by such capital reserve fund, and no holder of any such bond or note may bring any action, suit or proceeding, in law or equity, nor compel by mandamus or injunction the exercise of the taxing power of the municipality, or forfeiture of its property, unless and until all remedies with respect to such pledged revenues have been exhausted. The substance and extent of such covenant and agreement shall be plainly stated on the face of each note and bond to which it is applicable. All amounts paid over from the general fund of the municipality as provided in this subdivision shall, subject to the rights of the holders of any notes or bonds of the municipality theretofore or thereafter issued, be repaid to the general fund from (A) moneys in a capital reserve fund in excess of the maximum capital reserve fund requirement, (B) any revenues not required for any other of the purposes of this chapter and (C) proceeds from the sale or other disposition of the development property acquired from the proceeds of bonds and notes secured by such capital reserve fund. Within fourteen days after the adoption of a resolution pursuant to this subdivision, the resolution or a summary of such resolution shall be published in a newspaper having a general circulation within the municipality in which such resolution was adopted. If, within thirty days of such publication, five per cent of the electors of such municipality, who are registered as electors on the last completed, revised registry list of such municipality, file with the clerk of such municipality a petition requesting a referendum with respect to such resolution, the question of approval of such resolution shall be submitted to the electors of such municipality at a special election called for such purpose to be held not less than thirty days, nor more than sixty days, after the filing of such petition, in conformity with the provisions of section 9-369, or if a regular municipal election is to be held more than sixty days, but not more than one hundred twenty days, after the filing of such petition, such question shall be so submitted at such regular election and a vote thereon shall be taken in the manner prescribed by said section 9-369. If a majority of those voting in any such referendum shall vote to approve such resolution, such resolution shall thereupon become effective. If less than a majority of those voting in any such referendum vote to approve such resolution, such resolution shall be null and void. If no such petition is filed within thirty days after the publication of the newspaper notice of adoption of any such resolution, the municipal clerk shall verify that fact to the legislative body of the municipality and such resolution shall thereupon become effective.\n\n(5) Notwithstanding any other provisions contained in this chapter, the aggregate amount of bonds secured by such capital reserve funds authorized to be created and established by this section and by such covenant and agreement of the municipality as set forth in this section shall be included in the debt of the municipality as defined in subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of section 7-374, and shall be subject to the limitations on such debt and on total debt set forth in said subsection (b) of section 7-374, and the aggregate amount of such bonds shall not exceed five per centum of the grand list, as defined in section 7-374, and the proceeds of such bonds shall not be used for residential housing development property, except where such residential housing development property is a part of an undertaking designed to accomplish or further one or more purposes of this chapter in addition to the purpose of residential housing. No bonds shall be secured by a capital reserve fund unless the municipality by resolution or resolutions finds and determines that revenues derived from development property financed from the proceeds of such bonds shall be sufficient (A) to pay the applicable principal of and interest on such bonds, (B) to establish, maintain and increase any reserves deemed by the municipality to be advisable to secure the payment of the principal of and interest on such bonds, (C) unless the contract with the governmental unit or sponsor obligates the governmental unit or sponsor to pay for the maintenance and insurance of such property, to pay the cost of maintaining such property in good repair and keeping it properly insured and (D) to pay such other costs of such property as may be required, and further, in the case of sponsors, that such sponsor is found by the municipality to be financially responsible and presumptively able to comply with the terms and conditions of any lease, conditional sale or credit agreement or loan agreement, agreement of sale, mortgage or other agreement as made by it with the municipality with respect to such property.\n\n(b) The municipality may create and establish such other fund or funds, including other capital reserve funds with the same force and effect and upon the same terms and conditions and subject to the same limitations as provided in subsection (a) of this section, as may be necessary or desirable in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter.\n\n(July Sp.
