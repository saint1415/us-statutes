The commissioner shall use the prequalification classifications established pursuant to section 4a-100 to determine the specific categories of services that contractors may perform after being selected in accordance with this subparagraph and subparagraph (B) of this subdivision and awarded a contract in accordance with subparagraph (C) of this subdivision. The commissioner may establish a separate list for projects involving an expense to the state of less than one million dollars for the purpose of selecting and utilizing the services of small contractors and minority business enterprises, as such terms are defined in section 4a-60g.\n\n(B) The commissioner shall invite contractors to submit qualifications for each specific category of services sought by the department by posting notice of such invitation on the State Contracting Portal.

If the general bidder selected as the general contractor fails to perform the general contractor's agreement to execute a contract in accordance with the terms of the general contractor's general bid and furnish a performance bond and also a labor and materials or payment bond to the amount specified in the general bid form, an award shall be made to the next lowest responsible and qualified general bidder, or, in the case of a contract awarded by the Department of Administrative Services under subdivision (5) of subsection (a) of this section, to the bidder determined in accordance with said subdivision if fewer than three bids are received. No employee of an awarding authority with decision-making authority concerning the award of a contract and no public official, as defined in section 1-79, may communicate with any bidder prior to the award of the contract if the communication results in the bidder receiving information about the contract that is not available to other bidders, except that if the lowest responsible and qualified bidder's price submitted is in excess of funds available to make an award, the awarding authority may negotiate with such bidder and award the contract on the basis of the funds available, without change in the contract specifications, plans and other requirements. If the award of a contract on such basis is refused by such bidder, the awarding authority may negotiate with other contractors who submitted bids in ascending order of bid prices without change in the contract, specifications, plans and other requirements. In the event of negotiation with general bidders as provided in this section, the general bidder involved may negotiate with subcontractors on the same basis, provided such general bidder shall negotiate only with subcontractors named on such general bidder's general bid form.\n\n(c) No person may bid on a contract or perform work pursuant to a contract that is subject to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section unless the person is prequalified in accordance with section 4a-100.\n\n(d) Each bid submitted for a contract described in subsection (c) of this section shall include an update statement in such form as the Commissioner of Administrative Services prescribes and, if required by the public agency soliciting such bid, a copy of the prequalification certificate issued by the Commissioner of Administrative Services.

Any public agency that accepts a bid submitted without a copy of such prequalification certificate, if required by such public agency soliciting such bid, and an update statement, may become ineligible for the receipt of funds related to such bid, except the public agency soliciting such bids may allow bidders no more than two business days after the opening of bids to submit a copy of the prequalification certificate, if required by such public agency, and an update statement.\n\n(e) Any person who bids on a contract described in subsection (c) of this section shall certify under penalty of false statement at the conclusion of the bidding process that the information in the bid is true, that there has been no substantial change in the bidder's financial position or corporate structure since the bidder's most recent prequalification certificate was issued or renewed, other than those changes noted in the update statement, and that the bid was made without fraud or collusion with any person.\n\n(f) Any person who receives information from a state employee or public official that is not available to the general public concerning any construction, reconstruction, alteration, remodeling, repair or demolition project on a public building or any other public work prior to the date that a notice for bids on the project is posted shall be disqualified from bidding on the project.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter regarding competitive bidding procedures, the commissioner may select and interview at least three responsible and qualified general contractors who are prequalified pursuant to section 4a-100 and submit the three selected contractors to the construction services award panels process described in section 4b-100a and any regulation adopted by the commissioner. The commissioner may negotiate with the successful bidder a contract which is both fair and reasonable to the state for a community court project, the downtown Hartford higher education center project, a correctional facility project, a juvenile residential center project, or a student residential facility for the Connecticut State University System that is a priority higher education facility project. The Commissioner of Administrative Services, prior to entering any such contract or performing any work on such project, shall submit such contract to the State Properties Review Board for review and approval or disapproval by the board, pursuant to subsection (i) of this section. Any general contractor awarded a contract pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to the same requirements concerning the furnishing of bonds as a contractor awarded a contract pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(h) Any agency that seeks to have a project awarded without being subject to competitive bidding procedures shall certify to the joint committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to government administration and elections that the project is of such an emergency nature that an exception to the competitive bidding procedures of this section is required. Such certification shall include input from all affected agencies, detail the need for the exception and include any relevant documentation.\n\n(i) In the event that the General Assembly approves legislation authorizing an exception to the competitive bidding process for a project, the State Properties Review Board shall complete a review of the contract for such project and approve or disapprove such contract no later than thirty days after the Commissioner of Administrative Services submits such contract to the board. Such review shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of section 4b-3. In the event that such review does not occur within the thirty-day period prescribed by this subsection, such contract shall be deemed to be approved.\n\n(j) No person whose subcontract exceeds one million dollars in value may perform work as a subcontractor on a project for the construction, reconstruction, alteration, remodeling, repair or demolition of any public building or any other public work by the state or a municipality, except a public highway or bridge project or any other construction project administered by the Department of Transportation, which project is estimated to cost more than one million dollars and is paid for, in whole or in part, with state funds, unless, at the time of the bid submission, the person is prequalified in accordance with section 4a-100. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the downtown Hartford higher education center project.\n\n(k) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the Commissioner of Administrative Services may purchase equipment, supplies, materials or other property or services under sections 4a-53 and 4a-66 as required to fulfill his or her responsibilities under this chapter.\n\n(P.A. 73-528, S. 1, 12; P.A. 74-246, S. 1, 11; P.A. 75-425, S. 23, 57; P.A. 77-614, S. 73, 610; P.A. 82-438, S. 5, 6; 82-447, S. 1; P.A. 84-48, S. 12, 17; P.A. 87-496, S. 41, 110; 87-529, S. 5; P.A. 88-116, S. 4; P.A. 89-353, S. 3, 8; P.A. 92-228, S. 6, 9; P.A. 93-30, S. 4, 14; May Sp.
