The board, not later than ninety days after the receipt of the decision of the Commissioner of Administrative Services, shall either accept, reject or request modification of such decision, except that when more time is required, the board may have a ninety-day extension of time, provided the board shall advise the Commissioner of Administrative Services in writing as to the reasons for such extension of time. If such decision is disapproved by the board, it shall so inform the commissioner along with its reasons therefor, and the commissioner shall inform the head of the requesting agency and the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management that its request has been rejected. If such decision is approved by the board it shall inform the commissioner of such approval and the commissioner shall immediately communicate his decision to the head or acting head of such governmental unit and to the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and shall set forth the procedures to be taken to accomplish the results of such decision. The decision to make public such decision shall rest solely with the Commissioner of Administrative Services both as to time and manner of disclosure, but in no event shall such period exceed one year. The commissioner shall, when he or she deems it to be in the public interest, authorize the disclosure of such information; however, in the absence of such authorization, any unauthorized disclosure shall be subject to the criminal provisions of section 4b-27. All decisions made by the commissioner under the provisions of this section shall require review by the board. Except as otherwise hereinafter provided, the approval or disapproval of the Properties Review Board shall be binding on the commissioner and the requesting agency with regard to the acquisition of any real estate by lease or otherwise, notwithstanding any other statute or special act to the contrary. A majority vote of the board shall be required to accept or reject a decision of the commissioner.\n\n(f) Not later than forty-five days after the date of the board's decision regarding the request of a governmental unit, the head or acting head of such unit shall notify the Commissioner of Administrative Services (1) that it accepts the commissioner's decision, (2) that it rejects the commissioner's decision and withdraws its request, or (3) that it does not approve such decision and requests that all or part of such decision be modified by the commissioner. When such modification is requested, the Commissioner of Administrative Services shall, not later than three weeks after receipt of such request, consider and act upon such request for modification and submit his or her decision to the Properties Review Board. If the commissioner and the board fail to agree to such modification in whole or in part, the governmental unit may, not later than ten days after the date of notification of such final decision, accept the commissioner's final decision, reject such decision and withdraw its request, or appeal to the Governor. Upon such appeal, the Commissioner of Administrative Services shall submit a report to the Governor stating the board's conclusions and supporting material therefor and the governmental agency shall submit a report to the Governor stating its objections to such decision and its supporting material therefor. The Governor shall, not later than thirty days after the receipt of such reports, make a decision which shall be binding on the parties involved. In the absence of any such appeal or withdrawal of request, the decision of the commissioner and the board shall be final and binding upon the governmental unit.\n\n(g) After final action is taken approving any request or modification thereof, condemnation procedures shall continue to be prosecuted in the same manner as they were on July 1, 1975, by the agency involved, where such procedures are applicable and authorized by statute.\n\n(h) Approval by the Properties Review Board shall not be required prior to State Bond Commission authorization of funds (1) for planning costs and other preliminary expenses for any construction or acquisition project, or (2) for any construction or acquisition project for which an architect was selected prior to July 1, 1975.\n\n(i) As used in this subsection, (1) “project” means any state program, except the downtown Hartford higher education center project, as defined in section 4b-55, requiring consultant services if the cost of such services is estimated to exceed one hundred thousand dollars or, in the case of a constituent unit of the state system of higher education, the cost of such services is estimated to exceed three hundred thousand dollars, or in the case of a building or premises under the supervision of the Office of the Chief Court Administrator or property where the Judicial Department is the primary occupant, the cost of such services is estimated to exceed three hundred thousand dollars; (2) “consultant” means “consultant” as defined in section 4b-55; and (3) “consultant services” means “consultant services” as defined in section 4b-55.

The Properties Review Board shall, not later than thirty days after receipt of such selection of or contract with any consultant, approve or disapprove the selection of or contract with any consultant made by the Commissioner of Administrative Services pursuant to sections 4b-1 and 4b-55 to 4b-59, inclusive. If upon the expiration of the thirty-day period a decision has not been made, the Properties Review Board shall be deemed to have approved such selection or contract.\n\n(j) The Properties Review Board shall, not later than thirty days after receipt, approve or disapprove the proposed acquisition by lease of any residential property by the Commissioner of Developmental Services pursuant to subsection (d) of section 4b-3. If upon the expiration of such thirty-day period a decision has not been made, the Properties Review Board shall be deemed to have approved such lease.\n\n(k) Any agency or department of state government requiring additional facilities not included in the state facility plan may submit a request to the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management outlining the justification for its request. The agency or department shall also provide (1) in the case of a request not previously submitted to the secretary pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the reasons why it was not so submitted, and (2) in the case of a request so submitted, sufficient new information to warrant reconsideration.

Subsections (b) to (d), inclusive, of this section shall not apply to the review of such requests. Any such request for additional facilities which are determined by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management to be of emergency nature or the lack of which may seriously hinder the efficient operation of the state, may be approved by the Properties Review Board and the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and shall be known as an approval made during the interim between state facility plans. No action may be taken by the state to lease or construct such additional facilities unless the secretary makes such a determination.\n\n(l) The Commissioner of Administrative Services shall monitor the amount of leased space being requested and the costs of all proposed and approved facility project actions and, in the case of space or facility projects for which bond funds were authorized, shall advise the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and the Governor when the space to be leased or the forecast costs to complete the project exceed the square footage amount or the cost levels in the approved state facility plan by ten per cent or more. Approval of the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, the Properties Review Board, the State Bond Commission and the Governor shall be required to continue the project.\n\n(m) (1) Plans to construct, renovate or modify state-owned or occupied buildings shall provide for a portion of the total planned floor area of newly constructed state buildings or buildings constructed specifically for use by the state to be served by renewable sources of energy, including solar, wind, water and biomass sources, for use in space heating and cooling, domestic hot water and other applications. For the plan due December 1, 1979, the portion to be served by renewable energy sources shall be not less than five per cent of total planned new floor area. For each succeeding state facilities plan submitted after December 1, 1979, the portion of the total planned floor area of any additional newly constructed state buildings or buildings constructed specifically for use by the state to be served by renewable energy sources shall be increased by at least five per cent per year until a goal of fifty per cent of total planned floor area of any additional newly constructed state buildings or buildings constructed specifically for use by the state is reached. For any facility served by renewable energy sources in accordance with this subsection, not less than thirty per cent of the total energy requirements of any specific energy application, including, but not limited to, space heating or cooling and providing domestic hot water, shall be provided by renewable energy sources. The installation in newly constructed state buildings or buildings constructed specifically for use by the state of systems using renewable energy sources in accordance with this subsection, shall be subject to a life-cycle cost analysis.
