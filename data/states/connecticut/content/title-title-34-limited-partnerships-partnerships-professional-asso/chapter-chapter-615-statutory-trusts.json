      "text": "(a) A foreign statutory trust transacting business in this state may not maintain an action, suit or proceeding in a court of this state until it has registered in this state.\n\n(b) The failure of a foreign statutory trust to register in this state does not: (1) Impair the validity of any contract or act of the foreign statutory trust; (2) affect the right of any other party to the contract to maintain any action, suit or proceeding on the contract; or (3) prevent the foreign statutory trust from defending any action, suit or proceeding in any court of this state.\n\n(c) A foreign statutory trust, by transacting business in this state without a certificate of registration, appoints the Secretary of the State as its agent for service of process with respect to a cause of action arising out of the transaction of business in this state.\n\n(d) A foreign statutory trust which transacts business in this state without a valid certificate of registration shall be liable to this state, for each year or part thereof during which it transacted business in this state without such certificate, in an amount equal to: (1) All fees and taxes which would have been imposed by law upon such statutory trust had it duly applied for and received such registration to transact business in this state, and (2) all interest and penalties imposed by law for failure to pay such fees and taxes. A foreign statutory trust is further liable to this state, for each month or part thereof during which it transacted business without a valid certificate of registration, in an amount equal to three hundred dollars, except that a foreign statutory trust which has registered with the Secretary of the State not later than ninety days after it has commenced transacting business in this state shall not be liable for such monthly penalty. Such fees and penalties may be levied by the Secretary of the State. The Attorney General may bring proceedings to recover all amounts due this state under the provisions of this subsection not later than three years after the date of the levy assessed by the Secretary of the State.\n\n(e) The civil penalty set forth in subsection (d) of this section may be recovered in an action brought by the Attorney General. Upon a finding by the court that a foreign statutory trust has transacted business in this state in violation of sections 34-500 to 34-547, inclusive, the court shall, in addition to imposing a civil penalty, issue an injunction restraining further transaction of business by the foreign statutory trust and the further exercise of any rights and privileges of a statutory trust in this state. The foreign statutory trust shall be enjoined from transacting business in this state until all civil penalties, plus any interest and court costs which the court may assess, have been paid and until the foreign statutory trust has otherwise complied with the provisions of said sections.\n\n(f) A beneficiary of a foreign statutory trust is not liable for the debts and obligations of the statutory trust because that statutory trust transacted business in this state without a valid certificate of registration.\n\n(P.A. 96-271, S. 247, 254; P.A. 97-228, S. 6, 7; P.A. 98-137, S. 25, 62; 98-219, S. 33, 34; P.A. 09-83, S. 6; P.A. 24-111, S. 47.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 96-271 effective October 1, 1997; P.A. 97-228 deleted Subsec.

(d) to revise provision re grace period by providing that a foreign statutory trust is not liable for the monthly penalty if it has registered “not later than ninety days after it has commenced transacting” business in this state rather than not being liable “for the first three months or part thereof during which it transacted business without such certificate”, effective July 1, 1998; P.A. 98-219 revised effective date of P.A. 98-137, but without affecting this section; P.A. 09-83 amended Subsec. (d) to increase penalty from $165 to $300 for each month or part thereof that a foreign statutory trust transacts business without a certificate of registration and to make a technical change; P.A. 24-111 amended Subsec. (d) to add that proceedings by Attorney General to recover amounts due the state may be brought not later than 3 years after date of levy assessed by Secretary of the State, effective June 4, 2024.",
