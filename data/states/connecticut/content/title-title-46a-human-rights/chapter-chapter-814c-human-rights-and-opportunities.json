As used in this subdivision, “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when (A) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment, (B) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or (C) such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment;\n\n(9) For an employer, by the employer or the employer's agent, for an employment agency, by itself or its agent, or for any labor organization, by itself or its agent, to request or require information from an employee, person seeking employment or member relating to the individual's child-bearing age or plans, pregnancy, function of the individual's reproductive system, use of birth control methods, or the individual's familial responsibilities, unless such information is directly related to a bona fide occupational qualification or need, provided an employer, through a physician may request from an employee any such information which is directly related to workplace exposure to substances which may cause birth defects or constitute a hazard to an individual's reproductive system or to a fetus if the employer first informs the employee of the hazards involved in exposure to such substances;\n\n(10) For an employer, by the employer or the employer's agent, after informing an employee, pursuant to subdivision (9) of this subsection, of a workplace exposure to substances which may cause birth defects or constitute a hazard to an employee's reproductive system or to a fetus, to fail or refuse, upon the employee's request, to take reasonable measures to protect the employee from the exposure or hazard identified, or to fail or refuse to inform the employee that the measures taken may be the subject of a complaint filed under the provisions of this chapter. Nothing in this subdivision is intended to prohibit an employer from taking reasonable measures to protect an employee from exposure to such substances. For the purpose of this subdivision, “reasonable measures” are those measures which are consistent with business necessity and are least disruptive of the terms and conditions of the employee's employment;\n\n(11) For an employer, by the employer or the employer's agent, for an employment agency, by itself or its agent, or for any labor organization, by itself or its agent: (A) To request or require genetic information from an employee, person seeking employment or member, or (B) to discharge, expel or otherwise discriminate against any person on the basis of genetic information. For the purpose of this subdivision, “genetic information” means the information about genes, gene products or inherited characteristics that may derive from an individual or a family member;\n\n(12) For an employer, by the employer or the employer's agent, to request or require a prospective employee's age, date of birth, dates of attendance at or date of graduation from an educational institution on an initial employment application, provided the provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to any employer requesting or requiring such information (A) based on a bona fide occupational qualification or need, or (B) when such information is required to comply with any provision of state or federal law; and\n\n(13) (A) For an employer or the employer's agent to deny an employee a reasonable leave of absence in order to: (i) Seek attention for injuries caused by domestic violence including for a child who is a victim of domestic violence, provided the employee is not the perpetrator of the domestic violence against the child; (ii) obtain services including safety planning from a domestic violence agency or rape crisis center, as those terms are defined in section 52-146k, as a result of domestic violence; (iii) obtain psychological counseling related to an incident or incidents of domestic violence, including for a child who is a victim of domestic violence, provided the employee is not the perpetrator of the domestic violence against the child; (iv) take other actions to increase safety from future incidents of domestic violence, including temporary or permanent relocation; or (v) obtain legal services, assisting in the prosecution of the offense, or otherwise participate in legal proceedings in relation to the incident or incidents of domestic violence.\n\n(B) An employee who is absent from work in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision shall, within a reasonable time after the absence, provide a certification to the employer when requested by the employer. Such certification shall be in the form of: (i) A police report indicating that the employee or the employee's child was a victim of domestic violence; (ii) a court order protecting or separating the employee or employee's child from the perpetrator of an act of domestic violence; (iii) other evidence from the court or prosecuting attorney that the employee appeared in court; or (iv) documentation from a medical professional, domestic violence counselor, as defined in section 52-146k, or other health care provider, that the employee or the employee's child was receiving services, counseling or treatment for physical or mental injuries or abuse resulting in victimization from an act of domestic violence.\n\n(C) Where an employee has a physical or mental disability resulting from an incident or series of incidents of domestic violence, such employee shall be treated in the same manner as an employee with any other disability.\n\n(D) To the extent permitted by law, employers shall maintain the confidentiality of any information regarding an employee's status as a victim of domestic violence.\n\n(c) (1) The provisions of this section concerning age shall not apply to: (A) The termination of employment of any person with a contract of unlimited tenure at an independent institution of higher education who is mandatorily retired, on or before July 1, 1993, after having attained the age of seventy; (B) the termination of employment of any person who has attained the age of sixty-five and who, for the two years immediately preceding such termination, is employed in a bona fide executive or a high policy-making position, if such person is entitled to an immediate nonforfeitable annual retirement benefit under a pension, profit-sharing, savings or deferred compensation plan, or any combination of such plans, from such person's employer, which equals, in aggregate, at least forty-four thousand dollars; (C) the termination of employment of persons in occupations, including police work and fire-fighting, in which age is a bona fide occupational qualification; (D) the operation of any bona fide apprenticeship system or plan; or (E) the observance of the terms of a bona fide seniority system or any bona fide employee benefit plan for retirement, pensions or insurance which is not adopted for the purpose of evading said provisions, except that no such plan may excuse the failure to hire any individual and no such system or plan may require or permit the termination of employment on the basis of age. No such plan which covers less than twenty employees may reduce the group hospital, surgical or medical insurance coverage provided under the plan to any employee who has reached the age of sixty-five and is eligible for Medicare benefits or any employee's spouse who has reached age sixty-five and is eligible for Medicare benefits except to the extent such coverage is provided by Medicare. The terms of any such plan which covers twenty or more employees shall entitle any employee who has attained the age of sixty-five and any employee's spouse who has attained the age of sixty-five to group hospital, surgical or medical insurance coverage under the same conditions as any covered employee or spouse who is under the age of sixty-five.\n\n(2) No employee retirement or pension plan may exclude any employee from membership in such plan or cease or reduce the employee's benefit accruals or allocations under such plan on the basis of age. The provisions of this subdivision shall be applicable to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1988, except that for any collectively bargained plan this subdivision shall be applicable on the earlier of (A) January 1, 1990, or (B) the later of (i) the expiration date of the collective bargaining agreement, or (ii) January 1, 1988.\n\n(3) The provisions of this section concerning age shall not prohibit an employer from requiring medical examinations for employees for the purpose of determining such employees' physical qualification for continued employment.\n\n(4) Any employee who continues employment beyond the normal retirement age in the applicable retirement or pension plan shall give notice of intent to retire, in writing, to such employee's employer not less than thirty days prior to the date of such retirement.\n\n(d) (1) An employer shall provide written notice of the right to be free from discrimination in relation to pregnancy, childbirth and related conditions, including the right to a reasonable accommodation to the known limitations related to pregnancy pursuant to subdivision (7) of subsection (b) of this section to: (A) New employees at the commencement of employment; (B) existing employees within one hundred twenty days of October 1, 2017; and (C) any employee who notifies the employer of her pregnancy within ten days of such notification. An employer may comply with the provisions of this section by displaying a poster in a conspicuous place, accessible to employees, at the employer's place of business that contains the information required by this section in both English and Spanish. The Labor Commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to establish additional requirements concerning the means by which employers shall provide such notice.\n\n(2) The Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities shall develop courses of instruction and conduct ongoing public education efforts as necessary to inform employers, employees, employment agencies and persons seeking employment about their rights and responsibilities under this section.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 7405; 1955, S. 3035d; 1959, P.A. 145, S. 3; 1963, P.A. 261; 1967, P.A. 426, S. 2; P.A. 73-279, S. 14; 73-647; P.A. 75-350, S. 2; 75-446, S. 2; P.A. 78-148, S. 10; 78-350, S. 1, 6; P.A. 79-152; 79-303; 79-304, S. 1; 79-480, S. 1; P.A. 80-285; 80-422, S. 9; P.A. 81-382, S. 2; P.A. 82-196, S. 1; P.A. 86-381; P.A. 88-303, S. 3, 6; P.A. 89-147, S. 1, 3; P.A. 90-88, S. 3; 90-330, S. 3, 11; P.A. 98-180; P.A. 01-28, S. 8; P.A. 11-55, S. 24; 11-129, S. 20; P.A. 17-118, S. 1; 17-127, S. 4; P.A. 19-16, S. 4; 19-93, S. 8; P.A. 21-69, S. 1; P.A. 22-78, S. 7, 8; 22-82, S. 10.)\n\nHistory: 1959 act specified that discrimination based on age is unfair employment practice in Subdivs. (a), (b), (c) and (f), added exception re bona fide occupational qualification or need in Subdiv.

(7): There is a public policy against sex discrimination in employment sufficiently expressed in statutory and constitutional law to permit a cause of action for wrongful discharge; although Sec. 46a-51(10) excludes many employers from the requirements of the act, the clear public policy against sex discrimination transcends the exclusion. 64 CA 573.

Although no private organization is duty-bound to offer its services and facilities to all comers, once such an organization has determined to eschew selectivity, under statute it may not discriminate among the general public; accordingly, coverage under Subsec. depends, in each case, upon extent to which a particular establishment has maintained a private relationship with its own constituency or a general relationship with the public at large; Connecticut courts, in construing state antidiscrimination statutes that have similar federal counterparts, have looked to federal case law for guidance, even though federal and state statutes may differ somewhat; under certain circumstances, federal law defines the beginning and not the end of state's approach to the subject; consequently, on occasion, state courts have interpreted statutes even more broadly than their counterparts, to provide even greater protections to state citizens, especially in the area of civil rights. 99 CA 839.",

If the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities is unable to complete its investigation or make a final administrative determination within such time frames, it shall notify the complainant and the respondent in writing of the reasons for not doing so.\n\n(g) Any person who violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of a class D misdemeanor.\n\n(P.A. 90-246, S. 5; P.A. 91-407, S. 1, 42; P.A. 92-257, S. 2; P.A. 07-217, S. 168; P.A. 11-55, S. 26, 27; P.A. 12-80, S. 95; P.A. 17-127, S. 6; P.A. 22-82, S. 14.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 91-407 added references to “learning disability” (Revisor's note: In Subsec. (a)(4)(B), numeric indicators within Subpara. (B) were changed editorially by the Revisors to lower case Roman numerals for consistency with usage elsewhere in section); P.A. 92-257 amended Subsec. (b) by adding “single-family” before “dwelling” and “unit” after “dwelling”, adding “to the extent they utilize shared bathroom facilities when such sleeping accommodations are” after “sleeping accommodations” and adding phrase “based on considerations of privacy and modesty”; P.A. 07-217 made a technical change in Subsec. (g), effective July 12, 2007; P.A. 11-55 amended Subsecs. (a) and (e) to add references to gender identity or expression; P.A. 12-80 amended Subsec. (g) to replace penalty of a fine of not less than $25 or more than $100 or imprisonment of not more than 30 days or both with a class D misdemeanor; P.A. 17-127 amended Subsecs. (a) and (e) to add “status as a veteran”, and make technical changes; P.A. 22-82 amended Subsec. (a)(1) by adding “status as a victim of domestic violence” and by making technical changes.\n\nIn light of the nondiscriminatory purpose for which statute was enacted, a landlord may not rely solely on section 8 eligibility as basis for turning potential tenants away nor may it apply more stringent income requirements to section 8 rental applicants than to other rental applicants; federal law does not preempt statute; federal statute has no express preemption clause, does not occupy the field so comprehensively as to prohibit states from acting in the arena of low income housing assistance, and state program advances remedial purpose of the federal law; allowing an exception to antidiscrimination provisions for those landlords who refuse to use required section 8 lease would eviscerate the basic protection envisioned by statute. 250 C. 763. A violation of Subsec. (a)(3) does not require discriminatory animus, nor does it require a rejection of or disfavoring a lawful source of income, it bars statements that a reasonable listener would understand to convey an intention to make any such “preference, limitation, or discrimination”. 343 C. 31.\n\nCited. 45 CA 1.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\nException provided in Subdiv. (5) for insufficient income affords a landlord opportunity to determine whether, for reasons extrinsic to the section 8 housing assistance, a potential tenant lacks income sufficient to assure that rent will be paid promptly and other obligations of tenancy will be met. 250 C. 763.\n\nSubsec. (f):\n\nTrial court improperly granted defendants' motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, there being no evidence that legislature, in imposing time limitation in Subsec., intended for time limitation to serve as a jurisdictional bar; although use of “shall” reflected legislature's intent to have commission fulfill its obligation to investigate and issue final determination within time limitation set forth in Subsec., that obligation must be read in conjunction with statutory proviso “unless it is impracticable to do so”, an indication of legislature's intention to provide a condition under which commission's noncompliance is excused. 273 C. 373.",

The respondent shall either (1) file a written answer to the complaint as provided in subsection (b) of this section, or (2) not later than ten days after the date of receipt of the complaint, provide written notice to the complainant and the commission that the respondent has elected to participate in pre-answer conciliation, except that a discriminatory practice complaint alleging a violation of section 46a-64c or 46a-81e shall not be subject to pre-answer conciliation. A complaint sent by first class mail shall be considered to be received not later than two days after the date of mailing, unless the respondent proves otherwise. The commission shall conduct a pre-answer conciliation conference not later than thirty days after the date of receiving the respondent's request for pre-answer conciliation.\n\n(b) Except as provided in this subsection, not later than thirty days after the date (1) of receipt of the complaint, or (2) on which the commission determines that the pre-answer conciliation conference was unsuccessful, the respondent shall file a written answer to the complaint, under oath, with the commission. The respondent may request, and the commission may grant, one extension of time of not more than fifteen days within which to file a written answer to the complaint. An answer to any amendment to a complaint shall be filed within twenty days of the date of receipt to such amendment. The answer to any complaint alleging a violation of section 46a-64c or 46a-81e shall be filed not later than ten days after the date of receipt of the complaint.\n\n(c) Not later than sixty days after the date of the filing of the respondent's answer, the executive director or the executive director's designee shall conduct a case assessment review to determine whether the complaint should be retained for further processing or dismissed because (1) it fails to state a claim for relief or is frivolous on its face, (2) the respondent is exempt from the provisions of this chapter, or (3) there is no reasonable possibility that investigating the complaint will result in a finding of reasonable cause. The case assessment review shall include the complaint, the respondent's answer and the responses to the commission's requests for information, and the complainant's comments, if any, to the respondent's answer and information responses. The executive director or the executive director's designee shall send notice of any action taken pursuant to the case assessment review in accordance with section 46a-86a. For any complaint dismissed pursuant to this subsection, the executive director or the executive director's designee shall issue a release of jurisdiction allowing the complainant to bring a civil action under section 46a-100. This subsection and subsection (e) of this section shall not apply to any complaint alleging a violation of section 46a-64c or 46a-81e. The executive director shall report the results of the case assessment reviews made pursuant to this subsection to the commission quarterly during each year.\n\n(d) Not later than sixty days after the date of sending notice that a complaint has been retained after a case assessment review, the executive director or the executive director's designee shall assign an investigator or commission legal counsel to hold a mandatory mediation conference. A mediation conference may but need not be held if the commission has held a pre-answer conciliation conference. The investigator or commission legal counsel assigned to conduct the mediation shall not be assigned to investigate the complaint. The mandatory mediation conference may not be scheduled for the same time as a fact-finding conference held pursuant to subsection (f) of this section. The mediator may hold additional mediation conferences to accommodate settlement discussions.\n\n(e) If the complaint is not resolved after the mandatory mediation conference, the complainant, the respondent or the commission may at any time after such conference request early legal intervention. If a request for early legal intervention is made, a commission legal counsel shall determine not later than ninety days after the date of the request whether the complaint should be (1) heard pursuant to section 46a-84, (2) processed pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, or (3) released from the jurisdiction of the commission. In making such determination, commission legal counsel may hold additional proceedings and may utilize and direct commission staff. If a commission legal counsel determines that the complaint should be processed pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, the commission legal counsel may recommend that the investigator make a finding of no reasonable cause. The investigator shall make such a finding unless the investigator believes the commission legal counsel made a mistake of fact. If the investigator intends to make a finding of reasonable cause after the commission legal counsel recommends otherwise, the investigator shall consult with the commission legal counsel.\n\n(f) Not later than fifteen days after the date of (1) a mandatory mediation conference that fails to resolve a complaint, or (2) an early legal intervention decision to investigate a complaint, the executive director or the executive director's designee shall assign an investigator to process the complaint. The investigator may process the complaint by any lawful means of finding facts, including, but not limited to, a fact-finding conference, individual witness interviews, requests for voluntary disclosure of information, subpoenas of witnesses or documents, requests for admission of facts, interrogatories, site visits or any combination of these means for the purpose of determining whether there is reasonable cause for believing that a discriminatory practice has been or is being committed as alleged in the complaint. As used in this section and section 46a-84, “reasonable cause” means a bona fide belief that the material issues of fact are such that a person of ordinary caution, prudence and judgment could believe the facts alleged in the complaint.\n\n(g) (1) Before issuing a finding of reasonable cause or no reasonable cause, the investigator shall afford each party and each party's representative an opportunity to provide written or oral comments on all evidence in the commission's file, except as otherwise provided by federal law or the general statutes. The investigator shall consider such comments before making a finding. The investigator shall make a finding of reasonable cause or no reasonable cause in writing and shall list the factual findings on which it is based not later than one hundred ninety days from the date of the case assessment review, except that for good cause shown, the executive director or the executive director's designee may grant no more than two extensions of the investigation of three months each.\n\n(2) If the investigator makes a finding that there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of section 46a-64c has occurred, the complainant and the respondent shall have twenty days from sending of the reasonable cause finding to elect a civil action in lieu of an administrative hearing pursuant to section 46a-84. If either the complainant or the respondent requests a civil action, the commission, through the Attorney General or a commission legal counsel, shall commence an action pursuant to subsection (b) of section 46a-89, not later than ninety days after the date of receipt of the notice of election. If the Attorney General or a commission legal counsel believes that injunctive relief, punitive damages or a civil penalty would be appropriate, such relief, damages or penalty may also be sought. The jurisdiction of the Superior Court in an action brought under this subdivision shall be limited to such claims, counterclaims, defenses or the like that could be presented at an administrative hearing before the commission, had the complaint remained with the commission for disposition. A complainant may intervene as a matter of right in a civil action without permission of the court or the parties. If the Attorney General or commission legal counsel, as the case may be, determines that the interests of the state will not be adversely affected, the complainant or attorney for the complainant shall present all or part of the case in support of the complaint. If the Attorney General or a commission legal counsel determines that a material mistake of law or fact has been made in the finding of reasonable cause, the Attorney General or a commission legal counsel may decline to bring a civil action and shall remand the file to the investigator for further action. The investigator shall complete any such action not later than ninety days after receipt of such file.\n\n(h) If the investigator issues a finding of no reasonable cause or if the complaint is dismissed pursuant to subsection (m) of this section, the complainant may file a written request for reconsideration with the executive director or the executive director's designee, not later than fifteen days from the sending of such finding or dismissal. A request for reconsideration shall state specifically the reasons why reconsideration should be granted. A commission legal counsel shall grant or reject reconsideration not later than ninety days after the date of the sending of such finding or dismissal. A commission legal counsel shall conduct such additional proceedings as may be necessary to render a decision on the request.\n\n(i) After finding that there is reasonable cause to believe that a discriminatory practice has been or is being committed as alleged in the complaint, an investigator shall attempt to eliminate the practice complained of by conference, conciliation and persuasion not later than fifty days after the date of the finding. The refusal to accept a settlement shall not be grounds for dismissal of any complaint.\n\n(j) No commissioner or employee of the commission may disclose, except to the parties or their representatives, what has occurred in the course of the commission's processing of a complaint, provided the commission may publish the facts in the case and any complaint that has been dismissed and the terms of conciliation when a complaint has been adjusted. Each party and his or her representative shall have the right to inspect and copy documents, statements of witnesses and other evidence pertaining to the complaint, except as otherwise provided by federal law or the general statutes.\n\n(k) In the investigation of any complaint filed pursuant to this chapter, commission legal counsel may issue subpoenas requiring the production of records and other documents or compelling the attendance of witnesses.\n\n(l) The executive director or the executive director's designee may enter an order of default against a respondent who (1) after notice, fails to answer a complaint in accordance with subsection (a) of this section or within such extension of time as may have been granted; (2) fails to answer interrogatories issued pursuant to subdivision (11) of section 46a-54 or fails to respond to a subpoena issued pursuant to subsection (k) of this section or subdivision (9) of section 46a-54, provided the executive director or the executive director's designee shall consider any timely filed objection; (3) after notice and without good cause, fails to attend a fact-finding conference; or (4) after notice and without good cause, fails to attend a mandatory mediation conference. The respondent may make application to the executive director to vacate the default. Upon entry of an order of default or upon the decision of the executive director not to vacate the default, the executive director or the executive director's designee shall appoint a presiding officer to enter, after notice and hearing, an order eliminating the discriminatory practice complained of and making the complainant whole. The commission or the complainant may petition the Superior Court for enforcement of any order for relief pursuant to section 46a-95.\n\n(m) The executive director or the executive director's designee may enter an order of dismissal against a complainant who (1) after notice and without good cause, fails to attend a fact-finding conference; (2) after notice and without good cause, fails to attend a mandatory mediation conference; or (3) refuses to accept an offer of settlement where the respondent has eliminated the discriminatory practice complained of, taken steps to prevent a like occurrence in the future and offered full relief to the complainant.\n\n(P.A. 80-422, S. 31; P.A. 89-332, S. 4, 7; P.A. 90-246, S. 10; P.A. 91-58, S. 29; 91-302, S. 3, 5; P.A. 92-257, S. 3; P.A. 94-238, S. 1, 6; May 25 Sp.

The complainant or the complainant's attorney may request a release from the commission if the complaint is still pending after the expiration of one hundred eighty days from the date of its filing or after a case assessment review in accordance with subsection (c) of section 46a-83, whichever is earlier.

In light ofAmes v. Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, 267 Conn. 524, and a close reading of text of section in relation to other related human rights statutes, section does not authorize an award of punitive damages in employment discrimination cases. 324 C. 470.\n\nCited. 44 CA 446. Court did not abuse its discretion by awarding plaintiff attorney's fees because jury found defendant created hostile work environment in violation of Sec. 46a-60 and awarded punitive damages. 117 CA 680. The legislature did not, either expressly or by force of a necessary implication, statutorily waive the state's sovereign immunity from liability for punitive damages under the fair employment practices act. 118 CA 65. Section does not explicitly authorize award of punitive damages, therefore plaintiff is not entitled to such relief under section; despite use of the phrase “including, but not limited to” to modify the phrase “legal and equitable relief”, section already explicitly authorizes award of attorney's fees and litigation costs, and awarding punitive damages would provide plaintiff with double recovery and alter the settled common-law rule limiting punitive damages to a single recovery of litigation expenses, and there is no clear intent by the legislature to provide multiple recovery of attorney's fees and litigation costs under section. 157 CA 312; judgment affirmed, see 324 C. 470.",
