For the purposes of sections 46a-11a to 46a-11g, inclusive, the determination of intellectual disability may be made by means of a review of records and shall not require the commissioner to conduct a full psychological examination of the person. Any delay in making such determination of intellectual disability shall not delay the investigation of abuse or neglect or recommendation of provision of protective services. The evaluation shall include a visit to the named person with intellectual disability and consultation with those individuals having knowledge of the facts of the particular case. All state, local and private agencies shall have a duty to cooperate with any investigation conducted by the Department of Developmental Services under this section, including the release of complete records of the named person for review, inspection and copying, except where the person with intellectual disability refuses to permit such records to be released.
