Not later than twenty days after the date the notice was mailed or sent by electronic mail, the applicant may submit additional information to the commissioner with a request for reconsideration. The commissioner shall issue a final determination regarding the application not later than ninety days after the date the commissioner mailed or sent by electronic mail the notice of the preliminary determination, which ninety-day period may be extended for an additional period not to exceed ninety days if (1) the commissioner gives written notice to the applicant that the commissioner requires additional time, and (2) such notice is mailed or sent by electronic mail during the initial ninety-day period.\n\n(i) The commissioner may not issue or renew a prequalification certificate to any contractor or substantial subcontractor (1) who is disqualified pursuant to section 31-57c or 31-57d, or (2) who has a principal or key personnel who, within the past five years, has a conviction or has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere for or has admitted to commission of an act or omission that reasonably could have resulted in disqualification pursuant to any provision of subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, of subsection (d) of section 31-57c or subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, of subsection (d) of section 31-57d, as determined by the commissioner.\n\n(j) The commissioner may revoke a contractor's or substantial subcontractor's prequalification or reduce the contractor's or substantial subcontractor's prequalification classification or aggregate work capacity ratings, after an opportunity for a hearing, if the commissioner receives additional information that supports such revocation or reduction. During the course of such hearing process, the commissioner may suspend a contractor's or substantial subcontractor's prequalification certificate if the commissioner determines that there is probable cause to believe that such contractor or substantial subcontractor engaged in conduct that significantly undermines the skill, ability or integrity of such contractor or substantial subcontractor. Any such suspension shall not exceed a period of three months and shall be accompanied by a written decision of the commissioner that sets forth the reasons for and duration of such suspension. The commissioner shall send notification of any such suspension to such contractor or substantial subcontractor by certified mail, return receipt requested. Such contractor or substantial subcontractor may file a response, in writing, not later than thirty days after receipt of such notice. The commissioner shall review any such response submitted by a contractor or substantial subcontractor within such thirty-day period.\n\n(k) (1) Any substantial evidence of fraud in obtaining or maintaining prequalification or any materially false statement in the application or update statement may, in the discretion of the awarding authority, result in termination of any contract awarded the contractor by the awarding authority. The awarding authority shall provide written notice to the commissioner of such false statement not later than thirty days after discovering such false statement. The commissioner shall provide written notice of such false statement to the Commissioner of Consumer Protection and the president of The University of Connecticut not later than thirty days after discovering such false statement or receiving such notice.\n\n(2) The commissioner shall deny or revoke the prequalification of any contractor or substantial subcontractor if the commissioner finds that the contractor or substantial subcontractor, or a principal or key personnel of such contractor or substantial subcontractor, within the past five years (A) has included any materially false statement in a prequalification application or update statement, (B) has withheld any information or documentation required in a prequalification application, (C) has been convicted of, entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere for, or admitted to, a crime related to the procurement or performance of any public or private construction contract, or (D) has otherwise engaged in fraud in obtaining or maintaining prequalification. Any revocation made pursuant to this subsection shall be made only after an opportunity for a hearing. Any contractor or substantial subcontractor whose prequalification has been revoked pursuant to this subsection shall be disqualified for a period of two years after which the contractor or substantial subcontractor may reapply for prequalification, except that a contractor or substantial subcontractor whose prequalification has been revoked on the basis of conviction of a crime or engaging in fraud shall be disqualified for a period of five years after which the contractor or substantial subcontractor may reapply for prequalification. The commissioner shall not prequalify a contractor or substantial subcontractor whose prequalification has been revoked pursuant to this subdivision until the expiration of said two-year, five-year, or other applicable disqualification period and the commissioner is satisfied that the matters that gave rise to the revocation have been eliminated or remedied.\n\n(l) The commissioner shall provide written notice of any revocation, disqualification, reduction in classification or capacity rating or reinstated prequalification to the Commissioner of Consumer Protection and the president of The University of Connecticut not later than thirty days after any final determination.\n\n(m) The provisions of this section and section 4a-101 shall not apply to subcontractors who are not substantial subcontractors.\n\n(n) The commissioner shall establish an update statement for use by contractors and substantial subcontractors for purposes of renewing or upgrading a prequalification certificate for purposes of submitting a bid pursuant to section 4b-91.\n\n(o) Any contractor or substantial subcontractor aggrieved by the commissioner's final determination concerning a preliminary determination, a denial of certification, a reduction in prequalification classification or aggregate work capacity rating or a revocation or nonrenewal of certification may appeal to the Superior Court in accordance with section 4-183.\n\n(p) The commissioner shall provide written notice to each contractor and substantial subcontractor issued a prequalification certificate pursuant to this section about the bond guaranty program administered by the Department of Economic and Community Development.\n\n(P.A. 03-215, S. 3; 03-278, S. 129; June 30 Sp.
