      "text": "(a) If any person has a claim for more than ten dollars for materials furnished or services rendered in the construction, raising, removal or repairs of any building or any of its appurtenances or in the improvement of any lot or in the site development or subdivision of any plot of land, and the claim is by virtue of an agreement with or by consent of the owner of the land upon which the building is being erected or has been erected or has been moved, or by consent of the owner of the lot being improved or by consent of the owner of the plot of land being improved or subdivided, or of some person having authority from or rightfully acting for the owner in procuring the labor or materials, the building, with the land on which it stands or the lot or in the event that the materials were furnished or services were rendered in the site development or subdivision of any plot of land, then the plot of land, is subject to the payment of the claim.\n\n(b) The claim is a lien on the land, building and appurtenances or lot or in the event that the materials were furnished or services were rendered in the site development or subdivision of any plot of land, then on the plot of land and the claim takes precedence over any other encumbrance originating after the commencement of the services, or the furnishing of any such materials, subject to apportionment as provided in section 49-36.\n\n(c) If any such liens exist in favor of two or more persons for materials furnished or services rendered in connection with the same construction, raising, removal or repairs of any building or any of its appurtenances, or in the improvement of any lot, or in the site development or subdivision of any plot of land, no one of those persons shall have any priority over another except as hereinafter provided.\n\n(d) If any instrument constituting a valid encumbrance upon such land other than a mechanic's lien is filed for record while the building is being constructed, raised, removed or repaired, or the lot is being improved, or the plot of land is being improved or subdivided, all such mechanic's liens originating prior to the filing of that instrument for record take precedence over that encumbrance and no such mechanic's lien shall have priority over any other such mechanic's lien. That encumbrance and all such mechanic's liens shall take precedence over any mechanic's lien which originates for materials furnished or services rendered after the filing of that instrument for record, but no one of the mechanic's liens originating after the filing of that instrument for record has precedence over another. If any lienor waives or releases his lien or claim of precedence to any such encumbrance, that lien shall be classed with and have no priority over liens originating subsequent to that encumbrance.\n\n(e) A mechanic's lien shall not attach to any such building or its appurtenances or to the land on which the same stands or to any lot or to any plot of land, in favor of any subcontractor to a greater extent in the whole than the amount which the owner has agreed to pay to any person through whom the subcontractor claims subject to the provisions of section 49-36.\n\n(f) Any such subcontractor shall be subrogated to the rights of the person through whom the subcontractor claims, except that the subcontractor shall have a mechanic's lien or right to claim a mechanic's lien in the event of any default by that person subject to the provisions of sections 49-34, 49-35 and 49-36, provided the total of such lien or liens shall not attach to any building or its appurtenances, or to the land on which the same stands or to any lot or to any plot of land, to a greater amount in the whole than the amount by which the contract price between the owner and the person through whom the subcontractor claims exceeds the reasonable cost, either estimated or actual, as the case may be, of satisfactory completion of the contract plus any damages resulting from such default for which that person might be held liable to the owner and all bona fide payments, as defined in section 49-36, made by the owner before receiving notice of such lien or liens.\n\n(g) In the case of the removal of any building, no such mechanic's lien shall take precedence over any encumbrance upon the land to which such building has been removed which accrued before the building was removed upon the land.\n\n(h) If any person has a claim for more than ten dollars for materials furnished or services rendered in the construction, raising, removal or repairs of any real property, and the claim is by virtue of an agreement with or by consent of the lessee of such real property or of some person having authority from or rightfully acting for such lessee in procuring the materials or labor, then the leasehold interest in such real property is subject to the payment of the claim. This subsection shall not be construed to limit any of the rights or remedies available to such person under subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(i) Any mechanic's lien may be foreclosed in the same manner as a mortgage.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 7217; 1949, 1953, S. 2973d; P.A. 74-310, S. 1; P.A. 79-602, S. 86; P.A. 99-153, S. 7.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 74-310 applied provisions with respect to improvement of lots, site improvements and subdivisions of land; P.A. 79-602 divided section into Subsecs. and restated provisions but made no substantive changes; P.A. 99-153 added new Subsec. (h) to allow mechanic's liens to attach to leasehold interests without limiting existing lien rights or remedies and relettered the remaining Subsec. accordingly.\n\nSee Sec. 49-9 re form of release of mechanic's liens.\n\nAttaching creditors take subject to the lien for work done and to be done under a contract; a lien covers all the land required for the convenient use of the building. 18 C. 347.

Based on facts presented, plaintiff's services were not lienable under section. 51 CA 773. Benefit fund acting on behalf of those who performed services qualifies as “any person who has a claim” under Subsec. and thus has standing to sue; in a mechanic's lien foreclosure action, plaintiff must allege only that defendant consented to have work done, and plaintiff is not required to plead that defendant was aware of the terms of the agreement, or that defendant agreed to make payment for services or failed to make payments. 83 CA 352. Consent under Subsec. is consent that indicates an agreement that owner of at least the land shall be, or may be, liable for the materials or labor. 125 CA 561.\n\nSubsec. (f):\n\nCited. 23 CA 453; 27 CA 199.

Whenever a bond is substituted for any lien after an action for the foreclosure of a lien has been commenced, the plaintiff in the foreclosure may amend his complaint, without costs, so as to make the action one upon the bond with which the plaintiff may join an action to recover upon his claim. Whenever a bond is substituted for any lien before an action for the foreclosure of the lien has been commenced, the plaintiff may join the action upon the bond with an action to recover upon his claim. Whenever a bond has been substituted for any lien, pursuant to this section, unless an action is brought to recover upon the bond within one year from the date of recording the certificate of lien, the bond shall be void.\n\n(b) Whenever a bond has been substituted for any lien pursuant to this section:\n\n(1) The principal or surety on the bond, if no action to recover on the bond is then pending before any court, may make application, together with a proposed order and summons, to the superior court for the judicial district in which the action may be brought, or to any judge of the court, that a hearing be held to determine whether the lien for which the bond was substituted should be declared invalid or reduced in amount. The court or judge shall thereupon order reasonable notice of the application to be given to the obligee on the bond and, if the application is not made by all principals or sureties on the bond, shall order reasonable notice of the application to be given to all other such principals and sureties, and shall set a date for the hearing to be held thereon. If the obligee or any principal or surety entitled to notice is not a resident of this state, the notice shall be given by personal service, registered or certified mail, publication or such other method as the court or judge shall direct. At least four days notice shall be given to the obligee, principal and surety entitled to notice prior to the date of the hearing.\n\n(2) The application, order and summons shall be substantially in the form established by subsection (b) of section 49-35a, adapted accordingly. The provisions of subdivisions (1) and (2) of subsection (b) of section 49-35a, shall apply.\n\n(3) If an action on the bond is pending before any court, any party to that action may at any time prior to trial, unless an application under subdivision (1) of this subsection has previously been ruled upon, move that the lien for which the bond was substituted be declared invalid or reduced in amount.\n\n(4) No more than one application or motion under subdivision (1) or (3) of this subsection may be ruled upon with respect to any single mechanic's lien, except that the foregoing does not preclude an application or motion by a person not given notice of the prior application or not a party to the action at the time the prior motion was ruled upon. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed as permitting a surety on a bond to bring an application for discharge or reduction, if the validity of the lien has previously been ruled upon pursuant to section 49-35a.\n\n(5) Upon the hearing held on the application or motion set forth in this subsection, the obligee on the bond shall first be required to establish that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the lien. Any person entitled to notice under subdivision (1) of this section may appear, be heard and prove by clear and convincing evidence that the validity of the lien should not be sustained or that the amount of the lien claimed is excessive and should be reduced. Upon consideration of the facts before it, the court or judge may: (A) Deny the application or motion if probable cause to sustain the validity of the lien is established; or (B) order that the bond is void if (i) probable cause to sustain the validity of the lien is not established, or (ii) by clear and convincing evidence, the invalidity of the lien is established; or (C) order the amount of the bond reduced if the amount of the lien is found to be excessive by clear and convincing evidence.\n\n(6) Any order entered upon an application set forth in subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be deemed a final judgment for the purpose of appeal.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 7221; 1955, S. 2975d; P.A. 75-418, S. 8, 10; P.A. 76-436, S. 649, 681; P.A. 78-280, S. 1, 127; P.A. 79-602, S. 93; 79-631, S. 36, 111.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 75-418 required that action be brought to recover upon bond within one year from date of recording certificate of lien, rather than within two years, and added Subsec.

      "text": "(a) When any public work is awarded by a contract for which a payment bond is required by section 49-41, the contract for the public work shall contain the following provisions: (1) A requirement that the general contractor, within thirty days after payment to the contractor by the state or a municipality, pay any amounts due any subcontractor, whether for labor performed or materials furnished, when the labor or materials have been included in a requisition submitted by the contractor and paid by the state or a municipality; (2) a requirement that the general contractor shall include in each of its subcontracts a provision requiring each subcontractor to pay any amounts due any of its subcontractors, whether for labor performed or materials furnished, within thirty days after such subcontractor receives a payment from the general contractor which encompasses labor or materials furnished by such subcontractor.\n\n(b) Each payment requisition submitted in accordance with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, except for any such payment requisition submitted pursuant to a contract administered by or in conjunction with the Department of Transportation, shall include a statement showing the status of all pending construction change orders, other pending change directives and approved changes to the original contract or subcontract. Such statement shall identify the pending construction change orders and other pending change directives, and shall include the date such change orders and directives were initiated, the costs associated with their performance and a description of any work completed. As used in this section, “pending construction change order” or “other pending change directive” means an authorized directive for extra work that has been issued to a contractor or a subcontractor.\n\n(c) If payment is not made by the general contractor or any of its subcontractors in accordance with such requirements, the subcontractor shall set forth his claim against the general contractor and the subcontractor of a subcontractor shall set forth its claim against the subcontractor through notice by registered or certified mail. Ten days after the receipt of that notice, the general contractor shall be liable to its subcontractor, and the subcontractor shall be liable to its subcontractor, for interest on the amount due and owing at the rate of one per cent per month. In addition, the general contractor, upon written demand of its subcontractor, or the subcontractor, upon written demand of its subcontractor, shall be required to place funds in the amount of the claim, plus interest of one per cent, in an interest-bearing escrow account in a bank in this state, provided the general contractor or subcontractor may refuse to place the funds in escrow on the grounds that the subcontractor has not substantially performed the work according to the terms of his or its employment. In the event that such general contractor or subcontractor refuses to place such funds in escrow, and the party making a claim against it under this section is found to have substantially performed its work in accordance with the terms of its employment in any arbitration or litigation to determine the validity of such claim, then such general contractor or subcontractor shall pay the attorney's fees of such party.\n\n(d) No payment may be withheld from a subcontractor for work performed because of a dispute between the general contractor and another contractor or subcontractor.\n\n(e) This section shall not be construed to prohibit progress payments prior to final payment of the contract and is applicable to all subcontractors for material or labor whether they have contracted directly with the general contractor or with some other subcontractor on the work.\n\n(1969, P.A. 427, S. 1, 2; P.A. 75-626; P.A. 76-164; P.A. 79-602, S. 99; P.A. 80-115; P.A. 86-12, S. 1; P.A. 05-229, S. 5; P.A. 06-59, S. 1; P.A. 09-146, S. 2.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 75-626 added provisions re deposit of claim amount in escrow account and prohibiting withholding of payment from subcontractor for work performed because of dispute between general or prime contractor and another contractor or subcontractor; P.A. 76-164 substituted reference to requirements included in contract for reference to requirements issued by public works commissioner and added references to payments by municipalities; P.A. 79-602 divided section into Subsecs. and made minor changes in wording, substituting “the” or “that” for “such”, etc.; P.A. 80-115 restated provisions, eliminating references to “prime” contractors and added Subsec. (a)(2) re requirements of subcontracts; P.A. 86-12 changed time limits for payment by general contractor to subcontractor and subcontractor to subcontractor from 45 and 20 days respectively, to 30 days in each case; P.A. 05-229 amended Subsec. (b) to require the general contractor to place funds claimed in an escrow account if a surety bond is not in place; P.A. 06-59 amended Subsec. (b) to delete “if a surety bond is not in place,” re placing funds in escrow; P.A. 09-146 added new Subsec. (b) re payment requisition statement requirements and redesignated existing Subsecs.

      "text": "(a)(1) Any person who performed work or supplied materials for which a requisition was submitted to, or for which an estimate was prepared by, the awarding authority and who does not receive full payment for such work or materials within sixty days of the applicable payment date provided for in subsection (a) of section 49-41a, or any person who supplied materials or performed subcontracting work not included on a requisition or estimate who has not received full payment for such materials or work within sixty days after the date such materials were supplied or such work was performed, may enforce such person's right to payment under the bond by serving a notice of claim on the surety that issued the bond and a copy of such notice to the contractor named as principal in the bond not later than one hundred eighty days after the last date any such materials were supplied or any such work was performed by the claimant. For the payment of retainage, as defined in section 42-158i, such notice shall be served not later than one hundred eighty days after the applicable payment date provided for in subsection (a) of section 49-41a. The notice of claim shall state with substantial accuracy the amount claimed and the name of the party for whom the work was performed or to whom the materials were supplied, and shall provide a detailed description of the bonded project for which the work or materials were provided. If the content of a notice prepared in accordance with subsection (c) of section 49-41a complies with the requirements of this section, a copy of such notice, served not later than one hundred eighty days after the date provided for in this section upon the surety that issued the bond and upon the contractor named as principal in the bond, shall satisfy the notice requirements of this section. Not later than ninety days after service of the notice of claim, the surety shall make payment under the bond and satisfy the claim, or any portion of the claim which is not subject to a good faith dispute, and shall serve a notice on the claimant denying liability for any unpaid portion of the claim. The surety's failure to discharge its obligations under this section shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of defenses the surety or its principal on the bond may have or acquire as to the claim, except as to undisputed amounts for which the surety and claimant have reached agreement. If, however, the surety fails to discharge its obligations under this section, then the surety shall indemnify the claimant for the reasonable attorneys' fees and costs the claimant incurs thereafter to recover any sums found due and owing to the claimant. The notices required under this section shall be served by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid in envelopes addressed to any office at which the surety, principal or claimant conducts business, or in any manner in which civil process may be served.\n\n(2) If the surety denies liability on the claim, or any portion thereof, the claimant may bring an action upon the payment bond in the Superior Court for such sums and prosecute the action to final execution and judgment. An action to recover on a payment bond under this section shall be privileged with respect to assignment for trial. The court shall not consolidate for trial any action brought under this section with any other action brought on the same bond unless the court finds that a substantial portion of the evidence to be adduced, other than the fact that the claims sought to be consolidated arise under the same general contract, is common to such actions and that consolidation will not result in excessive delays to any claimant whose action was instituted at a time significantly prior to the filing of the motion to consolidate. In any such proceeding, the court judgment shall award the prevailing party the costs for bringing such proceeding and allow interest at the rate of interest specified in the labor or materials contract under which the claim arises or, if no such interest rate is specified, at the rate of interest as provided in section 37-3a upon the amount recovered, computed from the date of service of the notice of claim, provided, for any portion of the claim which the court finds was due and payable after the date of service of the notice of claim, such interest shall be computed from the date such portion became due and payable. The court judgment may award reasonable attorneys' fees to either party if upon reviewing the entire record, it appears that either the original claim, the surety's denial of liability, or the defense interposed to the claim is without substantial basis in fact or law. Any person having direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor but no contractual relationship express or implied with the contractor furnishing the payment bond shall have a right of action upon the payment bond upon giving written notice of claim as provided in this section.\n\n(b) Every suit instituted under this section shall be brought in the name of the person suing, in the superior court for the judicial district where the contract was to be performed, irrespective of the amount in controversy in the suit, but no such suit may be commenced after the expiration of one year after the last date that materials were supplied or any work was performed by the claimant, except that any such suit solely seeking payment for retainage, as defined in section 42-158i, shall be commenced not later than one year after the date payment of such retainage was due, pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) of section 49-41a.\n\n(c) The word “material” as used in sections 49-33 to 49-43, inclusive, shall include construction equipment and machinery that is rented or leased for use (1) in the prosecution of work provided for in the contract within the meaning of sections 49-33 to 49-43, inclusive, or (2) in the construction, raising or removal of any building or improvement of any lot or in the site development or subdivision of any plot of land within the meaning of sections 49-33 to 49-39, inclusive.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 7215; 1961, P.A. 228; 1969, P.A. 192, S. 1; P.A. 78-280, S. 2, 127; P.A. 79-602, S. 100; P.A. 87-345, S. 2; P.A. 94-188, S. 16; P.A. 00-36; P.A. 01-195, S. 48, 181; P.A. 06-78, S. 1; P.A. 09-146, S. 3; P.A. 16-104, S. 2.)\n\nHistory: 1961 act required that payment be made within 90 days rather than 60 days in Subsec.

(b) re commencement of suit within one year of last date materials were supplied or work was performed by claimant and requiring suit seeking payment solely for retainage to be commenced within one year after retainage payment was due, pursuant to Sec. 49-41a(a) and made conforming and technical changes in Subsecs. (a) and (b), effective May 30, 2006; P.A. 09-146 replaced reference to Sec. 49-41a(b) with reference to Sec. 49-41a(c) in Subsec. (a), effective July 1, 2009; P.A. 16-104 amended Subsec. (a) to designate existing provisions re enforcement of person's right to payment under bond by serving notice of claim on surety as Subdiv. (1) and amend same by adding provisions re surety's failure to discharge obligations not deemed to constitute waiver of defenses, and to designate existing provisions re surety that denies liability on claim may bring action in Superior Court as Subdiv.

Material actually forming part of work provided for in public works contract, as well as labor performed at the site, is clearly within contemplated coverage of payment bond required for protection of persons who have furnished “labor or material in the prosecution of the work”. Id., 334. Test as to whether labor and materials used in making repairs which are major items are covered by payment bond is whether item was necessitated by rigors of job rather than prior condition of equipment and whether supplier and purchasing contractor reasonably expected that item would be substantially consumed on the job. Id., 335. Having found that no administrative determination by public works commissioner of final settlement date had been made under Sec. 49-43, court was justified in concluding that no final settlement within meaning of this section could be said to have preceded actual payment and exchange of releases, and that subject action commenced within 3 months of that date had been timely brought. 159 C. 563.

Fact that written notice was given to the contractor in an action on bond must be recited in the complaint or a copy annexed thereto; failure to comply with this rule left the complaint deficient. 18 CS 43.

Upon receipt of such notice, the lienor shall discharge the lien by sending a release sufficient under section 52-380d, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the person requesting the discharge. If the lien is not discharged within thirty days of the notice, that person may apply to the Superior Court for such a discharge, and the court may adjudge the validity or invalidity of the lien and may award the plaintiff damages for the failure of the defendant to make discharge upon request. If the court is of the opinion that such certificate of lien was filed without just cause, it may allow, in its discretion, damages to any person aggrieved by such failure to discharge, at the rate of one hundred dollars for each week after the expiration of such thirty days, but not exceeding in the whole the sum of five thousand dollars or an amount equal to the loss sustained by such aggrieved person as a result of such failure to discharge the lien, which loss shall include, but not be limited to, a reasonable attorney's fee, whichever is greater.\n\n(b) When a lien on real property is adjudged invalid or is otherwise discharged by the court, a certified copy of the judgment of invalidity or discharge recorded on the land records of the town where the certificate of lien was filed fully discharges the lien. If such a discharged or invalid lien is a lien filed on personal property pursuant to section 52-355a, a release of lien in the form prescribed by subsection (c) of section 52-380d, certified to by a clerk of the Superior Court, with reference to and the date of the court order of discharge or invalidity, fully discharges the lien on filing with the Secretary of the State.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 7232; P.A. 79-602, S. 113; P.A. 82-270; P.A. 83-581, S. 18, 40.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 79-602 rephrased provisions but made no substantive changes; P.A. 82-270 specified the manner in which a lienor is to be given notice to discharge a lien, and authorized a court to award damages, and specified the amount of such damages, if a certificate of lien was filed without just cause; P.A. 83-581 made section applicable to liens on “personal property”, required the lienor upon receipt of the notice to discharge the lien by sending a release by first class mail, inserted Subsec. indicators and rephrased Subsec. (a) and provided that a copy of the discharge of a lien on real property recorded on the land records fully discharges the lien and, that if a discharged or invalid lien is a lien on personal property, a release of the lien in the form prescribed by Sec. 52-380d(c) certified by a court clerk and filed with the secretary of the state fully discharges the lien.\n\nAction to declare highway assessment invalid. 133 C. 1.

If the motor vehicle is subject to a security interest, the commissioner, within ten days of receipt of such notice, shall send the bailee the name and address of any lienholder as recorded on the certificate of title.
