      "text": "The Superior Court may administer legal and equitable rights and apply legal and equitable remedies in favor of either party in one and the same civil action so that legal and equitable rights of the parties may be enforced and protected in one action. Whenever there is any variance between the rules of equity and the rules of the common law in reference to the same matter, the rules of equity shall prevail.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 7738; P.A. 76-436, S. 583, 681; P.A. 82-160, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 76-436 replaced “All courts which are vested with jurisdiction both in law and in equity” with “The superior court” and made other changes, reflecting transfer of all trial jurisdiction to superior court, effective July 1, 1978; P.A. 82-160 replaced “suit” with “civil action” and rephrased the section.\n\nEquity pleadings. 1 C. 168; 6 C. 207; 7 C. 500. Equity will not ordinarily interfere in matters of probate jurisdiction. 8 C. 280; 9 C. 182. Our chancery practice differs from that of England. 23 C. 555. Court may render such judgment, legal or equitable, as the case requires. 49 C. 447; 99 C. 216. Does not enlarge equity powers of Superior Court on probate appeals. 53 C. 35. Two suits must not be brought where one is as effectual. 59 C. 503. Deed may be reformed and damages awarded for breach of covenants contained in the deed as reformed. 60 C. 170. Equitable estoppel may be claimed in action at law; 66 C. 156; 77 C. 185; so equitable counterclaims. 81 C. 246. Asking both legal and equitable relief. 68 C. 204; 72 C. 554; 77 C. 214; 80 C. 685; 83 C. 109; 85 C. 159; 100 C. 718. “Court” means the tribunal itself as established to administer public justice, not the judge as opposed to the jury. 68 C. 286. Equitable defenses are available on an appeal from a justice. 69 C. 30. The practice act has disregarded the technical formalities of common-law pleading and has followed in the main the practice in equity. 72 C. 199; 81 C. 402. With the enactment of the practice act, pleading, as a system of technical form, substantially disappeared. 73 C. 5. Policy of statute. 75 C. 243. Equitable principles prevail over rules of law. 78 C. 466; 82 C. 559; 87 C. 288. Trial of issues of fact in equitable action by jury. 79 C. 262; 93 C. 118. Trial by jury where legal and equitable remedies both sought. 83 C. 112. Includes writ of error. Id., 696. Party who fails as to claim for equitable relief may pursue claim for damages. 90 C. 281. Application to suit for damages for fraudulent conveyance and also claim for reconveyance in one complaint. 100 C. 717. Creates no new substantive rights; equitable defense must state good cause of action under established equity rules. 103 C. 299. But no longer necessary in equitable action to allege no adequate remedy at law. 105 C. 84. Where equities are strongly in favor of appellee, an error in procedure will not be ground for granting a new trial unless an inflexible rule compels it. 109 C. 299. For more than a century, jurisdiction in matters of equity was retained and exercised by the General Assembly. 3 Dal. 386; 23 C. 430. Receiver may file cross complaint against claimant; remedy at law to exclude equity jurisdiction must be as complete and beneficial as relief in equity. 117 C. 445. Where court has jurisdiction over subject matter, fact that judgment granting equitable relief prayed for might be erroneous does not deprive court of jurisdiction so as to make judgment void. 132 C. 128. Equity has full jurisdiction of suit for an accounting and settlement of partnership affairs. 147 C. 160. One who institutes suit in equity must be prepared to show prior or superior equity in himself to recover. 150 C. 693.

      "text": "(a) The Superior Court in any action or proceeding may declare rights and other legal relations on request for such a declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be claimed. The declaration shall have the force of a final judgment.\n\n(b) The judges of the Superior Court may make such orders and rules as they may deem necessary or advisable to carry into effect the provisions of this section.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 7628; 1949, June, 1955, S. 3116d; P.A. 76-436, S. 388, 681; P.A. 82-160, S. 6.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 76-436 removed court of common pleas from purview of section, reflecting transfer of all trial jurisdiction to superior court, and specified that superior court judges rather than supreme court judges are empowered to make orders and rules to carry out section provisions, effective July 1, 1978; P.A. 82-160 replaced “shall have power to” with “may” and added Subsec. indicators.\n\nIf a declaratory judgment is desired, it should be specifically and precisely demanded in an appropriate prayer for relief. 107 C. 119. Court may render judgment determining rights which are contingent on happening of a future event, but court not compelled to decide purely hypothetical claims; may refuse to hear case seeking declaration as to existence of fact when, even if it is found to exist, rights of parties will still be uncertain. 114 C. 297. Cited. 117 C. 186. No allowance of counsel fees in action for declaratory judgment construing will. Id., 496. May seek declaratory judgment as to exemption from property taxation. 121 C. 475.

Court not required to answer questions essentially academic. 129 C. 346. Request for declaratory judgment misjoined to appeal from order of public utilities commission. 132 C. 515. Action not one in equity; not necessary as a condition precedent that there be no adequate remedy at law; declaratory judgment may be had to explain a judicial decree or judgment, may determine if an issue was res judicata. 133 C. 403. Action for declaratory judgment may be maintained to determine whether a restrictive covenant as to engaging in business is legal and enforceable. 135 C. 195. Not an equitable action. Id., 294. There must appear a sufficient practical need for determination of the matter, and that need must be determined in the light of the particular circumstances involved in each case. 138 C. 172. A declaratory judgment ordinarily should not be rendered unless all persons having an interest in the subject matter are parties to the action. Id., 205.

Declaratory judgment seeking an interpretation of an agreement made in this state governing the rights and duties of an employer and his employees concerning an enterprise carried on in this state, held properly before the court. Id., 608. A prerequisite to an action for a declaratory judgment is that there be a substantial question in dispute or an uncertainty of legal relations which requires settlement between the parties. Id., 633. When a demurrer to a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment can be interposed. 148 C. 177. When the court is able to determine from the pleadings that a cause of action for a declaratory judgment has not been stated, the court may render judgment on the pleadings; it is within the discretion of the court to find that the parties should be left to seek redress by some other form of procedure and to refuse a declaratory judgment on that ground. Id., 385. Complaint must contain allegations sufficient to show plaintiff is entitled to declaratory judgment sought. 149 C. 426. Procedure cannot be used to cull out and adjudicate issue in pending action except under exceptional circumstances clearly alleged in complaint. Id., 428, 429. To be entitled to a declaratory judgment, plaintiff must have an interest, legal or equitable, by reason of danger of loss or of uncertainty as to its rights or other jural relations; in order to attack the constitutionality of regulations, plaintiff must demonstrate that it is adversely affected by them.

Declaratory judgment action is special statutory proceeding in which court is not limited by the issues joined or the claims of counsel. 153 C. 248. Declaratory judgment will not be rendered upon the complaint of any person unless all persons having an interest in the subject matter of the complaint are parties to the action or have been given reasonable notice thereof.

Court erred in refusing to render declaratory judgment where determination of questions was of considerable public importance. 155 C. 163. Cited. 157 C. 6.

Action for declaratory judgment under statute is more effective, convenient and complete than an appeal under Sec. 8-28 because latter would not have included the town as a defendant. Id., 362.

Superior Court's rule-making and sanctioning authority encompasses the power to strike an offer of compromise made under Sec. 52-192a from the record as a penalty for violation of a discovery order. 302 C. 772. Present case is nonjusticiable because no practical relief is available to plaintiff insofar as the allegations in the declaratory judgment complaint demonstrate that it is nothing more than a collateral attack on the protective order imposed by trial court in another action, and which was upheld by the Appellate Court. 329 C. 515.\n\nCited. 3 CA 118; Id., 302; 4 CA 137; 11 CA 332; 13 CA 282; 21 CA 77; 40 CA 75; Id., 692; 42 CA 13; Id., 363; Id., 712; 46 CA 187. Court improperly determined it lacked subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that the arbitrator had not completed the arbitration proceeding because plaintiff was seeking a declaratory judgment on the question of whether the arbitrator had completed the arbitration proceeding. 121 CA 135. Declaratory judgment procedure in statute did not obviate need for plaintiff marshal association to show injury from defendant tax collector's hiring of law firm, instead of marshals, to assist in collection of taxes. 198 CA 392.\n\nSection is remedial and it should be liberally construed. 9 CS 268.

Prayer for declaratory judgment cognizable only in Superior Court. 16 CS 76. Cited. 18 CS 403. Action does not lie where court is of opinion parties should seek redress by some other form of procedure as where questions of fact are presented which should be determined in another action. 22 CS 44. Action allowed in case concerning claimed violation of restrictive covenant in deed; statute is broader in scope than Uniform Act and statutes of most other jurisdictions. Id., 84. Judicial intervention to determine administrative authority at the behest of one immediately and truly injured by an administrative regulation may take place even before completion of the administrative process, if the need of the person injured is sufficiently compelling. 23 CS 30. The jurisdiction of Superior Court to determine the question of unlawful exercise of authority by administrative agencies is independent of the jurisdiction conferred on it by statutes creating a right of appeal. Id., 170. A reservation or other restriction in a deed is the proper subject of an action for a declaratory judgment. Id., 486. Cited. Id., 515; 25 CS 322.
