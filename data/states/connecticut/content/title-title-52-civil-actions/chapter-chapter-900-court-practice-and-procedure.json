      "text": "(a) No bond or recognizance for prosecution is required from a party in any civil action unless the judicial authority, upon motion and for good cause shown, finds that a party is not able to pay the costs of the action and orders that the party give a sufficient bond or enter into a recognizance to an adverse party with a financially responsible person to pay taxable costs. In determining the sufficiency of the bond or recognizance, the judicial authority shall consider only the taxable costs which the party may be responsible for under section 52-257, except that in no event shall the judicial authority consider the fees or charges of expert witnesses notwithstanding that such fees or charges may be allowable under said section.\n\n(b) The recognizance may be taken in the following form:\n\nYou, C.S., as principal, and E.C., as surety, acknowledge yourselves jointly and severally bound to J.L., in a recognizance (or, as the case may be, You, E.C., acknowledge yourself bound to J.L., in a recognizance) of .... dollars, that C.S. shall prosecute the action which he has now commenced against J.L. at the Superior court to be held at H. in and for the judicial district of H., on the ....

(a) by deleting provision requiring plaintiff to enter into recognizance before the process is signed; P.A. 15-85 replaced former Subsec. (a) re requirements for recognizance with new Subsec. (a) re bond or recognizance not required unless judicial authority finds that a party is not able to pay costs of the action, and amended Subsec.

      "heading": "Prior reasonable inquiry and certificate of good faith required in negligence action against a health care provider",
      "text": "(a) No civil action or apportionment complaint shall be filed to recover damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death occurring on or after October 1, 1987, whether in tort or in contract, in which it is alleged that such injury or death resulted from the negligence of a health care provider, unless the attorney or party filing the action or apportionment complaint has made a reasonable inquiry as permitted by the circumstances to determine that there are grounds for a good faith belief that there has been negligence in the care or treatment of the claimant. The complaint, initial pleading or apportionment complaint shall contain a certificate of the attorney or party filing the action or apportionment complaint that such reasonable inquiry gave rise to a good faith belief that grounds exist for an action against each named defendant or for an apportionment complaint against each named apportionment defendant. To show the existence of such good faith, the claimant or the claimant's attorney, and any apportionment complainant or the apportionment complainant's attorney, shall obtain a written and signed opinion of a similar health care provider, as defined in section 52-184c, which similar health care provider shall be selected pursuant to the provisions of said section, that there appears to be evidence of medical negligence and includes a detailed basis for the formation of such opinion. Such written opinion shall not be subject to discovery by any party except for questioning the validity of the certificate. The claimant or the claimant's attorney, and any apportionment complainant or apportionment complainant's attorney, shall retain the original written opinion and shall attach a copy of such written opinion, with the name and signature of the similar health care provider expunged, to such certificate. The similar health care provider who provides such written opinion shall not, without a showing of malice, be personally liable for any damages to the defendant health care provider by reason of having provided such written opinion. In addition to such written opinion, the court may consider other factors with regard to the existence of good faith. If the court determines, after the completion of discovery, that such certificate was not made in good faith and that no justiciable issue was presented against a health care provider that fully cooperated in providing informal discovery, the court upon motion or upon its own initiative shall impose upon the person who signed such certificate or a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion or other paper, including a reasonable attorney's fee. The court may also submit the matter to the appropriate authority for disciplinary review of the attorney if the claimant's attorney or the apportionment complainant's attorney submitted the certificate.\n\n(b) Upon petition to the clerk of any superior court or any federal district court to recover damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death, an automatic ninety-day extension of the statute of limitations shall be granted to allow the reasonable inquiry required by subsection (a) of this section. This period shall be in addition to other tolling periods.\n\n(c) The failure to obtain and file the written opinion required by subsection (a) of this section shall be grounds for the dismissal of the action.\n\n(P.A. 86-338, S. 12; P.A. 87-227, S. 9; P.A. 03-202, S. 14; P.A. 05-275, S. 2; P.A. 07-65, S. 1; P.A. 19-64, S. 16.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 87-227 amended Subsec. (a) to replace provision that “No action, accruing on or after October 1, 1986, shall be filed to recover damages for personal injury or wrongful death” with “No civil action shall be filed to recover damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death occurring on or after October 1, 1987”; P.A. 03-202 amended Subsec. (a) by deleting provision re form prescribed by rules of the superior court and making technical changes; P.A. 05-275 amended Subsec. (a) to make provisions applicable to an apportionment complaint and the filing thereof, require the opinion of the similar health care provider to be signed and include a detailed basis for the formation of such opinion, require the claimant or the claimant's attorney and any apportionment complainant or apportionment complainant's attorney to retain the original written opinion and attach a copy of such written opinion, with the name and signature of the similar health care provider expunged, to such certificate and provide that such similar health care provider shall not, without a showing of malice, be personally liable by reason of having provided such written opinion and added new Subsec. (c) to provide that the failure to obtain and file the written opinion shall be grounds for dismissal of the action, effective October 1, 2005, and applicable to actions filed on or after that date; P.A. 07-65 amended Subsec. (b) to substitute “civil action” for “action” and add “to recover damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death” re extension of statute of limitations; P.A. 19-64 amended Subsec. (b) by replacing “the court where the civil action will be filed” with “any superior court or any federal district court”.\n\nCited. 214 C. 1. Good faith certificate is not jurisdictional. 215 C. 701. Cited. 236 C. 681; 242 C. 1. In workers compensation case where city sought to intervene in employee's negligence action against physician, the city as a would-be intervenor was not required to file a good faith certificate where employee had filed such a certificate and the city asserted no additional claims. 253 C. 429. Applies only to civil actions to recover damages and does not apply to apportionment complaints under Sec. 52-102b which seek only apportionment of liability. 269 C. 10. Section does not require plaintiffs to attach an opinion from a similar health care provider addressing causation. 292 C. 350. Claim of lack of informed consent is not a medical negligence claim and plaintiff is not required to obtain and attach an opinion from a similar health care provider under section; lay standard is applicable to actions for lack of informed consent. 300 C. 383. Improperly designated motion to strike based on failure to submit attorney's good faith certificate and opinion letters in compliance with Subsec. (a) treated as motion to dismiss under Subsec. (c) and granting of such motion is not a judgment on the merits and does not preclude a second action under the doctrine of res judicata. 308 C. 338. Opinion letter requirement does not implicate the court's jurisdiction, rules of practice and case law governing the pleading and proof of jurisdictional facts are inapplicable to a motion to dismiss, and sufficiency of opinion letter is determined solely on basis of allegations in complaint and on face of opinion letter; to extent opinion letter is legally insufficient or defective, trial court retains authority to permit amendments or supplementation of a challenged letter in response to a motion to dismiss; motion to dismiss for failure to file an opinion letter remains waivable, including by inaction. 346 C. 80.\n\nCited. 26 CA 497; 33 CA 378; 37 CA 105; 43 CA 397. Fall by person dependent on a wheelchair while transferring from wheelchair to an exercise mat at physical therapy facility during scheduled session, where transfers were a stated goal of therapy, is medical malpractice. 61 CA 353. If a complaint is found to sound of medical malpractice, even if plaintiff claims the complaint sounds of ordinary tort and breach of contract, then failure by plaintiff to include a good faith certificate and an opinion of a similar health care provider shall constitute grounds for dismissal. 113 CA 569. Section does not abridge common law right to pursue judicial remedy under Art. 1, Sec. 10 of Connecticut Constitution because it is merely a procedural limitation that neither eliminates nor unreasonably burdens right to legal recourse, and section does not violate due process because limitations are reasonably related to legitimate state interest of preventing frivolous or meritless medical malpractice claims. 132 CA 68. Opinion letter did not set forth sufficient information to demonstrate that its author was a similar health care provider, as defined in Sec. 52-184c, qualified to render an opinion as to the standard of care owed by defendant. 133 CA 548. Plaintiff not required to attach certificate of good faith or opinion letter from similar health care provider to complaint when claim sounds in ordinary negligence and not in medical malpractice. 145 CA 253. Regardless of the type of procedure a plaintiff elects to employ to cure a defect in an opinion letter filed in accordance with section, that procedure must be initiated prior to the running of the statute of limitations, otherwise the sole remedy available will be to initiate a new action, if possible, pursuant to Sec. 52-592. 182 CA 688.\n\nCited. 41 CS 169.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nA surgeon, who likely would be qualified to testify as an expert witness at the trial of a medical malpractice action against a specialist physician, but who is not a “similar health care provider” as defined in Sec. 52-184c(c), may not provide the prelitigation opinion letter that must accompany the certificate of good faith attached to the complaint. 300 C. 1. A written opinion satisfies the “detailed basis” requirement if it sets forth the basis of the similar health care provider's opinion that there appears to be evidence of medical negligence by express reference to what defendant did or failed to do to breach the applicable standard of care; written opinion need not identify the precise cause of the injury; written opinion must state the similar health care provider's opinion as to the applicable standard of care, the fact that the standard of care was breached, and the factual basis of the similar health care provider's conclusion concerning the breach of the standard of care. 303 C. 630. Opinion letter of physician who is board certified in obstetrics meets “similar health care provider” requirement in action alleging negligence of certified nurse-midwives; good faith opinion certification required for claim against institutional defendant. 314 C. 709.\n\nSection establishes objective criteria, not subject to the exercise of discretion, making prelitigation requirements more definitive and uniform than requirements to testify at trial and arguably sets the bar higher to get into court than to prevail at trial; as to defendant health care provider who is a physician, the similar health care provider contemplated here is one defined in either Sec. 52-184c(b) or (c). 117 CA 535. Good faith opinion submitted sufficiently addressed allegations of negligence by indicating evidence of a breach of the standard of care, was not required to address causation, and, therefore, was sufficiently detailed for purposes of Subsec. 119 CA 808. Because defendant is a board certified specialist, a similar health care provider must be one trained and experienced in same specialty as defendant and certified by appropriate American board in same specialty. 122 CA 597. Judgment against plaintiff on a motion to strike for failure to comply with requirements re certificate of good faith is a judgment on the merits subject to doctrine of res judicata. 127 CA 606; judgment affirmed on alternate grounds, see 308 C. 338. Section requires the qualifications of the opinion letter author to be disclosed in the opinion letter in manner sufficient to determine whether author is a similar health care provider; claim of lack of informed consent against multiple providers does not trigger requirement for opinion letter. 132 CA 459. Plaintiff was required to file certificate of good faith under Subsec. for claim based on fall suffered after blood draw because claim sounded in medical malpractice, and not ordinary negligence, under test in 61 CA 353, of whether (1) defendants are sued in their capacities as medical professionals, (2) alleged negligence is of a specialized medical nature that arises out of the medical professional-patient relationship, and (3) the alleged negligence is substantially related to medical diagnosis or treatment and involved the exercise of medical judgment. 141 CA 707. Trial court's determination that certificate of good faith that was attempted to be filed in malpractice action was insufficient did not equate to determination that there was lack of probable cause to bring such action. 144 CA 100. Subsec. contains no express language prohibiting plaintiff from amending opinion letter after action is commenced; plaintiff may cure defect in original opinion letter by amending complaint to attach an amended or entirely new opinion letter within the statute of limitations. 161 CA 497. Plaintiff's author of opinion letter does not fall within definition of “similar health care provider” under Sec. 52-184c(c) because, unlike defendant physician, the author of the opinion letter is not board certified in emergency medicine. 168 CA 47. Author of plaintiff's opinion letter does not fall within definition of “similar health care provider” under section because, unlike defendant who is an anatomic pathologist, the author of the opinion letter is a clinical pathologist. 187 CA 555.\n\nDetailed basis for written opinion must enable defendant to ascertain basis of claim. 50 CS 385. Exception in Sec. 52-184c(c)(2) to board certification requirement for similar health care provider who authors opinion letter does not apply unless it is alleged that defendant physician actually undertook the diagnosis and treatment of a condition not within his specialty such that his conduct should be judged against the standards of care applicable to that specialty. 52 CS 463; judgment affirmed, see 140 CA 499.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\n90-day extension provided in Subsec. applies equally to both the 2-year statute of limitation and 3-year statute of repose in Sec. 52-584. 269 C. 787.\n\nThe term “filed”, for purposes of effective date of a public act, refers to the bringing of a complaint or other pleading to the clerk of the court, not a state marshal for service. 106 CA 810.\n\nSubsec. (c):\n\nTrial court must dismiss action if opinion letter fails to comply with Subsec. (a). 300 C. 1. When a medical malpractice action has been dismissed pursuant to Subsec. for failure to supply opinion letter by a similar health care provider required by Subsec. (a), plaintiff may commence an otherwise time barred new action pursuant to the matter of form provision of Sec. 52-592(a) only if that failure was caused by simple mistake or omission, rather than egregious conduct or gross negligence attributable to plaintiff or his attorney. Id., 33. Defendant's right to file motion to dismiss is waived if motion is not filed within time frames in rules of practice. 301 C. 388; overruled, see 346 C. 80.\n\nFailure to comply with Subsec. renders complaint subject to motion to dismiss and not motion to strike. 106 CA 810. Action subject to dismissal not only for lack of opinion letter but also if opinion letter is not from similar health care provider or does not give detailed basis for the opinion. 117 CA 535.\n\nFailure to provide written opinion required by Subsec. (a) does not result in automatic dismissal under Subsec. (c), but rather dismissal is discretionary and based upon facts. 50 CS 385.",

Each such civil action for which a valid certificate has been filed pursuant to section 52-190a shall be referred to mandatory mediation pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, unless the civil action is referred to another alternative dispute resolution program agreed to by the parties. Mandatory mediation under this section shall be conducted for the purpose of achieving a prompt settlement or resolution of the civil action. For the purposes of this section, “health care provider” means a provider, as defined in subsection (b) of section 20-7b, an institution, as defined in section 19a-490, or any other health care provider described in subsection (a) of section 52-184b.\n\n(b) Prior to the close of pleadings in such civil action, the presiding judge of the civil session of the court of the judicial district in which the action is pending shall refer the action to mandatory mediation or any other alternative dispute resolution program agreed to by the parties. The duration of the referral shall not exceed one hundred twenty days unless the court, for good cause shown, extends the duration of the referral. The court shall stay the time periods within which all further pleadings, motions, requests, discovery and other procedures must be filed or undertaken, including, but not limited to, filings under section 52-192a, except with respect to any apportionment complaint under section 52-102b.\n\n(c) Mediation under this section shall begin as soon as practicable, but not later than twenty business days after the date the action is referred under subsection (b) of this section. The first mediation session shall be conducted by the presiding judge or, at the discretion of the presiding judge, a different judge of the Superior Court or a senior judge or judge trial referee. At the first mediation session, the judge, senior judge or judge trial referee conducting the mediation session shall determine whether the action can be resolved at such mediation session, or, if the action cannot be resolved at that mediation session, whether the parties agree to participate in further mediation. If the action is not resolved at the first mediation session and the parties do not agree to further mediation, mandatory mediation under this section shall end.

Upon such referral, mediation shall begin as soon as practicable, but not later than twenty business days after the referral. Fifty per cent of the cost of such mediation shall be paid by the plaintiffs, and fifty per cent of the cost of such mediation shall be apportioned among all defendants who are parties to the mediation.\n\n(d) Each party to such action, and a representative of each insurer that may be liable to pay a claim on behalf of a defendant pursuant to such action, shall appear in person at each mediation session, unless participation by telephone or electronic means is permitted by the judge, senior judge, judge trial referee or mediator.\n\n(e) If such mediation does not settle or conclude the civil action, and if all parties in attendance at such mediation agree, the mediator and all such parties may file a stipulation with the court setting forth any matter or conclusion that the parties and the mediator believe may be useful or relevant to narrow the issues, expedite discovery or assist the parties in preparing the civil action for trial.\n\n(f) The judges of the Superior Court may adopt such rules as they deem necessary for the conduct of mediation pursuant to this section.

      "text": "(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, after commencement of any civil action based upon contract or seeking the recovery of money damages, whether or not other relief is sought, the plaintiff may, not earlier than one hundred eighty days after service of process is made upon the defendant in such action but not later than thirty days before trial, file with the clerk of the court a written offer of compromise signed by the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney, directed to the defendant or the defendant's attorney, offering to settle the claim underlying the action for a sum certain. For the purposes of this section, such plaintiff includes a counterclaim plaintiff under section 8-132. The plaintiff shall give notice of the offer of compromise to the defendant's attorney or, if the defendant is not represented by an attorney, to the defendant himself or herself. Within thirty days after being notified of the filing of the offer of compromise and prior to the rendering of a verdict by the jury or an award by the court, the defendant or the defendant's attorney may file with the clerk of the court a written acceptance of the offer of compromise agreeing to settle the claim underlying the action for the sum certain specified in the plaintiff's offer of compromise. Upon such filing and the receipt by the plaintiff of such sum certain, the plaintiff shall file a withdrawal of the action with the clerk and the clerk shall record the withdrawal of the action against the defendant accordingly. If the offer of compromise is not accepted within thirty days and prior to the rendering of a verdict by the jury or an award by the court, the offer of compromise shall be considered rejected and not subject to acceptance unless refiled. Any such offer of compromise and any acceptance of the offer of compromise shall be included by the clerk in the record of the case.\n\n(b) In the case of any action to recover damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death, whether in tort or in contract, in which it is alleged that such injury or death resulted from the negligence of a health care provider, the plaintiff may, not earlier than three hundred sixty-five days after service of process is made upon the defendant in such action, file with the clerk of the court a written offer of compromise pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and, if the offer of compromise is not accepted within sixty days and prior to the rendering of a verdict by the jury or an award by the court, the offer of compromise shall be considered rejected and not subject to acceptance unless refiled.\n\n(c) After trial the court shall examine the record to determine whether the plaintiff made an offer of compromise which the defendant failed to accept. If the court ascertains from the record that the plaintiff has recovered an amount equal to or greater than the sum certain specified in the plaintiff's offer of compromise, the court shall add to the amount so recovered eight per cent annual interest on said amount, except in the case of a counterclaim plaintiff under section 8-132, the court shall add to the amount so recovered eight per cent annual interest on the difference between the amount so recovered and the sum certain specified in the counterclaim plaintiff's offer of compromise. The interest shall be computed from the date the complaint in the civil action or application under section 8-132 was filed with the court if the offer of compromise was filed not later than eighteen months from the filing of such complaint or application. If such offer was filed later than eighteen months from the date of filing of the complaint or application, the interest shall be computed from the date the offer of compromise was filed. The court may award reasonable attorney's fees in an amount not to exceed three hundred fifty dollars, and shall render judgment accordingly. This section shall not be interpreted to abrogate the contractual rights of any party concerning the recovery of attorney's fees in accordance with the provisions of any written contract between the parties to the action.\n\n(P.A. 76-316, S. 2; P.A. 77-269, S. 1, 2; P.A. 79-60; 79-250, S. 1; P.A. 81-315, S. 3; P.A. 82-160, S. 94; 82-228; P.A. 83-295, S. 9; P.A. 92-110, S. 1; P.A. 94-20; P.A. 01-71, S. 1; P.A. 05-275, S. 4; P.A. 07-141, S. 16; P.A. 11-77, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 77-269 amended Subsec. (c) to specify that provisions apply to “all claims, except claims which were assigned for trial on or before October 1, 1976” rather than to claims “accruing after October 1, 1976”; P.A. 79-60 raised annual interest on offer of judgment from 6% to 12% in Subsec. (b); P.A. 79-250 authorized court to award attorney's fees not exceeding $350 and specified that provisions do not abrogate contractual rights concerning recovery of attorney's fees in Subsec. (b); P.A. 81-315 amended provisions in Subsec. (b) concerning computation of interest on judgments in actions commenced on or after October 1, 1981; P.A. 82-160 made minor technical changes to Subsecs. (a) and (b) and deleted Subsec. (c) which had provided “This section shall apply to all claims, except claims which were assigned for trial on or before October 1, 1976”; P.A. 82-228 amended Subsec. (a) by deleting the provision allowing a plaintiff to file a new offer of judgment after rejection and to continue to file offers up until trial, and amended Subsec. (b) by providing that interest is to be computed on the amount of the verdict rather than on the amount “contained in such offer” and by deleting a provision concerning what constituted the largest offer of judgment for purposes of computing interest; P.A. 83-295 amended Subsec. (b) by providing that interest is to be computed on and added to the “amount so recovered” rather than the “verdict”; P.A. 92-110 amended Subsec. (a) to authorize a plaintiff to file an offer of judgment in any civil action “seeking the recovery of money damages, whether or not other relief is sought” rather than in any civil action “for the recovery of money only”; P.A. 94-20 amended Subsec. (a) to require an offer of judgment to be accepted prior to the rendering of a verdict by the jury or an award by the court; P.A. 01-71 amended Subsec. (a) to require an offer of judgment to be filed not later than 30 days before trial and increase from 30 to 60 days the time period for filing an acceptance of the offer of judgment and made technical changes throughout section for purposes of gender neutrality; P.A. 05-275 replaced “offer of judgment” and “offer of settlement” with “offer of compromise” where appearing, amended Subsec. (a) to provide that the offer of compromise may be filed no earlier than 180 days after service of process is made upon the defendant, delete provision that plaintiff is offering “to stipulate to a judgment”, decrease from 60 days to 30 days the time period for the defendant to accept the offer, provide that when a defendant accepts an offer the defendant is agreeing “to settle the claim underlying the action for the sum certain stated in the plaintiff's offer of compromise” rather than “agreeing to a stipulation for judgment as contained in plaintiff's offer of judgment” and replace “Upon such filing, the clerk shall enter judgment immediately on the stipulation” with “Upon such filing and the receipt by the plaintiff of such sum certain, the plaintiff shall file a withdrawal of the action with the clerk and the clerk shall record the withdrawal of the action against the defendant accordingly”, added new Subsec. (b) re requirements for the filing of an offer of compromise in an action to recover damages for an injury or death resulting from the negligence of a health care provider, and redesignated existing Subsec. (b) as Subsec.

(a) to provide for purposes of section that a plaintiff includes a counterclaim plaintiff under Sec. 8-132, and amended Subsec. (c) re calculation of interest for a counterclaim plaintiff under Sec. 8-132 and added references to applications under Sec. 8-132, effective June 25, 2007, and applicable to applications filed on or after that date; P.A. 11-77 amended Subsec. (a) to add “Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section” and amended Subsec. (b) to add provisions re written offer of compromise filed by plaintiff not earlier than 365 days after service of process on defendant and re when such offer shall be considered rejected and not subject to acceptance unless refiled, and to delete requirements re statement of damages, authorization to disclose medical records, disclosure of expert witnesses and filing of certification with the court.\n\nCited. 188 C. 213. In the context of statute, reference to “verdict” incorporates a recovery awarded by the court; prejudgment and postjudgment interest discussed with reference to Sec. 37-3a. 192 C. 301. Does not apply to state; sovereign immunity not expressly waived. 205 C. 542. Cited. 206 C. 100. Is applicable to court as well as jury trials. 208 C. 82. Cited. 211 C. 648; 225 C. 146; 227 C. 914; 228 C. 206; 229 C. 525; 231 C. 745; 234 C. 169; 239 C. 144; Id., 708; Id., 769; Id., 802; 240 C. 49; Id., 287; Id., 799; 241 C. 319. Statute permits plaintiff to offer only one offer of judgment as to each defendant. 249 C. 339. Since intent of statute is to promote settlement and preserve judicial resources, contractual policy limitations on damages have no effect on section and its mandatory punitive provisions cannot be avoided. 256 C. 667. Relevant figure for determining whether to award interest under statute is amount of the jury verdict, not amount of the postapportionment judgment rendered pursuant to Sec. 31-293. 264 C. 314. Under 2005 revision, the legislative grant of authority to courts under section to award offer of judgment interest after a trial reasonably cannot be construed to mean “after a settlement” even if the parties agree to treat settlement as a verdict and judgment in plaintiff's favor for purposes of section. 294 C. 719. Amendment to section in 2007 evidences legislature's understanding that an amendment was necessary to bring condemnation appeals within the ambit of section, and prior to 2007, legislature did not intend for section to be applicable to condemnation appeals. Id., 803. Substitution of plaintiff under Sec. 52-109 did not render previously filed offers of judgment invalid and unenforceable, rather, the seemingly divergent principle of this section, which is punitive in nature, and Sec. 52-109, which is highly remedial, must be reconciled and leads to conclusion that substitution of plaintiff validated the offers of judgment such that interest began to accrue as of date of substitution. 297 C. 105.\n\nCited. 3 CA 111; Id., 570; 8 CA 254; 13 CA 712; 21 CA 366; Id., 549. Imposes penalty for wasting Connecticut judicial resources; court will not permit defendant to avoid consequences of his decision to ignore plaintiff's offer of judgment merely because his contract obligations were made in another state. 22 CA 640. Cited. 25 CA 67; 26 CA 231; Id., 322; 30 CA 664; 31 CA 806; 32 CA 118; 33 CA 662; Id., 842; 35 CA 504; 36 CA 653; 38 CA 685; 42 CA 239; Id., 712; 43 CA 645; 44 CA 154; 45 CA 165; Id., 543; 46 CA 37. Nothing in Subsec. (a) or (b) indicates that the offer of judgment must not include interest pursuant to Sec. 37-3a. 67 CA 100. Court correctly interpreted language of section in this unique case to hold that amended complaint became equivalent of original complaint for purposes of calculation of interest. 81 CA 419. Claim that court improperly awarded plaintiff interest pursuant to offer of judgment statute could not be properly reviewed because defendant failed to file motion for articulation seeking an explanation from the court as to basis for finding that renewed offer of judgment was still valid. 96 CA 294. Court properly awarded offer of compromise interest on basis of defendants' having rejected plaintiff's offer; defendants' offered no authority for proposition that inadequate performance of the party making an offer of compromise precludes the statutorily prescribed remedy. 102 CA 23. The court upheld award of judgment interest in accordance with 1999 revision of section and rejected defendant's argument that defendant's conditional acceptance of plaintiff's offer of judgment is an exception permitted under statute, since such conditional acceptance was a counteroffer and defendant's interpretation ignores the punitive aspect of section. 111 CA 287. Plaintiff failed to meet “sum certain” and “equal to or greater than” requirements of Subsecs. (a) and (c) where relief requested was $500,000 with interest, appraisal and other fees expended up to $20,000 and all necessary land use certificates and approvals, and relief recovered was $899,480 with interest and no such certificates and approvals. 163 CA 190. Although marital dissolution action is civil action, it is not an action based on contract or an action seeking money damages and section does not apply to marital dissolution cases. 222 CA 560.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nAlthough the required attorney's signature on an offer of judgment was inscribed by the attorney's law partner with attorney's permission, the document is in substantial compliance with the law and such irregularity does not disadvantage defendant. 68 CA 596. Plaintiff is not required to state in an offer of judgment the period of time that defendant has to accept the offer; including reference to the acceptance period in offer of judgment is a courtesy, done in order to save defendant from having to consult language of statute. 103 CA 20.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\nRequirements, purpose, de novo review, and application to unified offers of judgment. 245 C. 1. Where trial court granted defendant's motion for remittitur due to limit of plaintiff's underinsured motorist coverage pursuant to Sec. 38a-336, interest awarded pursuant to section is to be based on judgment amount, rather than verdict amount. 288 C. 38.\n\nTrial court exceeded statutory authority by trebling award of attorney's fees. 47 CA 517. Calculation of interest under Subsec. discussed. 88 CA 459.\n\nSubsec. (c):\n\nWhere jury award of $4.2 million in dram shop action was reduced by court to $250,000 pursuant to Sec. 30-102, trial court properly found that plaintiff had “recovered” $250,000 for purposes of calculating interest under this Subsec., and interest award under this Subsec. did not undermine legislative purpose of limiting recoverable damages under Dram Shop Act. 136 CA 805. Trial court properly awarded interest under section to plaintiffs because the combined jury verdict exceeded the unified offer of compromise and, where there are two plaintiffs and the claim of one of them is derivative of the other, offer of compromise interest based on the full jury award achieves the purpose of section. 156 CA 453.",

Section limits trial court's general authority to grant relief from a judgment, but does not limit its personal jurisdiction over the parties. 249 C. 94. Defendant did not prevail on its claim that, in the absence of a finding of contempt, court lacked jurisdiction to enter postjudgment orders after expiration of the 4-month statutory period for opening a judgment; court's continuing jurisdiction to enter orders in vindication of a prior judgment is grounded in its inherent powers and not its contempt powers and exercise of that jurisdiction in this case not barred by availability of appellate remedies. 260 C. 232. Trial court's clarification of injunctive order 7 months after original order and modification was proper because court had continuing jurisdiction due to nature of injunctive order and internal inconsistencies in prior order. 275 C. 420. Order restoring case to docket is immediately appealable when challenged on the basis of court's authority to restore case to the docket in light of the limitation period of section; court has continuing jurisdiction to vacate or modify a protective order after expiration of the 4-month limitation period of section. 276 C. 168. Plain language suggests that when a party files a motion to reargue, which would, if granted, alter substantive rights and duties of the parties, the 4-month limitation is measured from the court's decision on the motion to reargue, as opposed to the initial judgment; because plaintiff filed her motion to set aside summary judgment within 4 months of the trial court's denial of her motion to reargue, the motion to set aside was timely under section. 305 C. 654. Parties submitted to the jurisdiction of court by agreement and trial court acted within its authority in opening the dissolution judgment. 328 C. 376.\n\nCited. 2 CA 543; 5 CA 417; 8 CA 254; 9 CA 446; 10 CA 160; Id., 669; 11 CA 171; 15 CA 308; 18 CA 166; Id., 589; 19 CA 213; 22 CA 4; Id., 396; Id., 424; 27 CA 755; judgment reversed, see 225 C. 157; 29 CA 465; Id., 482; 32 CA 203; 33 CA 197; 34 CA 419; Id., 641; 36 CA 73.

In absence of fraud, mistake, duress or accident, trial court was without jurisdiction to order rescission of stipulated judgment where request for rescission was made more than 4 months after entry of judgment. 49 CA 203. 4-month limitation period does not apply because the entry of nonsuit was a clerical error. 55 CA 655. Judgment against defendant that was contrary to law shocks the judicial conscience and violates principles of equity, and court's denial of motion to open judgment, although filed more than 4 months after rendition of judgment, perpetuated the injustice. 59 CA 351. Discussion of “otherwise provided by law” provision; failure to file renewed motion to open judgment within 4-month limitation period. 69 CA 349. Because trial court did not make an express finding of mutual mistake, it lacked authority to open the judgment beyond the 4-month period. 78 CA 734. Provisions of section do not operate to strip court of its jurisdiction over its judgments, but merely operate to limit period in which court may exercise its substantive authority to adjudicate merits of a case. 87 CA 735. Clerical error in recorded judgment with respect to amount of deficiency which is inconsistent with actual judgment, may be corrected by trial court at any time, even after expiration of 4-month period set forth in section. 88 CA 592. A judgment rendered may be opened after 4-month limitation if it is shown that judgment was obtained because of mutual mistake. 109 CA 33. As a result of the trial court's original order to “remove” cement blocks being open to different interpretations, it was appropriate for plaintiff to invoke the trial court's continuing jurisdiction to interpret and to effectuate the order with respect to the cement blocks, and that court properly clarified rather than modified the original order. 111 CA 436. Court had authority to open judgment more than 4 months after its entry because plaintiff had by his actions waived right to raise claim under section. 120 CA 459. Trial court permissibly opened judgment and issued corrected memoranda of decision within 4-month time frame permitted by section, and such correction did not support claim that court failed to issue decision within 120 days under Sec. 51-183b. 125 CA 207. Section does not abrogate court's common-law authority to open a judgment beyond the 4-month limitation upon a showing that the judgment was obtained by fraud, duress or mutual mistake; common-law reasons for opening a judgment seek to preserve fairness and equity. 146 CA 214. Trial court had authority to open summary judgment under section, and such motion was not the equivalent of a motion for a new trial or a motion to reargue. 150 CA 842. Section applicable to restoration of a withdrawn case. 154 CA 605. Court had authority to open judgment of dismissal pursuant to this section, rather than Sec. 52-212, where judgment of dismissal was rendered in response to failure of plaintiff's counsel to attend dormancy status conference; section does not require a supporting affidavit. 161 CA 594. Section does not preclude court from granting plaintiff's motion to correct a technical defect in a party's name pursuant to Sec. 52-123 filed beyond four months. 180 CA 461. Four month period for filing motion to open was not tolled by filing of prior appeal and said period had run when motion to open was filed. 180 CA 818.

Inverse condemnation action has no common law analogue that was triable to a jury prior to 1818, its nearest historical analogue, eminent domain, gives rise to a proceeding in equity, therefore there is no right to jury trial for cause of action based on inverse condemnation. 262 C. 45.\n\nCited. 1 CA 511; 6 CA 576; 15 CA 297; 23 CA 287; 28 CA 693; 37 CA 162; 40 CA 261.

A fact not contradicted does not necessarily become an undisputed fact which is required to be added to the finding. Id., 349. Purpose of a charge is to call attention of jury, unfamiliar with legal distinctions, to whatever is necessary and proper to guide them to a right decision in a particular case; doctrine of estoppel was in issue but in charge jury was not given a definition of this term, held reversible error. Id., 391. Although trial court is given much latitude in discussing the evidence in a charge, an incorrect statement of a material and important fact which is apt to mislead the jury constitutes error. Id., 459.

Since there was no evidence that any of the vehicles involved in the collision had inadequate or defective brakes, the charge should not have submitted the issue to the jury; since other omitted matter was essential to a proper and complete consideration and decision of the case, the failure to charge on it, after a request to do so, constituted error. Id., 158. Where more than one conclusion is reasonably possible, judge cannot direct a verdict. Id., 623. Judge's failure to repeat all of his charge on claims of negligence may have misled jury into overlooking plaintiff's claim of supervening negligence of defendant as proximate cause of his injuries; this omission in supplemental charge was error and judgment for defendant was reversed. 157 C. 194.

Sec. 52-228a and this section are not inconsistent with one another; because section permits “the parties” to reject an order of additur, it cannot be read to prohibit plaintiff from rejecting an order of additur; there is no irreconcilable conflict between this section and Sec. 52-216a mandating that one be accepted and the other abandoned. 246 C. 170.\n\nCited. 2 CA 174; 14 CA 289; judgment reversed, see 209 C. 450; 15 CA 6; 16 CA 379; 24 CA 739; 26 CA 231; 27 CA 135. Court should have given parties opportunity to accept a reasonable addition before ordering a new trial on all issues. Id., 471.

Order of remittitur does not necessarily mean that verdict is tainted. 65 CA 441. Trial court was within its discretion to find that a jury's verdict, which compensated plaintiff for past medical bills and the cost of a future surgery that would produce pain, suffering and disability, but that failed to provide plaintiff with noneconomic damages, was improper as a matter of law. 112 CA 467. Section applies only to verdict for plaintiff that may be deemed inadequate, and a court may not order an additur to a defendant's verdict. 117 CA 658.\n\nCited. 37 CS 1.",
