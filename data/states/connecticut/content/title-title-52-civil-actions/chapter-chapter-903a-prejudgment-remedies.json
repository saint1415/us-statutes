The hearing shall be limited to a determination of (1) whether or not there is probable cause that a judgment in the amount of the prejudgment remedy sought, or in an amount greater than the amount of the prejudgment remedy sought, taking into account any defenses, counterclaims or set-offs, will be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff, (2) whether payment of any judgment that may be rendered against the defendant is adequately secured by insurance, (3) whether the property sought to be subjected to the prejudgment remedy is exempt from execution, and (4) if the court finds that the application for the prejudgment remedy should be granted, whether the plaintiff should be required to post a bond to secure the defendant against damages that may result from the prejudgment remedy or whether the defendant should be allowed to substitute a bond for the prejudgment remedy. If the court, upon consideration of the facts before it and taking into account any defenses, counterclaims or set-offs, claims of exemption and claims of adequate insurance, finds that the plaintiff has shown probable cause that such a judgment will be rendered in the matter in the plaintiff's favor in the amount of the prejudgment remedy sought and finds that a prejudgment remedy securing the judgment should be granted, the prejudgment remedy applied for shall be granted as requested or as modified by the court. The court shall not grant the prejudgment remedy if the prejudgment remedy or application for such prejudgment remedy was dismissed or withdrawn pursuant to the provisions of section 52-278j.\n\n(b) The clerk, upon the granting of the application for prejudgment remedy, shall deliver to the applicant's attorney the proposed writ, summons and complaint for service of process. If the court does not grant the application for any reason, including the failure of the plaintiff to serve the defendant, only a summons and complaint may be issued and served. In either event, the plaintiff may alter the return date of the writ, summons and complaint or the summons and complaint, as the case may be. No additional entry fee shall be collected upon the return of such action to court unless the prejudgment remedy or application for such prejudgment remedy was dismissed or withdrawn pursuant to the provisions of section 52-278j.\n\n(c) If an application for a prejudgment remedy is granted and the defendant moves the court for a stay, the court may, if it determines justice so requires, stay such order if the defendant posts a bond, with surety, in a sum determined by such judge to be sufficient to indemnify the adverse party for any damage which may accrue as a result of such stay.\n\n(d) At any hearing on an application for a prejudgment remedy held pursuant to this section or upon motion of the defendant at any time after the granting of such application, the defendant may request that the plaintiff post a bond, with surety, in an amount determined by the court to be sufficient to reasonably protect the defendant's interest in the property that is subject to the prejudgment remedy against damages that may be caused by the prejudgment remedy. If the court grants the defendant's request, the bond shall provide that if judgment in the matter is rendered for the defendant or if the prejudgment remedy is dismissed or dissolved, the plaintiff will pay to the defendant damages directly caused by the prejudgment remedy.\n\n(e) In determining whether to grant a request for a bond and, if granted, the amount of the bond to be set, the court shall consider the nature of the property subject to the prejudgment remedy, the methods of retention or storage of the property and the potential harm to the defendant's interest in the property that the prejudgment remedy might cause.\n\n(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (d) and (e) of this section, the court shall waive any bond or lower the amount of any bond ordered pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, upon request for such a waiver by an indigent plaintiff, if, after hearing and a consideration of the probability that a judgment will be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff, the potential harm to the defendant's interest in the property that the prejudgment remedy might cause, and the likelihood that the defendant will dissipate such property prior to judgment, the court finds that the plaintiff should be entitled to the protections of a prejudgment remedy.\n\n(P.A. 73-431, S. 4, 8; P.A. 75-530, S. 32, 35; P.A. 76-21, S. 4; 76-401, S. 1, 7; P.A. 86-403, S. 85, 132; P.A. 93-431, S. 2, 10.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 75-530 deleted provision allowing plaintiff reimbursement for entry fee if he does not serve the writ, summons and complaint upon his request; P.A. 76-21 qualified provision prohibiting collection of additional entry fee upon return of action to court by adding “unless the prejudgment remedy or application for such prejudgment remedy was dismissed or withdrawn pursuant to the provisions of section 52-278j”; P.A. 76-401 divided section into Subsecs., added language of P.A. 76-21 amendment to provision re grant of requested or modified prejudgment remedy applied for in Subsec.

Failure to provide hearing for either party to present evidence concerning application for prejudgment remedy found to be a procedural flaw requiring remand. 56 CA 114. Court may allow plaintiff to orally amend application and may entertain such amended application at the prejudgment remedy hearing; court must consider potential counterclaims during a hearing on application for prejudgment remedy, even when the counterclaims have not been filed. 68 CA 685. Phrase “in the matter” not restricted to lawsuits pending in Connecticut courts; prejudgment remedy statutes intended to apply either before or after a lawsuit is filed to secure property of defendant in Connecticut should plaintiff obtain judgment in any court; out of state judgment may be registered in Connecticut as foreign judgment to be given same effect as judgment of a court of this state. 73 CA 267. Statute clearly and unambiguously does not preclude court from granting prejudgment remedy order that authorizes attachment for amount less than amount sought in application for prejudgment remedy and does not require court, before issuing such order for a lesser amount, to determine that there exists probable cause that a judgment in at least amount sought in the application for prejudgment remedy will be rendered in the matter in favor of plaintiff utility company. 89 CA 164. To justify issuance of a prejudgment remedy, probable cause must be established both as to the merits of the cause of action and as to the amount of the requested attachment. 112 CA 315. Court unreasonably found adequate showing of insurance coverage when only the policy declaration page was admitted, defendant acknowledged insurer's reservation of rights re defense and coverage, and neither the policy nor the reservation letter was placed in evidence. 116 CA 685.",

THESE RIGHTS INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO A HEARING (1) TO OBJECT TO THE PREJUDGMENT REMEDY BECAUSE YOU HAVE A DEFENSE TO OR SET-OFF AGAINST THE ACTION OR A COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST THE PLAINTIFF OR BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF THE PREJUDGMENT REMEDY ALLOWED BY THE COURT IS UNREASONABLY HIGH OR BECAUSE PAYMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT THAT MAY BE RENDERED AGAINST YOU IS ADEQUATELY SECURED BY ANY INSURANCE THAT YOU MAY HAVE; (2) TO REQUEST THAT THE PLAINTIFF POST A BOND IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 52-278d OF THE GENERAL STATUTES TO SECURE YOU AGAINST ANY DAMAGES THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE PREJUDGMENT REMEDY; (3) TO REQUEST THAT THE PREJUDGMENT REMEDY BE DISSOLVED OR MODIFIED OR THAT YOU BE ALLOWED TO SUBSTITUTE A BOND FOR THE PREJUDGMENT REMEDY; AND (4) TO SHOW THAT ANY PROPERTY SUBJECT TO THE PREJUDGMENT REMEDY IS EXEMPT FROM SUCH A PREJUDGMENT REMEDY.\n\n(c) The notice and claim form required by subsection (b) of this section shall contain (1) the name and address of any third person holding property of the defendant who is subject to garnishee process preventing the dissipation of such property, and (2) a statement of the procedure set out in subsection (d) of this section for requesting a hearing to move to dissolve or modify the prejudgment remedy.\n\n(d) A defendant may move to dissolve or modify a prejudgment remedy allowed pursuant to this section by any proper motion or by return to the Superior Court of a signed claim form that indicates, by the checking of a box on the claim form, whether the claim is an assertion of a defense, counterclaim, set-off or exemption, an assertion that any judgment that may be rendered is adequately secured by insurance, an assertion that the amount of the prejudgment remedy is unreasonably high, a request that the plaintiff be required to post a bond to secure the defendant against any damages that may result from the prejudgment remedy, or a request that the defendant be allowed to substitute a bond for the prejudgment remedy.\n\n(e) The court shall proceed to hold a hearing and determine any motion made under subsection (d) of this section not later than seven business days after its filing. If the court determines at such hearing requested by the defendant that there is probable cause that judgment will be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff and, if the plaintiff has relied on a ground set forth in subsection (a) of this section, that there is probable cause to believe such ground exists, the prejudgment remedy granted shall remain in effect. If the court determines there is no probable cause to believe that a judgment will be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff or, if a ground set forth in subsection (a) of this section was relied on, to believe such ground exists, the prejudgment remedy shall be dissolved. An order shall be issued by the court setting forth the action it has taken.\n\n(f) No prejudgment remedy for the attachment of real property of a municipal officer may be granted pursuant to this section in any civil action against such officer for an act or omission, not malicious, wanton, wilful or ultra vires, on the part of such officer while acting in the discharge of his duties where such officer would be protected and held harmless from financial loss and expense under the provisions of section 7-101a.\n\n(P.A. 73-431, S. 5, 8; P.A. 76-401, S. 2, 7; P.A. 85-394; P.A. 90-149, S. 3; P.A. 91-315, S. 1, 5; P.A. 93-431, S. 3, 10.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 76-401 allowed issuance of prejudgment remedy without hearing if there is “probable cause to sustain the validity of the plaintiff's claim”, also requiring as possible conditions that remedy requested “is for an attachment of real property” and that defendant “is not otherwise subject to jurisdiction over his person by the court”; P.A. 85-394 made previous provisions Subsecs. (a) and (c) and added Subsec. (b) requiring the plaintiff to provide notice to the defendant of the existence of certain statutory rights which the defendant may wish to exercise concerning the prejudgment remedy; P.A. 90-149 added Subsec. (d) restricting the prejudgment attachment of real property of a municipal officer; P.A. 91-315 amended Subsec. (a) to replace “upon verification by oath of the plaintiff or of some competent affiant that there is probable cause” with “upon the filing of an affidavit sworn to by the plaintiff or any competent affiant setting forth a statement of fact sufficient to show that there is probable cause” and amended Subsec. (c) to require the court to hold a hearing and determine the motion “not later than seven business days after its filing” rather than “expeditiously” and to provide that the criterion for deciding whether the prejudgment remedy should remain in effect or be dissolved when the plaintiff has relied on a ground set forth in Subsec. (a)(2) is whether there is probable cause to believe such ground exists; P.A. 93-431 amended Subsec. (a) to require that the affidavit contain facts sufficient to show that there is probable cause “that a judgment in the amount of the prejudgment remedy sought, or in an amount greater than the amount of the prejudgment remedy sought, taking into account any known defenses, counterclaims or set-offs, will be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff” rather than probable cause “to sustain the validity of the plaintiff's claim”, and delete the provisions allowing issuance of the prejudgment remedy without a hearing when the prejudgment remedy requested is for “an attachment of real property” or when there is reasonable likelihood that the defendant “neither resides in nor maintains an office or place of business in this state and is not otherwise subject to jurisdiction over his person by the court” or “has stated he is insolvent or has stated he is unable to pay his debts as they mature”, amended Subsec. (b) to replace “If a prejudgment remedy is granted” with “If a prejudgment remedy is issued” and substantially revise the language contained in the notice advising the defendant of his rights including changing the basis on which the defendant may object to the prejudgment remedy and adding the right to request the plaintiff to post a bond, inserted a new Subsec. (c) re contents of the notice and claim form, designated the provisions of former Subsec. (c) re a motion to dissolve or modify as Subsec. (d) and amended said Subsec. to specify the manner in which a defendant may move to dissolve or modify a prejudgment remedy, designated the provisions of former Subsec. (c) re a court hearing as Subsec. (e) and amended said Subsec. to provide that the standard at such hearing shall be probable cause that judgment will be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff rather than probable cause to sustain the validity of the plaintiff's claim, and relettered former Subsec.
