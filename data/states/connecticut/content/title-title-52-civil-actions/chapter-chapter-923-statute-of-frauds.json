Sess. P.A. 92-11, S. 39, 70.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 82-160 replaced “estate” with “property”, rephrased the section and inserted Subsec. indicators; P.A. 89-338 added Subsec.

Unless there existed written memorandum satisfying requirements of statute of frauds, evidence indicating agreement is not legally sufficient to support court's conclusion that such agreement did exist. 159 C. 453. Oral agreements concerning interest in land are unenforceable. 164 C. 56.

Trial court improperly instructed jury on statute of frauds when it instructed jury that it could find that an exception to statute of frauds applied if it found that plaintiffs had proved either part performance of contract or detrimental reliance induced by defendant; although this court has occasionally used the terms interchangeably, it never intended that doctrines of equitable estoppel and of part performance operate as independent exceptions to statute of frauds; part performance is an essential element of the estoppel exception to statute of frauds. 274 C. 33. Statute of frauds, which governs disputes between parties to a contract, not applicable to case involving oral lease agreement because it did not involve a “contractual dispute”. 278 C. 660. Re action for specific performance on option to purchase real property where no written agreement existed for purchase price because cost of environmental remediation had not been determined, part performance of parties did not remove option from statute of frauds and did not provide remedy for specific performance. 293 C. 287.\n\nCited. 1 CA 566; Id., 634; 3 CA 34; 4 CA 46; 5 CA 358; Id., 394; 6 CA 595; 11 CA 375; Id., 439; 13 CA 677; 16 CA 240; 18 CA 581; 20 CA 58; 23 CA 522; 26 CA 305; 28 CA 739; 33 CA 662; 35 CA 31; 38 CA 420; Id., 772; 40 CA 261; 42 CA 413; Id., 712; 44 CA 402. Court rejected argument that partial payment of contract price is an act of part performance making contract enforceable regardless of statute of frauds; trial court's finding that contract satisfied statute of frauds was not clearly erroneous where trial court found that description of the land had been made sufficiently definite through reference to two contracts, a map attached to the contract, other maps and descriptions, plus testimony placed in evidence at trial. 49 CA 751. Statute of frauds requires that any modification to the note and mortgage be in writing. 62 CA 138.\n\nContract for sale of land not specific as to subsequent lien, void. 30 CS 30.

Goods set apart, and verbal delivery to vendee standing by, sufficient; such delivery not symbolical. 17 C. 173. Subsequent tender and acceptance have same effect as original delivery. 44 C. 139. Delivery of stock certificate sufficient delivery of shares. 50 C. 491. Acceptance by vendee must be an actual receiving on his part of the whole or part of the property sold; acceptance may be sufficient to pass title and yet insufficient to remove case from statute; facts held insufficient to show such an acceptance as would remove case from statute. 60 C. 366. Where no actual change of possession, it must clearly appear that continued possession of vendor is that of bailee for vendee. 75 C. 377; 76 C. 232. What constitutes acceptance. 90 C. 342.

Cir. Ct. 85. Statute is not defense to action for recovery of value of improvements to property made by lessee in reliance upon oral agreement to sell property so improved. 4 Conn. Cir. Ct. 437, 439, 440.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nSubdiv. (5): Contract of indefinite duration is not subject to “one year” provision. 202 C. 190. Subdiv. (5): Oral contract that does not say in express terms that performance is to have a specific duration beyond 1 year is the functional equivalent of a contract of indefinite duration for purposes of statute of frauds and thus is unenforceable as outside of statute's prescription. 220 C. 569. Cited. 221 C. 236. Contract did not violate statute of frauds re Subdiv. (4) interest in real property or Subdiv. (5) agreement not to be performed within 1 year. 245 C. 640.\n\nCited. 5 CA 240; 13 CA 527; 23 CA 579; 33 CA 662; 38 CA 329; Id., 333; Id., 420; Id., 772; 42 CA 413; 45 CA 466.

Agreement between parties not barred by statute of frauds. 69 CA 366. Due to lack of proof re existence and essential terms of an oral agreement, the alleged oral agreement violated statute of frauds. 70 CA 692. Subdiv. (4): Contract for sale of real estate that does not contain any designation of seller fails to satisfy statute. 85 CA 503. Statute did not apply to circumstances of case because contract governing son's debt had been fully performed and it is well-established that full performance by both parties to an oral contract will operate to remove a contract from the provisions of statute, and cause of action concerned property owners' default on their mortgage loan rather than an action to enforce property owners' promise to pay part of son's debt. 89 CA 200. Subdiv. (4): Although part performance may be sufficient to take a contract out of statute of frauds, plaintiffs' maintenance of city landscaping on the land was evidence of an agreement between plaintiffs and the city, not evidence of an agreement between plaintiffs and defendant to sell the land. 99 CA 294. Subdiv. (4): Because claim for negligent misrepresentation sounds in tort and not in contract, statute of frauds does not bar such claim. 116 CA 483. Subdiv. (5): Primary purpose of statute of frauds is to provide reliable evidence of the existence and terms of the contract, but an oral settlement agreement within framework of original lawsuit that was placed on the record before the trial judge and assented to by counsel for the parties is binding, as if the agreement were in writing and signed by the party to be charged, regardless of whether the agreement could be performed within a year. 132 CA 209. Subdiv. (4): Plaintiffs maintaining a civil action challenging the discretionary determination of the common interest association under Subdiv. are precluded from asserting the statute of fraud because section operates as a special defense to a civil action and accordingly may only be asserted as a shield to defeat a cause of action and not as a sword to seek a judicial remedy for a wrong. 174 CA 18. Subdiv. (6): Credit card agreement does not constitute a loan as contemplated by the statute of frauds. 174 CA 472.\n\nCited. 39 CS 188.",
