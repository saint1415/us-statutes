      "text": "When any person who has set up or desires to set up a water mill on his own land, or on land of another with his consent, desires to build or raise a dam on any land of his own, or of another with his consent, in order to create or improve a waterpower by means of a pond or reservoir, for the benefit of such mill, which dam would flow water upon land belonging to any other person, or to secure the right to build or improve discharge-ditches, to carry off the water flowing from his mill; or when any owner of any water mill, on any stream flowing out of a natural pond, desires, with the consent of the owner of the outlet of such pond, to build or raise a dam across such stream or outlet for working such mill; or when the owner of any waterpower and dam desires to conduct the water from such dam across the land of another to some point on his own land for milling purposes; or when the owner of any mill desires to deepen any watercourse below his mill, or the raceway conducting the water from such mill, in such a way as not to affect the interests of any other owner of any dam, mill or mill privilege situated on or receiving water from such watercourse; then, if such person, desiring to make any such erections or improvements, cannot agree with the owner of any land which will be affected by the same, as to the damages to be paid to him therefor, he may bring his petition against such owner to the superior court for the judicial district where the land to be overflowed or taken, or any part of it, lies; which petition shall contain such a description of the land to be overflowed or taken, and of the dam or other improvement proposed, its location and proposed height and dimensions, that the record will show with certainty the matter to be determined. Mesne process on any such petition shall be a writ of summons, describing the parties, the court to which it is returnable and the time and place of appearance, and shall be signed as in other civil actions and may run into any judicial district.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 8188; P.A. 78-280, S. 2, 127.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 78-280 substituted “judicial district” for “county”.\n\nSee Sec. 13a-54 re abandonment of highway for construction of dam.\n\nSee Sec. 22a-403 re permits necessary to build, alter, repair, etc. dams and other structures.\n\nStatute is constitutional. 33 C. 550; 34 C. 84; 87 C. 432. It is to be strictly construed. 35 C. 510; 36 C. 317. A mill owner may sue without joining a tenant at will. 33 C. 552. Joinder of respondents. Id., 89, 356. One who desires to let the waterpower, when obtained, to third parties, may sustain a petition. 35 C. 511. The petition will not be defeated by proof that petitioner has already wrongfully appropriated the privilege he seeks to obtain. 33 C. 552. Proof of failure to agree. 34 C. 86. Petitioner's mill need not be on or contiguous to the land where he seeks to build his dam. Id., 85. Attempt to extend Flowage Act to the creation of a pond from which to take ice, held ineffective; law to be strictly construed. 65 C. 322. Right to flow land under statute too remote an element of damage to be considered in proceedings to condemn water rights. 75 C. 248. Nature of proceedings. 87 C. 205. Waterpower created and maintained under Flowage Act is not protected from condemnation proceedings; but quaere if it is devoted to a public use at time of condemnation. 92 C. 220. Cited. 95 C. 91.",

      "text": "The petition, unless the parties thereto agree upon the judgment rendered thereon, shall be heard and decided by a committee of three disinterested property owners of the judicial district to be appointed by the court; and, if such committee is of the opinion that the flowing or taking of such land in the manner proposed will be of public use, it shall establish the height to which any such dam may be built and the water raised thereby, and the length of time or period during which the same may be kept up in each year thereafter, or the dimensions and location of any such discharge-ditches, aqueducts, watercourses or raceways, as the same may be built or improved; and shall assess the sum to be paid by the petitioner to the respondent for the right thus to overflow or take his land in the manner established in its report. In estimating the damage, such committee shall take into account any damage occasioned to any other land of the respondent, as well as to that overflowed or taken, and shall report its doings to such court, which shall add fifty per cent to the damages so assessed, as the sum to be paid for such right so to flow, take or injure such land.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 8189; P.A. 78-280, S. 2, 127.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 78-280 substituted “judicial district” for “county”.\n\nCertainty in report. 34 C. 86. Committee need not fix the height at precisely that asked for. 33 C. 552. Flowage law recognizes mills and manufacturing establishments as being for public use. 41 C. 91. Distinction as to taxation between land taken for profit and for a town water supply. 44 C. 371. Petitions are to be served by citation, as were bills in equity before the practice act. 49 C. 348. Evidence that petitioners are pecuniarily unable to avail themselves of the right sought is inadmissible. Id., 349. Specific issue held not to involve effect of flowage upon the public health. 52 C. 459. Statutes authorizing the taking or flowage of land by compulsory process should be strictly construed. 65 C. 323. Whether a law empowering riparian owners to create ice ponds on the land of others, against their will, can be supported, quaere. Id., 234. Cited. 69 C. 435.",

Id., 319. An abandoned millsite may be flowed. 35 C. 159. Setting up small mills, simply to protect the privilege from condemnation, and of no practical use, will be of no avail. Id., 513. A mill is a “lawfully existing” one, notwithstanding the dam may be a little higher than it should be, whereby land of the petitioner is overflowed. 40 C. 43. Continuance of intent to build on millsite is a question of fact. 49 C. 350. The question of the existence of and injury to a millsite and dam is one of fact. 52 C. 462. Cited. 92 C. 221.",
