A conveyance made pursuant to a decree ordering a sale of the land shall vest the title in the purchaser thereof, and shall bind the person entitled to the life estate and his legal heirs and any other person having a remainder interest in the lands.

For land title purposes, the possibility of a person having issue is never extinct as long as the person lives. 147 C. 34. Ordinarily, court accepts claims of parties as to interests held in the property in connection with the distribution of proceeds, but here court had to determine whether the owner of a one-half interest was also a lessee; plaintiff by asking for partition shows intent to sever all contractual relationships and therefore cannot now demand compliance with notice provision required by contract.
