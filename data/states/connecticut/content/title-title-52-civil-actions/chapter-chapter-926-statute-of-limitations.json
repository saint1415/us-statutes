Precondition of continuing course of conduct doctrine is that defendant must have committed an initial wrong upon plaintiff. 252 C. 193. Since there was a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the 3-year repose section contained in statute was tolled by defendant's alleged ongoing failure to warn plaintiff of his concern for cancer thus triggering the continuing course of conduct doctrine, it was improper for trial court to have concluded that there was no continuing course of conduct as a matter of law and to have granted defendant's motion for summary judgment. Id., 363. Allegations in amended complaint presented a new and different set of facts and were barred by statute of limitations since new facts did not relate back to original complaint. 257 C. 58. Does not impose a duty on plaintiff to investigate, instead, it requires jury to consider all the facts and circumstances in order to determine date when the injury is first sustained or discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered; does not impose a heightened standard of discovery on health care professionals regarding discovery of actionable harm. 262 C. 797. Correct legal standard by which to evaluate timeliness of causes of action in negligence restated; limitation period for actions in negligence begins to run on date when injury is first discovered or in exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered. 268 C. 723. 90-day extension provided in Sec. 52-190a(b) applies equally to both the 2-year statute of limitation and 3-year statute of repose in this section. 269 C. 787. Legislature's purpose in distinguishing “injury or actionable harm” from “the act or omission complained of” and providing a 3-year statute of repose, was to avoid “draconian effect” of running the 2-year limitation period from the date of defendant's negligence in cases in which plaintiff is unable to bring an action because he could not discover an essential jurisdictional fact, despite the exercise of reasonable care; 2-year statute of limitations set forth in statute does not begin to run until plaintiff knows or reasonably should have known the identity of the tortfeasor; plaintiff's ignorance of tortfeasor's identity will not excuse plaintiff's failure to bring a negligence action within 3 years of the date of the act or omission complained of. 271 C. 284. Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that two isolated contacts with two different radiologists at same hospital over the course of 3 years constituted a continuing course of conduct or treatment so as to toll the statute of limitations set forth in section for the purpose of allowing plaintiff to pursue a medical malpractice claim against the hospital for failing to discover her brain tumor. 279 C. 312. Plaintiff parents' claims against gynecologist delivering their infant were barred by the 3-year repose provision in statute; there was no genuine issue of material fact that gynecologist was not under a continuing duty to warn plaintiff parents of potential complications associated with respiratory distress syndrome because gynecologist ceased to be infant's treating physician after his birth; responsibility for infant's care and treatment after his birth was assumed by another physician who diagnosed infant as having the syndrome, and any legal duty that gynecologist had re infant prior to delivery concluded upon date of his birth; imposition on delivering hospital of a continuing duty to inform plaintiff parents of all potential complications associated with infant's diagnosis regardless of his treating physician's actual knowledge would nullify the 3-year repose provision established by legislature for medical malpractice actions; continuing course of conduct doctrine did not toll such repose provision. 280 C. 190. Continuous treatment doctrine did not apply to bar statute of limitations. 282 C. 745. Action was not time barred because there were disputed facts sufficient to warrant the invocation of continuing course of conduct doctrine. 287 C. 158. Evidence that defendant should have been aware or that defendant deviated from the standard of care does not amount to actual knowledge to impose a continuing duty on defendant so that the period of repose is tolled under continuous course of conduct doctrine; evidence must be submitted to prove the existence of a physician-patient relationship or ongoing course of treatment by defendant in order to properly toll the period of repose under continuing treatment doctrine. 290 C. 347. Doctrine of nullum tempus occurrit regi, i.e. no time runs against the king, exempts state from operation of section. 307 C. 412. Routine postoperative appointments for the purposes of tracking the progress of plaintiff's condition and postoperative complications, if any, constitute continuing course of treatment for any identified medical condition that was caused by the surgery. 321 C. 637. The relation back doctrine applies to a proposed new or changed allegation of negligence when it falls within the scope of the original cause of action, which is the transaction or occurrence underpinning plaintiff's legal claim against defendant. 325 C. 198. The plaintiff's knowledge of the causal connection between the defendants' alleged negligence and her physical harm is a material fact because it begins the accrual of statute of limitation; legislative history supports conclusion that “injury” as used in statute was intended to mean a legally recognized injury, not just physical hurt or loss. 342 C. 103.\n\nCited. 1 CA 7; Id., 123; Id., 652.

Service of prejudgment remedy document did not toll the running of section, even though contained the words “the institution of this action” and included unsigned proposed writ of summons and complaint, since unsigned writ and complaint does not have effect of commencing a civil action; court declined to adopt rule that section is tolled when prejudgment remedy documents are served. 61 CA 234.

Statute of limitations not tolled by continuous course of conduct doctrine where pathology group failed to diagnose plaintiff's disease, because to expect pathology group to provide follow-up treatment or to instruct patient on follow-up care after a negative diagnosis when there is no awareness that the diagnosis is wrong and there is no ongoing relationship is beyond the expectation of public policy. 66 CA 518. Because plaintiff failed to offer any evidence to demonstrate that defendant physician had an awareness of risk to plaintiff subsequent to the surgical sterilization procedure, plaintiff could not establish that defendant had a continuing duty to warn her so as to toll the limitation period of statute. 67 CA 565.

Counterclaim more than a year after the occurrence is barred unless it may be allowed under exception; held that pleadings had been finally closed on the filing of a reply when they terminated in an issue of fact decisive of the merits of the case; that the court might reopen the pleadings at any time to permit amendment did not mean that they were not closed within the intendment of statute. Id., 139. Cited. Id., 367; 24 CS 321. Where complaint is broad enough to permit proof of causes in tort and contract, demurrer merely reaching tort action is insufficient. Id., 459.

Continuing course of conduct doctrine does not apply to the 2-year limitation; term “injury” in statute requires an actionable harm. Id., 154.

Since section uses “action” and “cause of action”, and not “claim”, to refer to what is allowed to be brought under its provisions, trial court incorrectly concluded that savings provisions of section operate only to save the exact state law claims that were dismissed without prejudice in federal court, but do not permit the bringing of additional state law claims arising from same set of facts. 49 CA 715. Failure to return complaint for two and one-half years not diligent as required for application of statute. 50 CA 632. Second action improperly dismissed without affording plaintiff opportunity to present evidence on the issue of when he received notice of prior dismissal; plaintiff who fails to receive timely notice of dismissal of original action is not barred from pursuing the action pursuant to section. 68 CA 238. Plaintiff could not avail himself of statute where alleged breach of contract occurred in 1993, where the action had been dismissed for dormancy in 1997 and dismissed again in 1999 for failure to close the pleadings, and where plaintiff failed to file a motion to open that dismissal or to proffer any explanation for his conduct. 69 CA 614. Plaintiff must have commenced an original action before statute can be applied to save a subsequent action. 78 CA 235. Plaintiff not required to plead or prove that statute was applicable to his action because defendants had not raised a statute of limitations defense. Id., 783. Previous claims that were not tried on their merits not saved by statute because they were not commenced within time periods set forth in applicable statutes of limitations; previous action cannot qualify as “original action” for purposes of statute because action did not fail to be heard as matter of form, but as part of settlement by parties. 84 CA 1. “Action”, for the purpose of section, means a civil action commenced in a court of law, not an arbitration before a panel of arbitrators as an alternative to a civil action; Sec. 4-61 arbitration proceeding is not an action under section. 87 CA 367. Dismissal of prior case because of lack of attention and diligence of counsel does not qualify case for continuation of action through invocation of section. 99 CA 540. If found that the nature and extent of conduct that led to disciplinary dismissal involves excusable neglect, plaintiff is entitled to relief. 114 CA 244. There is no distinction, for purposes of taking advantage of section, between a plaintiff who voluntarily dismisses its action because of want of jurisdiction and one whose action is dismissed because it has conceded lack of jurisdiction; dismissal for want of jurisdiction does not need to be the result of mistake or accident for section to apply. 116 CA 144. Dismissal of plaintiff's federal action without prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted falls within the protection afforded by section. 131 CA 99. Section is not available to save plaintiff's untimely disability discrimination and retaliation claims because such claims involve a new cause of action that is separate from and would require a demonstration of conduct completely distinct from her previous race discrimination claims. 136 CA 759.

Where plaintiff had brought a timely appeal under Sec. 12-118 which was nonsuited, he is not entitled to rely on this section to bring a new appeal on the same cause of action after the 2-month limitation had run, since the proceeding involving an appeal under Sec. 12-107c(d) is not the type of action which comes within the saving protection of this section. 26 CS 168.

Id., 412. Cited. 236 C. 701. Disciplinary dismissals are not excluded categorically from relief afforded by statute, and plaintiff claiming benefit of statute must be afforded opportunity to show that plaintiff's noncompliance with court order was due to mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect. 243 C. 569. Applies to actions otherwise barred by applicable statute of limitations, does not operate to save plaintiff's action from contractual limitation period for bringing suit. 246 C. 378. Where a federal action and second state action were for same cause, federal action was the “original action”, i.e. first action filed within time allowed by the applicable statute of limitations; 216 C. 412 affirmed; policy of statute discussed. 250 C. 105. Appellate Court properly ruled that plaintiff's appeal of an initial action was moot because defendant acknowledged that Subsec. precluded any statute of limitations defense in the second action that wasn't applicable in the first action and therefore the first action, which only differed in the manner and date of service and the return date, was moot. 265 C. 650. Motion to cite in an additional defendant does not constitute a new “action” under Subsec. 299 C. 84. When a medical malpractice action has been dismissed pursuant to Sec. 52-190a(c) for failure to supply opinion letter by a similar health care provider required by Sec. 52-190a(a), plaintiff may commence an otherwise time barred new action pursuant to the matter of form provision of Subsec. only if that failure was caused by simple mistake or omission, rather than egregious conduct or gross negligence attributable to plaintiff or his attorney. 300 C. 33. Action dismissed for failure to provide a good faith certificate as required by Sec. 52-190a was not saved by this section where trial court found that the failure to supply certificate could not be said to be the result of mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect. 308 C. 338. Phrase “commenced within the time limited by law” includes the additional 30-day period for service by a marshal set forth in Sec. 52-593a; if defendant has actual notice within the 30-day period, savings provision of Subsec. would apply. 313 C. 516.\n\nPlaintiff limited to bringing new action within 1 year from end of original action, not the last action. 11 CA 156. Not device for avoiding rules of res judicata. 28 CA 653. Dismissal due to party's pattern of delay can result in barring relief pursuant to Subsec. 62 CA 775. Plaintiff's original action was an “action” within meaning of Subsec. despite the fact that defendant named in that action had died prior to commencement of the action. 71 CA 697. Applicability of statute depends on particular nature of conduct involved, i.e., mere mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect vs. egregious conduct. 72 CA 601. Plaintiff's failure to object in a timely manner to motion to dismiss waives right to later challenge. 85 CA 746. Plaintiff may not take advantage of the accidental failure of suit statute following a judgment of nonsuit when plaintiff failed to comply with a court order to answer defendants' written discovery and was not the victim of a lawyer's errors because she was not represented by counsel concerning her litigation. 135 CA 506. Compulsory arbitration judgment rendered under Sec. 52-549z is an action “tried on its merits” for purposes of Subsec. (a), andNunno v. Wixner, 257 C. 671, finding that compulsory arbitration was not a “trial” for purposes of Sec. 52-192a(c), does not control as the statutes at issue here and inNunnohave different purposes and are textually distinguishable. 200 CA 660.\n\nA disciplinary dismissal that results from counsel for plaintiff's blatant and egregious conduct and refusal to comply with court orders is not intended to be condoned or sanctioned by the statute's matter of form provision. 52 CS 435; judgment affirmed, see 139 CA 88. Relief not available under Subsec. when conduct of plaintiff's attorney, in repeatedly ignoring the court's orders, went well beyond mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect and constituted a knowing, blatant and egregious disregard for the court and the rules of practice. 53 CS 220; judgment affirmed, see 147 CA 299.\n\nSubsec.
