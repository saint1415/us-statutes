Transfer cannot be considered fraudulent if, at time of transfer, the transferred property is encumbered by valid liens exceeding its value because the property would no longer be considered an asset under Subdiv. (2), and only assets may be transferred fraudulently. 79 CA 725.",

Determination of question of fraudulent intent is clearly an issue of fact which must often be inferred from surrounding circumstances. 54 CA 481. There is no requirement under section for a fraudulent intent with respect to transferees; where there was evidence for jury to conclude that defendant transferred his interest with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud estate, the granting of directed verdict was improper; section adopts and clarifies common law of fraudulent conveyances, but is not a wholesale codification. 138 CA 695.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nDistribution of marital property constitutes a transfer under Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, regardless of whether distribution occurred as part of a settlement or after a trial. 304 C. 546.\n\nA transfer cannot be considered fraudulent if, at the time of the transfer, the transferred property is encumbered by valid liens exceeding the property's value because the property would no longer be considered an asset under Sec. 52-552b (2), and only assets may be transferred fraudulently. 191 CA 1.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\nPlaintiff's claim under act is challenge to transfer of assets, not collateral attack on dissolution decree, plaintiff having been denied intervention in dissolution proceeding was a stranger to the previous litigation and thus falls under exception to rule against collateral attacks. 304 C. 546.",
