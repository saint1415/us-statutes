Conviction of Sec. 53-246 “intoxication” is not infamous crime to attack credibility of a witness. 140 C. 39. Cited. 149 C. 125. A plea of guilty by one of several persons charged with a crime can be no more than hearsay as to others so charged; therefore, while the plea may be used to attack the credibility of the one so pleading if he testifies as a witness for or against the others, it is not admissible on the trial of the others to establish that the crime was committed. 150 C. 195. The conviction of a crime, whether or not denominated a felony by statute, is admissible in evidence to affect credibility under section only if the maximum permissible penalty for the crime may be imprisonment for more than 1 year, and the presence or absence of moral turpitude is not a consideration affecting admissibility. 152 C. 472.

Where statement of witness was offered to show bias against defendant, it was properly excluded where it related to criminal activity of witness for which he had not been convicted. Id., 536.

Prudent course where trial court faced with decision on admission as evidence of credibility prior convictions for crimes not directly reflecting on credibility is to allow prosecution to mention that defendant was convicted of unspecified crime or crimes carrying a penalty of more than 1 year. 194 C. 1. Cited. Id., 297. Where a prior charge resulted in a determination that defendant was a youthful offender and not in a criminal conviction, it was not admissible for impeachment purposes under statute. 196 C. 122, 128.

(7) to replace provisions defining psychiatrist with provisions defining psychiatric mental health provider, and made technical changes.\n\nCase decided before effective date of statute. 150 C. 689. Cited. 152 C. 510, 512. Psychiatrist-patient privilege does not extend to records relative to drug-dependency treatment. 169 C. 223. Psychiatric-patient privilege not waived and testimony of psychiatrist hired by state, but not as a result of court order, held inadmissible. 178 C. 626. Purpose of statutory privilege is to protect a therapeutic relationship; communications that bear no relationship to the purpose for which privilege was enacted are admissible subject to normal rules of evidence. 190 C. 813.

Statute reflects public policy against suit by patient's former spouse. 250 C. 86. Evidence of conversation between defendant and third party overheard by mental health worker not protected by privilege provided for under section. 254 C. 694. Medical and dental records created during a patient's inpatient treatment at a mental health facility are mental health records exempt from disclosure under Sec. 52-146e. 318 C. 769. Subdiv. (2): The legislative history and purpose of Subdiv. results in the conclusion that the phrase “including communications and records which occur in or are prepared at a mental health facility” is not intended to create a freestanding category of confidential communications and records unique to mental health facilities but, instead, was intended as an illustrative application of the phrase ‘wherever made’ and, as such, all communications and records thereof prepared in a mental health facility that identify a patient are not privileged under Sec. 52-146e(a) without a consideration of whether they were communications between the individuals identified in the three categories of communicants delineated in Subdiv. 347 C. 675.\n\nCited. 1 CA 384; 14 CA 552; 19 CA 304; 24 CA 287; 25 CA 653; judgment reversed, see 223 C. 52; 30 CA 839; 33 CA 253; Id., 647; 35 CA 94; judgment reversed, see 235 C. 185. Subdiv. (2): Communications and records relating to diagnosis and treatment of an alcohol-related disorder falls within ambit of a “mental condition”; phrase “including communications and records which occur in or are prepared at a mental health facility” interpreted as an illustrative application of phrase “wherever made”, not as a limitation on its scope; therefore, trial court improperly concluded that plaintiff was required to establish that treatment facility located in Maine was a mental health facility as defined in Subdiv. (5) as a condition precedent to invocation of statutory psychiatrist-patient privilege. 54 CA 663. Nursing assessment containing consent form in which defendant consented to “mental health assessment and treatment” and conducted by nurse under supervision of psychiatrist is a mental health record that is privileged under Secs. 52-146d to 52-146f. 73 CA 150.\n\nCited. 28 CS 57.",

Statute reflects public policy against suit by patient's former spouse. 250 CA 86. Legislative intent was not to give courts discretion to override privileged communication. 254 C. 321. Broad sweep of statute covers not only disclosure to defendant or his counsel, but also disclosure to a court even for the limited purpose of an in camera examination; section does not impose an obligation on the holder of privilege to state expressly to whom the records cannot be disclosed, rather, statute indicates that the holder of privilege must state in writing to whom the documents may be disclosed and for what purpose; there is no authority to support the proposition that defendant has a right, even when the complaining witness' credibility is central to the case, to have her confidential records produced directly to him. 289 C. 411. Medical and dental records created by an inpatient mental health facility during the treatment of a patient are exempt from disclosure under section. 318 C. 769. A trial court, in certain circumstances, may be constitutionally required to review in camera privileged psychiatric records of a homicide victim to determine whether information contained therein supports accused's claim of self-defense, provided the accused first demonstrates a compelling need for the privileged records, predicated on the relevance of the records to the self-defense claim, the potential significance of the records in establishing that defense, and the unavailability of alternative sources of information. 326 C. 742.\n\nPsychiatric patient privilege and defendant's right to confrontation discussed. 1 CA 384.

However, no subpoena may compel the production of matters which are privileged or otherwise protected by law from discovery.\n\n(c) Any person to whom a subpoena commanding production of books, papers, documents or tangible things has been directed may, within fifteen days after the service thereof or on or before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance if such time is less than fifteen days after service, serve upon the issuing authority designated in the subpoena written objection to inspection or copying of any or all of the designated materials. If objection is made, the party at whose request the subpoena was issued shall not be entitled to inspect and copy the disputed materials except pursuant to an order of the court in which the cause is pending. The party who requested the subpoena may, if objection has been made, move upon notice to the deponent for an order at any time before or during the taking of the deposition.\n\n(d) The court in which the cause is pending may, upon motion made promptly and in any event at or before the time for compliance specified in a subpoena authorized by subsection (b) of this section, (1) quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and oppressive or if it seeks the production of materials not subject to production under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, or (2) condition denial of the motion upon the advancement by the party who requested the subpoena of the reasonable cost of producing the materials which he is seeking.\n\n(e) If any person to whom a lawful subpoena is issued under any provision of this section fails without just excuse to comply with any of its terms, the court before which the cause is pending, or any judge thereof, may issue a capias and cause him to be brought before such court or judge, as the case may be, and, if the person subpoenaed refuses to comply with said subpoena, such court or judge may commit him to jail until he signifies his willingness to comply with it.\n\n(f) (1) Deposition of witnesses living in this state may be taken in like manner to be used as evidence in a civil action or probate proceeding pending in any court of the United States or of any other state of the United States or of any foreign country, on application to the court in which such civil action or probate proceeding is pending of any party to such civil action or probate proceeding. The Superior Court shall have jurisdiction to quash or modify, or to enforce compliance with, a subpoena issued for the taking of a deposition pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(2) Any person to whom a subpoena has been directed in a civil action or probate proceeding, other than a party to such civil action or probate court proceeding, pending in any court of any other state of the United States or of any foreign country, which subpoena commands (A) the person's appearance at a deposition, or (B) the production, copying or inspection of books, papers, documents or tangible things may, within fifteen days after the service thereof or on or before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance if such time is less than fifteen days after service, serve upon the party who requested issuance of the subpoena written objection to appearing or producing, copying or permitting the inspection of such books, papers, documents or tangible things on the ground that the subpoena will cause such person undue or unreasonable burden or expense. Service of the objection shall be made by United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, without the use of a state marshal or other officer. Such written objection shall be accompanied by an affidavit of costs setting forth the estimated or actual costs of compliance with such subpoena, including, but not limited to, the person's attorney's fees or the costs to such person of electronic discovery. If a person makes such written objection, the party who requested issuance of the subpoena (i) shall not be entitled to compel such person's appearance or receive, copy or inspect the books, papers, documents or tangible things, except pursuant to an order of the Superior Court, and (ii) may, upon notice to such person, file a motion with the Superior Court for an order to compel such person's appearance or production, copying or inspection of such materials in accordance with the terms of such subpoena. When ruling on such motion to compel, the Superior Court shall make a finding as to whether the subpoena subjects the person to undue or unreasonable burden or expense prior to entering any order to compel such person's appearance or the production, copying or inspection of such materials. If the Superior Court finds that the subpoena issued to the person subjects such person to undue or unreasonable burden or expense, any order to compel such person's appearance or production, copying or inspection of such materials shall protect the person from undue or unreasonable burden or expense resulting from compliance with such subpoena and, except in the case of a subpoena commanding the production, copying or inspection of medical records, may include, but not be limited to, the reimbursement of such person's reasonable costs of compliance, as set forth in the affidavit of costs.\n\n(3) The provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection shall not apply to a civil action filed to recover damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death in which it is alleged that such injury or death resulted from the professional malpractice of a health care provider or health care institution.\n\n(P.A. 76-273, S. 5; P.A. 77-604, S. 32, 84; P.A. 06-152, S. 4; P.A. 15-211, S. 29.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 77-604 made technical correction; P.A. 06-152 amended Subsec.

The defendant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 7905; P.A. 82-160, S. 85.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 82-160 rephrased the section.\n\nCited. 123 C. 396. Presumption avails plaintiff until trier finds proven the circumstances with reference to use of car and authority to drive it, leaving burden then on plaintiff to establish that car was being operated by agent in course of employment. Id., 459. Presumption not rebutted by mere offer of substantial countervailing evidence; jury not obliged to accept testimony offered by defendant on agency and may find for plaintiff even if he produces no evidence on that issue. 126 C. 587. Nature of presumption; burden on defendant is restricted to rebutting presumption. 130 C. 185; Id., 684. Plaintiff does not waive benefit of presumption of agency by introducing evidence of the fact of agency on his case in chief. 137 C. 675. Inapplicable where there is no allegation re ownership of car. 145 C. 605. If dealer's plates are affixed to motor vehicle, they constitute prima facie evidence of ownership by dealer to whom plates were issued. 151 C. 252. Cited. 155 C. 218, 221; 156 C. 194. Directed verdict for defendant was proper where plaintiff's proof showed defendant loaned her car to her nephew for his personal family use in course of which accident occurred. 157 C. 258. Presumption is not ousted by mere introduction of contrary evidence, but ceases to operate when trier finds proven facts which fairly put question in issues; direction of verdict for defendant is generally precluded. 164 C. 277. Cited. 190 C. 774; 211 C. 555. Section creates rebuttable presumption of employer-employee relationship between owner and operator of a motor vehicle, rendering owner vicariously liable for compensatory damages arising out of negligent and reckless conduct of the operator, but not vicariously liable for punitive damages stemming from that conduct. 266 C. 822.\n\nCited. 9 CA 221; 11 CA 485; 19 CA 85; 25 CA 665. Discussion of the word “owner”; trial court improperly granted defendant's motion to set aside verdict where jury reasonably could have found from evidence presented that public transit bus involved in accident was owned by defendant and that defendant did not rebut presumption arising under section that bus was operated by agent of defendant acting within the scope of his agency at the time of the accident. 61 CA 29. Presumption is not ousted simply by introduction of any evidence to the contrary. 83 CA 782.\n\nIt is unnecessary to allege agency since statute raises such presumption. 4 CS 226, but see 12 CS 279 and 14 CS 342. Presumption is not overcome by any substantial countervailing evidence but is effective until defendant proves the truth as to what the facts are by a fair preponderance of evidence. 5 CS 20; Id., 97. Describing defendant as “brother, agent and servant” does not waive presumption of agency in favor of plaintiff. 9 CS 193. Statute does not create a new kind of agency but only creates a presumption of agency susceptible to rebuttal. 12 CS 279. Cited. 14 CS 238; 15 CS 148; 16 CS 194. Allegation of ownership and operation are sufficient to raise statutory presumption of agency. 17 CS 49. Section primarily designed to apply to commercial vehicles. Id., 73. Motion for summary judgment by defendant in effect sought to deprive plaintiff of benefit of presumption; denied. 27 CS 108. Cited. 32 CS 158.\n\nCited. 2 Conn. Cir. Ct. 653. Where a minor's vehicle is registered in the name of the father for the purpose of evading financial responsibility, the registered owner of the vehicle is estopped to deny not only ownership of the vehicle but also that the minor-owner was acting in furtherance of the business of the father when the tort occurred. 3 Conn. Cir. Ct. 591, 598. Statute does not establish that operator of car is agent of owner, acting within scope of his employment, but only creates a rebuttable presumption. 5 Conn. Cir. Ct. 113.",

      "text": "(a) In any civil action to recover damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death occurring on or after October 1, 1987, in which it is alleged that such injury or death resulted from the negligence of a health care provider, as defined in section 52-184b, the claimant shall have the burden of proving by the preponderance of the evidence that the alleged actions of the health care provider represented a breach of the prevailing professional standard of care for that health care provider. The prevailing professional standard of care for a given health care provider shall be that level of care, skill and treatment which, in light of all relevant surrounding circumstances, is recognized as acceptable and appropriate by reasonably prudent similar health care providers.\n\n(b) If the defendant health care provider is not certified by the appropriate American board as being a specialist, is not trained and experienced in a medical specialty, or does not hold himself out as a specialist, a “similar health care provider” is one who: (1) Is licensed by the appropriate regulatory agency of this state or another state requiring the same or greater qualifications; and (2) is trained and experienced in the same discipline or school of practice and such training and experience shall be as a result of the active involvement in the practice or teaching of medicine within the five-year period before the incident giving rise to the claim.\n\n(c) If the defendant health care provider is certified by the appropriate American board as a specialist, is trained and experienced in a medical specialty, or holds himself out as a specialist, a “similar health care provider” is one who: (1) Is trained and experienced in the same specialty; and (2) is certified by the appropriate American board in the same specialty; provided if the defendant health care provider is providing treatment or diagnosis for a condition which is not within his specialty, a specialist trained in the treatment or diagnosis for that condition shall be considered a “similar health care provider”.\n\n(d) Any health care provider may testify as an expert in any action if he: (1) Is a “similar health care provider” pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section; or (2) is not a similar health care provider pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section but, to the satisfaction of the court, possesses sufficient training, experience and knowledge as a result of practice or teaching in a related field of medicine, so as to be able to provide such expert testimony as to the prevailing professional standard of care in a given field of medicine. Such training, experience or knowledge shall be as a result of the active involvement in the practice or teaching of medicine within the five-year period before the incident giving rise to the claim.\n\n(P.A. 86-338, S. 11; P.A. 87-227, S. 8.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 87-227 amended Subsec. (a) to change applicability of section from “In any cause of action accruing on or after October 1, 1986, to recover damages for personal injury or wrongful death” to “In any civil action to recover damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death occurring on or after October 1, 1987” and specified that a health care provider is “as defined in section 52-184b”.\n\nCited. 211 C. 555; 214 C. 1; 215 C. 701; 239 C. 574; 242 C. 1. There is no explicit incorporation of the definition in Sec. 52-184b with reference to a similar health care provider anywhere in this section; this suggests that legislature intended to incorporate the definition only with reference to defendant health care providers and not with reference to similar health care providers. 265 C. 79.\n\nCited. 34 CA 871; 44 CA 257; 46 CA 391.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nIn claim for ordinary negligence for failure of health care provider to warn third party, expert testimony required to prove standard of care, breach of that standard and causation of injury. 262 C. 248. Expert testimony establishing standard of care at a particular hospital is relevant only if it comports with an accepted, applicable national standard of care. 289 C. 61.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\nAbsent evidence of specialized training, registered nurses are considered nonspecialists under Subsec. 172 CA 699.\n\nSubsec. (c):\n\nGood faith opinion letter from physician who is board certified in obstetrics and gynecology meets requirements of Subsec. because claims were related to care given by certified nurse-midwives and a registered nurse in same specialty. 314 C. 709.\n\nPlaintiff's author of opinion letter does not fall within definition of “similar health care provider” under section because, unlike defendant physician, the author of the opinion letter is not board certified in emergency medicine. 168 CA 47. Author of plaintiff's opinion letter does not fall within definition of “similar health care provider” under section because, unlike defendant who is an anatomic pathologist, the author of the opinion letter is a clinical pathologist. 187 CA 555.\n\nSubsec. (d):\n\nDoes not preclude board-certified physician from testifying as an expert solely because the physician was not board-certified at the time of the alleged malpractice. 262 C. 637.\n\nSubsec. deals with situations where specialties overlap. 77 CA 307. Affords court discretion in determining whether an expert may testify and thus it is possible that expert could qualify to testify at trial under Subsec. but not qualify to provide a prelitigation opinion pursuant to Sec. 52-190a(a). 117 CA 535.",
