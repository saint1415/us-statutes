      "text": "Upon the trial of all matters of fact in any cause or action in the Superior Court, whether to the court or jury, or before any judge thereof when the jurisdiction of any action or proceeding is vested in him, if either party is aggrieved by the decision of the court or judge upon any question or questions of law arising in the trial, including the denial of a motion to set aside a verdict, he may appeal to the court having jurisdiction from the final judgment of the court or of such judge, or from the decision of the court granting a motion to set aside a verdict, except in small claims cases, which shall not be appealable, and appeals as provided in sections 8-8 and 8-9.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 8003; 1959, P.A. 28, S. 118; 1961, P.A. 509, S. 2; P.A. 74-183, S. 93, 291; P.A. 76-436, S. 139, 681; P.A. 77-347, S. 8, 11; P.A. 78-280, S. 105, 127; P.A. 82-160, S. 135; June Sp. Sess. P.A. 83-29, S. 8, 82; P.A. 89-356, S. 8.)\n\nHistory: 1959 act deleted provision for appeal from civil cause or action in municipal court; 1961 act deleted provision excepting summary process from coverage.; P.A. 74-183 deleted reference to causes or actions in court of common pleas, effective December 31, 1974; P.A. 76-436 added exception re Sec. 52-7, effective July 1, 1978; P.A. 77-347 deleted exception added by P.A. 76-436 and clarified provision re appeals to supreme court by adding exception re Secs. 51-164t, 51-164v and 51-197b; P.A. 78-280 made minor change in wording; P.A. 82-160 rephrased the section and replaced provisions concerning the right to appeal to the supreme court “except as provided in sections 51-164t, 51-164v and 51-197b” with exceptions for small claims cases, appeals within the jurisdiction of the appellate session, administrative appeals and except as otherwise provided by statute; June Sp. Sess. P.A. 83-29 deleted reference to supreme court and substituted reference to court “having jurisdiction” and deleted reference to appellate session and Sec. 51-197d and added exception re appeals as provided in Secs. 8-8, 8-9, 8-28 and 8-30; P.A. 89-356 deleted reference to Secs. 8-28 and 8-30.\n\nAppeals from decision of a court; in general: “In the trial” is not to be taken in a strict sense. 58 C. 101. Party may appeal, though not in fact aggrieved. 60 C. 427; 97 C. 519; 101 C. 735. Right depends on possibility of, rather than actual, grievance. 69 C. 715; 122 C. 464; 130 C. 499. New trial should not be sought where only small amount involved. 79 C. 104; 88 C. 50. Meaning of “action”. 79 C. 47.

Remedy where appeal not proper is motion to erase. 96 C. 718; 108 C. 307; 109 C. 51. Judgment for one defendant and against the other final as to former, though latter appeals. 97 C. 223. Cited. 114 C. 584. Decision setting aside verdict is not a final judgment; formerly appealable under a separate statute. 115 C. 680. Formerly, appeal from decision on motion to set aside verdict could not be combined with appeal from judgment. 119 C. 312; Id., 400. Appellee to avail himself of claimed error should file cross-appeal; bill of exceptions does not take place of appeal. 122 C. 465. Cited. 126 C. 591, 604; 128 C. 478; 130 C. 282; Id., 472.

Now possible to take single appeal both from ruling on motion to set verdict aside and from judgment. Id., 559. Appeal from judgment of nonsuit held improper and appeal dismissed; dismissal does not conclude substantive rights of plaintiff. 145 C. 99. Cited. Id., 130. Where motion to set aside a verdict is denied, judgment is rendered upon the verdict and the appeal is from that judgment. Id., 401. Failure to appeal from such judgment is defect of form and does not void appeal. Id, 586. Failure of plaintiff to file timely motion to dismiss considered waiver of defendants' defective appeal. 146 C. 282. If no motion to dismiss appeal from denial of motion is filed within 10 days of appeal, defect may be deemed waived. 147 C. 109. Failure to make timely objection, whether through mistake of law, inattention or design, to errors occurring in the course of a trial may disqualify issue as a basis of appeal. Id., 296. Appeal bond obligated defendant to one plaintiff only, held, on timely motion of other plaintiff, that appeal was defective as to such plaintiff. Id., 722. The Liquor Control Commission represents the public interest in such matters as the issuance, renewal, revocation and suspension of liquor permits; when action of commission with respect to such a matter is reversed by a court, commission is a party aggrieved by the decision of the court and, as such, may appeal to the Supreme Court. 150 C. 68. City employer in workers' compensation case seeking to intervene in employee's negligence action against physician satisfies the test for appellate jurisdiction. 253 C. 429. Appellate jurisdiction is limited to final judgments of trial court. 263 C. 39. Where state appeals criminal defendant's motion for a new trial after guilty verdict had been rendered, court concluded that section applies to criminal cases and authorizes such an appeal upon the granting of motion to set aside the verdict but not upon the granting of motion for a new trial. 265 C. 658.\n\nNecessity of rendition of judgment by trial court: This was necessary under old practice; 7 C. 439; as it is now. 63 C. 576. If no judgment has been rendered, appeal is void. 66 C. 264; 109 C. 50.\n\nJudgments reviewable in general: Judgment appealed from must be final. 51 C. 328; 71 C. 459; 74 C. 202; 96 C. 718; 108 C. 307; 109 C. 51.

Meaning of “action”; judgment by consent not ordinarily reviewable. 79 C. 47. Recognition that judgment necessarily follows is not consent. 72 C. 257. Joining appeal from reviewable judgment to one not reviewable does not invalidate former. 64 C. 535. A judgment may be final as to one party alone; 66 C. 37; 97 C. 223; or as to one part of controversy alone. 69 C. 714. A judgment rendered on a directed verdict is a final judgment. 104 C. 451. Judgment entered when party refuses to plead further after demurrer is overruled, is final. 124 C. 342. After judgment rendered on one cause of action, denial of plaintiff's motion for trial on another cause of action, in same complaint, is final judgment. 126 C. 690. Judgment dismissing action for want of jurisdiction is final. 133 C. 249. To constitute a final judgment, the rights of the parties must be concluded by the ruling so that further proceedings cannot affect them; order of reference to a state referee and refusal of court to grant motion to revoke, both final judgments from which an appeal may be taken. 146 C. 55. An order staying proceedings is not a final order and therefore not appealable; denial of motion to expunge a counterclaim held not an appealable judgment. 148 C. 218. In criminal case, appeal from “the verdict rendered ... and the sentence of the court”, while not taken from final judgment in strict accordance with statute, was treated as one from final judgment since imposition of sentence is judgment of court. 149 C. 489.\n\nJudgments reviewable; particular cases: Denial of petition for new trial. 58 C. 69.

Order staying proceedings; denial of motion to expunge counterclaim. 148 C. 218. Summary judgment issued pursuant to Sec. 304 of the Practice Book, being interlocutory only, is not a final judgment from which appeal lies. 153 C. 120. The test of finality is whether the rights of the parties are so concluded that further proceedings cannot affect them. 146 C. 55; 153 C. 210.\n\nAppeals from decision of a judge: Nature of proceeding. 67 C. 206.

On appeal from denial of motion to set verdict aside as against evidence, inclusion of arguments between counsel improper. 112 C. 120. Cited. 115 C. 722; 118 C. 699; 124 C. 560; 125 C. 266.\n\nRules governing action of court: New trial should not be granted unless it appears that there is manifest injustice, mistake in the application of legal principles, or corruption or prejudice; 9 C. 106; 12 C. 217; Id., 489; 19 C. 330; 21 C. 252; 26 C. 404; 29 C. 123; 30 C. 310; 52 C. 449; 64 C. 134; 68 C. 294; 69 C. 186; Id., 302; Id., 651; 72 C. 635; 75 C. 129; 79 C. 99; Id., 270; Id., 477; 90 C. 74; 91 C. 457; 93 C. 387; 99 C. 105; 102 C. 485; 104 C. 740; 106 C. 704; 150 C. 567; nor to enable a party to recover nominal damages merely. 29 C. 123.

Immaterial that trial court assigns wrong ground for its action in setting verdict aside. 103 C. 718; 104 C. 388; 105 C. 775. Setting aside of verdict upon conflicting testimony upheld; 104 C. 518; 106 C. 704; but only where conclusion is unreasonable. Id. Judgment entered on a directed verdict is a final judgment; distinguished from judgment of nonsuit. 104 C. 451.

Mere fact that court would have reached a different result not sufficient; 91 C. 404; or doubts correctness of verdict. 93 C. 242. That verdict just equals plaintiff's claim does not show disregard of instruction to allow certain sum to defendant. 94 C. 613. In criminal case, verdict not set aside unless palpably and manifestly against the evidence. 96 C. 640. Verdict palpably inadequate may be set aside. 83 C. 445.

Verdict directed may be set aside. 92 C. 252; 100 C. 529. Refusal to direct verdict does not prevent setting it aside. 90 C. 18. Where defendant requests no finding for purposes of appeal and no finding was made, Supreme Court will be confined to pleadings and judgment in determining facts on which judgment was based; if judgment was for plaintiff, this means that all material and disputed allegations in the pleadings were found for him. 150 C. 345.

Denial of motion to dismiss was not an appealable final judgment because, although interlocutory appeal from denial of motion to dismiss is permitted if motion presents a colorable double jeopardy claim, in this case defendant's trial has concluded and there is no risk that he will be subjected to a second prosecution, consequently he will not suffer irreparable harm if appellate review is postponed until after his sentence is imposed. 121 CA 756.

Motion to erase part of record not to be encouraged. 83 C. 243. Dismissal of case in ignorance of fact known to parties which would uphold appeal. 82 C. 208. Motion lies to strike from record special finding of facts where question arises on demurrer; 93 C. 160; so to strike out appeal in summary process action; 95 C. 69; or one attempted to be taken from judgment not final. 96 C. 719; 109 C. 50. No appeal lies from overruling of accused's challenge to array when he thereupon proceeds to trial without a jury. 105 C. 337. A motion to open and vacate a judgment during the term at which it was rendered is addressed to the court's discretion, and the action of the court will not be disturbed unless it is a clear abuse of its discretion; motion to revoke an order of reference to a state referee is the legal equivalent of a motion to open a judgment. 147 C. 13. On an appeal by defendant from the denial of a motion for judgment non obstante veredicto, plaintiff is required to set forth, in an appendix, the evidence which he claims warrants the rendition of a verdict in his favor. Id., 18. Jurisdiction of appeal court in reviewing denial of a motion to set aside a verdict as excessive. Id., 171. When a pleader wishes to admit or deny only a portion of a paragraph, he must recite that portion; request to add certain paragraphs to draft finding must be accompanied by a record of the relevant evidence. Id., 305. Motion to vacate a decree justified only where there was total absence of jurisdiction. Id., 482. The same principles are to be applied in reviewing court's action in failing to set aside a verdict and in denying a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. 148 C. 419. In setting aside a verdict, court ordered a new trial rather than directing a verdict, for it would not have been an abuse of discretion for the trial court to have denied a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and to have ordered a new trial. Id., 426.\n\nPractice of court. Informality of appeal under new law disregarded; 64 C. 462; 72 C. 403; so where error is clear; 85 C. 679; and court overlooked minor error of procedure. 92 C. 7. Where facts found were written on margin of request for finding, court regarded them. 66 C. 56. Court passed on question irregularly presented where error was apparent and public interest involved; 67 C. 222; so where question was one of practice frequently arising; 67 C. 278; so where interpleader fairly presented questions, though it was perhaps not properly brought; 84 C. 364; 85 C. 573; 88 C. 157; 89 C. 332; so suit to construe deed of trust; 84 C. 497; so where finding was made in jury case and no one objected; 86 C. 281; so where case fully argued, court overlooked failure to close issue; 87 C. 614; so in assigning error, where no objection made. 81 C. 656. In murder case, court overlooked defects of record to pass on real issues. 93 C. 343. Where case is tried upon a certain theory, court will adopt that theory. 85 C. 147; 86 C. 361; Id., 551; 107 C. 571, 580. Where question was assigned and argued as question of law, court so treated it. 65 C. 118. So it confined itself to question assumed by parties to be the only one at issue. 70 C. 489. So it followed agreement of counsel that it might regard pleadings as broad enough to cover facts found. 70 C. 540. Court regarded demurrer on same theory as had parties and trial court; 91 C. 514; 96 C. 543; 107 C. 119; and adopted parties' construction of pleadings. 94 C. 213; 96 C. 401. Court regarded demurrer to answer in light of facts stated in reply; 91 C. 354; and demurrer to complaint in light of finding. 92 C. 646. Court stated first impression on defective appeal where both parties desired decision. 71 C. 462. It accepts issues as framed on pleadings. 83 C. 666. It decided matters as interpleader though no judgment to interplead appeared, where parties so treated it. 84 C. 209. Where both parties overlooked statute, court ordered reargument; 73 C. 519; 72 C. 157; and in another case found error because of its terms. 92 C. 551. Minor grounds of demurrer, curable by amendment, disregarded to pass on main issue; 65 C. 326; so minor points which might be raised. 66 C. 134. An issue prominent and likely to be again presented considered, though another point was decisive; 66 C. 315; 81 C. 655; 82 C. 5; 93 C. 377; but an issue not likely to rise again and which might cause embarrassment was disregarded in such a case. 68 C. 71. Decision should be limited to rights of those who are parties. 69 C. 10. Where demurrer to answer presents fundamental question, demurrer to complaint may be overlooked. 79 C. 470. Court refused to discuss questions of evidence not material to decision where no new trial ordered; 81 C. 622; and so an issue, where new trial ordered on another ground. 82 C. 280. Where same questions arise on finding and ruling on demurrer, only former regarded. 82 C. 298; 85 C. 50; Id., 67. Where two appeals taken and decision of one is conclusive, court may pass on other, to determine costs, etc. 85 C. 271. It will not pass on question not properly presented where to do so would prevent party raising question of constitutionality in U.S. court. 84 C. 606. Court heard case involving salary of its own members where parties waived disqualification. 78 C. 536. Where public interest is involved, court may remand case for further finding. Id., 250. On appeal from demurrer, facts later appearing may be consulted; 74 C. 689; 83 C. 554; 87 C. 341; Id., 403, see 83 C. 634; so on appeal from plea in abatement. 76 C. 414.

Finding of issues generally for plaintiff but judgment given on one count only; that count will alone be considered on defendant's appeal; otherwise if defendant prejudiced by such finding. Id., 259.

Court may waive defect in pleading where trial court and both parties treated pleadings as proper. 105 C. 478. Proper procedure in appeal by state in a criminal case reviewed. 106 C. 115. In suit for declaratory judgment, court is not limited by issues joined or claims of counsel; court will itself give appropriate judgment. 107 C. 661. In absence of a finding by the court, legal conclusions upon which the judgment is based must be ascertained from the memorandum. 146 C. 1. Court cannot act on assumed rulings of the court that are not discoverable on the record. Id., 10. Court may resort to the memorandum of decision for aid in interpreting uncertainties in the finding. Id., 42. Award of damages will not be set aside if it does not offend the sense of justice and compel conclusion that jury was influenced by partiality, prejudice or mistake. Id., 344. Assignments of error not pursued in brief are treated as abandoned. Id., 360. If sole question on appeal is the sufficiency of evidence to sustain the conviction, no finding of facts is necessary since conviction can only be tested by the evidence. Id., 693, 705; 147 C. 90. If appellant fails to present all evidence necessary for proper consideration of an appeal, it becomes the duty of appellee to do so. Id., 7.

Request to add certain paragraphs to draft finding must be accompanied by a record of the relevant evidence. Id., 305.

Court refused to review alleged error in rulings on evidence because party had not followed procedure set out in Sec. 648 of Practice Book. Id., 27. In order to avail himself of the rule that grounds upon which evidence is claimed to be inadmissible must be stated, a party must state the grounds for his claim of admissibility; a finding in a jury trial is merely a narrative of the facts claimed to have been proved by each side, made for the purpose of fairly presenting any claimed errors in the charge or rulings of the court. Id., 208. Corrections in a finding can be made if the trial court has refused to find a material fact which was an admitted or undisputed fact; information afforded by deeds and map introduced in evidence held to constitute such material fact; the fact that the trial court assigned an incorrect reason for its decision would not require a reversal of the judgment if it was correct for another reason. Id., 299. When appellant assigns as error, and makes the claim in his brief, that a material fact was found without evidence, and does not print the relevant evidence, the burden of printing evidence to show that no error was committed is placed on appellee; if appellee fails to print such evidence, then the questioned finding must be stricken; where admissibility of evidence depends upon a preliminary question of fact, to be determined by the court, its decision is not to be reversed unless there is clear and manifest error. Id., 398. Where court sustained a demurrer on grounds other than those claimed by defendant, the ruling may be upheld if a proper conclusion was reached. Id., 430. Court dismissed appeal as the question presented was then academic. Id., 456. An obviously erroneous award of damages can be corrected to conform to the finding of the trial court. Id., 504.

Defendant may have exception to order substituting new plaintiff. 73 C. 384. It is error to treat case on wrong basis; 77 C. 291; to overlook a statute, though not referred to; 72 C. 157; 92 C. 551; 73 C. 519; to fail to regard material facts; 73 C. 573; to consider as evidence matter not in the case, or to misconstrue purport of testimony; 77 C. 688; not to consider evidence for all proper purposes; 82 C. 460; to insert in charge issue not raised by pleading; 84 C. 150; to leave question of law to the jury; 86 C. 641; to direct verdict on erroneous assumption as to facts; 88 C. 16; to refuse to permit counsel to press proper claim in argument; 93 C. 106; to fail to regard material and relevant evidence; 95 C. 445; but frankness of the court in suggesting that a ruling is questionable is not. 95 C. 503. A judgment not supported by facts found is erroneous. 83 C. 118; 87 C. 617. The possibility of affecting the result is the test as regards rulings on evidence. 78 C. 396; 83 C. 547. Admission of evidence attacking credit. 74 C. 425; 76 C. 92. It is error to treat evidence as uncontradicted where facts contradict it; 74 C. 468; or to find material fact without evidence. 73 C. 692; 82 C. 5; 84 C. 93; Id., 122. In ruling on demurrer, question is correctness of result, not reasons assigned. 84 C. 275. Departure from technical rules in examining witness unfamiliar with English language overlooked. 93 C. 107. Question which trial court does not find it necessary to rule upon disregarded. Id., 118. Refusal to direct verdict is not error. Id., 454. An erroneous conclusion from subordinate facts is an error of law. 96 C. 275. Where demurrer of one defendant to complaint is sustained, but case goes on and verdict is finally directed for it, appeal from verdict does not bring up ruling on demurrer. Id., 497. In passing on demurrer, court not restricted to grounds considered by trial court. Id., 542. So, where trial court inadvertently sustains demurrer to original complaint when amended complaint has been filed. 102 C. 128. When pleading to which a demurrer has been sustained is voluntarily replaced by another pleading on which issue is joined and a trial had, there is no right of appeal from decision on demurrer. 99 C. 67. Error held harmful where material evidence excluded on an erroneous ground and, on appeal, it could not be determined that the evidence was inadmissible for the purpose for which it was offered. 146 C. 42. There must be evidence to support a finding of fact; conclusions are tested by the finding and not by the evidence. Id., 90. Cross-examination to show motive, interest, bias or prejudice held to have been unduly restricted by court. 147 C. 40. For a new trial because of an erroneous ruling on evidence, the ruling must be both erroneous and harmful. Id., 76. Test for reasonableness of court's action in directing a verdict. Id., 398. If inapplicable statute is submitted to the jury, the materiality of the error must be determined on the whole record before the court. Id., 638. Court's finding omitted a ruling on evidence which was relied on as a ground of error, held that, because of the nature of the ruling, a new trial was necessary. Id., 641. Extemporaneous remark by judge that damages were “nominal” held not to invalidate his award of $340. Id., 728. Error cannot be predicated on ambiguous exceptions which do not fairly apprise the trial court of the error claimed. 148 C. 459.\n\nHarmless errors; in general. As regards receiver, judgment removing him is harmless. 70 C. 473. Plaintiff not harmed by grant of nonsuit as to one of two defendants. 79 C. 379. Ruling on demurrer of one party held not to avail another; 65 C. 84; so party cannot complain of any ruling as to which he has no interest. 84 C. 208. A new trial will not be granted, where record shows error to be harmless; 65 C. 76; 69 C. 201; 90 C. 382; 91 C. 354; 101 C. 59; 109 C. 401, 402; and the whole record is to be consulted. 75 C. 548. Errors must be fundamental and substantial; 83 C. 547; 85 C. 55; and prejudicial to appellant. 87 C. 341; 91 C. 316.

Court refused to review ruling on evidence since no ground for objection was stated. Id., 566.

Ordinarily, an erroneous charge on any material issue is ground for new trial. 87 C. 652. Assumption of fact mistakenly harmless even in murder case if jury told that facts were for them to determine; 93 C. 328; or court correctly states duty of parties in the premises; 96 C. 49; so mistake as to evidence. 95 C. 574.

Id., 484. A later incorrect statement will be considered misleading, though correct rule first stated; 74 C. 177; 75 C. 326; and a later correction will not always remedy an earlier statement. 69 C. 219; 71 C. 61. Even a misstatement of evidence is not harmless where jury could not fail to follow it. 84 C. 248. Where verdict equals amount erroneously included in charge, with interest, harm appears. 81 C. 479. Calling particular attention to element of damages not properly recoverable held harmful; 91 C. 407; so permitting recovery for breach of inapplicable statute; 96 C. 22; so requiring proof of incompetency of driver of automobile as well as his negligence. Id., 669. So charge authorizing jury to treat alleged intentional wrongdoing as an accident where evidence affords no warrant for that view. 92 C. 388.

Errors in charge immaterial if verdict is properly directed. 95 C. 252. Where jury finds accused guilty, and there was no reasonable basis for a finding that enterprise was abandoned, error in charging as to that matter harmless. 97 C. 330.

Chance remark concerning contributory negligence, though incorrect, held cured by balance of charge. 98 C. 610. Charge containing absolute contradiction on a vital point held error. 99 C. 423. Unless whole charge printed, omissions cannot be presumed. 102 C. 639. Conflicting statements regarding law governing case are usually ground for reversal. 103 C. 557. A charge is tested by the finding, not by the evidence. 147 C. 171, 296, 311. If party took no exception to charge of jury, he cannot claim error in such charge on appeal. Id., 191. Wholesale attack on charge without any attempt to specify alleged error held to disentitle appellant to a review of the correctness of the charge. Id., 663, see also 148 C. 130. Defendant could prevail on a denial of negligence or a defense of contributory negligence; hence possible error in charge on issue of negligence cured by general verdict for defendant. 147 C. 727. Court will not review alleged error in the charge to the jury if the party did not file any request to charge or, at the conclusion of the charge, took no exception to any part of the charge. 148 C. 27. Party not entitled to a review of the correctness of a charge if he did not submit a proper request to charge. Id., 266.\n\nImmaterial errors.

Item of insignificant amount ignored in finding and reasons of appeal disregarded. 85 C. 629. De minimis non curat lex. 79 C. 104; 88 C. 50. Charge increasing damage by small amount. 83 C. 208. Trivial error in damages. 79 C. 343; 86 C. 265; 90 C. 317. Frivolous motion in error should not be reserved. 13 C. 216. Erroneous allowance of $4 in judgment of $152. 94 C. 256. Failure to allow interest amounting to $3 or less. 96 C. 645. Failure of court in ordering remittitur to allow for nominal damages amounting to $1. 96 C. 685. On appeal from award of nominal damages, error held too inconsequential to merit a new trial on issue of damages. 146 C. 470. Extemporaneous remark by judge that damages were “nominal” held not to invalidate his award of $340. 147 C. 728.\n\nErrors cured. Error in ruling on demurrer may be cured by subsequent proceedings; 74 C. 689; 83 C. 554; Id., 634; 87 C. 341; Id., 403; so ruling on plea in abatement; 76 C. 414; so error in admitting document may be cured by facts subsequently proved. 85 C. 18, see 83 C. 575. Failure to recite notice of injury cured by admitting due notice. 85 C. 221.

Error in failing to charge as requested cured by verdict negativing facts on which it is based. 86 C. 263. Refusal to allow proper amendment disregarded where facts are stated in answer. 87 C. 634. Aider by verdict. 68 C. 517; 70 C. 72; 72 C. 112; 75 C. 201; 81 C. 696; 84 C. 272; 93 C. 643; 97 C. 149; 108 C. 127. Leaving paper in file given to jury improperly cured by charge; 82 C. 59; so improper argument. 81 C. 22; 86 C. 415. Amendment curing defect will cause demurrer on that ground to be overruled. 71 C. 632. Statement in charge may cure improper argument; 95 C. 111, see 96 C. 160; Id., 289; and ordering improper evidence stricken out and directing jury to disregard it may cure error in its admission; 95 C. 500; but this may not be so in criminal case; 97 C. 259; and charge that evidence as to one being a careful driver is immaterial if they found him negligent does not cure error in admitting the testimony as to reputation. 95 C. 639. Demonstration of personal injury not under oath repeated under oath. 96 C. 34. Defects in drawing jury panel waived by accused if he elects trial by the court. 105 C. 337. Error in charge on one count cured by general verdict where complaint contained two counts and no interrogatories were filed. Id., 486. Defendant who files new answer to amended complaint waives review of judgment on motion to expunge parts of original answer to original complaint. Id., 675. Defendant could prevail on a denial of negligence or a defense of contributory negligence, hence possible error in charge on issue of negligence cured by general verdict for defendant. 147 C. 727. Prompt direction by court to jury to disregard its comment rendered comment harmless. 154 C. 314.\n\nErrors induced by appellant. Error induced by appellant no ground for new trial. 66 C. 577; 73 C. 379; 104 C. 299. Exclusion of evidence on appellant's objection. 67 C. 50. Findings sought by appellant. 70 C. 480. Where court adopts theory and requests of appellant, he cannot complain; 69 C. 228; 76 C. 283; 80 C. 582; 83 C. 278; 96 C. 41; 106 C. 157; nor can he, as to taxing costs on count inserted by him out of court's jurisdiction. 79 C. 305. Party securing process can rarely object to it as invalid. 77 C. 183. Party can rarely complain of failure of opponent to introduce evidence, induced by his silence; 77 C. 674; or of charge which imposes greater restrictions on opponent than his own requests; 82 C. 647; or of the admission of evidence in pursuance of his own theory; 84 C. 508; or of failure to charge due to his own admissions on failure to make claim. 79 C. 706. If party consents to admission of evidence, he cannot complain; 65 C. 69; or to use of document otherwise inadmissible; 90 C. 669; nor can he raise other questions where he agrees to a finding; 71 C. 505; nor can he complain of decision on demurrer to which he consents; 72 C. 435; or of ruling consented to. 79 C. 79. But to recognize that judgment is necessary result of certain ruling does not make it judgment by consent; and consent to filing amendment does not waive defects in it. 72 C. 257.\n\nErrors waived. By trial and consent to reservation, party is estopped to claim that issues tried were not those settled before trial; 69 C. 228; so to claim error as to pleadings after stipulation filed and judgment entered accordingly. 67 C. 73. A party claiming judgment against all defendants cannot complain of failure to give it against one only. 68 C. 496. An executor who enters to defend cannot complain of a judgment against “the defendant.” 77 C. 382. Inspection and approval of judgment file as waiving defects. 88 C. 676.

Plea in bar or admissions in answer waives such defects as are reached by motion. 66 C. 165; 70 C. 73; Id., 320; 73 C. 83; Id., 368; 74 C. 304; 75 C. 254; 77 C. 382; Id., 602; 78 C. 119.

If nonsuit for variance is properly granted, case should not be remanded. 82 C. 236. If finding shows judgment in part based on error, new trial should be ordered. 85 C. 212. If all facts of record, judgment may be given without new trial; 72 C. 444; 99 C. 511; if facts proved lead to definite conclusion, it should be adopted; 96 C. 412; but not if finding is uncertain; 75 C. 519; or is so altered on appeal as to materially change basis of judgment; 82 C. 619; 86 C. 481; 105 C. 432; or is based in part on inadmissible evidence. 84 C. 694. When former finding of facts is not affected by reversal. 46 C. 38. New trial will not be ordered where it would be unavailing; 64 C. 397; 72 C. 617; or where no error appears though court cannot see how decision was reached; 65 C. 442; or where there are irregularities in reaching a judgment responsive to issues and supported by facts; 68 C. 201; or where substantial justice has been done; Id., 579; 78 C. 422; as where action was brought at law instead of in equity; 71 C. 250; but the court set aside a judgment for error in admitting evidence, though new trial could not result differently. 70 C. 647. If little more than nominal sum involved, court hesitates to grant new trial. 72 C. 561; 79 C. 108; 85 C. 629; 106 C. 39; 107 C. 535. Unless substantial rights are involved; 67 C. 255; 84 C. 556; thus where judgment for defendant was erroneous, but plaintiff was only entitled to nominal damages, new trial not granted; 86 C. 552; 106 C. 174; 108 C. 99; but otherwise where continuing nuisance is involved; 106 C. 174; but if plaintiff gets substantial damages and is only entitled to nominal, case should be remanded for latter judgment. 75 C. 42. A portion of a judgment may be stricken out; Id., 251; or a certain amount of damages may be added; Id., 301; and if erroneous part of judgment can be separated and justice done, court may modify judgment; 83 C. 34; and where issues properly determined, but judgment on them is erroneous, court may modify it. Id., 118. But the court remanded a case with directions to exclude an item erroneously included. 84 C. 24. And for erroneous direction of verdict or setting it aside, new trial must be ordered; 81 C. 579; so where trial court directs remittitur and it is not filed. 89 C. 712. Remanding case with directions to enter judgment for less amount than originally given. 85 C. 640. Judgment for new trial unless remittitur is filed; 69 C. 652; 71 C. 2; 78 C. 300; 81 C. 101; 85 C. 24; 87 C. 686; for new trial on issue of damages. 147 C. 365. Unless claim for damages amended to equal those found, new trial. 89 C. 254. Judgment where U.S. Supreme Court reverses our court. 82 C. 702. Extension of time for redemption of mortgage where law day expires pending appeal. 85 C. 383; 90 C. 652. Fixing time of execution in murder case. 81 C. 22. Where there are several parties, final judgment must determine rights of all, although some only appeal. 76 C. 394. If accused is found guilty on two counts by general verdict and either is good, judgment stands. 66 C. 255. Bill of exceptions cannot enlarge judgment as to party not appealing. 72 C. 562. If any one of several defenses is good, judgment for defendant stands. 80 C. 124. Where in fraud action trial court set aside mortgage and also gave damages, Supreme Court, finding error as to former, directed that damages be increased by amount of mortgage. 91 C. 128. Where trial court granted an injunction and error was found, all facts appearing of record, Supreme Court directed judgment for damages. 92 C. 24. Where injunction included some land improperly, case remanded to determine proper lines. 93 C. 233. Where damages assessed as of wrong date, case was remanded with directions for a new trial unless excess of damages was remitted. Id., 123. Where there was error as to damages and court could not see how they were determined, retrial necessary. Id., 413. Where demurrer of one defendant was sustained wrongfully, even though it appeared that judgment would finally go against plaintiff, case was reversed. Id., 570. Where it appeared that trial court disposed of case on side issue, case was remanded to determine real issue. 95 C. 300. Where plaintiff could not win anyway, errors as to him are harmless. 100 C. 250. Evidence printed, but not certified, will not be considered. 102 C. 357. Court will dismiss action wherever want of jurisdiction of subject matter appears. 105 C. 511. Reversal of judgment for defendant on issue of liability; new trial may be limited to assessment of damages. Id., 663; and this, whether trial to jury or court. 107 C. 72; Id., 586; 108 C. 561. Supreme Court's right to remand, if error is found, is unqualified. 128 C. 437. If there is reasonable difference of opinion on the issue of proximate cause, the determination is for the trier. 146 C. 352; Id., 470. Judgment set aside since no conclusions of either fact or law are included in the finding. 147 C. 305. Where claimed newly discovered evidence would merely affect the credibility of a witness, it is not a ground for a new trial unless it is reasonably probable that on a new trial there would be a different result. Id., 566. When evidence is excluded upon a mere general objection and the offering party at no time assigns any ground in support of the claim of admissibility, the Supreme Court lacks a basis for reviewing court's ruling re admissibility. Id., 625. Court's finding omitted a ruling on evidence which was relied on as a ground of error; held that because of the nature of the ruling, a new trial was necessary. Id., 641. Where finding contained inconsistencies and was partially based on erroneous view of the law, case remanded for new trial. 148 C. 223. The fact that a trial court assigned an incorrect reason for its decision would not require a reversal of the judgment if it was correct for another reason. Id., 299. Where the admissibility of evidence depends upon a preliminary question of fact, to be determined by the court, its decision is not to be reversed unless there is clear and manifest error. Id., 398. Court dismissed the appeal as the question presented was then academic. Id., 456. An obviously erroneous award of damages can be corrected to conform to the finding of the trial court. Id., 504.\n\nEffect of Supreme Court's action. On reversal of one judgment, others dependent on it fall. 73 C. 414; 75 C. 393; 85 C. 271. Status of cause when remanded; 1 D. 152; case is the same; 73 C. 413; and so is status of parties. 81 C. 719; 85 C. 271. On remand, judgment sustaining demurrer must enter unless pleadings are changed. 79 C. 605. Judgment special order. 17 C. 73; 35 C. 102. On reversal of judgment on demurrer overruled, final file of clerk is authoritative expression of judgment; if rescript is ambiguous, opinion should be consulted. 72 C. 444. Effect of decision as to construction of will. 83 C. 369. Where judgment is entered in trial court in accordance with opinion of Supreme Court, judgment, not opinion, determines issues. 65 C. 116. Opinion of court in granting new trial becomes law of case. 91 C. 430. Statements in opinions to be read in light of exact questions at issue. 93 C. 401. Reversal of itself not grant of new trial. 90 C. 412. On remanding, case goes to court or jury list from which it came. 91 C. 703. Where plaintiff prevailed as to each of two counts and as to counterclaim, and there was error as to one count, case remanded with directions to enter judgment between amount of count as to which no error and of counterclaim, and for retrial of issues on other count. 95 C. 600. When error found and cause remanded, new trial of all issues is necessary; adoption of parts of finding in first case by Supreme Court in its opinion does not require same finding on retrial. 105 C. 250. Where plaintiff prevails on all litigated issues, remand to correct inadvertent error in judgment does not make defendant party entitled to costs. 133 C. 18. Section authorizes a remand of a case for retrial on writs of error. 135 C. 367. A judgment responsive to the issues and supported by the facts should stand, even if court's method of reaching its conclusion might be questionable. 138 C. 718.
