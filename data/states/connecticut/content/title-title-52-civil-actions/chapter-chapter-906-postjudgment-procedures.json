(g); P.A. 83-581 specified that the exempt property was that “of any natural person”, added Subdivs. (j) to (o), formerly Sec. 52-352c, and added Subdivs. (p) and (q), formerly Sec. 52-354; P.A. 91-239 amended Subdiv. (m) by deleting former provision re payments received by exemptioner under profit-sharing, pension, stock bonus, annuity or similar retirement plan and added new provision re assets or interests of exemptioner in, or payments received by the exemptioner from, a plan or arrangement described in Sec. 52-321a; P.A. 92-94 added livestock feed to the exempt property listed in Subdiv. (b) and specified that such property used in the course of farming operation is exempt; P.A. 93-301 added Subdiv. (r) re any interest of exemptioner in any property not to exceed $1,000, added Subdiv. (s) re interest in exemptioner not to exceed $4,000 in any accrued dividend or interest under, or loan value of any unmatured life insurance contract owned by exemptioner under which insured is exemptioner or individual of whom exemptioner is dependent and added Subdiv.

(10) to replace provision re one motor vehicle to value of $3,500 with provision re two motor vehicles to value of $7,000 in aggregate, added Subdiv. (20) re cash surrender value of life insurance policy, redesignated existing Subsec. (t) as Subdiv.

Because the legislature did not direct otherwise, the homestead exemption contained in Subdiv. (21), as expanded by P.A. 21-161, S. 1, does not have retrospective effect, rather, the expanded exemption applies in all bankruptcy and postjudgment proceedings initiated on or after October 1, 2021, regardless of when the underlying debts accrued. 347 C. 284.\n\nCited. 22 CA 260; 33 CA 365. Trial court improperly created an exemption not provided by statute. 49 CA 503.\n\nSubdiv. (21) (former Subsec. (t)):\n\nMortgage securing pre-existing judgment debt was consensual lien not subject to homestead exemption and waiver of exemption was not against public policy because exemption was waived voluntarily, knowingly and with aid of counsel. 332 C. 306.\n\nTrial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to act on homestead exemption claim to protect proceeds from voluntary sale from a judgment lien creditor. 130 CA 115. Once a foreclosure sale is confirmed and reduced to proceeds, homestead exemption rights attach to the proceeds of the sale. 156 CA 778. A mortgage is a consensual lien under Subdiv. and therefore a mortgage is exempt from the homestead exemption set forth in said Subdiv. 175 CA 770; judgment affirmed in part, see 332 C. 306. Statute expanding homestead exemption applies retroactively in cases where foreclosure action was filed before statute enactment but court's decision was rendered after enactment. 224 CA 571.\n\nIf prejudgment remedies are possible only to extent of equity in family home, the homestead exemption attachment as means of debt collection would be of limited use. 47 CS 590.",

However, in the case of a debtor who is not located in this state, the judgment lien shall be effective only as to the debtor's tangible personal property that is located in this state.\n\n(b) The judgment lien certificate shall: (1) Be signed by the judgment creditor or his attorney or personal representative; (2) state the names and last-known addresses of the judgment creditor and judgment debtor, the court in which and the date on which the judgment was rendered, and the original amount of the money judgment and the amount due thereon; and (3) describe the personal property on which the lien is to be placed.\n\n(c) Any such judgment lien shall be effective, in the same manner and to the same extent as a similar security interest under the provisions of title 42a, for five years from the date of filing, provided the filing shall not give the judgment creditor any right to take possession of the personal property on which the lien has been placed other than by writ of execution or other judicial process.

      "text": "(a)Procedure. Levying officer's responsibilities.(1) On application of a judgment creditor or a judgment creditor's attorney, stating that a judgment remains unsatisfied and the amount due thereon, and subject to the expiration of any stay of enforcement and expiration of any right of appeal, the clerk of the court in which the money judgment was rendered shall issue an execution pursuant to this section against the nonexempt personal property of the judgment debtor other than debts due from a banking institution or earnings. The application shall be accompanied by a fee of one hundred five dollars payable to the clerk of the court for the administrative costs of complying with the provisions of this section which fee may be recoverable by the judgment creditor as a taxable cost of the action. In the case of a consumer judgment, the application shall indicate whether, pursuant to an installment payment order under subsection (b) of section 52-356d, the court has entered a stay of execution and, if such a stay was entered, shall contain a statement of the judgment creditor or the judgment creditor's attorney as to the debtor's default on payments. In the case of a judgment arising out of services provided at a hospital, no application shall be made until the court has (A) issued an order for installment payments in accordance with section 52-356d, (B) made a finding that the debtor has defaulted on payments under the order, and (C) lifted the mandatory stay issued under section 52-356d. The court shall make a determination concerning noncompliance or default, and decide whether to modify the installment payment plan, continue the installment payment plan, or lift the stay. The execution shall be directed to any levying officer.\n\n(2) The property execution shall require a proper levying officer to enforce the money judgment and shall state the names and last-known addresses of the judgment creditor and judgment debtor, the court in which and the date on which the money judgment was rendered, the original amount of the money judgment and the amount due thereon, and any information which the judgment creditor considers necessary or appropriate to identify the judgment debtor. The property execution shall notify any person served therewith that the judgment debtor's nonexempt personal property is subject to levy, seizure and sale by the levying officer pursuant to the execution and, if the judgment debtor is a natural person, shall be accompanied by a notice of judgment debtor rights as prescribed by section 52-361b and a notice to any third person of the manner, as prescribed by subdivision (4) of this subsection, for complying with the execution.\n\n(3) A property execution shall be returned to court within four months after issuance. The untimely return of a property execution more than four months after issuance shall not of itself invalidate any otherwise valid levy made during the four-month period.\n\n(4) The levying officer shall personally serve a copy of the execution on the judgment debtor and make demand for payment by the judgment debtor of all sums due under the money judgment. On failure of the judgment debtor to make immediate payment, the levying officer shall levy on nonexempt personal property of the judgment debtor, other than debts due from a banking institution or earnings, sufficient to satisfy the judgment, as follows:\n\n(A) If such nonexempt personal property is in the possession of the judgment debtor, the levying officer shall take such property into his possession as is accessible without breach of the peace;\n\n(B) With respect to a judgment debtor who is not a natural person, if such personal property, including any debt owed, is in the possession of a third person, the levying officer shall serve that person with a copy of the execution and that person shall forthwith deliver the property or pay the amount of the debt due or payable to the levying officer, provided, if the debt is not yet payable, payment shall be made when the debt matures if within four months after issuance of the execution;\n\n(C) With respect to a judgment debtor who is a natural person, if such personal property, including any debt owed, is in the possession of a third person, the levying officer shall serve that person with two copies of the execution, required notices and claim forms. On receipt of such papers, the third person shall forthwith mail a copy thereof postage prepaid to the judgment debtor at the last-known address of record with the third person and shall withhold delivery of the property or payment of the debt due to the levying officer or any other person for twenty days. On expiration of the twenty days, the third person shall forthwith deliver the property or pay the debt to the levying officer provided (i) if an exemption claim has been filed in accordance with subsection (d) of section 52-361b, the property shall continue to be withheld subject to determination of the claim, and (ii) if a debt is not yet payable, payment shall be made when the debt matures if within four months after issuance of the execution.\n\n(5) Levy under this section on property held by, or a debt due from, a third person shall bar an action for such property against the third person provided the third person acted in compliance with the execution.\n\n(6) If the levying officer cannot remove any property on which he seeks to levy without the danger of injury thereto, he may levy on and take possession of the property by posting on or adjacent to the property a conspicuous notice of the levy.\n\n(7) Subject to the provisions of section 52-328, if the property to be executed against is already subject to an attachment, garnishment or judgment lien of the judgment creditor as security for that judgment, the priority of the execution shall hold from the date of perfecting of the attachment, garnishment or other lien. A sale pursuant to the execution forecloses any interest acquired as a result of the attachment, garnishment or judgment lien.\n\n(8) If the judgment debtor has left the state prior to service of the execution or if he cannot otherwise be found with reasonable effort at his last-known address in this state, the levying officer shall proceed with the levy after (A) making demand for payment at such last-known address and on any agent or attorney of the judgment debtor of record with the clerk of the Superior Court, and (B) making a reasonable effort to ascertain and provide notice of the execution at any forwarding address.\n\n(b)Sale.(1) The judgment debtor's interest in personal property levied on pursuant to an execution, other than any money so obtained, shall be sold by the levying officer, or by an indifferent person deputed to act on his behalf, or by such other levying officer as the court in which the money judgment was rendered directs, in accordance with subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection. The sale shall be held at such time and place and in such manner as is commercially reasonable. The sale shall be subject to, and shall not affect, any secured interests, including any such liens, that are senior in right to the execution. No sale may be made to any levying officer, or to his agent or associate. The property shall be present and within view of those attending the sale unless otherwise ordered by the court.\n\n(2) Notice of the time and place of sale and of the name and address of the levying officer shall be (A) sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the judgment debtor and to each holder of a lien or other secured interest in the property at their last-known addresses and (B) posted in the office of the town clerk in the town where the property is to be sold. On application of the judgment debtor or any other party in interest, the court may order further notice to be given, by publication or otherwise.\n\n(3) Notice shall be given at least twenty days prior to the date of sale unless the property is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value. If the property is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value, the court, on application of any party or of the levying officer, may, ex parte, order shorter notice.\n\n(c)Advertisement of sale.In addition to the notice of sale required by this section, the judgment creditor or levying officer may advertise in the legal or classified advertising section of any publication and recover any reasonable costs therefor. The judgment debtor may advertise the sale at his own expense.\n\n(d)Distribution of sale proceeds.All amounts received from the sale, and all other money received, shall be distributed subject to the supervision of the court according to the following priorities: (1) To all reasonable and necessary costs of sale; (2) to other legal costs of levy including the levying officer's fees of fifteen per cent of the amount realized; (3) to payment of the judgment creditor pursuant to the judgment under which the sale was held or the money received; (4) to payment of any subordinate secured parties or lienors who make a written demand to the levying officer prior to the sale, according to their respective interests, and to any other judgment creditors presenting an execution to the levying officer, in the order of presentation; and (5) to payment to the judgment debtor.\n\n(e)Statement of officer's fees.Prior to return of a satisfied or partially satisfied execution, a levying officer shall sign and give the judgment debtor, on demand and without fee, an itemized statement of his fees. On his failure to comply with this provision, the levying officer shall forfeit to the judgment debtor three times the amount of his fees.\n\n(f)Record of satisfaction.On return of an execution, the clerk of the court shall note on the record of the judgment whether, or to what extent, the judgment was satisfied.\n\n(g)Completion of levy.Any levy commenced prior to the expiration of the levying officer's term of office may be completed notwithstanding the expiration of that term.\n\n(P.A. 83-581, S. 9, 40; P.A. 84-527, S. 15; P.A. 85-613, S. 131, 154; May Sp.

      "text": "(a) Application. If a judgment debtor fails to comply with an installment payment order, the judgment creditor may apply to the court for a wage execution. The application shall contain the judgment creditor's or the judgment creditor's attorney's statement setting forth the particulars of the installment payment order and of the judgment debtor's failure to comply. The application shall be accompanied by a fee of one hundred five dollars payable to the clerk of the court for the administrative costs of complying with the provisions of this section which fee may be recoverable by the judgment creditor as a taxable cost of the action.\n\n(b) Issuance. On receipt of the application, a clerk of the Superior Court shall issue a wage execution against the judgment debtor, directed to a levying officer, to enforce payment of the judgment.\n\n(c) Contents. The wage execution shall state (1) the names and last-known addresses of the judgment creditor and judgment debtor, (2) the court in which and the date on which the money judgment was rendered, (3) the original amount of the money judgment and the amount due thereon, (4) any limitation on the execution ordered by the court pursuant to a motion for modification thereof, (5) the portion of the judgment debtor's earnings which are subject to levy thereunder, or the information necessary to determine such portion, and (6) any information which the judgment creditor provides to identify the judgment debtor's employer. The wage execution shall notify any employer of the manner prescribed by this section for complying with the execution and shall be accompanied by a notice of judgment debtor rights and a claim form as prescribed by section 52-361b.\n\n(d) Levy. The levying officer shall levy on all earnings which are due or become due to the judgment debtor to the extent specified in the wage execution plus the levying officer's fee and any actual postage costs incurred in accordance with this section, until the judgment is satisfied, or the execution is modified or set aside, by serving the employer with the wage execution, the required notice of rights and the claim forms. On receipt thereof, the employer shall forthwith deliver a copy thereof to the judgment debtor, or mail such copy postage prepaid to the judgment debtor at his last-known address. On service of the wage execution on the employer, the wage execution shall automatically be stayed for a period of twenty days and shall thereafter immediately become a lien and continuing levy on such portion of the judgment debtor's earnings as is specified in the wage execution, provided if a claim is filed in accordance with subsection (d) of section 52-361b within twenty days of such service on the employer, the stay shall continue until determination of the claim. If the levying officer has served the employer of the judgment debtor in accordance with this section, and the debt is later satisfied in whole or in part by payment directly to the creditor or creditor's agent instead of the levying officer, the creditor or the creditor's agent is responsible for payment of the levying officer's fee or portion thereof, and any actual postage costs incurred in accordance with this section. Any service of process or other notice required under this section may be made in accordance with section 52-57 or by certified mail, return receipt requested, provided a levying officer may make such service by mail to (1) an address within such officer's precinct or extension of precinct in accordance with section 52-56, or (2) in a case involving an employer whose payroll address is outside the state, to the out-of-state payroll address designated by the employer. When service is made by the serving officer by certified mail, return receipt requested, pursuant to this subsection, the officer may under the levy first collect the actual postage costs incurred.\n\n(e) Service and return. A wage execution shall be served within one year from its issuance and returned within thirty days from the satisfaction of the judgment.\n\n(f) Amount subject to levy. The maximum part of the aggregate weekly earnings of an individual which may be subject under this section to levy or other withholding for payment of a judgment is the lesser of (1) twenty-five per cent of his disposable earnings for that week, or (2) the amount by which his disposable earnings for that week exceed forty times the higher of (A) the minimum hourly wage prescribed by Section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, USC Title 29, Section 206(a)(1), or (B) the full minimum fair wage established by subsection (i) of section 31-58, in effect at the time the earnings are payable. Unless the court provides otherwise pursuant to a motion for modification, the execution and levy shall be for the maximum earnings subject to levy and shall not be limited by the amount of the installment payment order. Only one execution under this section shall be satisfied at one time. Priority of executions under this section shall be determined by the order of their presentation to the employer.\n\n(g) Employer responsibilities. Any employer served with a wage execution, including the state and any municipality, shall, upon expiration of the automatic stay of execution and subject to any further stay pursuant to a claim, pay over to the levying officer such portion of the judgment debtor's nonexempt earnings as the execution prescribes until the judgment is satisfied or the execution modified or set aside. The payments to the levying officer in compliance with the execution shall bar any action against the employer for such payments. If the employer fails or refuses to pay the earnings levied against to the levying officer, the employer may be subjected to a turnover order pursuant to section 52-356b and, on a finding of contempt, may be held liable to the judgment creditor for any amounts which he has so failed or refused to pay over. Any amount so recovered by the judgment creditor shall be applied toward payment of the judgment.\n\n(h) Modification. Either party may apply at any time to the court which issued the wage execution for a modification of the execution. After notice and hearing or pursuant to a stipulation, the court may make such modification of the execution as is reasonable.\n\n(i) Assignment of earnings. Any assignment by an employee of his earnings shall be void except (1) payments due for support in public welfare cases and payments pursuant to a family support judgment, and (2) deductions for union dues and initiation fees in accordance with the terms of a duly executed contract between an employer and his employees or a collective bargaining agent or in accordance with a duly executed authorization signed by the employee for the payment of such dues or initiation fees or both to such collective bargaining agent.\n\n(j) Unlawful discipline, suspension or discharge. Notwithstanding any other provision of the general statutes to the contrary, no employer may discipline, suspend or discharge an employee because of any wage execution against the employee unless the employer is served with more than seven wage executions against the employee in a calendar year. An employer who violates this subsection shall be liable to the employee for all earnings and all employment benefits lost by the employee from the time of the unlawful discipline, suspension or discharge to the time of reinstatement.\n\n(k) Status of defendant. Notwithstanding any provision of law, the remedy provided by this section shall be available to any judgment creditor and the status of the defendant as an elected or appointed official of any branch of the government of this state may not be interposed as a defense.\n\n(P.A. 83-581, S. 13, 40; P.A. 84-527, S. 9; P.A. 87-196, S. 2; May Sp.

Before the court or family support magistrate enters an order for withholding which is effective immediately against an obligor who is before the court or a family support magistrate, it shall inform the obligor of the minimum amount of income which is exempt from withholding under state and federal law, of such obligor's right to claim any applicable state or federal exemptions with respect thereto and of such obligor's right to offer any evidence as to why a withholding order effective immediately should not enter. If the court or family support magistrate enters an order for withholding to be effective immediately against a nonappearing obligor, notice shall be served subsequently upon the obligor in accordance with section 52-57 or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the obligor's last-known address, informing such obligor: (A) That a support order has been entered to be enforced by an income withholding order, (B) that an income withholding order has been entered effective immediately as part of the support order, (C) of the minimum amount of income exempt from withholding under state and federal law and of such obligor's right at the hearing on the support order to claim any other applicable state or federal exemptions with respect thereto, (D) of such obligor's right to a hearing, upon motion to the court, to offer any evidence as to why the withholding order effective immediately should not continue in effect, (E) of the amount of income received by such obligor which formed the basis for the support order against such obligor, and (F) of such obligor's right to move to modify the support order if such obligor's income has changed substantially or if the support order substantially deviates from the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a.\n\n(c) (1) If an obligor is delinquent on support payments on any prior order of support in an amount greater than or equal to thirty days' obligation, whether or not such order is subject to a contingent income withholding, such obligor shall become subject to withholding and the dependent shall cause a delinquency notice to be served on such obligor. The delinquency notice shall include a claim form and be in clear and simple language informing the obligor that (A) such obligor is delinquent under the support order in a specified amount and any additional amounts accruing until the effective date of the withholding order, (B) a withholding order has become effective against such obligor's income, (C) such obligor has fifteen days to request a hearing before the court or family support magistrate, and at such hearing such obligor may contest the claimed delinquency and the imposition of the income withholding, seek modification of the withholding order, and claim any lawful exemption with respect to such obligor's income, (D) such obligor has a right to seek modification of the support order by a proper motion filed with the court or family support magistrate, (E) eighty-five per cent of the first one hundred forty-five dollars of disposable income per week are exempt, and (F) the amount of the withholding order may not exceed the maximum percentage of disposable income which may be withheld pursuant to Section 1673 of Title 15 of the United States Code, together with a statement of such obligor's right to claim any other applicable state or federal exemptions with respect thereto. The claim form shall contain a checklist identifying the most common defenses and exemptions such that the obligor may check any which apply to the obligor and a space where the obligor may briefly explain the claim or request a modification of or raise a defense to the support order.\n\n(2) An obligor shall become subject to withholding to enforce a prior order of support upon the request of the dependent regardless of any delinquency, and whether or not such order is subject to a contingent income withholding. In such cases, the dependent shall cause a notice to be served on such obligor which notice shall comply in all respects with the delinquency notice required under subdivision (1) of this subsection except that such notice shall not be required to allege a delinquency.\n\n(d) An obligor may claim a defense based upon mistake of fact, may claim an exemption in accordance with subsection (e) of this section with respect to the withholding order, or may file by motion a modification or defense to the support order being enforced by the withholding, by delivering a signed claim form, or other written notice or motion, with the address of the obligor thereon, indicating the nature of the claim or grounds of the motion, to the clerk of the Superior Court or the assistant clerk of the Family Support Magistrate Division within fifteen days of receipt of notice. On receipt of the claim or motion, the clerk shall promptly enter the appearance of the obligor, schedule the matter for a hearing, send a file-stamped copy of the claim or motion to the person or agency of the state to whom the support order is payable and notify all parties of the hearing date set. The court or family support magistrate shall promptly hear and determine the claim or motion and notify the obligor within forty-five days from the date of the notice required under subsection (c) of this section of its determination. Unless the obligor successfully shows cause why the withholding order should not continue in effect, the court or family support magistrate shall order that the outstanding withholding order continue in effect against the nonexempt income of the obligor to the extent provided under subsection (e) of this section. The order shall be a final judgment for purposes of appeal. The effect of the withholding order shall not be stayed on appeal except by order of the court or a family support magistrate.\n\n(e) A withholding order shall issue in the amount necessary to enforce a support order against only such nonexempt income of the obligor as exceeds the greater of (1) eighty-five per cent of the first one hundred forty-five dollars per week of disposable income, or (2) the amount exempt under Section 1673 of Title 15 of the United States Code, or against any lesser amount which the court or family support magistrate deems equitable. Subject to subsection (d) of section 46b-88, the withholding order shall secure payment of past and future amounts due under the support order and an additional amount computed in accordance with the child support guidelines established in accordance with section 46b-215a, to be applied toward liquidation of any arrearage accrued under such order, unless contested by the obligor after a notice has been served pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, in which case the court or family support magistrate may determine the amount to be applied toward the liquidation of the arrearage found to have accrued under prior order of the court or family support magistrate. In no event shall such additional amount be applied if there is an existing arrearage order from the court or family support magistrate in a IV-D support case, as defined in subdivision (13) of subsection (b) of section 46b-231. Any investigator or other authorized employee of the Office of Child Support Services within the Department of Social Services, or any officer of Support Enforcement Services of the Superior Court, may issue a withholding order entered by the Superior Court or a family support magistrate pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, and shall issue a withholding order pursuant to this subsection when the obligor becomes subject to withholding under subsection (c) of this section. On service of the order of withholding on an existing or any future employer or other payer of income, and until the support order is fully satisfied or modified, the order of withholding is a continuing lien and levy on the obligor's income as it becomes due.\n\n(f) Commencing no later than the first pay period in the case of an employer, or the date of periodic payment in the case of a payer of income other than an employer, that occurs after fourteen days following the date of service of an order for withholding and within seven business days of the date the obligor is paid thereafter, an employer or other payer of income shall pay sums withheld pursuant to the withholding order to the state disbursement unit, as required by subsection (p) of this section. The employer or other payer of income (1) shall specify the dates on which each withholding occurred and the amount withheld for each obligor on each such date, and (2) may combine all withheld amounts into a single payment to the state disbursement unit with the portion thereof which is attributable to each individual obligor being separately designated. If an employer or other payer of income fails to withhold from income due an obligor pursuant to an order for withholding or fails to make those payments, such employer or other payer of income is liable to such person for the full amount of income not withheld since receipt of proper notice in an action therefor, and the amount secured in the action shall be applied by such person toward the arrearage owed by the obligor. Such employer or other payer of income shall be subject to a finding of contempt by the court or family support magistrate for failure to honor such order for withholding, provided service of the order is made in accordance with section 52-57 or by certified mail, return receipt requested.\n\n(g) All orders for withholding issued pursuant to this section shall take precedence over any execution issued pursuant to section 52-361 of the general statutes revised to 1983, or section 52-361a. Two or more orders for withholding may be levied concurrently under this section, but if the total levy in any week exceeds the maximum permitted under this section, all sums due shall be allocated by the state disbursement unit in proportion to the amount of such orders, giving priority in such allocation to current support.\n\n(h) Service of any process under this section, including any notice, may be made in accordance with section 52-57, or by certified mail, return receipt requested. If service is made on behalf of the state, it may be made by an authorized employee of Support Enforcement Services, by an investigator or other officer of the Office of Child Support Services within the Department of Social Services, by an investigator of the Department of Administrative Services or by the Attorney General. Service of income withholding orders by Support Enforcement Services or by an investigator or other officer of said office upon an employer under this section may be made in accordance with section 52-57, by certified mail, return receipt requested, by first class mail or electronically, provided the employer agrees to accept service made electronically.\n\n(i) An applicant for employment or an employee subject to an order for withholding issued pursuant to this section shall have the same protection from discipline, suspension or discharge by an employer as provided in section 52-361a.\n\n(j) There shall be a fine of not more than one thousand dollars imposed on any employer who discharges from employment, refuses to employ, takes disciplinary action against or discriminates against an employee subject to an order for withholding issued pursuant to this section because of the existence of such order for withholding and the obligations or additional obligations which it imposes upon the employer.\n\n(k) The employer shall notify promptly the dependent or Support Enforcement Services as directed when the obligor terminates employment, makes a claim for workers' compensation benefits or makes a claim for unemployment compensation benefits and shall provide the obligor's last-known address and the name and address of the obligor's new employer, if known. When the obligor makes a claim for workers' compensation benefits, the employer shall include a copy of any order for withholding received by the employer for the obligor with the employer's first report of occupational illness or injury to the employer's workers' compensation benefits carrier, and such benefits carrier shall withhold funds pursuant to the withholding order and pay any sums withheld as required by subsection (f) of this section.\n\n(l) When an obligor who is subject to withholding under this section is identified as a newly hired employee pursuant to subsection (d) of section 31-2c, the state agency enforcing the obligor's child support order shall, within two business days after the date information regarding such employee is entered into the state directory of new hires, issue a withholding order to the employer of the employee in accordance with subsection (e) of this section.\n\n(m) The provisions of this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedy available at law to enforce or punish for failure to obey a support order.\n\n(n) When a support order is issued in another state and the obligor has income subject to withholding derived in this state, such income shall be subject to withholding in accordance with the provisions of this section, upon registration of the support order in accordance with subdivision (1) of this subsection or as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n(1) An income withholding order issued in another state and registered in this state shall be subject to the procedures for registration, choice of law, notice to the nonregistering party, contest and confirmation of such order in sections 46b-370 to 46b-380, inclusive.\n\n(2) An income withholding order issued in another state and received directly by an employer in this state shall be subject to the procedures in sections 46b-358 to 46b-364, inclusive. Such employer shall, in addition to following the procedures in said sections, immediately provide to the obligor a copy of the notice and claim form provided by the Department of Social Services pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this subdivision.\n\n(A) The Department of Social Services shall make available to all employers in this state a standard notice and claim form, written in clear and simple language, which shall include (i) notice that money will be withheld from the employee's wages for child support and health insurance; (ii) notice of the amount of disposable earnings that are exempt from the income withholding order; (iii) notice that the amount of the income withholding order may not exceed the maximum permitted by federal law under 15 USC 1673, together with a statement of the obligor's right to claim any other applicable state or federal exemptions; (iv) notice of the right to object to the validity or enforcement of such income withholding order in a court in this state and of the right to seek modification of the underlying support order in the court of continuing exclusive jurisdiction; (v) notice of the right to seek the assistance of the Office of Child Support Services of the Department of Social Services and the toll-free telephone number at which the office can be contacted; and (vi) a claim form which shall include (I) a list of the most common defenses and exemptions to such income withholding order in a manner which allows the obligor to check any of the defenses and exemptions which apply; (II) a space where the obligor may briefly explain the obligor's claim or defense; (III) a space where the obligor may initiate a request for services to modify the support order, and the address of the Office of Child Support Services of the Department of Social Services to which such request may be sent; (IV) a space for the obligor to provide the obligor's address and the name of the town in which the obligor principally conducts the obligor's work for the employer; (V) a space for the obligor to sign the obligor's name; (VI) the address of Support Enforcement Services to which the claim form is to be sent in order to contest the validity or enforcement of the income withholding order; and (VII) space for the employer to state the date upon which the form was actually delivered to the obligor.\n\n(B) An obligor may contest the validity or enforcement of an income withholding order issued in another state and received directly by an employer in this state by following the procedures in section 46b-363 or by mailing to Support Enforcement Services the claim form delivered to the obligor pursuant to this subdivision. Such form shall be signed by the obligor and contain the obligor's address. A copy of the income withholding order shall be included.\n\n(C) Upon receipt of a claim form contesting the validity or enforcement of an income withholding order, Support Enforcement Services shall: (i) Give notice of the contest to (I) the support enforcement agency providing services to the obligee; (II) each employer that has directly received an income withholding order relating to the obligor; (III) the person designated to receive payments in the income withholding order; and (IV) if the obligee's address is known, the obligee; (ii) file the claim form and a copy of the income withholding order on behalf of the obligor with the Family Support Magistrate Division; and (iii) notify the person or agency that sent the income withholding order to file not less than ten days before the scheduled hearing (I) two copies, including one certified copy of the underlying support order, including any modification of such order; and (II) a sworn statement showing the amount of any arrearage together with the last court determination of an arrearage and an accounting of the arrearage since such determination.\n\n(D) Upon receipt of a claim form filed by Support Enforcement Services on behalf of the obligor in accordance with subparagraph (C) of this subdivision, the clerk shall promptly enter the appearance of the obligor, schedule a hearing, and give notice of the hearing to the obligor, Support Enforcement Services, the party initiating the income withholding order, and, if the obligee's address is known, the obligee. The family support magistrate shall promptly hear and determine the claim and enter the family support magistrate's determination within forty-five days from the date of the filing of the claim form. The family support magistrate shall utilize the procedures set forth in sections 46b-342 to 46b-344, inclusive, to obtain additional evidence and information as needed for a prompt determination on the claim. If the person or agency that sent the income withholding order fails to file the documents described in subparagraph (C) (iii) of this subdivision or fails to comply with a reasonable request for information or documents made under section 46b-343 or 46b-344, the family support magistrate may (i) continue the hearing for a period of not more than an additional forty-five days and direct Support Enforcement Services to provide such notice as may be appropriate; (ii) order a temporary or partial stay of income withholding for a period not to exceed forty-five days; or (iii) sustain the obligor's objection to the validity or enforcement of the income withholding order and enjoin the employer from complying with such order. In addition to any notice given by the clerk, upon entry of the decision of the family support magistrate on the claim, Support Enforcement Services shall give notice of the decision to each employer that has directly received an income withholding order related to the obligor, the party initiating the income withholding order, the obligor and, if the obligee's address is known, the obligee.\n\n(E) If the claim form requests services to modify the support order, the Office of Child Support Services shall assist the obligor to file a motion for modification with the appropriate tribunal of the state of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction in accordance with the law of that jurisdiction. The receipt of the request for modification shall constitute a request for Title IV-D services, but the office may require the making of a formal application. Such assistance shall include, but is not limited to, providing the obligor with information about how such a motion is filed, contacting the state of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction on behalf of the obligor to obtain appropriate forms, and transmitting such forms and applicable information to the appropriate tribunal in such state.\n\n(F) Venue for contested claims under this section shall be the Family Support Magistrate Division of the Superior Court in the judicial district in which the obligor resides, provided (i) if the obligor does not reside in this state, venue shall be in the judicial district of the employer who is subject to the income withholding order, and (ii) if there is an existing action concerning support of the child or children who are the subject of the income withholding order, the claim shall be filed in that action.\n\n(o) An employer who withholds the income of an obligor pursuant to a withholding order issued under subsection (e), (l) or (n) of this section that is regular on its face shall not be subject to civil liability to any individual or agency for conduct in compliance with such order.\n\n(p) All withholding orders issued under this section shall be payable to the state disbursement unit established and maintained by the Commissioner of Social Services in accordance with subsection (j) of section 17b-179. The state disbursement unit shall ensure distribution of all money collected under this section to the dependent, the state and the support enforcement agencies of other states, as their interests may appear, within two business days. Each dependent who is not receiving child support enforcement services, as defined in subsection (b) of section 46b-231, shall be notified upon the issuance of a withholding order pursuant to this section, that such services are offered free of charge by the State of Connecticut upon application to the Office of Child Support Services within the Department of Social Services.\n\n(q) The judges of the Superior Court may adopt any rules they deem necessary to implement the provisions of this section and sections 46b-69a, 46b-575 and 52-361a and such judges, or their designee, shall prescribe any forms required to implement such provisions.\n\n(1955, S. 3204d; 1959, P.A. 655; 1963, P.A. 33; 1969, P.A. 447, S. 3; P.A. 73-373, S. 38; P.A. 76-66; 76-436, S. 142, 681; P.A. 77-389; 77-594, S. 6, 7; 77-614, S. 70, 610; P.A. 78-217, S. 1; P.A. 80-149, S. 2, 3; P.A. 81-266, S. 1, 2; P.A. 82-433, S. 2; P.A. 83-295, S. 17; 83-400, S. 1; 83-581, S. 34, 40; P.A. 84-455, S. 4, 5; 84-527, S. 17, 18; 84-546, S. 115, 116, 173; P.A. 85-548, S. 1; P.A. 86-359, S. 36, 44; P.A. 87-483, S. 1, 3; P.A. 89-302, S. 1, 7; P.A. 90-213, S. 38, 56; P.A. 91-391, S. 10; P.A. 92-253, S. 4; P.A. 93-262, S. 1, 87; P.A. 96-268, S. 9, 34; June 18 Sp.

The lien for past-due child support shall be secured by the IV-D agency pursuant to procedures contained in the general statutes applicable to the type of property to be secured. After securing the lien, the IV-D agency shall provide such person with notice of the lien and an opportunity for a hearing before a hearing officer of the Department of Social Services pursuant to section 17b-60 to contest the lien. The IV-D agency shall file a release of such lien if a hearing officer determines that the conditions for the existence of a lien are not satisfied. Any such lien on real property may, at any time during which the obligor owes the amount of past-due child support secured by such lien, be foreclosed in an action brought in a court of competent jurisdiction by the Commissioner of Social Services in a title IV-D case or by the person to whom the child support is due. A lien for past-due support arising in any other state shall be given full faith and credit by this state provided such other state has complied with its procedural rules relating to recording or serving of liens.\n\n(b) On October 1, 1991, and monthly thereafter, the Department of Social Services shall compile a list of all obligors who owe overdue support in the amount of one thousand dollars or more accruing after the entry of an initial court order establishing a child support obligation. Any overdue support in an amount of one thousand dollars or more shall be subject to the reporting provisions of this section. The state shall report to any participating consumer reporting agency, as defined in 15 USC 1681a(f), information regarding the amount of such overdue support owed by an obligor if the amount of such overdue support is one thousand dollars or more, on a computer tape in a format acceptable to the consumer reporting agency. Such information shall be reported by the department only after notice has been sent by the department to such obligor of the proposed action, and such obligor is given an opportunity for a hearing before a hearing officer of the department to contest the amount of the alleged arrearage. Any such notice sent to such obligor shall contain a telephone number and address of the Department of Social Services and shall contain the following language in bold type: “If you are no longer in arrears or have received this notice in error, please contact the department at the following address or telephone number.” On a monthly basis, the Department of Social Services shall provide to each consumer reporting agency informed of the original arrearage of an obligor updated information concerning any such obligor and the status of payments, including a list of obligors who no longer owe overdue support, in such acceptable computer format. The department shall designate one or more persons in the department to receive telephone or other requests from an obligor or a consumer reporting agency regarding verification of information supplied to a consumer reporting agency. The department shall respond to any such request within five working days of its receipt. Upon satisfactory verification that an obligor is no longer in arrears, the department shall send a statement to such obligor, and such statement shall constitute proof to a creditor that such obligor is no longer in arrears as of the date of the statement. A participating consumer reporting agency which receives such updated information from the department that an obligor no longer owes any overdue support shall record such information within thirty days of receipt of such notification unless the information was in a format which was unusable by the agency or contained an error which prevented the agency from matching the updated information to previously supplied data. Any consumer reporting agency which negligently or wilfully fails to use reasonable efforts to comply with any requirement imposed under this subsection with respect to an obligor shall be liable to such obligor in an amount equal to the sum of (1) any actual damages sustained by the obligor as a result of such failure, and (2) a reasonable attorney's fee as determined by the court.\n\n(c) When any person redeems a winning lottery ticket worth five thousand dollars or more at the central office of the Connecticut Lottery Corporation, the Connecticut Lottery Corporation shall check the name and other identifying information of such person against a list of obligors supplied by the Commissioner of Social Services. If such person is included on the list of obligors, the Connecticut Lottery Corporation shall request confirmation from the Commissioner of Social Services that such person is in fact an obligor, and upon notification by the Commissioner of Social Services that money is due from any such person as a result of a claim for support which has been assigned to the state pursuant to section 17b-77, or is to be paid to the state acting by and through the IV-D agency, the Connecticut Lottery Corporation shall withhold from any lottery winnings payable to such person under the provisions of chapter 226 or chapter 229a the amount of such claim for support owed to an individual for any portion of support which has not been assigned to the state and then the amount of such claim for support owed to the state, provided the Connecticut Lottery Corporation shall notify such person that (1) lottery winnings have been withheld as a result of the amount due for such support, and (2) such person has the right to a hearing before a hearing officer designated by the Commissioner of Social Services if such person contests the amount of the alleged claim for support. The Connecticut Lottery Corporation shall pay any such person in accordance with any decisions of the hearing officer or the court upon appeal of the hearing officer's decision.\n\n(d) Whenever an order of the Superior Court or a family support magistrate of this state, or an order of another state that has been registered in this state, for support of a minor child or children is issued and such payments have been ordered through the IV-D agency, and the obligor against whom such support order was issued owes overdue support under such order in the amount of five hundred dollars or more, the IV-D agency, as defined in subdivision (12) of subsection (b) of section 46b-231, or Support Enforcement Services of the Superior Court may notify (1) any state or local agency or officer with authority (A) to hold assets or property for such obligor including, but not limited to, any property unclaimed or presumed abandoned under part III of chapter 32, or (B) to distribute benefits to such obligor including, but not limited to, unemployment compensation and workers' compensation, (2) any person having or expecting to have custody or control of or authority to distribute any amounts due such obligor under any judgment or settlement, (3) any financial institution holding assets of such obligor, and (4) any public or private entity administering a public or private retirement fund in which such obligor has an interest that such obligor owes overdue support in a IV-D support case. Upon receipt of such notice, such agency, officer, person, institution or entity shall withhold delivery or distribution of any such property, benefits, amounts, assets or funds until receipt of further notice from the IV-D agency.\n\n(e) In IV-D cases in which a notice is sent pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, the IV-D agency shall notify the obligor that such property, benefits, amounts, assets or funds have been withheld as a result of overdue support in a IV-D support case in accordance with an order of the Superior Court or family support magistrate of this state, or an order of another state that has been registered in this state. The IV-D agency shall further notify the agency, officer, person, institution or entity to whom notice was sent pursuant to subsection (d) of this section as follows: (1) Upon expiration of the time for requesting a hearing specified in section 17b-60, to make payment to the state from any such property, benefits, amounts, assets or funds withheld in accordance with subsection (d) of this section provided, in the case of retirement funds, such payment shall only be made in accordance with a withholding order issued under section 52-362 when the obligor is entitled to receive retirement benefits from such fund; (2) upon payment of such overdue support by such obligor, to release or distribute, as appropriate, such property, benefits, amounts, assets or funds to such obligor; or (3) upon issuance of a decision by the hearing officer or the court upon appeal of such officer's decision, to take such other action as may be ordered by such officer or such court, and such agency, officer, person, institution or entity shall forthwith comply with such notice received from the IV-D agency.\n\n(f) Support collected pursuant to this section shall be distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.\n\n(g) The Commissioner of Social Services shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, setting forth procedures providing for adequate notice of (1) the right to a hearing before a hearing officer, and (2) procedures for a fair hearing for any person alleged by the commissioner to owe past-due or overdue child support to the state, or to an individual when the payments have been ordered payable to the state acting by and through the IV-D agency, if the commissioner has filed a lien on the property of such person or claimed an offset against money payable by the state to enforce a claim for payment of such past-due or overdue support, or intends to seize any benefits, amounts, assets or funds withheld in accordance with subsection (d) of this section or report such overdue support to a consumer credit agency.\n\n(P.A. 85-548, S. 7; P.A. 86-359, S. 38, 44; P.A. 88-257, S. 1, 2; P.A. 90-206; 90-213, S. 40, 56; P.A. 91-139; P.A. 93-262, S. 1, 87; 93-329, S. 1; June 18 Sp.

If execution is desired against any such debt, the plaintiff requesting the execution shall make application to the clerk of the court. The application shall be accompanied by a fee of one hundred five dollars payable to the clerk of the court for the administrative costs of complying with the provisions of this section which fee may be recoverable by the judgment creditor as a taxable cost of the action.

Such judgment or order shall be deemed to be a final judgment for the purposes of appeal. No appeal shall be taken except within seven days of the rendering of the judgment or order. The judgment or order of the court may be implemented during such seven-day period, unless stayed by the court.\n\n(j) If records or testimony are subpoenaed from a financial institution in connection with a hearing conducted pursuant to section 52-356c on a written claim for determination of interests in property made pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, the reasonable costs and expenses of the financial institution in complying with the subpoena shall be recoverable by the financial institution from the party requiring such records or testimony, provided the financial institution shall be under no obligation to attempt to obtain records or documentation relating to the account executed against that are held by any other financial institution.

      "text": "(a) Exempt debts. Execution may be granted pursuant to this section against any debts due from any financial institution to a judgment debtor who is an individual, except to the extent such debts are protected from execution by sections 52-352a, 52-352b, 52-352c of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to 1983, 52-354 of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to 1983, 52-361 of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to 1983 and section 52-361a, as well as by any other laws or regulations of this state or of the United States which exempt such debts from execution.\n\n(b) Issuance and service of execution. (1) If execution is desired against any such debt, the plaintiff requesting the execution shall make application to the clerk of the court. The application shall be accompanied by a fee of one hundred five dollars payable to the clerk of the court for the administrative costs of complying with the provisions of this section, which fee may be recoverable by the judgment creditor as a taxable cost of the action. In a IV-D case, the request for execution shall be accompanied by an affidavit signed by the serving officer attesting to an overdue support amount of five hundred dollars or more which accrued after the entry of an initial family support judgment. If the papers are in order, the clerk shall issue such execution containing a direction that the officer serving such execution shall, within seven days from the receipt by the serving officer of such execution, make demand (A) upon the main office of any financial institution having its main office within the county of the serving officer, (B) if such main office is not within the serving officer's county and such financial institution has one or more branch offices within such county, upon an employee of such a branch office, such employee and branch office having been designated by the financial institution in accordance with regulations adopted by the Banking Commissioner, in accordance with chapter 54, or (C) only upon demand of a financial institution which does not have any main office or branch office in this state, by certified mail, return receipt requested, for payment of any such nonexempt debt due to the judgment debtor and, after having made such demand, shall serve a true and attested copy of the execution, together with the affidavit and exemption claim form prescribed by subsection (k) of this section, with the serving officer's actions endorsed thereon, with the financial institution upon whom such demand is made. When service is made by the serving officer by certified mail pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this subdivision, the officer may collect the actual postage costs incurred, in addition to the serving officer's fee, from the amount removed from the judgment debtor's account, if any, pursuant to subsection (h) of this section. The serving officer shall not serve more than one financial institution execution per judgment debtor at a time, including copies thereof. After service of an execution on one financial institution, the serving officer shall not serve the same execution or a copy thereof upon another financial institution until receiving confirmation from the preceding financial institution that the judgment debtor had insufficient funds at the preceding financial institution available for collection to satisfy the execution, provided any such additional service is made not later than forty-five days from the receipt by the serving officer of such execution. The financial institution shall provide the serving officer a response to the service of such execution in accordance with subdivision (2) of this subsection. After service of an execution on a financial institution, the serving officer shall not subsequently serve the same execution or a copy thereof upon such financial institution if an electronic direct deposit that is readily identifiable as exempt from execution was made to the judgment debtor's account during the look-back period, as described in subsection (c) of this section. If no such deposit was made, the serving officer may subsequently serve the same execution or a copy thereof upon such institution, provided such execution has not expired or otherwise become unenforceable.\n\n(2) Not later than the seventh business day after the service of an execution upon a financial institution, the financial institution shall send to the serving officer by first class mail, postage prepaid, (A) if the financial institution has removed funds from the judgment debtor's account pursuant to the execution and this section, a notice stating the amount of funds removed from the judgment debtor's account and referencing the docket number, if provided by the judgment creditor on the execution form, or (B) if the judgment debtor is not indebted to the financial institution or if the financial institution has not removed funds from the judgment debtor's account pursuant to the execution and this section, a complete set of all the documents served on the financial institution by the serving officer, including the cover page of the serving officer, with endorsements from other financial institutions, as the case may be, the original true and attested copy of the execution served on the financial institution, and the affidavit and exemption claim form prescribed by subsection (k) of this section. The response of the financial institution pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this subdivision shall include a notation on the serving officer's cover page, or at the financial institution's option, on a separate document prepared by the financial institution, to the effect that the judgment debtor does not have an account with the financial institution or that no funds were removed from the account, provided that such separate document shall be affixed to, or enclosed contiguous to the financial institution's return of a particular execution to the serving officer pursuant to this subsection. The financial institution shall maintain reasonable procedures to prevent the resubmission of a response provided to the serving officer pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this subdivision. As used in this section, “business day” has the same meaning as provided in section 36a-330.\n\n(c) Removal of funds from judgment debtor's account. (1) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, if any such financial institution upon which such execution is served and upon which such demand is made is indebted to the judgment debtor, the financial institution shall remove from the judgment debtor's account the amount of such indebtedness not exceeding the amount due on such execution before its midnight deadline, as defined in section 42a-4-104.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the financial institution shall leave in the judgment debtor's account (A) the full amount of electronic direct deposits that are readily identifiable as exempt federal veterans' benefits, Social Security benefits, including, but not limited to, retirement, survivors' and disability benefits, supplemental security income benefits, exempt benefits paid by the federal Railroad Retirement Board or the federal Office of Personnel Management, unemployment compensation benefits exempt under section 52-352b, and child support payments processed and received pursuant to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, and (B) the amount of electronic direct deposits, not to exceed one thousand dollars, that are readily identifiable as wages, provided such deposits were made to the judgment debtor's account during the look-back period of two months preceding the date that the execution was served on the financial institution, or, with regard to federal benefits, such greater period as required by federal law. If no such deposits have been made to the judgment debtor's account during the look-back period, or if such readily identifiable funds are less than one thousand dollars, the financial institution shall leave in the judgment debtor's account as exempt pursuant to subdivision (18) of section 52-352b the lesser of the account balance or one thousand dollars in the aggregate. To the extent that such funds are left in the judgment debtor's account as exempt pursuant to subdivision (18) of section 52-352b, the provisions of said subsection shall not be the basis for a claim of exemption pursuant to this subsection in response to a levy of execution.\n\n(3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit a financial institution's right or obligation to remove such funds from the judgment debtor's account if required by any other provision of law or by a court order. The judgment debtor shall have full and customary access to such funds left in the judgment debtor's account pursuant to this subsection. The financial institution may notify the judgment creditor that funds have been left in the judgment debtor's account pursuant to this subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall alter the exempt status of funds which are exempt from execution under subsection (a) of this section or under any other provision of state or federal law, or the right of a judgment debtor to claim such exemption. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect any other rights or obligations of the financial institution with regard to the funds in the judgment debtor's account.\n\n(d)  Notice to judgment debtor and secured party. (1) If any funds are removed from the judgment debtor's account pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the execution and exemption claim form from the serving officer, the financial institution shall (A) forthwith mail copies thereof, postage prepaid, to the judgment debtor and to any secured party that is party to a control agreement between the financial institution and such secured party under article 9 of title 42a at the last-known address of the judgment debtor and of any such secured party with respect to the affected accounts on the records of the financial institution, and (B) mail notice to the judgment debtor as required by 31 CFR 212.6 and 212.7. The financial institution may note that funds have been removed from the judgment debtor's account on any records for such account, including electronic records, available to the judgment debtor, but shall not display, or otherwise provide to the judgment debtor, the name or contact information of the serving officer. The financial institution shall hold the amount removed from the judgment debtor's account pursuant to subsection (c) of this section for fifteen days from the date of the mailing to the judgment debtor and any such secured party, and during such period shall not pay the serving officer.\n\n(2) In the event the judgment debtor directs questions to the financial institution concerning the execution, the financial institution may instruct the judgment debtor to direct such questions regarding the execution to the judgment creditor or the judgment creditor's attorney at the telephone number provided on the execution. The financial institution may also direct the judgment debtor to direct such questions to the applicable clerk of the court identified on the execution form.\n\n(e) Claim of exemption and claim of prior perfected security interest. To prevent the financial institution from paying the serving officer, as provided in subsection (h) of this section, the judgment debtor shall give notice of a claim of exemption by delivering to the financial institution, by mail or other means, the exemption claim form or other written notice that an exemption is being claimed and any such secured party shall give notice of its claim of a prior perfected security interest in such deposit account by delivering to the financial institution, by mail or other means, written notice thereof. The financial institution may designate an address to which the notice of a claim of exemption, or a secured party claim notice, shall be delivered. Upon receipt of such notice, the financial institution shall, within two business days, send a copy of such notice to the clerk of the court which issued the execution, and send a copy of such notice, or a separate notice prepared by the financial institution indicating that the judgment debtor has submitted a claim of exemption, to the serving officer.\n\n(f) Hearing. (1) Upon receipt of an exemption claim form or a secured party claim notice, the clerk of the court shall enter the appearance of the judgment debtor or such secured party with the address set forth in the exemption claim form or secured party claim notice. The clerk shall forthwith send file-stamped copies of the exemption claim form or secured party claim notice to the judgment creditor and judgment debtor with a notice stating that the disputed funds are being held for forty-five days from the date the exemption claim form or secured party claim notice was received by the financial institution or until a court order is entered regarding the disposition of the funds, whichever occurs earlier, and the clerk shall promptly schedule the matter for a hearing. The claim of exemption filed by such judgment debtor shall be prima facie evidence at such hearing of the existence of the exemption.\n\n(2) Upon receipt of notice from the financial institution pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, a judgment creditor may, on an ex parte basis, present to a judge of the Superior Court an affidavit sworn under oath by a competent party demonstrating a reasonable belief that such judgment debtor's account contains funds which are not exempt from execution and the amount of such nonexempt funds. Such affidavit shall not be conclusory but is required to show the factual basis upon which the reasonable belief is based. If such judge finds that the judgment creditor has demonstrated a reasonable belief that such judgment debtor's account contains funds which are not exempt from execution, such judge shall authorize the judgment creditor to submit a written application to the clerk of the court for a hearing on the exempt status of funds left in the judgment debtor's account pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. The judgment creditor shall promptly send a copy of the application and the supporting affidavit to the judgment debtor and to any secured party shown on a secured party claim notice sent to the judgment creditor pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection. Upon receipt of such application, the clerk of the court shall promptly schedule the matter for a hearing and shall give written notice to the judgment creditor, the judgment debtor and any secured party shown on a secured party claim notice received by the clerk of the court. The notice to the judgment creditor pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall be prima facie evidence at such hearing that the funds in the account are exempt funds. The burden of proof shall be upon the judgment creditor to establish the amount of funds which are not exempt.\n\n(g) Disposition if exemption or prior perfected security interest is claimed. If an exemption claim is made or a secured party claim notice is given pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, the financial institution shall continue to hold the amount removed from the judgment debtor's account for forty-five days or until a court order is received regarding disposition of the funds, whichever occurs earlier. If no such order is received within forty-five days of the date the financial institution sends a copy of the exemption claim form or notice of exemption or a secured party claim notice to the clerk of the court, the financial institution shall return the funds to the judgment debtor's account.\n\n(h) Disposition if no exemption or prior perfected security interest is claimed. If no claim of exemption or secured party claim notice is received by the financial institution within fifteen days of the mailing to the judgment debtor and any secured party of the execution and exemption claim form pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, the financial institution shall, upon demand, forthwith pay the serving officer the amount removed from the judgment debtor's account, and the serving officer shall thereupon pay such sum, less such serving officer's fees and costs owing to such serving officer under this section, to the judgment creditor, except to the extent otherwise ordered by a court.\n\n(i) Court order. The court, after a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, shall enter an order determining the issues raised by the claim of exemption and claim by a secured party of a prior perfected security interest in such deposit account. The clerk of the court shall forthwith send a copy of such order to the financial institution. Such order shall be deemed to be a final judgment for the purposes of appeal. No appeal shall be taken except within seven days of the rendering of the order. The order of the court may be implemented during such seven-day period, unless stayed by the court.\n\n(j) Determination of exempt moneys. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section, if both exempt and nonexempt moneys have been deposited into an account, for the purposes of determining which moneys are exempt under this section, the moneys most recently deposited as of the time the execution is served shall be deemed to be the moneys remaining in the account.\n\n(k) Forms. The execution, exemption claim form and clerk's notice regarding the filing of a claim of exemption shall be in such form as prescribed by the judges of the Superior Court or their designee. The exemption claim form shall be dated and include a checklist and description of the most common exemptions, instructions on the manner of claiming the exemptions and a space for the judgment debtor to certify those exemptions claimed under penalty of false statement.\n\n(l) Records of financial institution. If records or testimony are subpoenaed from a financial institution in connection with a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, the reasonable costs and expenses of the financial institution in complying with the subpoena shall be recoverable by the financial institution from the party requiring such records or testimony, provided, the financial institution shall be under no obligation to attempt to obtain records or documentation relating to the account executed against which are held by any other financial institution. The records of a financial institution as to the dates and amounts of deposits into an account in the financial institution shall, if certified as true and accurate by an officer of the financial institution, be admissible as evidence without the presence of the officer in any hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (f) of this section to determine the legitimacy of a claim of exemption made under this section.\n\n(m) Fee for financial institution's costs. If there are moneys to be removed from the judgment debtor's account, prior to the removal of such moneys pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the financial institution shall receive from the serving officer as representative of the judgment creditor a fee of eight dollars for the financial institution's costs in complying with the provisions of this section which fee (1) shall be deducted by the financial institution from the amount that is paid to the serving officer pursuant to this section, and (2) may be recoverable by the judgment creditor as a taxable cost of the action. Such fee shall not be considered a deposit account charge pursuant to section 36a-316.\n\n(n) Liability of financial institution. If the financial institution fails or refuses to pay over to the serving officer the amount of such debt, not exceeding the amount due on such execution, such financial institution shall be liable in an action therefor to the judgment creditor named in such execution for the amount of nonexempt moneys which the financial institution failed or refused to pay over, excluding funds of up to one thousand dollars which the financial institution in good faith allowed the judgment debtor to access pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. The amount so recovered by such judgment creditor shall be applied toward the payment of the amount due on such execution. Thereupon, the rights of the financial institution shall be subrogated to the rights of the judgment creditor. If such financial institution pays exempt moneys from the account of the judgment debtor over to the serving officer contrary to the provisions of this section, such financial institution shall be liable in an action therefor to the judgment debtor for any exempt moneys so paid and such financial institution shall refund or waive any charges or fees by the financial institution, including, but not limited to, dishonored check fees, overdraft fees or minimum balance service charges and legal process fees, which were assessed as a result of such payment of exempt moneys. Thereupon, the rights of the financial institution shall be subrogated to the rights of the judgment debtor.\n\n(o) Good faith immunity.
