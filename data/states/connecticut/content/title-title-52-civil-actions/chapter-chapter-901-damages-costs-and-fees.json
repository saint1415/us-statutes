Factors that may indicate that a claim or civil action is substantially complex, unique or different from other wrongful death, personal injury or property damage claims or civil actions include, but are not limited to, if the claim or civil action (1) involves complex factual medical or legal issues, (2) involves serious permanent personal injury or death, (3) is likely to require extensive investigation and discovery proceedings, including multiple depositions, or (4) requires independent expert witness testimony. For the purposes of this subsection, “independent expert witness testimony” means testimony, whether at trial or in a deposition, from an expert who has not participated in the care of the claimant and has not participated in any official investigation of the incident involved.\n\n(d) Prior to a claimant entering into a contingency fee agreement that provides for a fee that exceeds the percentage limitations of subsection (b) of this section, the attorney shall (1) explain the percentage limitations of subsection (b) of this section to the claimant and the reasons the attorney is unable to abide by those limitations; (2) advise the claimant of the claimant's right to seek representation by another attorney willing to abide by the percentage limitations of subsection (b) of this section; and (3) allow the claimant a sufficient period of time to review the proposed contingency fee agreement and, if the claimant wishes, seek representation by another attorney prior to entering into such agreement.\n\n(e) No waiver of the percentage limitations of subsection (b) of this section shall be valid unless the contingency fee agreement (1) is in writing, (2) sets forth in full the fee schedule of subsection (b) of this section, (3) contains a conspicuous statement, printed in boldface type at least twelve points in size, in substantially the following form: “I UNDERSTAND THAT THE FEE SCHEDULE SET FORTH IN SECTION 52-251c OF THE CONNECTICUT GENERAL STATUTES LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF ATTORNEY'S FEES PAYABLE BY A CLAIMANT AND THAT THE STATUTE WAS INTENDED TO INCREASE THE PORTION OF THE JUDGMENT OR SETTLEMENT THAT WAS ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY A CLAIMANT.

(b) to replace “percentage of the award or settlement amount” with “percentage of the damages awarded and received by the claimant or of the settlement amount received by the claimant”, and added Subsec.

(g) prohibiting payment of a fee to an attorney who seeks a fee that exceeds such percentage limitations unless the claimant has waived such limitations and the agreement complies with Subsec. (e), redesignated existing Subsec. (c) as Subsec. (h) and amended said Subsec. to delete from definitions of “damages awarded and received” and “settlement amount received” provision that in a claim or civil action brought pursuant to Sec. 38a-368 such amount shall be reduced by any basic reparations benefits paid to the claimant pursuant to Sec. 38a-365 and deleted former Subsec.

Legal experts are not included within enumeration of the categories of experts entitled to discretionary award of expert witness fees. 78 CA 760. Sec. 31-51m allows for costs, but does not expressly provide for expert witness fees; therefore, general cost provisions of Sec. 52-257 and this section apply, which do not mention nontestimonial costs; accordingly, nontestimonial work performed by plaintiff's economics expert was not taxable as costs. 79 CA 501. Expert witness fees for roofing consulting firms are not enumerated under section and cannot be awarded as part of claim under Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. 113 CA 509. Court improperly awarded expert witness fees for construction experts in claim under Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. 121 CA 105.\n\nAgreement to pay witness more than legal fees will not ordinarily be enforced; exceptional cases considered. 26 CS 463. Statute, as amended, read in conjunction with Sec. 48-12, as amended, entitled property owner to reasonable appraisal fees in condemnation proceedings. 27 CS 288.\n\nSubsec. (f):\n\nFee charged by an expert for time spent in preparation for his or her deposition treated as a taxable cost. 286 C. 234. Trial court may not award costs for nontestimonial work performed by expert witness. 289 C. 61.\n\nNothing in legislative history indicates that legislature's use of term “costs” in either Sec. 31-51m or 31-51q was intended to authorize court to award prevailing party the cost of an economist; further, because an economist is not a listed expert witness whose cost may be reimbursed under general provisions of Subsec., plaintiff's expert economist's testimonial fees cannot be reimbursed. 79 CA 501. Invoices submitted by defendant for expert witness fees were not sufficient on their own to establish that the costs stated therein were “reasonable”. 113 CA 339.",

Each such officer or person shall also receive the fee set by the Department of Administrative Services for state employees for each mile of travel, to be computed from the place where such officer or person received the process to the place of service, and thence in the case of civil process to the place of return. If more than one process is served on one person at one time by any such officer or person, the total cost of travel for the service shall be the same as for the service of one process only, except, if an officer or person is requested by the court or required by law to effectuate in-hand personal service, or for service pursuant to subsection (h) of section 46b-15, such officer or person shall receive the fee set by the Department of Administrative Services for state employees for each mile of travel of each round trip traveled while attempting to effectuate in-hand personal service, to be computed from the place where the process was received to the place of attempted service, and if multiple trips to effectuate service are made, back to the place where process was received and then to the place of the subsequent attempt at service, and thence in the case of civil process to the place of return provided the officer or person shall state in the return of service that in-hand personal service was requested or required, or that in-hand service was made pursuant to subsection (h) of section 46b-15, and that multiple trips were necessary to effectuate in-hand personal service.

The officer or person requesting the receipt of such fees for attempted round trip travel may only receive such fees from the Judicial Department when ordered by the court or by law to effectuate in-hand personal service and only when such in-hand personal service is effectuated, when in-hand personal service of process is made pursuant to subsection (h) of section 46b-15, or subsection (d) of section 46b-16a. Such payment from the Judicial Department of attempted round trip travel for in-hand service of process may be limited to three round trips, provided nothing in this section shall limit payment of a greater amount from the Judicial Department to an officer or person serving process. For service made pursuant to subsection (h) of section 46b-15, and subsection (d) of section 46b-16a, which was not effectuated in-hand, regardless of any attempts to effectuate service in-hand, the mileage fee shall be from the place where the process was received to the place of service, and thence in the case of civil process to the place of return. Where the court allows an applicant additional time to make service under subsection (c) of section 46b-15, for purposes of calculating the mileage fee for multiple trips, such extra time will be considered a continuation of the original attempts at service. Each officer or person who serves process shall also receive the moneys actually paid for town clerk's fees on the service of process. Each officer or person who serves process shall also receive the moneys actually paid for fees for the disclosure or search of records of the Department of Motor Vehicles in connection with the service of process.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, for summoning grand jurors, such officer or person shall receive only such officer's or person's actual expenses and such reasonable sum for services as are taxed by the court.
