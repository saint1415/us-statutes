The individuals designated by such bank, out-of-state bank or high-ranking official shall testify about information known or reasonably available to such bank, out-of-state bank or high-ranking official.\n\n(iii) If the Attorney General believes in good faith that a high-ranking official of a bank or out-of-state bank that is served with a subpoena under this subsection has unique, direct knowledge about a violation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, P.L. 111-203, as amended from time to time, and that the information sought by such subpoena could not be obtained through other, less burdensome or intrusive means, such high-ranking official shall testify pursuant to such subpoena.\n\n(iv) In any such subpoena issued under this subsection to a bank or out-of-state bank, the Attorney General shall, in addition to satisfying any applicable requirements of subdivision (2) of this subsection, describe with reasonable particularity the matters for examination pursuant to such subpoena and advise the bank or out-of-state bank of such bank's or out-of-state bank's duty pursuant to this subparagraph to confer with the Attorney General and to designate individuals who shall testify.\n\n(v) The provisions of this subparagraph shall not preclude any other procedure allowed under this subsection.\n\n(2) Any subpoena for documentary material issued under this subsection shall (A) state the nature of the alleged violation, (B) describe the class or classes of documentary material to be produced thereunder with such definiteness and certainty as to be accurately defined, and (C) prescribe a date that would allow a reasonable time to respond. All testimony taken in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii) of subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be under oath and a written transcript shall be made of the same, a copy of which shall be furnished to the individual appearing, and shall not be available for public disclosure. All written interrogatories shall prescribe a return date that would allow a reasonable time to respond, which responses shall be under oath and not be available for public disclosure. No subpoena issued under this subsection shall require the submission of that portion of any documentary material, testimony or responses to interrogatories that would be privileged or precluded from disclosure if demanded in a grand jury investigation.\n\n(3) Service of subpoenas ad testificandum, subpoenas duces tecum, notices of deposition and written interrogatories, as provided in this subsection, may be made (A) by any proper officer by personal service or service at the usual place of abode, or (B) if service cannot with reasonable diligence be effected under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, by any proper officer or other person lawfully empowered to make service by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, a duly executed copy thereof addressed to the person to be served at such person's principal place of business in this state or at the place of such person's registered agent in this state, or, if such person has no principal place of business in this state or registered agent in this state, at such person's principal office or such person's usual place of abode.\n\n(4) All documentary material and responses to interrogatories furnished to, and all transcripts of testimony taken by, the Attorney General pursuant to a subpoena issued under this subsection or voluntarily, and all information obtained, collected or prepared in connection with an investigation conducted pursuant to this subsection, including the identity of the person furnishing such documentary material, responses or transcripts, shall be held in the custody of the Attorney General, and shall not be available to the public or be subject to inspection or disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.

No copy or original of the confidential material described or shown to a person providing oral testimony pursuant to this subsection shall be retained by such person.\n\n(6) The Attorney General may, without waiving any privilege, disclose any confidential material for any appropriate supervisory, governmental, law enforcement or other public purpose, including, but not limited to, a civil action brought pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, and may cooperate with officials of the federal government, the state and other states by, among other things, sharing and disclosing information and evidence obtained pursuant to a subpoena issued under this subsection.

In any proceeding before a court, the court may issue a protective order in appropriate circumstances to protect the confidentiality of any such confidential material and order that any such confidential material on file with the court or filed in connection with the court proceeding be sealed, and that the public be excluded from any portion of the proceeding at which any such confidential material is disclosed.\n\n(7) In the event any person refuses to comply with, or otherwise fails to comply with, a subpoena served in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, the Attorney General may apply to the superior court for the judicial district where such person resides or maintains an office or, if such person does not reside or maintain an office in the state, the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford for an order (A) compelling such person to comply with such subpoena, which court may, upon notice to such person, issue such order, which shall be served upon such person, and (B) requiring such person to pay to the state a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars, which court may, after notice to such person and a hearing thereon, issue such order.\n\n(8) (A) For any subpoena issued under this subsection, the person upon whom service of such subpoena was made may file, not later than ten business days after such subpoena is served, a motion to quash such subpoena in the superior court for the judicial district where such person resides or maintains an office or, if such person does not reside or maintain an office in the state, the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford. Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, no fees or costs shall be assessed for the filing of such motion. The person filing the motion to quash shall be designated as the plaintiff and the Attorney General shall be designated as the defendant. Such motion to quash shall be expeditiously assigned and heard by the court. The date and time of such hearing shall be established by the court. The court shall give notice to the parties of such hearing.\n\n(B) Upon the filing of such motion to quash, any party to the proceeding regarding such motion to quash may, as provided by law, file a motion to seal or limit the disclosure of files, affidavits, documents or other materials on file or lodged with the court or in connection with a court proceeding. The court shall, as provided by law, hold a hearing on such motion.\n\n(C) The court may quash or modify any subpoena issued pursuant to this subsection for any just cause, including, but not limited to, the following grounds: (i) The information sought by such subpoena is plainly irrelevant to the Attorney General's investigation; (ii) the information sought by such subpoena is protected by the attorney-client privilege or a statutory or constitutional privilege; (iii) the production of property sought by such subpoena would be unreasonable or oppressive; or (iv) the property sought by such subpoena constitutes attorney work product.\n\n(9) Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection, the Attorney General shall not exercise visitorial powers, including, but not limited to, by issuing a subpoena under this subsection, with respect to a national bank or federal savings association except in a manner consistent with federal law, including, but not limited to, 12 USC 25b(i), as amended from time to time.\n\n(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the commissioner to enforce the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, P.L. 111-203, as amended from time to time, or any other state or federal law or regulation.\n\n(P.A. 11-119, S. 1; P.A. 24-75, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 11-119 effective July 1, 2011; P.A. 24-75 added Subsec.
