On and after January 1, 2001, or on and after the first adoption of an investment policy statement under section 3-13b, whichever is later, all trust fund investments shall be made in accordance with the investment policy statement adopted under section 3-13b.

The Treasurer may sell call options which would give the holders of such options the right to purchase securities held by the Treasurer at the date the call is sold for investment purposes, under such terms and conditions as the Treasurer may determine.

In exercising his discretion to invest the state's trust funds in Connecticut mortgage pass-through certificates and in considering the yield on such investments, the Treasurer shall give preference to pools of mortgage loans which contain loans to persons who at the time of mortgage application are contributors to state pension and retirement funds included among the trust funds defined in section 3-13c or who have been past contributors to such funds and who continue to maintain a financial interest therein, and may consider furtherance of the public policy of increasing the amount of reasonably priced mortgage loans available to state residents. Nothing in this section shall prevent the Treasurer from investing state trust funds in mortgage pass-through certificates other than Connecticut mortgage pass-through certificates.\n\n(c) Except in the event of an express repeal of this subsection, no pool of mortgage loans, the ownership of which is evidenced by Connecticut mortgage pass-through certificates, shall be subject to any tax imposed by the state if all of the outstanding Connecticut mortgage pass-through certificates respecting such pool were at any time owned by or on behalf of any one or more of the state's trust funds.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding any other provision in the general statutes or elsewhere to the contrary, the Treasurer may enter into contracts with any life insurance company authorized to do business in Connecticut under which any amounts held in the state's trust funds may be used to purchase pension funding contracts and contracts providing for participation in separate accounts or under which funds become a part of the general account of any such life insurance company.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, neither the Treasurer, the Deputy Treasurer nor any acting Treasurer shall make a private equity or real estate investment without the approval of the Investment Advisory Council, for the balance of the Treasurer's term of office, on or after any of the following events: (1) The defeat of the Treasurer (A) in a ballot for the party nomination for Treasurer at a convention where said Treasurer was a candidate for nomination, (B) in a primary for nomination for said office where said Treasurer was a candidate for nomination, or (C) upon the completion of a recanvass of the returns from such primary under section 9-445 or 9-446, whichever is later, (2) the defeat of the Treasurer (A) in the election for said office or (B) upon the completion of a recanvass of the returns from such election under section 9-311, 9-311a or 9-311b, or (3) the resignation of the Treasurer.\n\n(P.A. 73-594, S. 7, 12; P.A. 74-49, S. 1, 2; P.A. 80-431, S. 2, 4; P.A. 81-343, S. 2, 7; P.A. 86-29, S. 1, 3; P.A. 92-69, S. 4, 5; P.A. 95-120, S. 1, 2; June 18 Sp.

Such description shall be sufficient if made merely by reference to a numbered subsection, subdivision or other applicable section of such bond act.\n\n(2) The agenda of each meeting shall be made available to the members of the commission not later than five business days prior to the meeting at which such agenda is to be considered. The day of the meeting shall count as one of the business days.

Such powers shall be exercised from time to time in such manner as the Treasurer shall determine to be in the best interests of the state and the Treasurer shall file a certificate of determination setting forth the details thereof with the secretary of the State Bond Commission on or before the date of delivery of such bonds, the details of which were determined by the Treasurer in accordance with such delegation.\n\n(4) The State Bond Commission may authorize the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development to defer payments of interest or principal, or a portion thereof, in the case of a troubled loan, as defined in subdivision (1) of subsection (e) of section 8-37x, made by the commissioner under any provision of the general statutes.\n\n(h) Notwithstanding any general statute, public act or special act of the General Assembly enacted prior to or after March 20, 1973, bonds or portions thereof, including refunding bonds authorized by any general statute, public act or special act of the General Assembly enacted prior to or after said date to be issued by the commission or by the Treasurer may be consolidated for the purpose of sale and issued, sold, printed and delivered as a single bond issue, provided, if bonds authorized under two or more bond acts are issued as a single bond issue or if bonds authorized under one or more bond acts together with refunding bonds are issued as a single bond issue, a separate maturity schedule or sinking fund requirements, if any, for such bonds or portions thereof authorized under each bond act and for the refunding bonds shall be established and filed with the secretary of the State Bond Commission on or before the date of delivery of such bonds.\n\n(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or of any general statute, public act or special act of the General Assembly enacted prior to or after March 20, 1973, whenever the Treasurer finds that it is in the best interests of the state to refund bonds issued pursuant to this section or pursuant to any other general statute, public act or special act of the General Assembly enacted prior to or after said date the maturity date of which has not yet occurred, and whether such bonds to be refunded are or are not subject to redemption prior to maturity, refunding bonds of the state may be issued for the purpose of purchasing, paying, funding or refunding such bonds and the interest payable thereon in advance of their maturity, or, if subject to redemption, at such redemption date or dates as provided in such bonds, at maturity or on such date or dates as determined by the Treasurer. No such refunding bonds shall be issued unless they are part of an issue described in a bond determination made and signed by the Treasurer in accordance with and pursuant to this subsection of which a copy has been filed with the secretary of the Bond Commission prior to delivery of such refunding bonds and such determination (A) sets forth the maturities of the bonds, including any refunding bonds, and the interest installments thereof, to be paid from the proceeds of the refunding bonds and (B) includes a certification of the Treasurer that the state reasonably expects as of the date of the certification to achieve, as a result of the sale of such refunding bonds and the investment and application of the proceeds of such sale, net debt service savings. Upon the issuance of any refunding bonds the proceeds from the sale thereof shall be deemed to have been appropriated and pledged for and shall be used and applied to the purchase, redemption or payment of the bonds to be so refunded including the payment of any redemption premium thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue thereon to the date of purchase, redemption or payment of such bonds at or prior to the maturity of such bonds as set forth in the bond determination, the refunding bonds authorized and issued pursuant to this subsection shall be general obligations of the state and the full faith and credit of the state are pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on said bonds as the same become due, and accordingly as part of the contract of the state with the holders of said bonds, appropriation of all amounts necessary for punctual payment of such principal, including any amount of a mandatory sinking fund requirement as provided in such contract, and interest is hereby made, and the Treasurer shall pay such amounts as the same become due. Pending such use or application of the proceeds of refunding bonds issued pursuant to this subsection, such proceeds may be invested in accordance with and subject to the provisions of such bond determination, in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the state or the United States or any agency or instrumentality of the United States or in certificates of deposit or time deposits secured by such obligations, or without limiting the foregoing in bonds, debentures, notes or participation certificates or other obligations issued by federal land banks, the Federal National Mortgage Agency, the federal home loan bank system, the Export Import Bank, the Government National Mortgage Association, the federal intermediate credit banks, the Tennessee Valley Authority, public housing authorities and fully secured by payment of both principal and interest by a pledge of annual contributions under contracts with the United States of America, the United States Postal Service, banks for cooperatives and the Farmers Home Administration and shall be held in trust by the Treasurer in trust for use, application and investment as aforesaid separate and apart from other funds of the state or may be deposited with a trustee in trust for such use, application and investment, upon the execution of the bond determination the Treasurer is authorized to execute contracts for such holding, deposit, use, application and investment of such proceeds. Except as may be provided in the bond determination authorizing refunding bonds pursuant to this subsection, net earnings of investments of proceeds of such refunding bonds not needed for the purpose for which such refunding bonds were authorized shall be deposited in the General Fund. In any such bond determination of the Treasurer authorizing refunding bonds pursuant to this subsection, said Treasurer may include provision for the date or dates of such refunding bonds, the principal amount of such refunding bonds, the maturity date or dates of such refunding bonds and provision relating to serial or term bonds and sinking or other reserve fund requirements, if any, the establishment and terms of any trust or trusts held by a trustee or by the Treasurer pursuant to this subsection, due dates of the interest on such refunding bonds, the form thereof, including execution and issuance to the purchasers, pending preparation of definitive refunding bonds, of temporary bonds without coupons exchangeable for the definitive bonds when prepared, executed and ready for delivery, the denominations and designation of such refunding bonds, registration, conversion and transfer privileges and the terms of redemption with or without premium, the date and manner of sale of such refunding bonds, either public or private, at such price or prices as the Treasurer may determine, provisions for the consolidation of such refunding bonds with other bonds for the purpose of sale as provided in subsection (h) hereof, limitations with respect to the interest rate or rates of such refunding bonds, provisions for receipt and deposit or investment of the good faith deposit pending delivery of such refunding bonds and such other terms and conditions of such refunding bonds and of the issuance and sale thereof and the investment of the proceeds thereof as the Treasurer may determine to be in the best interests of the state. For the purposes of this subsection, “refunding bonds” means bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness including commercial paper and shall be deemed to include any of those agreements authorized by section 3-20a, to the extent that the Treasurer determines that the execution thereof is appropriate or necessary to satisfy the refunding requirements of this subsection.\n\n(j) The Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management shall be the secretary of the State Bond Commission and shall be responsible for keeping complete records of the commission, including minutes certified by him of any meeting showing the adoption of any resolution by the commission and other actions taken by and documents filed with the commission, and such records shall be the official records of the proceedings of said commission and shall be maintained in the office of the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and open for public inspection. Meetings of the State Bond Commission shall be called upon such notice as may be determined by the State Bond Commission and may be open to the public.\n\n(k) Bonds and refunding bonds shall be signed in the name of the state by the manual or facsimile signatures of at least two of the following: (1) The Governor, (2) the Treasurer or the Deputy Treasurer appointed pursuant to section 3-12, and (3) the Comptroller. At least one of such signatures or the signature of an authenticating agent, certifying agent, registrar or transfer agent shall be a manual signature. Such bonds and refunding bonds may be issued notwithstanding that any of the officials signing them or whose facsimile signatures appear on the bonds has ceased to hold office at the time of such issue or at the time of the delivery of such bonds and refunding bonds to the purchaser.\n\n(l) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or of any bond act, bonds issued under this section may be sold at public sale on sealed proposals or, subject to the approval of the State Bond Commission, by negotiation, in such manner, at such price or prices, at such time or times and on such other terms and conditions as the Treasurer shall determine to be in the best interests of the state. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to general obligation bonds issued in accordance with sections 3-17 and 10-183m and delivered to the retirement fund provided for in section 10-183r or to refunding bonds sold at private sale pursuant to subsection (i) hereof.\n\n(m) With the exception of refunding bonds, whenever the State Bond Commission has adopted a resolution authorizing bonds, the Treasurer may, pending the issuing of such bonds, issue, in the name of the state, temporary notes and any renewals thereof in anticipation of the proceeds from the sale of such bonds, which notes and any renewals thereof shall be designated “Anticipation Notes”. The proceeds from the sale of such notes shall be used only for those purposes for which may be used the proceeds of the sale of bonds in anticipation whereof such anticipation notes were issued. Such portion of the proceeds from the sale of such bonds as may be required for such purposes shall be applied to the payment of the principal of and interest on any such anticipation notes which have been issued.\n\n(n) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any bonds sold under section 13a-208 or, except to the extent provided for in this section, to any bonds issued before or after July 1, 1953, pursuant to any bond act which took effect prior to said date.\n\n(o) Any bond act may adopt the provisions of this section by reference to this section or its short title and such reference shall serve to incorporate the provisions of this section in said bond act as though set out in full therein. Notwithstanding such adoption by reference, said bond act may contain provisions applicable to the bonds issued thereunder, and, in case of conflict, the provisions in such bond act shall prevail.\n\n(p) Bonds issued in accordance with the provisions of this section pursuant to any bond act are secured by the full faith and credit of the state, and as part of the contract of the state with the holders of said bonds, appropriation of all amounts necessary for punctual payment of principal of and interest on such bonds is hereby made and the Treasurer shall pay such principal and interest as the same become due.\n\n(q) The State Bond Commission shall have power from time to time to transfer funds from any project or purpose under any act to the contingency reserve of such act provided said commission shall have authorized such transfer upon a finding that there has been filed with it a request for such transfer which is signed by or on behalf of the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management stating that such projects or purposes have been completed and that such funds are excess moneys not needed for such project or purpose.\n\n(r) The State Bond Commission may make representations and agreements which are necessary or appropriate to ensure the exemption from taxation of interest on bonds, notes or other obligations of the state, eligibility of such bonds, notes or other obligations for tax credits or payments from the federal government, or any other desired federal income tax treatment of such bonds, notes or other obligations, in each case under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, including agreements to pay rebates to the federal government of investment earnings derived from the investment of the proceeds of bonds, notes or other obligations issued on or after January 1, 1986, or may delegate to the Treasurer the authority to make such representations and agreements on behalf of the state. Any such agreement may include (1) a covenant to pay rebates to the federal government of investment earnings derived from the investment of the proceeds of bonds, notes or other obligations issued on or after January 1, 1986, (2) a covenant that the state will not limit or alter its rebate obligations until its obligations to the holders or owners of such bonds, notes or other obligations are finally met and discharged, and (3) provisions to (A) establish trust and other accounts which may be appropriate to carry out such representations and agreements, (B) retain fiscal agents as depositories for such funds and accounts, and (C) provide that such fiscal agents may act as trustee of such funds and accounts.\n\n(s) The State Bond Commission may authorize, by vote of a majority of the members of said commission, bonds, refunding bonds, other obligations or borrowings in anticipation thereof in such form and manner that the interest on such bonds, refunding bonds, other obligations or borrowings in anticipation thereof may be includable under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, in the gross income of the holders or owners of such bonds, refunding bonds, other obligations or borrowings in anticipation thereof upon the finding by said commission that the issuance of such taxable bonds, refunding bonds, other obligations or borrowings in anticipation thereof is in the public interest.\n\n(t) The State Bond Commission may establish the interest rate or rates payable upon any loans originated on or after July 1, 1987, under any state loan programs and funded by bonds issued under this section if no rate of interest is specified or required by the general statutes or the public or special act authorizing such loans. The State Bond Commission shall establish such rate or rates in order to achieve the goals and purposes of such loan programs, to achieve the best interests of the state and, to the extent deemed necessary or desirable by the State Bond Commission, to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, and regulations promulgated thereunder.\n\n(u) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or of any bond act, bonds, refunding bonds, notes or other obligations in anticipation thereof authorized and issued under this section may include contract provisions for (1) the payment of interest either (A) at certain rates in the event such interest is excludable from the gross income of the holders or owners thereof under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, or (B) at certain other rates in the event such interest is includable in the gross income of the holders or owners thereof under the Internal Revenue Service Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, (2) the payment by the state of such costs and expenses as may be incurred by the holders or owners of such obligations pursuant to the contract with the state as a result thereof, and (3) other terms as the Treasurer shall determine to be in the best interests of the state. As part of the contract of the state with the holders or owners of such obligations, appropriation of all such amounts necessary for the punctual payment of any amounts required to be paid pursuant to any such contract provisions is hereby made and the Treasurer shall pay such amounts as aforesaid as the same becomes due.\n\n(v) The State Bond Commission may make representations and agreements for the benefit of the holders of bonds, notes or other obligations of the state, or with respect to which the state is an obligated person, including bonds sold under section 13a-208, to provide secondary market disclosure information, or may delegate to the Treasurer the authority to make such representations and agreements on behalf of the state. Any such agreement may include: (1) Covenants to provide secondary market disclosure information, (2) arrangements for such information to be provided with the assistance of a paying agent, trustee or other agent, and (3) remedies for breach of such agreement, which remedies may be limited to specific performance. All such agreements entered into and all such actions taken prior to June 22, 1995, are hereby validated.\n\n(w) The state shall protect and save harmless any official or former official of the state from financial loss and expense, including legal fees and costs, if any, arising out of any claim, demand, suit or judgment by reason of alleged negligence on the part of such official, while acting in the discharge of his official duties, in providing secondary market disclosure information or performing any other duties set forth in any agreement to provide secondary market disclosure information. Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the defense of governmental immunity to any such claim, demand or suit. For purposes of this subsection “official” means any person elected or appointed to office or any state employee. This subsection shall not apply to cases of wilful and wanton fraud.\n\n(x) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, public acts or special acts, upon any sale, lease or other disposition to or use by a nongovernmental entity of all or a portion of any project financed with proceeds of bonds of the state the interest on which is not included in gross income pursuant to Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, that would otherwise cause such bonds to be treated as private activity bonds within the meaning of Section 141 of said internal revenue code, the Treasurer is authorized to transfer all or a portion of the proceeds received with respect to and at the time of such disposition or use, in an amount not less than the amount required by said internal revenue code to preserve the exclusion from gross income of interest on such bonds, (1) to the General Fund to pay debt service on, including redemption, defeasance or purchase of, outstanding bonds of the state the interest on which is not included in gross income pursuant to Section 103 of said internal revenue code, (2) with the approval of the State Bond Commission, in lieu of the issuance of bonds, to the appropriate account or fund for any projects or purposes authorized by the State Bond Commission pursuant to a bond act and with the same force and effect as bond proceeds, thereby reducing the authority to issue bonds by such dollar amount, provided in any event that any such transfer does not cause the interest on the subject bonds to become included in gross income pursuant to Section 103 of said internal revenue code.\n\n(y) For the purposes of this subsection, “state moneys” means the proceeds of the sale of bonds authorized pursuant to this section, or of temporary notes issued in anticipation of the moneys to be derived from the sale of such bonds. Each request filed for an authorization of bonds shall identify the project for which the proceeds of the sale of such bonds are to be used and, in addition to any terms and conditions required pursuant to this section, shall include the recommendation of the person signing such request as to the extent to which federal, private or other moneys then available or thereafter to be made available for costs in connection with any such project should be added to the state moneys available or becoming available for such project. If the request includes a recommendation that some amount of such federal, private or other moneys should be added to such state moneys, then, if and to the extent directed by the State Bond Commission at the time of authorization of such bonds, such amount of such federal, private or other moneys then available, or thereafter to be made available for costs in connection with such project, may be added to any state moneys available or becoming available for such project and shall be used for such project. Any other federal, private or other moneys then available or to be made available for costs in connection with such project shall, upon receipt, be used by the State Treasurer, in conformity with applicable federal and state law, to meet the principal of outstanding bonds issued pursuant to this section, or to meet the principal of temporary notes issued in anticipation of the money to be derived from the sale of bonds authorized pursuant to this section, for the purpose of financing such costs, either by purchase or redemption and cancellation of such bonds or notes, or by payment of such notes at maturity. Whenever any of the federal, private or other moneys so received with respect to such project are used to meet the principal of such temporary notes or whenever principal of any such temporary notes is retired by application of such federal, private or other moneys, the amounts of bonds authorized in anticipation of which such temporary notes were issued, and the aggregate amount of bonds which may be authorized, shall each be reduced by the amount of the principal so met or retired. Pending use of the federal, private or other moneys so received to meet principal as directed in this subsection, the amount of such moneys may be invested by the State Treasurer in bonds or obligation of, or guaranteed by, the state or the United States or agencies or instrumentalities of the United States, shall be deemed to be part of the debt retirement funds of the state, and net earnings on such investments shall be used in the same manner as the moneys so invested.\n\n(z) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes or any public act or special act, upon the request of any proposed recipient for a grant for a program or project within the state to be financed by bonds issued pursuant to this section, and subject to the approval of the State Bond Commission and the Treasurer, such grant may be made to a qualified community development entity, or to a partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or other business entity investing exclusively in a qualified community development entity, provided substantially all of the proceeds of such grant are made available to such proposed recipient to finance such project, or to any reinvestment in such project following a foreclosure brought against such proposed recipient or any affiliate of such proposed recipient on such project. For purposes of this subsection, “qualified community development entity” means an entity certified as a qualified community development entity pursuant to Section 45D(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time, that has received an allocation of new markets tax credits available for qualified low-income community investments in the state under Section 45D(f)(2) of said Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(aa) (1) For each fiscal year during which general obligation bonds or credit revenue bonds issued on and after May 15, 2018, and prior to July 1, 2020, shall be outstanding, the state of Connecticut shall comply with the provisions of (A) section 4-30a of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2017, as amended by section 704 of public act 17-2 of the June special session and section 7 of public act 18-49 and section 20 of public act 18-81, (B) section 2-33c in effect on October 31, 2017, (C) section 2-33a of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2017, as amended by section 709 of public act 17-2 of the June special session, (D) subsections (d) and (g) of this section, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2017, as amended by sections 710 and 711 of public act 17-2 of the June special session, and (E) section 3-21 of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2017, as amended by section 712 of public act 17-2 of the June special session.

Such bonds also may be secured by a pledge of reserves, sinking funds and any other funds and accounts, including proceeds from investment of any of the foregoing, authorized hereby or by the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds, and by moneys paid under a credit facility including, but not limited to, a letter of credit or policy of bond insurance, issued by a financial institution pursuant to an agreement authorized by such proceedings.\n\n(e) The pledge of the pledged revenues under this section is made by the state by operation of law through this section, and as a statutory lien is effective without any further act or agreement by the state, and shall be valid and binding from the time the pledge is made, and any revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys so pledged and received by the state shall be subject immediately to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the state, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof.\n\n(f) In the proceedings authorizing any credit revenue bonds, the state shall direct the trustee to establish one or more collection accounts with the collection agent to receive the pledged revenues and shall direct payment of the pledged revenues into such collection accounts of the collection agent. Funds in such collection accounts shall be kept separate and apart from any other funds of the state until disbursed as provided for in the proceedings authorizing such credit revenue bonds. Such proceedings shall provide that no funds from such collection accounts shall be disbursed to the control of the state until and at such times as all current claims of any trustee set out in the proceedings have been satisfied, and thereafter may be disbursed to the control of the state free and clear of any claim by the trustee or the holders of any credit revenue bonds. The agreements with the depositaries establishing the collection accounts may provide for customary settlement terms for the collection of revenues. The expenses of the state in establishing such collection accounts and directing the deposit of pledged revenues therein, including the expenses of the Department of Revenue Services and the office of the Comptroller in establishing mechanisms to verify, allocate, track and audit such accounts and the deposits therein, may be paid as costs of issuance of any bonds issued pursuant to section 3-20 or this section.\n\n(g) The proceedings under which bonds are authorized to be issued, pursuant to this section, may, subject to the provisions of the general statutes, contain any or all of the following:\n\n(1) Covenants that confirm, as part of the contract with the holders of the credit revenue bonds, the agreements of the state set forth in subsections (d) to (f), inclusive, of this section;\n\n(2) Provisions for the execution of reimbursement agreements or similar agreements in connection with credit facilities including, but not limited to, letters of credit or policies of bond insurance, remarketing agreements and agreements for the purpose of moderating interest rate fluctuations, and of such other agreements entered into pursuant to section 3-20a;\n\n(3) Provisions for the collection, custody, investment, reinvestment and use of the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged therefor;\n\n(4) Provisions regarding the establishment and maintenance of reserves, sinking funds and any other funds and accounts as shall be approved by the State Bond Commission in such amounts as may be established by the State Bond Commission, and the regulation and disposition thereof, including requirements that any such funds and accounts be held separate from or not be commingled with other funds of the state;\n\n(5) Provisions for the issuance of additional bonds on a parity with bonds theretofore issued, including establishment of coverage requirements as a condition of the issuance of such additional bonds;\n\n(6) Provisions regarding the rights and remedies available in case of a default to the bondowners, or any trustee under any contract, loan agreement, document, instrument or trust indenture, including the right to appoint a trustee to represent their interests upon occurrence of an event of default, as defined in said proceedings, provided, if any bonds shall be secured by a trust indenture, the respective owners of such bonds or notes shall have no authority except as set forth in such trust indenture to appoint a separate trustee to represent them, and provided further no such right or remedy shall allow principal and interest on such bonds to be accelerated; and\n\n(7) Provisions or covenants of like or different character from the foregoing which are consistent with this and which the State Bond Commission determines in such proceedings are necessary, convenient or desirable to better secure the bonds, or will tend to make the bonds more marketable, and which are in the best interests of the state. Any provision which may be included in proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds hereunder may be included in a trust indenture duly approved in accordance with this subsection which secures the bonds and any notes issued in anticipation thereof, and in such case the provisions of such indenture shall be deemed to be a part of such proceedings as though they were expressly included therein.\n\n(h) Bonds issued pursuant to this section shall be secured by a trust indenture, approved by the State Bond Commission, by and between the state and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondowners as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the state in relation to the exercise of its powers pursuant to the pledged revenues and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. The state may provide by such trust indenture for the payment of the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys to the trustee under such trust indenture or to any other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine, but consistent with the provisions of subsections (d) to (f), inclusive, of this section.\n\n(i) The Treasurer shall have power to purchase bonds of the state issued pursuant to this section out of any funds available therefor. The Treasurer may hold, pledge, cancel or resell such bonds subject to and in accordance with agreements with bondowners.\n\n(j) Bonds issued pursuant to this section are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, whether or not such bonds are of such form and character as to be negotiable instruments under the terms of the Uniform Commercial Code, subject only to the provisions of such bonds for registration.\n\n(k) Any moneys held by the Treasurer or a trustee pursuant to a trust indenture with respect to bonds issued pursuant to this section, including pledged revenues, other pledged receipts, funds or moneys and proceeds from the sale of such bonds, may, pending the use or application of the proceeds thereof for an authorized purpose, be (1) invested and reinvested in such obligations, securities and investments as are set forth in subsection (f) of section 3-20 and in participation certificates in the Short Term Investment Fund created under section 3-27a, or (2) deposited or redeposited in such bank or banks as shall be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, the certificate of determination authorizing issuance of such bond anticipation notes or in the indenture securing such bonds. Proceeds from investments authorized by this subsection, less amounts required under the proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds, shall be credited to the General Fund.\n\n(l) Bonds issued pursuant to this section are hereby made securities in which all public officers and public bodies of the state and its political subdivisions, all insurance companies, credit unions, building and loan associations, investment companies, banking associations, trust companies, executors, administrators, trustees and other fiduciaries and pension, profit-sharing and retirement funds may properly and legally invest funds, including capital in their control or belonging to them. Such bonds are hereby made securities which may properly and legally be deposited with and received by any state or municipal officer or any agency or political subdivision of the state for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds or obligations of the state is now or may hereafter be authorized by law.\n\n(m) The state covenants with the purchasers and all subsequent owners and transferees of bonds issued by the state pursuant to this section, in consideration of the acceptance of the payment for the bonds, until such bonds, together with the interest thereon, with interest on any unpaid installment of interest and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding on behalf of such owners, are fully met and discharged, or unless expressly permitted or otherwise authorized by the terms of each contract and agreement made or entered into by or on behalf of the state with or for the benefit of such owners, that the state will impose, charge, raise, levy, collect and apply the pledged revenues and other receipts, funds or moneys pledged for the payment of debt service requirements as provided in this section, in such amounts as may be necessary to pay such debt service requirements in each year in which bonds are outstanding and further, that the state (1) will not limit or alter the duties imposed on the Treasurer and other officers of the state by law and by the proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds with respect to application of pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged for the payment of debt service requirements as provided in said sections; (2) will not alter the provisions establishing collection accounts with the collection agent or the direction of pledged revenues to such collection accounts, or the provisions applying such pledged revenues to the debt service requirements with respect to bonds or notes; (3) will not issue any bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, other than the bonds, having any rights arising out of said sections or secured by any pledge of or other lien or charge on the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged for the payment of debt service requirements as provided in said sections; (4) will not create or cause to be created any lien or charge on such pledged amounts, other than a lien or pledge created thereon pursuant to said sections, provided nothing in this subsection shall prevent the state from issuing evidences of indebtedness (A) which are secured by a pledge or lien which is and shall on the face thereof be expressly subordinate and junior in all respects to every lien and pledge created by or pursuant to said sections; (B) for which the full faith and credit of the state is pledged and which are not expressly secured by any specific lien or charge on such pledged amounts; or (C) which are secured by a pledge of or lien on moneys or funds derived on or after such date as every pledge or lien thereon created by or pursuant to said sections shall be discharged and satisfied; (5) will carry out and perform, or cause to be carried out and performed, every promise, covenant, agreement or contract made or entered into by the state or on its behalf with the owners of any bonds; (6) will not in any way impair the rights, exemptions or remedies of such owners; and (7) will not limit, modify, rescind, repeal or otherwise alter the rights or obligations of the appropriate officers of the state to impose, maintain, charge or collect the taxes, fees, charges and other receipts constituting the pledged revenues as may be necessary to produce sufficient revenues to fulfill the terms of the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds; and provided further the state may change the rate of withholding taxes, calculation of amounts to which the rate applies, including exemptions and deductions so long as any such change, had it been in effect, would not have reduced the withholding taxes for any twelve consecutive months within the preceding fifteen months to less than an amount three times the maximum debt service payable on bonds issued and outstanding under this section for the current or any future fiscal year. The State Bond Commission is authorized to include this covenant of the state in any agreement with the owner of any such bonds.\n\n(n) At the time of issuance of any credit revenue bonds pursuant to this section, the Treasurer shall determine the amount of principal and interest estimated to be saved by the issuance of credit revenue bonds instead of general obligation bonds, as measured by the difference between the stated principal and interest payable with respect to such credit revenue bonds in each fiscal year during which bonds shall be outstanding, and the principal and interest estimated to be payable in each fiscal year during which such bonds would have been outstanding had such bonds been issued as general obligation bonds payable over the same period on the basis of equal amounts of principal stated to be due in each fiscal year, subject to any specific adjustments which the Treasurer may consider appropriate to take into account in the structure for a specific bond issue, provided in any fiscal year that the Treasurer determines there are no savings, the estimated savings shall be zero for such fiscal year. The Treasurer shall base such determination on such factors as the Treasurer shall deem relevant, which may include advice from financial advisors to the state, historical trading patterns of outstanding state general obligation bonds and spreads to common municipal bond indexes. The Treasurer shall set out such estimated savings for each fiscal year during which each issue of credit revenue bonds shall be stated to be outstanding in a bond determination which shall be filed with the State Bond Commission at or prior to the issuance of such credit revenue bonds, and such amounts shall be dedicated savings for purposes of this section.\n\n(o) For each fiscal year during which credit revenue bonds shall be outstanding, there shall be transferred from the General Fund of the state to the Budget Reserve Fund established pursuant to section 4-30a, at the beginning of such fiscal year, an amount equal to the aggregate dedicated savings for all such bonds issued and to be outstanding in such fiscal year, unless the Governor declares an emergency or the existence of extraordinary circumstances, in which the provisions of section 4-85 are invoked, and at least three-fifths of the members of each chamber of the General Assembly vote to diminish such required transfer during the fiscal year for which the emergency or existence of extraordinary circumstances are determined, or in such other circumstances as may be permitted by the terms of the bonds, notes or other obligations issued pursuant to this section. Amounts so transferred shall not be available for appropriation for any other purpose, but shall only be used as provided in section 4-30a.\n\n(p) (1) Prior to July 1, 2025, net earnings of investments of proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to section 3-20 or pursuant to this section and accrued interest on the issuance of such bonds and premiums on the issuance of such bonds shall be deposited to the credit of the General Fund, after (A) payment of any expenses incurred by the Treasurer or State Bond Commission in connection with such issuance, or (B) application to interest on bonds, notes or other obligations of the state.\n\n(2) On and after July 1, 2025, notwithstanding subsection (f) of section 3-20, (A) net earnings of investments of proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to section 3-20 or pursuant to this section and accrued interest on the issuance of such bonds shall be deposited to the credit of the General Fund, and (B) premiums, net of any original issue discount, on the issuance of such bonds shall, after payment of any expenses incurred by the Treasurer or State Bond Commission in connection with such issuance, be deposited at the direction of the Treasurer to the credit of an account or fund to fund all or a portion of any purpose or project authorized by the State Bond Commission pursuant to any bond act up to the amount authorized by the State Bond Commission, provided the bonds for such purpose or project are unissued, and provided further the certificate of determination the Treasurer files with the secretary of the State Bond Commission for such authorized bonds sets forth the amount of the deposit applied to fund each such purpose and project. Upon such filing, the Treasurer shall record bonds in the amount of net premiums credited to each purpose and project as set forth in the certificate of determination of the Treasurer as deemed issued and retired and the Treasurer shall not thereafter exercise authority to issue bonds in such amount for such purpose or project. Upon such recording by the Treasurer, such bonds shall be deemed to have been issued, retired and no longer authorized for issuance or outstanding for the purposes of section 3-21, and for the purpose of aligning the funding of such authorized purpose and project with amounts generated by net premiums, but shall not constitute an actual bond issuance or bond retirement for any other purposes including, but not limited to, financial reporting purposes.\n\n(q) Any general obligation bonds or notes issued pursuant to section 3-20 may be refunded by credit revenue bonds or notes issued pursuant to this section, and any credit revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section may be refunded by general obligation bonds or notes issued pursuant to subsection (g) of section 3-20 in the manner, and subject to the same conditions, as set out in subsection (g) of section 3-20.\n\n(June Sp.

If it is not definite and certain from the records of the company what person is entitled to the funds, it is presumed that the last-known address of the person entitled to the funds is the same as the last-known address of the insured or annuitant according to the records of the company.\n\n(b) As used in this section, “unclaimed funds” means all moneys held and owing by any insurance company unclaimed and unpaid for more than three years after the moneys became due and payable as established from the records of a life insurance company under any life or endowment insurance policy or annuity contract which has matured or terminated or after the moneys became due and payable as established from the records of any other insurance company. A life insurance policy not matured by actual proof of the death of the insured is deemed to be matured and the proceeds thereof are deemed to be due and payable if such policy was in force when the insured attained the limiting age under the mortality table on which the reserve is based, unless the person appearing entitled thereto has within the preceding three years (1) assigned, readjusted or paid premiums on the policy, or subjected the policy to loan, or (2) corresponded in writing with the insurance company concerning the policy.

Investment earnings credited to the assets of said fund shall become part of the assets of said fund. Any balance remaining in said fund at the end of any fiscal year shall be carried forward in said fund for the fiscal year next succeeding.\n\n(c) As provided in the proceedings, the Treasurer shall deposit all abandoned property receipts in the Special Abandoned Property Fund to pay and secure the abandoned property fund bonds and the debt service requirements.\n\n(d) The Treasurer shall apply the resources in the Special Abandoned Property Fund, upon their receipt, first, to pay or provide for the payment of debt service requirements, as defined in this section, at such time or times, in such amount or amounts and in such manner, as provided by the proceedings authorizing the issuance of abandoned property fund bonds; second, to pay Special Abandoned Property Fund financing costs; third, to pay all costs incident to the collection and recovery of such abandoned property receipts and any other property collected and recovered under sections 3-56a to 3-76, inclusive; and fourth, to deposit in the General Fund.\n\n(e) The State Bond Commission may, prior to June 30, 2005, authorize the issuance of abandoned property fund bonds in one or more series and in principal amounts not to exceed sixty million dollars plus such additional amount of abandoned property fund bonds required to fund Special Abandoned Property Fund financing costs in accordance with the proceedings authorizing the abandoned property fund bonds for the purpose of disbursing funds to the General Fund in support of state programs. Such abandoned property fund bonds are hereby determined to be issued for valid public proposes in the exercise of essential government functions.\n\n(f) The debt service requirements with respect to any abandoned property fund bonds shall be secured by (1) a first call upon the pledged revenues as they are deposited to the Special Abandoned Property Fund; and (2) a lien upon any and all amounts held in and to the credit of the Special Abandoned Property Fund from time to time.\n\n(g) Such abandoned property fund bonds shall be special obligations of the state and shall not be payable from or charged upon any funds other than the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged therefor and deposited in the Special Abandoned Property Fund and the state or any political subdivision thereof shall not be subject to any liability thereon, except to the extent of such pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged therefor as provided in this section. The issuance of abandoned property fund bonds shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the state or any political subdivision thereof to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor, or to make any additional appropriation for their payment. Such abandoned property fund bonds shall not constitute a charge, lien or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the state or of any political subdivision thereof other than the pledged receipts, funds or moneys pledged therefor and deposited in the Special Abandoned Property Fund and the substance of such limitation shall be plainly stated on each such abandoned property fund bond. Notwithstanding any other provision of the general statutes, abandoned property fund bonds shall not be subject to any statutory limitation on the indebtedness of the state, and, when issued, shall not be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of the state in respect of and to the extent of any such limitation. As part of the contract of the state with the owners of the abandoned property fund bonds, all amounts necessary for the punctual payment of the debt service requirements with respect to the abandoned property fund bonds shall be deemed appropriated, but only from the sources pledged pursuant to this section.\n\n(h) The abandoned property fund bonds may be issued if after authorization the Treasurer and the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management find that such issuance is necessary to disburse funds to the General Fund in support of state programs.\n\n(i) The abandoned property fund bonds may be executed and delivered at the time or times, shall be dated, shall bear interest at the rate or rates, shall mature at the time or times not exceeding seven years from their date, have the rank or priority, be payable in the medium of payment, be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, carry the registration and transfer privileges and be made redeemable before maturity at the price or prices and under the terms and conditions, all as may be provided by the proceedings and the Treasurer shall continue to deposit all abandoned property receipts in the Special Abandoned Property Fund to pay the abandoned property fund bonds until such bonds are fully discharged.\n\n(j) All of the provisions of section 3-20 with the exception of subsections (i) and (p) of said section 3-20 and the exercise of any right or power granted thereby which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this section, are hereby adopted and may be invoked in respect to the abandoned property fund bonds authorized pursuant to this section.\n\n(k) Any abandoned property fund bonds may be sold at public sale on sealed proposals or by negotiation in such manner, at such price or prices, at such time or times and on such other terms and conditions of such abandoned property fund bonds and the issuance and sale thereof as the Treasurer may determine to be in the best interests of the state.\n\n(l) The proceedings under which abandoned property fund bonds are authorized to be issued may, subject to the provisions of the general statutes, contain any or all of the following: (1) Provisions respecting custody of the proceeds from the sale of the abandoned property fund bonds, including any requirements that such proceeds be held separate from or not be commingled with other funds of the state; (2) provisions for the investment and reinvestment of abandoned property fund bond proceeds until used to pay Special Abandoned Property Fund financing costs and for the disposition of any excess bond proceeds or investment earnings thereon; (3) provisions for the execution of reimbursement agreements or similar agreements in connection with credit facilities, including, but not limited to, letters of credit or policies of bond insurance, remarketing agreements and agreements for the purpose of moderating interest rate fluctuations, and of such other agreements entered into pursuant to section 3-20a; (4) provisions for the collection, custody, investment, reinvestment and use of the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged therefor and deposited in the Special Abandoned Property Fund; (5) provisions regarding the establishment and maintenance of reserves, sinking funds and any other funds and accounts as shall be approved by the Treasurer in such amounts as may be established by the Treasurer, and the regulation and disposition thereof, including requirements that any such funds and accounts be held separate from or not be commingled with other funds of the state; (6) covenants for the establishment of pledged revenue coverage requirements for the abandoned property fund bonds; (7) provisions for the issuance of additional abandoned property fund bonds on a parity with abandoned property fund bonds theretofore issued, including establishment of coverage requirements with respect thereto as provided in this subsection; (8) provisions regarding the rights and remedies available in case of a default to the bondowners, or any trustee under any contract, document, instrument or indenture of trust, including the right to appoint a trustee to represent their interests upon occurrence of an event of default, as defined in said proceedings, provided if any abandoned property fund bonds shall be secured by an indenture of trust, the respective owners of such abandoned property fund bonds shall have no authority except as set forth in such trust indenture to appoint a separate trustee to represent them; and (9) provisions or covenants of like or different character from the foregoing which are determined in such proceedings are necessary, convenient or desirable in order to better secure the abandoned property fund bonds, or will tend to make the abandoned property fund bonds more marketable, and which are in the best interests of the state.\n\n(m) Any pledge made by the state pursuant to this section is and shall be deemed a statutory lien. Such lien shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made. The lien of any pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the state, including but not limited to a claim pursuant to sections 3-56a to 3-76, inclusive, irrespective of whether the parties have notice of the claims. Notwithstanding any provision of the Uniform Commercial Code, neither this section, the indenture of trust, the proceedings nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded. Any revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys so pledged and thereafter credited to and held in the Special Abandoned Property Fund shall be subject immediately to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act and such lien shall have priority over all other liens.\n\n(n) Abandoned property fund bonds may be secured by an indenture of trust by and between the state and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Such indenture of trust may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondowners as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. The state may provide by such indenture of trust for the payment of the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys to the trustee under such indenture of trust or to any other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such indenture of trust may be treated as Special Abandoned Property Fund financing costs.\n\n(o) The Treasurer shall have power to purchase abandoned property fund bonds issued pursuant to this section out of any funds available therefor. The Treasurer may hold, pledge, cancel or resell such abandoned property fund bonds subject to and in accordance with agreements with bondowners.\n\n(p) Whether or not any abandoned property fund bonds issued pursuant to this section are of the form and character to qualify as negotiable instruments under the terms of title 42a, the abandoned property fund bonds are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all purposes of said title 42a, subject only to the provisions of the abandoned property fund bonds.\n\n(q) Any moneys held by the Treasurer or by a trustee pursuant to an indenture of trust with respect to abandoned property fund bonds including pledged revenues, other pledged receipts, funds or moneys and proceeds from the sale of such abandoned property fund bonds, may, pending the use or application of the proceeds thereof for an authorized purpose, be (1) invested and reinvested in such obligations, securities and investments as are set forth in subsection (f) of section 3-20 and in participation certificates in the Short Term Investment Funds created under sections 3-27a and 3-27f, or (2) deposited or redeposited in such bank or banks as shall be provided in the proceedings. Unless the proceedings provide otherwise, proceeds from investments authorized by this subsection, less amounts required under the proceedings authorizing the issuance of abandoned property fund bonds for the payment of Special Abandoned Property Fund financing costs relating to such abandoned property fund bonds, shall be credited to the Special Abandoned Property Fund.\n\n(r) Any abandoned property fund bonds at any time outstanding may, at any time and from time to time, be refunded by the state by the issuance of its refunding abandoned property fund bonds in such amounts as the Treasurer may deem necessary, but not to exceed an amount sufficient to refund the principal of the abandoned property fund bonds to be so refunded, to pay any unpaid interest on such abandoned property fund bonds and any premiums and commissions necessary to be paid in connection with such abandoned property fund bonds and to pay costs and expenses which the Treasurer may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the authorization, sale and issuance of refunding abandoned property fund bonds. Any such refunding may be effected whether the abandoned property fund bonds to be refunded shall have matured or shall thereafter mature. All refunding abandoned property fund bonds issued under this subsection shall be payable solely from the revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys out of which the abandoned property fund bonds to be refunded thereby are payable and shall be subject to and may be secured in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(s) The state covenants with the purchasers and all subsequent owners and transferees of abandoned property fund bonds, in consideration of the acceptance of and payment for the abandoned property fund bonds, that the principal and interest of such abandoned property fund bonds shall be free from taxation at all times, except for estate and gift, franchise and excise taxes, imposed by the state or any political subdivision thereof. The Treasurer is authorized to include this covenant of the state in any agreement with the owner of any such abandoned property fund bonds.\n\n(t) Abandoned property fund bonds issued pursuant to this section are hereby made securities in which all public officers and public bodies of the state and its political subdivisions, all insurance companies, credit unions, building and loan associations, investment companies, banking associations, trust companies, executors, administrators, trustees and other fiduciaries and pension, profit-sharing and retirement funds may properly and legally invest funds, including capital in their control or belonging to them. Such abandoned property fund bonds are hereby made securities which may properly and legally be deposited with and received by any state or municipal officer or any agency or political subdivision of the state for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds or obligations of the state is now or may hereafter be authorized by law.\n\n(u) The state covenants with the purchasers and all subsequent owners and transferees of abandoned property fund bonds issued by the state pursuant to this section in consideration of the acceptance of the payment for the abandoned property fund bonds, until such abandoned property fund bonds, together with the interest thereon, with interest on any unpaid installment of interest and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding on behalf of such owners, are fully met and discharged, or unless expressly permitted or otherwise authorized by the terms of each contract and agreement made or entered into by or on behalf of the state with or for the benefit of such owners, that the state will apply the pledged revenues and other receipts, funds or moneys pledged for the payment of debt service requirements as provided in this section, in such amounts as may be necessary to pay such debt service requirements in each year in which such abandoned property fund bonds are outstanding and further, that the state (1) will not limit or alter the duties imposed on the Treasurer and other officers of the state by this section, and by the proceedings authorizing the issuance of abandoned property fund bonds with respect to application of pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged for the payment of debt service requirements as provided in this section; (2) will not issue any bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, other than the abandoned property fund bonds, having any rights arising out of this section or secured by any pledge of or other lien or charge on the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged for the payment of debt service requirements as provided in this section; (3) will not create or cause to be created any lien or charge on such pledged amounts, other than a lien or pledge created thereon pursuant to this section, provided nothing in this subsection shall prevent the state from issuing evidences of indebtedness (A) which are secured by a pledge or lien which is and shall on the face thereof be expressly subordinate and junior in all respects to every lien and pledge created by or pursuant to this section; or (B) for which the full faith and credit of the state is pledged and which are not expressly secured by any specific lien or charge on such pledged amounts; or (C) which are secured by a pledge of or lien on moneys or funds derived on or after such date as every pledge or lien thereon created by or pursuant to this section shall be discharged and satisfied; (4) will carry out and perform, or cause to be carried out and performed, each and every promise, covenant, agreement or contract made or entered into by the state or on its behalf with the owners of any abandoned property fund bonds; (5) will not in any way impair the rights, exemptions or remedies of the owners of abandoned property fund bonds; and (6) will not limit, modify, rescind, repeal or otherwise alter the rights or obligations of the appropriate officers of the state to collect the funds and other receipts constituting the pledged revenues as may be necessary to produce sufficient revenues to fulfill the terms of the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the abandoned property fund bonds, including pledged revenue coverage requirements, and provided, however, nothing in this subsection shall preclude the state from exercising its power to limit, modify, rescind, repeal or otherwise alter the character or amount of such pledged revenues, if and when adequate provisions shall be made by law for the protection of the owners of the outstanding abandoned property fund bonds. The Treasurer is authorized to include this covenant of the state in any agreement with the owners of any such abandoned property tax bonds.\n\n(P.A. 04-216, S. 56; P.A. 24-62, S. 7.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 04-216 effective May 6, 2004; P.A. 24-62 amended Subsec.

      "text": "(a) Not less than one hundred eighty days before a presumption of abandonment is to take effect in respect to property subject to section 3-60b or 3-60c and within one year before a presumption of abandonment is to take effect in respect to all other property subject to this part, and if the owner's claim is not barred by law, the holder shall notify the owner thereof and take reasonable steps to prevent abandonment from being presumed, at a minimum, by sending such notice by first class mail directed to the owner's last-known address, and, if a holder has received an owner's consent for the electronic delivery of any notices that are required by law, by electronic mail directed to the owner's last-known electronic mail address, that evidence of interest must be indicated as required by this part or such property will be transferred to the Treasurer and will be subject to escheat to the state. If the property presumed abandoned is a security, virtual currency or tangible property from a safe deposit box, the holder's notice shall indicate that such property may be liquidated either prior to or following its reporting to the Treasurer and that after such liquidation will be limited to the proceeds of such liquidation. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an owner to consent to the electronic delivery of notices for communications regarding unclaimed property.\n\n(b) Not later than ninety days after the close of the calendar year in which property is presumed abandoned, the holder shall pay or deliver such property to the Treasurer and file, on forms that the Treasurer shall provide, a report of unclaimed property. Each report shall be verified and shall include: (1) The name, if known, last-known physical and electronic mail address, if any, and last-known telephone number, if any, of each person appearing to be the owner of such property; (2) in case of unclaimed funds of an insurance company, the full name of the insured or annuitant and beneficiary and his or her last-known address appearing on the insurance company's records; (3) the nature and identifying number, if any, or description of the property and the amount appearing from the records to be due; (4) the date when the property became payable, demandable or returnable and the date of the last transaction with the owner with respect to the property; (5) if the holder is a successor to other holders, or if the holder has changed the holder's name, all prior known names and addresses of each holder of the property; and (6) such other information as the Treasurer may require.\n\n(c) Verification, if made by a partnership, shall be executed by a partner; if made by an unincorporated association or private corporation, by an officer; and if made by a public corporation, by its chief fiscal officer.\n\n(d) The Treasurer shall keep a permanent record of all reports submitted to the Treasurer pursuant to this section.\n\n(e) Except for claims paid under section 3-67a and except as provided in subsection (e) of section 3-70a, no owner shall be entitled to any interest, income or other increment which may accrue to property presumed abandoned from and after the date of payment or delivery to the Treasurer.\n\n(f) The Treasurer may decline to receive any property the value of which is less than the cost of giving notice or holding sale, or may postpone taking possession until a sufficient sum accumulates.\n\n(g) The Treasurer, or any officer or agency designated by the Treasurer, may examine any person on oath or affirmation, or the records of any person or any agent of the person including, but not limited to, a dividend disbursement agent or transfer agent of a business association, banking organization or insurance company that is the holder of property presumed abandoned to determine whether the person or agent has complied with this part. The Treasurer may conduct the examination even if the person or agent believes the person or agent is not in possession of any property that must be paid, delivered or reported under this part. The Treasurer may bring an action in a court of appropriate jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this part.\n\n(h) A record of the issuance of a check, draft or similar instrument is prima facie evidence of the obligation represented by the check, draft or similar instrument. In claiming property from a holder who is also the issuer, the Treasurer's burden of proof as to the existence and amount of the property and its abandonment is satisfied by showing issuance of the instrument and passage of the requisite period of abandonment. Defenses of payment, satisfaction, discharge and want of consideration are affirmative defenses that shall be established by the holder.\n\n(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the holder of personal property presumed abandoned pursuant to subdivision (5) of subsection (a) of section 3-57a or section 3-57b shall (1) sell such property and pay the proceeds arising from such sale, excluding any charges that may lawfully be withheld, to the Treasurer, unless such property consists of military medals, in which case such property shall not be sold, and (2) provide the Treasurer with records deemed appropriate by the Treasurer of property so presumed abandoned. The holder shall complete the sale of such property and deliver the net proceeds to the Treasurer not later than thirty days after filing the report required under subsection (b) of this section. A holder of tangible, personal property may contract with a third party to store and sell such property and to pay the proceeds arising from such sale, excluding any charges that may be lawfully withheld, to the Treasurer, provided the third party holds a surety bond or other form of insurance coverage with respect to such activities. Any holder who sells property pursuant to subsection (a) of section 3-57a or section 3-57b and remits the excess proceeds to the Treasurer or who transmits tangible, personal property to a bonded or insured third party for such purposes, shall not be responsible for any claims related to the sale or transmission of the property or proceeds to the Treasurer. If the Treasurer exempts any such property from being remitted or sold pursuant to this subsection, whether by regulations or guidelines, the holder of such property may dispose of such property in any manner such holder deems appropriate and such holder shall not be responsible for any claims related to the disposition of such property or any claims to the property itself. For purposes of the sale of personal property presumed abandoned under subdivision (5) of subsection (a) of section 3-57a or section 3-57b, charges that may lawfully be withheld include costs of storage, appraisal, advertising and sales commissions as well as lawful charges owing under the contract governing the safe deposit box rental.\n\n(j) In the event military medals are presumed abandoned pursuant to subdivision (5) of subsection (a) of section 3-57a, a banking or financial organization shall transmit such medals to the Department of Veterans Affairs in accordance with procedures established by the Treasurer. The Treasurer and Commissioner of Veterans Affairs shall enter into a memorandum of understanding concerning the handling of such medals and the Department of Veterans Affairs shall hold such medals in custody pursuant to such memorandum.

Said fund and said account or accounts or municipal reserve account or accounts may each contain proceeds of bonds and other moneys and shall each be held, separate and apart from all other moneys and funds, in such manner as may be determined by a bond determination made and signed and filed with the secretary of the State Bond Commission by the Treasurer.\n\n(b) Pending the use or application of moneys in said fund as hereinbelow directed, such moneys shall be invested by the Treasurer subject to the limitations of this part and such limitations, if any, as provided in the contract or contracts with the holders of the special obligation bonds. Obligations purchased as such investment of moneys in said fund shall be held at all times as part of said fund, and the interest thereon and any profit arising on the sale thereof shall be credited to said fund and any loss resulting on the sale thereof shall be charged to said fund, and for all purposes of this part, said obligations shall be valued at the amortized cost thereof.\n\n(c) Except as may be otherwise required by the terms of any lien or pledge created by or pursuant to this part, the moneys in such fund shall be held only for and applied to the payment, subject to and in accordance with the terms of any covenant or principal of, and redemption premium if any and interest on, such bonds as such principal, premium and interest shall become due; provided, if at any time there is in said fund moneys which may be withdrawn therefrom by the terms of any such contract or covenant and are not otherwise required to be retained therein as determined by the Treasurer to assure the payment of all special obligation bonds theretofore issued or to be issued pursuant to this part, the Treasurer shall transfer or cause to be transferred therefrom such moneys which may be so withdrawn and which are not so required, first to the General Fund of the state in repayment of any sums theretofore appropriated by this part, and not previously repaid and second to the municipalities in proportion to the amount of municipal refunding bonds sold to the state in accordance with the contracts executed therewith.\n\n(d) The moneys required by the contract with the holders of special obligation bonds to be held in or credited to any municipal reserve account established under this section, except as hereinafter provided, shall be used solely for the payment of the principal of special obligation bonds secured by such municipal reserve account as the same become due, the purchase of such bonds, the payment of interest on such bonds or the payment of any redemption premium required to be paid when such bonds are redeemed prior to maturity; provided, the Treasurer, on behalf of the state, as part of the contract with the holders of special obligation bonds shall have power to provide that moneys in any such account shall not be withdrawn therefrom at any time in such amount as would reduce the amount of such funds to less than the “required reserve” as defined in this section, except for the purpose of paying such principal of, redemption premium and interest on such bonds secured by such municipal reserve account becoming due and for the payment of which other moneys in the Municipal Refunding Trust Fund in accordance with the terms of any contract with the holders of special obligation bonds are not available. As used in this subsection, “required reserve” means, as of any date of computation, the amount or amounts required to be on deposit in the municipal reserve account or accounts as provided in the contract with the holders of the special obligation bonds. The Treasurer in the bond determination may provide that it shall not issue bonds at any time if the required reserve on the special obligation bonds outstanding and the special obligation bonds then to be issued and secured by a municipal reserve account will exceed the amount of such municipal reserve account at the time of issuance of such bonds, unless there shall be deposited in such municipal reserve account from the proceeds of the bonds so to be issued, or otherwise, an amount which, together with the amount then in such municipal reserve account, will be not less than the required reserve. On or before December first, annually, there is deemed to be appropriated from the state General Fund such sums, if any, as shall be certified by the Treasurer to the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and Comptroller of the state, as necessary to restore each such municipal reserve account to the amount equal to the required reserve of such account, and such sum shall be allotted, paid and deposited into such account in the Municipal Refunding Trust Fund during the then current state fiscal year. Nothing contained in this section shall preclude the Treasurer, on behalf of the state, as part of the contract with the holders of special obligation bonds, from establishing and creating other debt service reserve accounts or funds in connection with the issuance of such bonds.\n\n(P.A. 73-591, S. 13, 21; P.A. 77-614, S. 19, 610.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 77-614 substituted secretary of the office of policy and management for commissioner of finance and control.",
