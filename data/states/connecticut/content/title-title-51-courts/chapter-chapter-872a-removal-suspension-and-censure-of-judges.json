The council shall, not later than five days after such initiation of an investigation or receipt of such complaint, notify by registered or certified mail any judge, administrative law judge or family support magistrate under investigation or against whom such complaint is filed. A copy of any such complaint shall accompany such notice. The council shall also notify the complainant of its receipt of such complaint not later than five days thereafter. Any investigation to determine whether or not there is probable cause that conduct under section 51-51i has occurred shall be confidential and any individual called by the council for the purpose of providing information shall not disclose his knowledge of such investigation to a third party prior to the decision of the council on whether probable cause exists, unless the respondent requests that such investigation and disclosure be open, provided information known or obtained independently of any such investigation shall not be confidential.

The judge, administrative law judge or family support magistrate shall also have the right to be represented by legal counsel and examine and cross-examine witnesses. In conducting its investigation under this subsection, the council may request that a court furnish to the council a record or transcript of court proceedings, including records and transcripts of juvenile matters pursuant to section 46b-124 and records and transcripts of cases involving youthful offenders pursuant to section 54-76l, made or prepared by a court reporter, assistant court reporter or monitor and the court shall, upon such request, furnish such record or transcript.\n\n(b) The Judicial Review Council shall, not later than three business days after the termination of such investigation, notify the complainant, if any, and the judge, administrative law judge or family support magistrate that the investigation has been terminated and the results thereof.

If an admonishment is issued, the council shall (1) notify the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to the judiciary that an admonishment was issued and provide said committee with the substance of the admonishment, including copies of the complaint file, (2) notify the Chief Court Administrator that an admonishment was issued and provide the Chief Court Administrator with the substance of the admonishment, including copies of the complaint file, and (3) inform the complainant, if any, that an admonishment was issued if the admonishment is the result of misconduct alleged in the complaint.

All hearings held pursuant to this subsection shall be open. A judge, an administrative law judge or a family support magistrate appearing before such a hearing shall be entitled to counsel, to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses.
