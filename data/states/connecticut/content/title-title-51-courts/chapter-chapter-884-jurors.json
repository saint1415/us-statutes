Any person claiming a disqualification under subdivision (9) of this subsection shall submit to the Jury Administrator a letter from a licensed health care provider stating the health care provider's opinion that such disability prevents the person from rendering satisfactory juror service. In reaching such opinion, the health care provider shall apply the following guideline: A person shall be capable of rendering satisfactory juror service if such person is able to perform a sedentary job requiring close attention for six hours per day, with short work breaks in the morning and afternoon sessions, for at least three consecutive business days. Any person claiming a disqualification under subdivision (10) of this subsection shall supply proof of federal jury service satisfactory to the Jury Administrator.\n\n(b) The Jury Administrator may determine, in such manner and at such times as the Jury Administrator deems feasible, whether any person is qualified to serve as juror under this section and whether any person may be excused for extreme hardship.\n\n(c) The Jury Administrator shall have the authority to establish and maintain a list of persons to be excluded from the summoning process, which shall consist of (1) persons who are disqualified from serving on jury duty on a permanent basis due to a disability for which a licensed physician, a physician assistant or an advanced practice registered nurse has submitted a letter stating the physician's, physician assistant's or advanced practice registered nurse's opinion that such disability permanently prevents the person from rendering satisfactory jury service, (2) persons seventy-five years of age or older who have requested not to be summoned, (3) elected officials enumerated in subdivision (4) of subsection (a) of this section and judges enumerated in subdivision (5) of subsection (a) of this section during their term of office, and (4) persons excused from jury service pursuant to section 51-217a who have not requested to be summoned for jury service pursuant to said section.

A challenge to the array must be for a cause that affects all the jurors alike. 67 C. 583; 109 C. 572. There can rarely be any ground for a challenge to the array; 48 C. 546; nature of such challenge. 67 C. 581. Jurors are not public officers within the meaning of the constitution and law. 48 C. 546. Prescribed age not indispensable to the validity of a verdict. 72 C. 112. Grounds for challenge at common law are still good; statutory qualifications are in addition to those at common law. 103 C. 542. Reading newspaper articles to jury in jury room not ground for challenge to array, since it is not concerned with any irregularity in selecting or summoning jurors composing panel. 109 C. 572. Proper remedy where papers or exhibits are improperly sent into jury room is motion to set aside verdict; and motion to set aside should be granted unless it clearly appears that they had no prejudicial effect; whether jury made use of such papers is immaterial, since deliberations cannot be inquired into. Id., 726. An array representation of the community is a fair cross section of the county; a challenge to the array is inadequate where it was not an attack on the selection process for the entire panel. 167 C. 539. Held constitutional on its face; exclusion of felons consistent with standards of section. 169 C. 692. Legislatively prescribed juror qualifications do not unconstitutionally encroach upon the judicial power. 180 C. 382. Cited. 203 C. 570; 216 C. 621; 220 C. 487. General discussion of relevant procedure for jury selection in Connecticut. 254 C. 578.\n\nCited. 7 CA 95.\n\nCited. 38 CS 407; 42 CS 534.\n\nUnderrepresentation of a racial group on juries is not violative of any constitutional requirements; constitution requires only a fair jury selected without regard to race; Connecticut's system of selecting jurors does not, in and of itself, discriminate against black people; statutes are designed to produce jurors who reasonably reflect a cross section of the community and are of necessary character and intelligence. 2 Conn. Cir. Ct. 203–205.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nSubdiv. (3): English proficiency requirement not violative of equal protection clause of either federal or state constitution. 260 C. 339. Subdiv. (3): Defendant failed to demonstrate that removal of prospective juror for cause on ground of lack of English proficiency entitled him to new trial in absence of showing of prejudice to defendant's right to impartial jury or that such removal constituted a systemic pattern of improper exclusion under 476 U.S. 79. 322 C. 519.\n\nSubdiv. (3): A prospective juror for whom English is a second language should not be disqualified from jury service based upon his imperfect ability to speak English; there must be sufficient information before the court to support a determination that the prospective juror is functionally incapable of carrying out his responsibilities as a juror, which includes being able to follow the court's instructions and the proceedings, and to communicate with fellow jurors during deliberations in a common effort to reach a verdict. 155 CA 392; judgment affirmed, see 322 C. 519.",

If the date to which the juror has postponed jury service is improper, unavailable or inconvenient for the court, the Jury Administrator shall assign a date of service which, if possible, is reasonably close to the postponement date selected by the juror. Such notice or summons shall be made available to any party or to the attorney for such party in an action to be tried to a jury. The Jury Administrator may grant additional postponements within or beyond said ten months but not beyond one year from the original summons date.\n\n(c) (1) The Jury Administrator shall provide to a prospective juror a juror confirmation form and a confidential juror questionnaire. Such questionnaire shall include questions eliciting the juror's name, age, race and ethnicity, gender, occupation, education, information usually raised in voir dire examination and such other demographic information determined appropriate by the Judicial Branch. The questionnaire shall inform the prospective juror that information concerning race and ethnicity is required solely to enforce nondiscrimination in jury selection, that the furnishing of such information is not a prerequisite to being qualified for jury service and that such information need not be furnished if the prospective juror finds it objectionable to do so. Such juror confirmation form and confidential juror questionnaire shall be signed by the prospective juror under penalty of false statement. Copies of the completed questionnaires shall be provided to the judge and to counsel for use during voir dire or in preparation therefor. Counsel shall be required to return such copies to the clerk of the court upon completion of the voir dire. Except for disclosure made during voir dire or unless the court orders otherwise, information inserted by jurors shall be held in confidence by the court, the parties, counsel and their authorized agents. Such completed questionnaires shall not constitute a public record.\n\n(2) The Judicial Branch shall compile a record of the demographic characteristics of all persons who: (A) Are summoned for jury service, (B) participated in a panel, (C) are subject to a peremptory challenge, (D) are subject to challenge for cause, and (E) serve on a jury. Such record shall exclude personally identifiable information and shall be maintained in a manner that provides free and open access to the information on the Internet. As used in this subdivision, “personally identifiable information” means any identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual.\n\n(d) The number of jurors in a panel may be reduced when, in the opinion of the court, such number of jurors is in excess of reasonable requirements. Such reduction by the clerk shall be accomplished by lot to the extent authorized by the court and the jurors released shall be subject to recall for jury duty only if and when required.\n\n(e) In each judicial district, the Chief Court Administrator shall designate one or more courthouses to be the courthouse to which jurors originally shall be summoned.

In the event that a juror may be considered to be both a full-time employed juror and a part-time employed juror for any day of the first five days, or part thereof, of jury service, such juror shall, for the purposes of this section, be considered to be a full-time employed juror only.\n\n(b) The Jury Administrator shall establish guidelines for reimbursement of expenses pursuant to this section.\n\n(c) Each juror who serves more than five days shall be paid by the state for the sixth day and each day thereafter at a rate of fifty dollars per day of service.
