Section does not apply to timeliness of judgment rendered following short calendar proceeding. 95 CA 713. Where court sent notice extending commencement of period to issue decision, express consent by parties not required for extension. 99 CA 367. Completion date of trial was date on which court last heard argument on the issues of liability and damages before it rendered judgment on those issues; court complied with section requirements regarding judgment as to liability and damages that was issued within 120 days from completion date of trial, and regarding subsequent judgment awarding punitive damages, attorney's fees and costs more than 120 days after completion date of trial; as long as trial court decides a case on its merits within 120 days, there is no statutory time limit within which it must decide ancillary issues such as punitive damages, attorney's fees and costs; section not intended to guarantee that a losing party will have a final judgment from which to appeal within 120 days of completion of trial. 121 CA 105. Section is not applicable when a matter is referred to and tried before an attorney fact finder. 124 CA 1. Habeas petitioner's silence before tardy judgment was rendered was not a waiver, and motion to set aside judgment, filed 9 days after judgment was rendered beyond the 120-day time limitation, was a seasonable objection. 125 CA 296. Completion date of trial was the date the court last heard argument on the issues of liability and damages, and the court complied with the 120-day time requirement. Id., 399. Where court requested extension of 120-day requirement from only one party, opposing party did not implicitly waive 120-day requirement through silence or inaction, or assume duty to object to or protest the late judgment. 137 CA 142. 120-day period begins to run from date parties file post-trial briefs or other materials the court finds necessary for a well-reasoned decision. 140 CA 697. Trial court's finding that plaintiff had waived the provisions of section by executing multiple agreements extending the period of time for the court to render judgment was clearly erroneous and voidable when the court ultimately rendered judgment after the date stipulated in the parties' second extension. 144 CA 62. When an extension is unaccompanied by any language of limitation or conditions, it necessarily operates as a waiver, and because defendants consented to an extension of the 120-day time period within which the court was required to issue its decision, and did not set forth any conditions or limitations on the agreed upon extension, the court's determination that they waived the 120-day rule was not clearly erroneous. 163 CA 1.\n\nCited. 44 CS 312.",

Id., 384, 412. Division cannot evaluate other cases where it is claimed that lesser sentences were imposed unless it has before it the facts of such cases. Id., 415. In determining a proper sentence, trial court owes duty to public as much as it does to accused. Id., 418. Maximum sentences given to defendants who were first offenders under uniform state narcotic drug act reduced from 10 to 7 years as both had used drugs for a short time only and neither sold narcotics. Id., 421. It is function of board of parole, not sentence review division, to determine when a person should be released from prison. Id., 423. Sentence of narcotics offender reduced where background showed prior voluntary submission to arrest in an effort to break narcotic habit. Id., 426. Defendant sentenced to reformatory and then to prison, terms to be served consecutively; prison sentence suspended for presumably he would be reformed while serving reformatory sentence. Id., 431. Relatively more severe sentences may be justified in crimes involving injury or risk of injury to children. Id., 434. Purpose of division is to achieve more rational sentences and greater equality of treatment for offenders; considerations of clemency and postprison reform are matters outside its scope. Id., 448. In sentencing, deterrence of such conduct on the part of others is a desired goal since public has right to be protected against crimes threatening high social and personal injury. Id., 452. Defendant received a higher penalty than his codefendant though tried on a lesser charge, sentence held proper. Id., 455. Defendant charged as second offender; fact that all who might have been presented as second offenders have not been so presented cannot aid defendant. Id., 457. Defendant convicted of manslaughter; in view of circumstances of the killing, defendant's inclination to violence as shown by his criminal record and his knowledge, when he pleaded guilty, of what sentence would be recommended, his sentence held proper. Id., 461. Under uniform state narcotic drug act, conviction of defendant as second offender made compulsory minimum imprisonment term of 10 years, once court deemed confinement was required, and defendant's claim that this amounts to a life sentence because of his age is a request based on considerations of clemency and more properly addressed to the board of pardons. Id., 463. Court's objective to impose a maximum sentence which would ensure that defendant would be under jurisdiction of parole board for the rest of his life could be accomplished with a lesser sentence, so sentence modified accordingly. Id., 468. Mere fact that defendant received a higher sentence than his codefendant affords no sound basis of comparison without the consideration of other pertinent surrounding circumstances. Id., 468, 474. The stress is not alone upon the criminal act but upon make-up of the offender and chances of his reform. Id., 474. Because the trial judge has opportunity to weigh and consider factors personal to defendant in connection with evidence, his opinion as to appropriateness of a sentence deserves great weight. Id., 477. Sentence increased where defendant was second offender and his sentence was less than that given for first offense. Id., 480. Matters which are administrative in nature are not reviewable by review division. 22 CS 208. Trial court's refusal to appoint new counsel in place of public defender was not matter with which review division could concern itself; function limited to harshness of sentence. 25 CS 3.

Division not empowered to comply with request of person convicted of violating narcotics act to send him to Kentucky hospital. Id., 7. Defendant's war record, being recited in presentence report, was before court at time of sentencing and cannot now be used to mitigate sentence. Id., 55. All factors must be weighed in reviewing sentences, not just those favorable to defendant. Id., 57. Sentence increased where robberies were vicious and no consideration for victims was shown. Id., 68. Sentence reduction denied where defendant had some knowledge of what is proper in law and order and chose to assume control on his own. Id., 73. Division not empowered to transfer prisoner from jail to a place where he could receive psychiatric help. Id., 145. Cited. Id., 149; Id., 473, 474, 484; 26 CS 176. Where defendant sentenced as second offender asked review division to reduce his maximum term on ground that parole board had denied him parole, held it is not function of division thus to pass on actions of parole board. Id., 196. Where minor defendant was committed to reformatory for indefinite term for crime for which adult could be confined only 30 days, sentence too severe. Id., 506. Where maximum sentence that could have been imposed would be aggregate of 120 days except for reformatory commitment, sentence of not more than 2 years without possibility of parole for 9 months too severe. 27 CS 81. Where, if court had imposed maximum penalty on all charges, result would be substantial fine and sentence in excess of 2 years and in view of defendant's presentence behavior, commitment to reformatory for not more than 2 years with basic minimum of 9 months on good behavior fair and should stand. Id., 89. Where minor defendant committed to reformatory to be detained not more than 2 years was witness for state and helped state obtain a conviction and had been unable to post bond, being jailed over 3 months prior to conviction, sentence too severe. Id., 100. Evidence of reform after conviction outside scope of division's consideration. Id., 221. Unnecessary for division to find facts and interpret statutes to determine its jurisdiction to modify sentence to comply with law limiting commitments to reformatory to males between 16 and 21 when matter not raised before division.
