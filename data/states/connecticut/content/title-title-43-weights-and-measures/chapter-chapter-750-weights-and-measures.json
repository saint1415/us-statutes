Said commissioner shall take charge of the standards adopted, under the provisions of section 43-2, as the standards of the state, and cause them to be kept in a fire-proof building belonging to the state, or in a suitable place in his office, from which they shall not be removed except for repairs or for certification, and he shall take all other necessary precautions for their safekeeping. He shall maintain the state standards in good order and shall provide for their certification as prescribed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology at least once in ten years. He shall, at least once in two years, test by the state standards all standard weights, measures and other apparatus which belong to any municipality and shall seal such apparatus as is found to be accurate, by stamping thereon, with seals kept for that purpose, the letter “C” and the last two figures of the year of certification. He shall have general supervision of the weights, measures and weighing and measuring devices sold, offered for sale or used in the state. He, or the inspectors by his direction, shall, at least once in each year, test all scales, weights and measures used in checking the receipt or disbursement of supplies in each institution for the maintenance of which moneys are appropriated by the General Assembly, and he shall maintain a record of his findings and make such record available to the supervisory board and to the executive officer of the institution concerned, and, at the request of such board or executive officer, he shall appoint, in writing, one or more employees, in the service of each institution, who shall act as special deputies for the purpose of checking the receipt or disbursement of supplies. He shall keep a complete record of the standards, balances and other apparatus belonging to the state, and take a receipt for the same from his successor in office. He, or the inspectors at his direction, shall, at least once in two years, inspect the work of the local sealers throughout the state and shall have power to inspect and ascertain the correctness of all weights, scales, beams, measures, instruments or mechanical devices for measuring, and tools, appliances or accessories connected with any such instruments or measures kept, offered or exposed for sale, sold, used or employed by any proprietor, agent, lessee or employee in proving the size, quantity, extent, area or measurement of quantities, things, produce or articles for distribution or consumption, offered or submitted by such person or persons for sale, hire or reward; and shall, from time to time, weigh or measure packages or amounts of commodities of any kind kept for the purpose of sale, offered for sale or sold, or in the process of delivery, in order to determine whether the same contain the amounts represented, and whether they are offered for sale or sold in accordance with law. They may, in the performance of their official duties, enter, without warrant, into or upon any stand, place, building or other premises, or stop any vendor, peddler, junk dealer or driver of any vehicle transporting or containing coal, coke, ice or other commodity, or any dealer, and require him to proceed to some place which they may specify, for the purpose of making tests. Said commissioner or the inspectors may seal any such weighing or measuring instrument or apparatus which is found to be correct and may seize and destroy any incorrect weight, measure or weighing or measuring instrument. The commissioner shall issue, from time to time, regulations prescribing specifications and tolerances for commercial weights and measures and weighing and measuring devices and regulations for the guidance of municipal sealers, which regulations shall govern the procedure to be followed by such officers in the discharge of their duties. The commissioner may by regulation exempt specific duties and restrict specific powers of the municipal sealers appointed under the provisions of section 43-6 thereby reserving exclusively to the commissioner within the municipality the duties exempted and powers restricted. The commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, prescribing fees to be charged for any calibration services performed by the Department of Consumer Protection, provided no fee shall be charged for services provided in accordance with the provisions of section 43-50 for those registrants residing in and having a place of business in this state.
