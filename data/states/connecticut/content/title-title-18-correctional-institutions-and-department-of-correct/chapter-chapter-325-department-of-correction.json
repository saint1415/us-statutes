Allocation of credit under section does not implicate fundamental right or burden a suspect class, and is rationally related to legitimate public purpose of ensuring that convicted offenders serve the full term of their sentences; respondent's allocation of pretrial confinement credit pursuant to section did not violate separation of powers doctrine; because legislature plays substantial role, in conjunction with the judiciary, in sentencing those convicted of criminal offenses, court could not conclude that statute, as applied by respondent, significantly interfered with judiciary's role in sentencing. 90 CA 460. Credits under section are only available to an individual committed to the custody of Commissioner of Correction and not to a person committed to any other authority, including a juvenile committed to Commissioner of Children and Families. 136 CA 373. The commissioner, rather than the sentencing court, is the proper authority to determine eligibility for presentence confinement credit and to apply such credit against a defendant's sentence after the sentence is imposed. 217 CA 453.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nMunicipal police department is neither a community correctional center nor a correctional institution. 258 C. 394. When concurrent sentences are imposed on different dates, presentence confinement days accrued simultaneously on more than one docket are utilized fully on the date they are applied to first sentence; hence, they cannot be counted a second time to accelerate discharge date of any subsequent sentence without violating language of Subdiv. (1)(A). 271 C. 808. Section clearly requires that in order for petitioner to receive jail credit, he must request the credit from the sentencing court at the time of sentencing, and such timely request is thus a condition precedent to the court's ability to grant the credit. 294 C. 165.\n\nCourt reiterated holding that each day of presentence confinement, regardless of the number of informations under which such confinement accrues, should be counted only once and credited to only one day of sentenced confinement. 80 CA 574. Each day of presentence confinement, regardless of the number of informations under which such confinement accrues, should be counted once and credited to only one day of sentenced confinement. Id., 580. Petitioner cannot earn presentence confinement credit while serving sentence. 83 CA 77. Pretrial confinement credit shall be used only once. 94 CA 283. Recalculation of petitioner's presentence confinement credit in wake ofHarris v. Commissioner of Correctiondid not violate petitioner's right to equal protection, constitute an ex post facto violation or violate the separation of powers doctrine. 104 CA 793.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\n“One continuous term” language of Sec. 18-7 is applicable to presentence good time credit earned under Subsec. and presentence good time credits earned on one sentence may be credited toward a subsequent, controlling concurrent sentence. 254 C. 214.\n\nSubsec. (c):\n\nCommissioner of Correction is proper authority to ensure defendant receives all presentence confinement credit due. 218 CA 302.",

If an inmate has not earned sufficient risk reduction credit at the time the commissioner or the commissioner's designee orders the loss of all or a portion of earned credit, such loss shall be deducted from any credit earned by such inmate in the future.\n\n(c) The award of risk reduction credit earned for conduct occurring prior to July 1, 2011, shall be phased in consistent with public safety, risk reduction, administrative purposes and sound correctional practice, at the discretion of the commissioner, but shall be completed not later than July 1, 2012.\n\n(d) Any credit earned under this section may only be earned during the period of time that the inmate is sentenced to a term of imprisonment and committed to the custody of the commissioner and may not be transferred or applied to a subsequent term of imprisonment. In no event shall any credit earned under this section be applied by the commissioner so as to reduce a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment such inmate is required to serve by statute.\n\n(e) Prior to release of any inmate whose sentence is being reduced due to risk reduction credits earned pursuant to this section, the commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall review such inmate's records and verify that the inmate earned the risk reduction credits being applied to reduce such inmate's sentence.\n\n(f) The commissioner shall adopt policies and procedures to determine the amount of credit an inmate may earn toward a reduction in his or her sentence and to phase in the awarding of retroactive credit authorized by subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(P.A. 11-51, S. 22; P.A. 15-216, S. 9; P.A. 18-155, S. 3.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 11-51 effective July 1, 2011; P.A. 15-216 amended Subsec.

(e) by replacing “warden of the correctional facility from which such inmate is to be released” with “commissioner or the commissioner's designee”.\n\nSection is plain and unambiguous and shows that the legislature intended for only sentenced inmates to be eligible to earn risk reduction earned credits. 175 CA 460. An inmate has no liberty interest in risk reduction credits, as commissioner has broad discretion to implement the program. 184 CA 76.",
