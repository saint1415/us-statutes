He shall also keep a record of any punishment inflicted upon a prisoner, showing its cause, mode and degree, and a like record of the conduct of each prisoner. Any prisoner sentenced to a term of imprisonment prior to October 1, 1976, may, by good conduct and obedience to the rules of said institution, earn a commutation or diminution of his sentence, as follows: Sixty days for each year, and pro rata for a part of a year, of a sentence which is not for more than five years; and ninety days for the sixth and each subsequent year, and pro rata for a part of a year, and, in addition thereto, five days for each month as a meritorious time service award which may be granted in the discretion of the warden and the commissioner for exemplary conduct and meritorious achievement; provided any serious act of misconduct or insubordination or persistent refusal to conform to institution regulations occurring at any time during his confinement in said prison shall subject the prisoner, at the discretion of the warden and the commissioner, to the loss of all or any portion of the time earned. Said commutation of sentence shall apply to any prisoner transferred from the Connecticut Correctional Institution, Somers, to the John R. Manson Youth Institution, Cheshire. When any prisoner is held under more than one conviction, the several terms of imprisonment imposed thereunder shall be construed as one continuous term for the purpose of estimating the amount of commutation which he may earn under the provisions of this section. The commissioner may employ prisoners outside the institution walls, within the state, under the charge of some officer of the institution. He shall provide for the prisoners suitable food and clothing and suitable implements and materials for their work, and shall provide for the relief of any sick or infirm prisoner, and the cost thereof shall be paid by the state from funds appropriated and available for such purpose and, if the prisoner is hospitalized the cost thereof shall be paid as provided in section 18-52a. The warden shall superintend the labor and conduct of the prisoners, and, when requested, shall communicate to the commissioner any information in his knowledge respecting the prison.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 3002; 1957, P.A. 225, S. 1; 1959, P.A. 107; 1963, P.A. 28, S. 2; 1967, P.A. 152, S. 29; 1969, P.A. 463, S. 1; P.A. 76-358, S. 1; P.A. 86-186, S. 10; P.A. 97-245, S. 2.)\n\nHistory: 1959 act stipulated serious act of misconduct may cause loss of time earned; 1963 act deleted provision for five-day commutation or diminution of sentence for each month prisoner is employed on farm connected with prison; 1967 act substituted “State Prison” for “prison” and changed references to board of directors to commissioner of correction, gave discretionary powers to warden for commutation or diminution of sentence for exemplary conduct and meritorious achievement and gave the authority of the warden to employ prisoners outside prison walls to the commissioner; 1969 act deleted references to terms of not more than one year; P.A. 76-358 made provisions applicable to terms of sentence made before October 1, 1976; P.A. 86-186 changed the name of the Connecticut Correctional Institution, Cheshire to the John R.

Statute requires aggregation of petitioner's multiple sentences for the purpose of calculating good time credits whenever a prisoner is held under more than one conviction and does not require continuous confinement as a prerequisite to aggregation, thus break in confinement due to petitioner's escape from furlough does not change fact that petitioner was held under more than one conviction once he was sentenced on the felony murder conviction. 94 CA 210.\n\nCharacter of prisoner's right to earn good time is that of a privilege and not a vested right. 11 CS 281.

In the case of an indeterminate sentence, such credit shall apply to both the minimum and maximum term. In the case of an indefinite sentence, such credit shall apply to the maximum term only. Any act of misconduct or refusal to obey the rules which have been established for the service of his sentence shall subject the prisoner to the loss of all or any portion of such credit by the commissioner or his designee.\n\n(b) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, any person sentenced to a term of imprisonment for an offense committed on or after July 1, 1981, may, while held in default of bond or while serving such sentence, by good conduct and obedience to the rules which have been established for the service of his sentence, earn a reduction of his sentence in the amount of ten days for each month and pro rata for a part of a month of a sentence up to five years, and twelve days for each month and pro rata for a part of a month for the sixth and each subsequent year of a sentence which is more than five years. Misconduct or refusal to obey the rules which have been established for the service of his sentence shall subject the prisoner to the loss of all or any portion of such reduction by the commissioner or his designee.\n\n(c) Any person sentenced to a term of imprisonment for an offense committed on or after July 1, 1983, may, while held in default of bond or while serving such sentence, by good conduct and obedience to the rules which have been established for the service of his sentence, earn a reduction of his sentence as such sentence is served in the amount of ten days for each month served and pro rata for a part of a month served of a sentence up to five years, and twelve days for each month served and pro rata for a part of a month served for the sixth and each subsequent year of a sentence which is more than five years. Misconduct or refusal to obey the rules which have been established for the service of his sentence shall subject the prisoner to the loss of all or any portion of such reduction by the commissioner or his designee. In the event a prisoner has not yet earned sufficient good time to satisfy the good time loss, such lost good time shall be deducted from any good time earned in the future by such prisoner.\n\n(P.A. 76-358, S. 2; P.A. 80-442, S. 1, 28; P.A. 82-379, S. 1, 2; P.A. 97-169; P.A. 15-14, S. 4.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 80-442 added Subsec.

Commissioner may promulgate rules that make an inmate ineligible to earn statutory good time. 50 CA 421. Good time credit received under section must be interpreted as credit earned in the year it should have been given and in this case, adjustment of respondent's time was not a retroactive adjustment, but rather a correction. 86 CA 777. Habeas court found to have improperly determined that petitioner was not eligible for good time credits; court's interpretation of good time statutes has the potential of burdening defendant in such a manner so as to conclude that the statutes are penal in nature; in resolving a latent ambiguity as to whether defendant was eligible for good time credits, the rule of lenity applied. 101 CA 52. Viewed within context of section, the phrase “term of imprisonment” is susceptible only to one reasonable interpretation, which is that it should be afforded its customary and primary meaning, describing the physical confinement of a person in a correctional facility; there is no basis in law or logic to conclude that it describes or encompasses time spent on probation. 105 CA 210. Subsec. contains no language providing that good time credit earned under Subsec. operates to reduce a person's parole eligibility date, and there is no language in Subsec. to suggest that legislature intended that a person's sentence, after it has been reduced by the application of good time credit, should serve as the sentence that is used to calculate his parole eligibility date under Sec. 54-125a(f). 199 CA 575.",
