Prior to 1972 amendment, circuit court could commit wayward girls for indeterminate 3 years, Sec. 54-1a did not limit its jurisdiction under this section; holding that imposition of up to 3 year terms for criminal convictions was unconstitutional as discriminatory affected only that part of section relating to commitments for crime. 159 C. 150.\n\nOn habeas corpus petition, sentence of 3 years under statute for violation of Sec. 53-174 imposed by circuit court modified to term permitted under said section as term imposed exceeded statutory punishment for breach of peace and the jurisdiction of circuit court. 28 CS 9. Commitment of plaintiff by circuit court for possible 3 year maximum sentence is invalid only as to that portion which exceeded 1 year limit of court's jurisdiction. Id., 424. Court may not fix the term of a commitment to Niantic Correctional Institution. 31 CS 350.\n\nCited. 4 Conn. Cir. Ct. 206.",

The licensed health care provider shall inform the inmate of any necessary medical tests associated with the pregnancy assessment prior to the administration of such tests.\n\n(c) The York Correctional Institution shall provide each inmate who is pregnant with: (1) Counseling and written material, in a form that may be reasonably understood, concerning (A) the inmate's options with regard to her pregnancy, (B) prenatal nutrition, (C) maintaining a healthy pregnancy, (D) labor and delivery, (E) the postpartum period, (F) the institution's policies and practices regarding the care of an inmate during pregnancy, labor and delivery and the postpartum period, and (G) restrictions on the use of restraints on pregnant inmates, (2) medical care at the correctional institution, which shall include, but not be limited to: (A) Periodic health monitoring and evaluation during pregnancy, and (B) prenatal vitamins or supplements, as deemed necessary by a licensed health care provider, (3) a diet containing the nutrients necessary to maintain a healthy pregnancy, as determined by a licensed health care provider trained in prenatal care, (4) the clothing, undergarments and sanitary materials deemed appropriate by a licensed health care provider who has been trained in prenatal and postpartum medical care, (5) the opportunity for a minimum of one hour of ambulatory movement every day, and (6) access to treatment for postpartum depression by a qualified mental health professional, provided such treatment is deemed necessary by a licensed health care provider who has been trained in postpartum medical care.

The written material provided to an inmate pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be known as the “Pregnant Woman's Guide”.\n\n(d) Except as provided in this subsection, correctional staff of the York Correctional Institution shall not use any leg or waist restraint on any inmate of the institution who is known to be pregnant or in the postpartum period.

If a correction officer is present with the inmate during any stage of labor or delivery, such correction officer shall be female, if possible. Such correction officer shall be positioned in a location that ensures the inmate's privacy, to the extent possible.\n\n(f) Any inmate in the postpartum period shall be assessed by a licensed health care provider upon return to the correctional institution. Each inmate in the postpartum period shall be housed in a medical or mental health housing unit at the correctional institution until discharged by a licensed health care provider.\n\n(g) The York Correctional Institution shall provide a pregnant inmate, prior to the inmate's release, with counseling and discharge planning to ensure, to the extent feasible, the continuity of prenatal and pregnancy-related care, including substance abuse programs and treatment referrals when deemed appropriate.\n\n(P.A. 18-4, S. 1.)",
