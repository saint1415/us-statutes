      "text": "It is found and declared that there exists in the state and will exist in the future a serious shortage of housing for low and moderate income families and persons; that this shortage has contributed and will contribute to the persistence of slums and blight and will tend to perpetuate the concentration of families and persons of low and moderate income in the older urban areas of the state; and that this shortage has been a major contributing factor to the deterioration in the quality of environment and living conditions of large numbers of the citizens of Connecticut. It is further found and declared that it is imperative that the cost of mortgage financing, a major factor materially affecting the supply and cost of housing, be made lower in order to encourage the development and reduce the cost of housing for low and moderate income families and persons, that the supply of housing for families and persons displaced by public action or disaster be increased, and that private enterprise and public agencies be encouraged and assisted to build and rehabilitate well planned, well designed housing which will be made available to house families and persons of low and moderate income and will prevent the recurrence of slums and blight. It is further found and declared that there exists a serious lack of construction and permanent financing for housing proposed to be constructed, rehabilitated, purchased and refinanced pursuant to government-insured mortgage programs and with government subsidies for low and moderate income families and persons, and that this lack of construction and permanent financing will severely limit the growth in the supply of housing for such families and persons. It is further found and declared that there exists a serious shortage of low interest rate financing available to low and moderate income families and persons for the purchase or rehabilitation of existing dwelling units. It is therefore found and declared that providing state financial assistance for housing for low and moderate income families and persons through the making and purchase of mortgages on such housing located in this state and the undertaking of the other financing arrangements set forth in this chapter to meet the aforesaid needs and achieve the foregoing objectives, including mortgage loans to families and persons of low and moderate income for the purchase of existing dwelling units, are public purposes and purposes for which public money may be expended for the public benefit and good. It is further found and declared that in order to provide housing for families and persons of lower income than the Connecticut Housing Financing Authority can presently assist, it shall be a public purpose of the authority to invest a portion of its funds in mortgage or mortgage-backed securities at the maximum yield obtainable and to apply the income from such investments to reduce the interest rate charged on housing for low and moderate income persons and families and other mortgagees. It is further found and declared that municipalities in the state with a population in excess of seventy-five thousand or with population densities of three thousand five hundred per square mile of physically accessible land area as determined by or predicated upon the 1970 United States Census have, owing to their large size and long establishment as urban areas, urban problems that are not as pervasive nor of similar magnitude in municipalities of a smaller size and that this fact justifies limiting the provisions of subsection (34) of section 8-250, subsection (b) of section 8-251 and subdivision (4) of subsection (a) of section 8-258 to those municipalities of a population hereinbefore stated. It is further found and declared that there exists in such urban areas a critical and growing need to maintain and to encourage a proper balance of housing, industrial, commercial and community and recreational facilities and to restore urban areas as desirable places for persons of all income levels to live, work, shop and enjoy the amenities of town living and meeting, traditional to the state. It is recognized that a sufficient number of attractive sites for housing exist in the state elsewhere than in urban areas, that, during certain periods in recent times, private mortgage financing at acceptable rates has been and may continue to be more readily available elsewhere than in urban areas and that the superficial economics of housing elsewhere than in urban areas has been and will continue to be an incentive for citizens of the state to abandon their homes in urban areas or continue to live elsewhere; however, it is found and declared that the state has a major investment in insuring that urban areas do not further deteriorate because the cost (1) of accommodating continued development elsewhere than in urban areas, in terms of additional fire protection, sewer, water, education and energy requirements, of additional construction and maintenance of highways and transportation facilities, of the additional destruction of natural areas of the state, of the additional administrative and governmental requirements that result as underdeveloped areas grow in population and of such other similar public improvements and services that government is required to finance as a result thereof and (2) of redeveloping the urban areas, of the inefficient and underuse of the public facilities and services presently available in the urban areas and of the increased expense of providing safety for persons continuing to reside in deteriorating areas, is and will continue to be an undue burden on the state, adversely affecting the health, welfare, safety and general prosperity of the citizens of the state. It is further recognized that since the late nineteen-forties providing housing for low and moderate income persons and the redevelopment of urban areas has been the subject matter of government action and assistance in this state and that such action and assistance must continue; however, experience has shown that balanced community development has the best chance of improving the urban areas and that the proliferation of suburban sprawl is detrimental to the state, to its natural resources and to all of its inhabitants. It is further recognized that the conditions in certain parts of urban areas have caused the mortgage lenders to refuse to risk their capital on attractive housing even to persons able to afford such housing without assistance. It is further found, as more particularly set forth in the plan of conservation and development for Connecticut that the declared policy of the state is to discourage the development of areas which remain in their natural state and to encourage the further development and revitalization of the other areas of the state. It is therefore found and declared that in order to encourage the development of a balanced community of all income levels in the urban areas it is necessary and appropriate that mortgage financing for construction, reconstruction, purchase and refinancing of housing in urban areas for all levels of income more readily be made available. It is further found and declared that the erosion in the value of one, two or three-family homes due to the decline of economic conditions in the state has precluded the refinancing of mortgages on such property in a manner that could increase homeowner disposable income and contribute to the general economic recovery of the state and that it is beneficial and in the public interest that the state extend mortgage guarantees to mortgage lending institutions to provide refinancing mortgage loans when the decline of home values has precluded such lending. It is further found that energy costs of operating residential buildings have increased greatly in recent years creating a severe economic burden for families and persons of low and moderate income and making it difficult for such persons to afford basic housing needs; and that it is highly probable such energy costs will continue to increase rapidly in the future. It is therefore found and declared to be in the public interest and for the public benefit and good to protect Connecticut residents from further increases in energy costs by providing state financial assistance for the purchase, construction and installation in new and existing buildings of energy conservation measures and renewable energy systems providing space heating or cooling, domestic hot water, electricity or other useful energy. To achieve such purposes for the foregoing reasons, the General Assembly determines that the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority should be provided with the additional powers set forth in subsections (34) and (36) of section 8-250, subsection (b) of section 8-251 and subdivision (4) of subsection (a) of section 8-258 and that the expenditure of public moneys therefor constitutes a serving of a needed public purpose and is in the public interest. It is further found and declared that there continues to exist in the state and will exist in the future a serious shortage of housing; that federal programs providing subsidies for housing of low and moderate income persons and families are being curtailed or eliminated; that federal legislation has limited and restricted the ability of the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority to issue obligations, the interest on which is exempt from federal income taxation, to finance housing for low and moderate income persons and families and in urban areas; that it is imperative for the state to continue to create and maintain a climate conducive to attract investment in multifamily housing in the state and that the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority has demonstrated its capability for raising funds for such purpose. To achieve the purpose of continuing to attract such investment and to continue housing finance programs for shelter for its inhabitants, the General Assembly determines that the issuance of the obligations authorized pursuant to subsection (o) of section 8-252 and the expenditure of the proceeds thereof constitutes a serving of a needed public purpose and is in the public interest. It is further found and declared that the high cost of housing in the state, relative to the cost of housing in other states, is a significant impediment to the promotion and maintenance of economic development in the state and it is imperative that such competitive disadvantage be moderated to the extent possible through employer-assisted housing efforts or other means.\n\n(1969, P.A. 795, S. 2; 1972, P.A. 208, S. 1; P.A. 74-104, S. 1, 12; P.A. 75-465, S. 1, 7; P.A. 76-13, S. 1, 7; 76-118, S. 1, 6; 76-435, S. 18, 82; P.A. 79-578, S. 1, 3; P.A. 82-393, S. 1, 3; P.A. 83-587, S. 9, 96; P.A. 93-248, S. 1; 93-308, S. 1, 12; 93-435, S. 94, 95; P.A. 96-180, S. 9, 166.)\n\nHistory: 1972 act expanded policy statement to provide for lowering cost of mortgage financing and for encouragement of construction of housing units for low and moderate-income families; P.A. 74-104 added specific provision concerning low interest rate financing for purchase of existing dwellings; P.A. 75-465 added provision for use of investment income to finance housing for those “of lower income than the Connecticut housing finance authority can presently assist”; P.A. 76-13 included financing for rehabilitation of existing dwelling units; P.A. 76-118 greatly expanded section to include provisions specifically relating to urban municipalities; P.A. 76-435 made technical changes; P.A. 79-578 added provisions concerning financial assistance for energy conservation measures; P.A. 82-393 added language concerning the issuance of taxable obligations; P.A. 83-587 made technical changes; P.A. 93-248 added specific provision concerning employer-assisted housing; P.A. 93-308 added provision re residential mortgage refinancing guarantees, effective July 1, 1993; P.A. 93-435 changed effective date of P.A. 93-308 from July 1, 1993, to June 9, 1993, effective June 28, 1993; P.A. 96-180 made technical changes in references to Sec. 8-258, effective June 3, 1996.\n\nBroad provisions of statute cannot be interpreted to eliminate authority under Sec. 8-253a(1) to grant or withhold consent to prepayment of loan because an affordable housing developer may obtain a more favorable mortgage rate from a private lender. 281 C. 277.",

Each such subsidiary is authorized to assume or take title to housing subject to any existing mortgage and to mortgage, convey or dispose of its assets and pledge its revenues in order to secure any borrowing, for the purpose of refinancing, rehabilitating or improving its assets, provided each such borrowing or mortgage shall be a special obligation of the subsidiary, which obligation may be in the form of bonds, bond anticipation notes and other obligations to the extent permitted under this chapter, to fund and refund the same and provide for the rights of holders thereof, and to secure the same by pledge of revenues, notes and mortgages of others, and which shall be payable solely from the assets, revenues and other resources of the subsidiary and provided further no such mortgage, borrowing or pledge of security eliminates requirements relating to housing that preserve housing for persons and families of low and moderate income without the express written consent of the authority. Such borrowing shall be in accordance with subsections (b) to (m), inclusive, of section 8-252, provided no such subsidiary shall be entitled to borrow for any purpose except with respect to property transferred to such subsidiary by the authority specified in subsection (a) of said section 8-252.\n\n(2) Each subsidiary shall have a board of directors and at least one-half of the board of directors of each subsidiary shall be members of the board of directors of the authority, or their designees or officers or employees of the authority.

Except as otherwise provided in this section, the issuance of such bonds shall be governed by the provisions of section 8-252. Such bonds may be guaranteed by the authority, which guarantee may be a general obligation of the authority. Such bonds whether or not a general obligation of the authority may be secured by revenues or other assets of the authority which are not subject to the lien of the general housing mortgage program bond resolution of the authority adopted September 27, 1972, as amended, or subject to a lien created by any other existing bond resolution of the authority. The state, acting through the State Treasurer, is authorized to pledge such principal and interest payments and other revenues, and to make such agreements, covenants and representations as may be required for issuance of the bonds. The provisions of subdivision (2) of section 32-1l shall not apply to any pledge under this section, nor to any transfer of revenues to the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority or to a trustee incident to the issuance of bonds under this section, but such a pledge or transfer of revenues from bond-financed state housing programs, as defined in section 8-37qq, to the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority or to a trustee incident to the issuance of bonds under this section is hereby authorized.

The proceeds of any bonds issued pursuant to this section shall, after payment of all costs of issuance and sale, including, without limitation, the costs of credit facilities and the establishment of any reserves as security for such bonds, be deposited in the General Fund.\n\n(b) In the event that the total of principal and interest payments and other revenues pledged to any trustee in accordance with a pledge made pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and received in any fiscal year are less than the total of all interest and principal payments and other revenues on loans under any bond-financed housing program as defined in section 8-37qq by the state in that same fiscal year, the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management shall apportion any payments to be transferred to such trustee under such pledge among payments that would otherwise have flowed to the General Fund, the Rental Housing Fund or the Housing Repayment and Revolving Loan Fund and may, on behalf of the state, make such agreements, covenants and representations with respect to such apportionment as may be required for issuance of the bonds under this section. In the event that principal and interest payments or other revenues pledged pursuant to subsection (a) of this section are transferred in any fiscal year to any trustee in excess of total debt service payments required in such fiscal year under the terms of any indenture of trust for bonds issued under this section the balance shall be returned to the state. Such returned balance shall be apportioned among the General Fund, the Rental Housing Fund or the Housing Repayment and Revolving Loan Fund, as determined by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management provided, any such returned balance shall first be apportioned to the Housing Repayment and Revolving Loan Fund, up to the amount which would otherwise have flowed to the Housing Repayment and Revolving Loan Fund in such fiscal year absent such pledge under this section.\n\n(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize (1) the use of moneys in any sinking fund which may have been pledged by resolution or trust indenture in connection with the issuance of any general obligation bonds, as to which sinking fund the state did not reserve the right to application and use of such moneys for other purposes, (2) the pledge of moneys, any apportionment of payments or returned balances in subsection (b) of this section that the State Treasurer determines to have been precluded by any covenant or agreement with bondholders on any outstanding general obligation bonds of the state, or (3) the pledge of certain loan payments or revenue if it is determined by the State Treasurer that the tax-exempt status of any outstanding general obligation bonds of the state shall be jeopardized by the pledge of such payments or revenues.\n\n(P.A. 97-309, S. 11, 23; 97-322, S. 7, 9; P.A. 13-234, S. 66.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 97-309 effective July 1, 1997; P.A. 97-322 changed effective date of P.A. 97-309 but without affecting this section; P.A. 13-234 amended Subsec.

Mortgage loans made or insured by the authority under this chapter may be for construction financing as well as permanent financing, and may provide financing for related facilities to the extent permitted by applicable authority regulations. Mortgage loans made or insured by the authority under this chapter shall be secured by a first or second mortgage. The aggregate principal amount of all mortgages so insured by the authority under this chapter and outstanding at any one time shall not exceed ten times the average annual balance for the preceding calendar year of funds on deposit in the Housing Mortgage Insurance Fund. The aggregate amount of principal obligations of all mortgages so insured shall not constitute indebtedness of the state of Connecticut. Any contract of insurance executed by the authority under this section shall be conclusive evidence of eligibility for such mortgage insurance and the validity of any contract of insurance so executed or of an advance commitment to issue such shall be incontestable in the hands of an approved mortgagee from the date of execution of such contract or commitment, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such approved mortgagee and, as to commitments to insure, noncompliance with the terms of the advance commitment or authority regulations in force at the time of issuance of the advance commitment.\n\n(b) For mortgage payments to be eligible for insurance under the provisions of this chapter, the underlying mortgage shall be one which is made to and held by a mortgagee approved by the authority as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly. Permanent mortgage loans made or insured by the authority under the provisions of this chapter shall: (1) Not exceed (i) ninety per cent of the estimated cost of such proposed housing if owned or to be owned by a profit-making mortgagor or (ii) one hundred per cent of the estimated cost of such proposed housing if owned or to be owned by a housing authority, a municipal developer, a nonprofit corporation or cooperative or by a resident-owner of a structure containing not more than three dwelling units, or of a condominium; (2) have a maturity satisfactory to the authority but in no case longer than fifty years from the date of the issuance of the loan or insurance; (3) contain amortization provisions satisfactory to the authority requiring periodic payments by the mortgagor not in excess of his reasonable ability to pay as determined by the authority; (4) be in such form and contain such terms and provisions with respect to maturity, property insurance, repairs, alterations, payment of taxes and assessments, default reserves, delinquency charges, default remedies, anticipation of maturity, additional and secondary liens, equitable and legal redemption rights and other matters as the authority may prescribe. If a loan made by the authority under this chapter is insured or if the project or any units therein are assisted by any department, agency or instrumentality of the United States or this state, and the terms of the mortgage insurance commitment or regulatory agreement covering such insurance or other assistance are inconsistent with the terms and conditions required by this section or established by the authority under this chapter, the terms of such mortgage insurance commitment or regulatory agreement shall prevail, to the extent of such inconsistency.\n\n(c) Construction mortgage loans made by the authority under the provisions of this chapter may be advanced at the discretion of the authority in installments as the work progresses, provided that the authority shall retain not more than ten per cent of the construction contract price until the construction or rehabilitation has been inspected and found by the authority to be more than ninety per cent completed. Thereafter such retention or any part thereof may be either advanced at the discretion of the authority or retained until the authority shall determine that the mortgagor has complied with all of the terms and conditions of subsection (b) of section 8-253 and section 8-253a. The total of all advances made, after any adjustment under subdivision (6) of section 8-253a, shall not exceed (i) ninety per cent of the project cost if owned or to be owned by a profit making mortgagor or (ii) one hundred per cent of the project cost if owned or to be owned by a housing authority, a municipal developer or a nonprofit corporation or cooperative.\n\n(1969, P.A. 795, S. 13; 1971, P.A. 840, S. 2; 1972, P.A. 208, S. 7; P.A. 74-104, S. 10, 12; P.A. 77-316, S. 7; P.A. 87-436, S. 18, 23.)\n\nHistory: 1971 act replaced requirement that aggregate amount of mortgages not exceed “five times that portion of the bonds authorized by the state bond commission which when sold are to be deposited in the housing mortgage insurance fund ...” with requirement that amount not exceed “ten times the average annual balance for the preceding calendar year of funds on deposit” in said fund; 1972 act divided section into subsecs., allowed authority to make loans as well as insure them, allowed loans for construction and for related facilities as well as for permanent financing, allowed 100% financing for housing to be owned by housing authority or by resident-owner of structure with not more than three units rather than by resident-owner of single-family dwelling, changed maturity limit from 80% of remaining useful life of housing or 40 years to 50 years, added provision re conflicts between federal and state regulations and authority regulations and added Subsec.

      "text": "In addition to the terms and conditions set forth in section 8-253, loans made by the authority hereunder shall also be subject to the following terms and conditions:\n\n(1) A loan hereunder may be prepaid after a period of twenty years or sooner with the permission of the authority; provided, nonprofit mortgagors and mortgagors to whom loans are made on or after October 1, 1978, may prepay their loans prior to maturity only with the consent of the authority. The authority shall grant such consent if it finds (A) that it may reasonably be expected that the prepayment of the loan will not result in a material escalation of rents charged to occupants of the project; and (B) that the need for low and moderate income housing in the area concerned is no longer acute.\n\n(2) The interest rate on the loan shall be established by the authority at the lowest level consistent with the authority's cost of operation and its responsibilities to the holders of its bonds, bond anticipation notes and other obligations, except those loans made pursuant to subsection (32) of section 8-250.\n\n(3) The authority shall require the mortgagor or its contractor to post labor and materials and construction performance surety bonds, or enter into an escrow arrangement acceptable to the authority, in amounts related to the project cost as established by regulation, and to execute such other assurances and guarantees as the authority may deem necessary.\n\n(4) The loan shall be subject to an agreement between the authority and the mortgagor which will subject said mortgagor and its principals or stockholders to limitations established by the authority as to rentals, carrying charges, and other charges, profits and fees, and the disposition of its property and franchises to the extent more restrictive limitations are not provided in the law under which the mortgagor is incorporated or organized.\n\n(5) A loan to a mortgagor, other than a municipal developer or a nonprofit corporation having as one of its purposes the construction or rehabilitation of housing, shall be subject to an agreement between the authority and the mortgagor limiting the mortgagor, and its principals or stockholders, to such return on the mortgagor's equity in any project assisted with a loan from the authority as may be established or permitted by the authority. The mortgagor's equity in a project shall consist of the difference between the amount of the loan and the total project cost, whether or not such costs have been paid in cash or in a form other than cash. With respect to every project, the authority shall, pursuant to rules and regulations adopted by it, establish the mortgagor's equity after the acceptance as proper by the authority of the certification or other assurances of project cost from the mortgagor, provided in no case shall such figure ever be less than the mortgagor's original equity in such project.\n\n(6) No loan shall be executed, except a loan made to a municipal developer or a nonprofit corporation having as one of its purposes the construction or rehabilitation of housing, unless the mortgagor agrees (A) to certify upon completion of project construction or rehabilitation, subject to audit by the authority, either that the actual project cost as defined herein exceeded the amount of the loan proceeds by ten per cent or more, or the amount by which the loan proceeds exceed ninety per cent of total project cost, and (B) to pay forthwith to the authority, for application to reduction of principal of the loan, the amount, if any, of such excess loan proceeds, subject to audit and determination by the agency. No loan shall be made to a municipal developer or a nonprofit corporation unless such mortgagor agrees to certify the actual project cost upon completion of the project, and further agrees to pay forthwith to the authority, for application to reduction of the principal of the loan, the amount, if any, by which the proceeds of the loan exceed the certified project cost, subject to audit and determination by the authority. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the authority may accept, in lieu of any certification of project cost as provided herein, such other assurances of the said project cost, in any form or manner whatsoever, as will enable the authority to determine with reasonable accuracy the amount of said project cost.\n\n(7) As a condition of the loan, the authority shall have the power at all times during the construction and rehabilitation of a housing project and the operation thereof: (A) To enter upon and inspect without prior notice any project, including all parts thereof, for the purpose of investigating the physical and financial condition thereof, and its construction, rehabilitation, operation, management and maintenance, and to examine all books and records with respect to capitalization, income and other matters relating thereto and to make such charges as may be required to cover the cost of such inspections and examinations; (B) to order such alterations, changes or repairs as may be necessary to protect the security of its investment in a housing project or for the health, safety and welfare of the occupants thereof; (C) to order any managing agent, project manager or owner of a housing project to do such acts as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of all applicable laws and ordinances or any rule or regulation of the authority or the terms of any agreement concerning the said project or to refrain from doing any act in violation thereof and in this regard the authority shall be a proper party to file a complaint and to prosecute thereon for any violation of laws or ordinances as set forth herein; (D) to require the adoption and continuous use of uniform systems of accounts and records for a project and to require all owners or managers of same to file annual reports containing such information and verified in such manner as the authority shall require and to file at such times and on such forms as the authority may prescribe reports and answers to specific inquiries of the authority to determine the extent of compliance with any agreement, the terms of the loan, the provisions of this chapter and any other applicable law; and (E) to enforce, by court action if necessary, the terms and provisions of any agreement between the authority and the mortgagor as to schedules of rentals or carrying charges, aggregate family income limits as applied to applicants for housing or the occupants thereof, or any other limitation imposed upon the mortgagor as to financial structure, construction, operation, or disposition of the housing.\n\n(8) If, pursuant to subsection (29) of section 8-250, the authority appoints a majority of new directors to the board of directors of a mortgagor corporation, or appoints a new managing agent for an unincorporated association, the persons so appointed need not be stockholders or partners or meet other qualifications which may be prescribed by the articles of incorporation or other basic documents of organization or the bylaws of such mortgagor. In the absence of fraud or bad faith, the persons so appointed shall not be personally liable for the debts, obligations or liabilities of such mortgagor; and shall serve only for a period coexistent with the duration of the reasons for their appointment or until the authority is assured, in a manner satisfactory to it, that the need for such service no longer exists; and they shall serve as directors or managing agents for such compensation as the authority may determine and shall be entitled to be reimbursed for all necessary expenses incurred in the discharge of their duties as directors or managing agents of such mortgagor.\n\n(1972, P.A. 208, S. 8; P.A. 74-104, S. 11, 12; P.A. 75-465, S. 5, 7; P.A. 77-316, S. 6; P.A. 78-150; P.A. 81-472, S. 5, 159; P.A. 84-110, S. 1, 2; P.A. 87-436, S. 19, 23.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 74-104 replaced “and” in the phrase “having as one of its purposes the construction and rehabilitation of housing” with the word “or” in Subdiv.

(5) to replace 6% limit on investment return with “such a return ... as may be established or permitted by the authority” and replaced provision for establishment of equity at the time of final construction loan advance with provision that equity be established “after the acceptance as proper by the authority of the certification or other assurances of project cost from the mortgagor” and deleted Subdiv. (7) re reduction of rents when earned surplus exceeds 10%, renumbering subsequent Subdivs. accordingly; P.A. 78-150 allowed mortgagors receiving loans on and after October 1, 1978, to pay loans prior to maturity only with authority's consent; P.A. 81-472 made technical changes; P.A. 84-110 amended Subdiv. (5) to provide for variation in the mortgagor's equity; P.A. 87-436 added references to municipal developers in Subdivs. (5) and (6); (Revisor's note: In 1989 a reference in Subdiv. (2) to Subdiv. “(ff)” of Sec. 8-250 was changed editorially by the Revisors to Subdiv. “(32)” to conform with changes made to said section by the Revisors for consistency with customary statutory usage).\n\nSubdiv. (1):\n\nAuthorized authority, in the absence of facts requiring authority's consent under section, to approve or deny consent for prepayment of loans made under chapter and is consistent with its broad provisions. 281 C. 227. Legislature gave authority sole discretion to determine whether mortgagor met requirements necessary to receive consent to prepay mortgage, and authority properly determined that “the area concerned”, for purposes of apartment building in Middletown, was the Hartford metropolitan statistical area. 294 C. 639.",

All moneys held in the Housing Mortgage Capital Reserve Fund, except as hereinafter provided, shall be used for the payment of the principal and interest of any bonds or notes issued by the authority, as such payment shall become due and for the retirement of bonds upon maturity and when due. In addition, moneys from the fund may be used to retire bonds before maturity and to pay any redemption premium required to be paid, provided no moneys shall be utilized in any year to retire bonds before maturity if the consequence thereof is to reduce the fund below an amount of moneys sufficient to meet the maximum payments required in the succeeding calendar year for payment of principal and interest falling due on all other outstanding bonds and retiring all other bonds required by their terms to be retired, such amount being hereafter referred to as the “required minimum capital reserve”. Income or interest from the investment of moneys held in the fund shall be retained therein if needed to meet any deficiencies in the required minimum capital reserve but, to the extent of any excess over the aforesaid required minimum capital reserve, moneys may be transferred by the authority to any other fund or account of the authority. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this chapter, no bonds shall be issued by the authority unless there is in the fund the required minimum capital reserve for all bonds issued and to be issued, provided nothing shall preclude the authority from satisfying the foregoing requirement by depositing so much of the proceeds of the bonds to be issued, upon their issuance as is needed for the fund to achieve the required minimum capital reserve. On or before December first of each year, there is deemed to be appropriated from the state General Fund such sums, if any, as shall be certified by the chairman of the authority, to the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, as necessary to restore said fund to an amount equal to the required minimum capital reserve, and such amounts shall be allotted and paid to the authority. Such amounts, if any, shall be repaid to the state and credited to the General Fund, subject to the provisions of section 8-261 and to any general resolution adopted prior to May 18, 1972, by the authority authorizing the issuance of bonds, as soon as possible, by the authority from any moneys available therefor and in excess of the amounts which the authority determines will keep it self-supporting. For purposes of valuation of the Housing Mortgage Capital Reserve Fund, securities acquired as an investment for said fund shall be valued at par, actual cost to the authority or market value, whichever value is less.\n\n(2) The authority may also establish one or more additional capital reserve funds in connection with the issuance of any bonds pursuant to a resolution other than its general housing mortgage program bond resolution adopted October 27, 1972. Any such capital reserve fund shall be established and maintained on the same terms and conditions as the Housing Mortgage Capital Reserve Fund, and amounts shall be deposited and maintained therein, expended therefrom and are hereby appropriated thereto in the same manner and with the same force and effect as is provided in subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of this section with respect to the Housing Mortgage Capital Reserve Fund, it being hereby expressly provided that the operation of any such capital reserve fund shall be identical to the operation of the Housing Mortgage Capital Reserve Fund, except as follows: When computing the amount on deposit in any such capital reserve fund, investments therein shall be valued at par, cost, amortized value or such other method as the authority determines to be reasonable and in the best interests of the state and the holders of the bonds entitled to the benefits thereof; and in calculating the required “minimum capital reserve” with respect to such capital reserve fund there shall be taken into account only those bonds of the authority secured by such capital reserve fund and in computing the “required minimum capital reserve” pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of this section, such bonds shall not be taken into account in determining the amount of outstanding and other bonds. The provisions of section 8-261 shall be applicable to this subdivision.\n\n(3) The Housing Mortgage General Fund shall consist of (A) all proceeds of the sale of bonds issued by the authority not required to be deposited in the Housing Mortgage Capital Reserve Fund by the terms of the resolution authorizing the sale of said bonds; (B) all moneys paid by the state of Connecticut for inclusion therein; (C) any moneys not allocated to any fund; (D) any moneys which the authority shall transfer from the Housing Mortgage Capital Reserve Fund pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of this section; and (E) any other moneys available to the authority which it determines to utilize for this purpose. To the extent available, after paying all operating costs of the authority except moneys required for the Housing Mortgage Capital Reserve Fund and the Housing Mortgage Insurance Fund, the moneys remaining in the General Fund may be used for the payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds issued by the authority or for such other corporate purposes of the authority as are authorized by this chapter.\n\n(4) The Housing Mortgage Insurance Fund shall consist of (A) all receipts of mortgage insurance premiums, (B) all money or other assets of whatever nature received by the authority as a result of loan defaults or delinquencies, including proceeds from the sale, lease or rental of real property, (C) all moneys lent or paid by the state for inclusion therein and (D) any other moneys available to the authority which it determines to include therein. From said funds shall be paid all payments required by loan defaults and all direct expenses and payments for the protection of the interest of the authority in connection with delinquent or defaulted insured mortgages or property acquired as a result thereof. Loans and advances may be made from said funds as provided by section 8-250.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, of subsection (a) of this section, the authority may establish accounts in the funds established under said subdivisions or such additional alternative or further funds and accounts thereof, which may include the proceeds of bonds, and may establish other capital reserve funds on the same terms and conditions and with the same force and effect resulting from the provisions of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of this section, except that securities acquired as an investment of any such fund shall be valued in such reasonable manner as the authority shall determine, all as may be, in its discretion, necessary and desirable to accomplish any purpose of the authority or to comply with the provisions of any agreement made by the authority or any resolution approved by the authority. The resolution establishing such a fund and accounts shall specify the source of moneys from which such funds or accounts shall be funded and the purposes for which moneys held in the funds and accounts shall be disbursed.\n\n(c) Moneys in any of the funds referred to in this section not needed to meet expenses may be invested in the manner provided in subsection (18) of section 8-250.\n\n(d) Subject to any agreement or agreements with holders of outstanding bonds, notes or other obligations, the authority may apply moneys in the Housing Mortgage Capital Reserve Fund, any additional capital reserve fund or the Housing Mortgage General Fund to purchase a financial guaranty or financial guaranties secured or unsecured as the authority may determine. For purposes of this section, financial guaranty means any letter of credit, surety bonds, insurance policy, guaranty or similar instrument issued by a bond or insurance company or other financial institution which provides for moneys to be available for the purposes to which and at the times by which moneys in each such fund may be required.\n\n(e) Secure instruments or contracts authorized under subsection (38) of section 8-250 in any manner in which the authority may secure its bonds, notes or other obligations under section 8-252, subject to any agreement or agreements with holders of outstanding bonds, notes or other obligations of the authority.\n\n(f) The State Treasurer is hereby authorized to issue a collateralized direct guarantee of the state of punctual payment thereof from the General Fund and carrying the full faith and credit pledge of the state for any investment of the authority or financial guarantee purchased by the authority to the extent such investment or financial guarantee has a rating equal to or better than that of the state provided the state is fully secured by a collateral assignment of such investment or financial guarantee and such investment or financial guarantee qualifies as an investment by the Short-Term Investment Fund under section 3-27a. The amount necessary to honor such state collateralized guarantee is hereby deemed appropriated from the General Fund and the Treasurer is authorized and directed to sell and collect on the security of the collateral so assigned and to pay such amount to the authority. Such state collateralized guarantee shall not constitute indebtedness of the state for the purposes of any debt limit of other statutory purpose and shall be only placed on any such investment or financial guarantee to permit the authority to maximize its investment opportunities and to meet its responsibilities under the requirements of its general housing mortgage finance program bond resolution adopted September 27, 1972, as amended, provided the State Treasurer determines that the collateral is at least sufficient to offset the full amount of the state guarantee. The State Treasurer shall be entitled to such supporting documents as necessary or appropriate from the authority prior to placing such collateralized guarantee on any such investment.\n\n(1969, P.A. 795, S. 18; 1972, P.A. 208, S. 13; P.A. 76-13, S. 5, 7; 76-118, S. 5, 6; P.A. 77-316, S. 5; 77-614, S. 19, 610; P.A. 79-631, S. 44, 111; P.A. 81-472, S. 6, 159; P.A. 93-33, S. 2, 4; 93-125, S. 2, 3; P.A. 96-180, S. 10, 166.)\n\nHistory: 1972 act added provision requiring repayment to general fund by authority of amounts taken from general fund to cover deficiencies in required minimum capital reserve in Subsec.

Such notice shall advise the homeowner of his delinquency or other default under the mortgage and shall state that the homeowner has sixty days from the date of such notice in which to (1) have a face-to-face meeting, telephone or other conference acceptable to the authority with the mortgagee or a face-to-face meeting with a consumer credit counseling agency to attempt to resolve the delinquency or default by restructuring the loan payment schedule or otherwise, and (2) contact the authority, at an address and phone number contained in the notice, to obtain information and apply for emergency mortgage assistance payments if the homeowner and mortgagee are unable to resolve the delinquency or default.\n\n(b) Except in cases in which the mortgagee refuses to meet with the homeowner, if the homeowner fails to meet with the mortgagee or comply with any of the time limitations specified in the notice as provided in subsection (a) of this section, or if the homeowner's application is not filed by the date thirty days after the date of any default in payment under an agreement as provided in subsection (c) of this section or if the homeowner's application for emergency mortgage assistance payments is not approved by the date thirty calendar days after the date of receipt of the homeowner's application in accordance with the provisions of section 8-265ff, the foreclosure of the homeowner's mortgage may, at any time thereafter, except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, continue without any further restriction or requirement under the provisions of sections 8-265cc to 8-265kk, inclusive, provided the mortgagee files an affidavit with the court stating the notice provisions of subsection (a) of this section have been complied with and that either the homeowner failed to meet with the mortgagee or failed to comply with all of the time limitations specified in the notice as provided in subsection (a) of this section or that the homeowner's application for emergency assistance payments was not approved by the date thirty calendar days after the date of receipt of the homeowner's application, or that a determination of ineligibility was made.\n\n(c) If, after a face-to-face meeting, telephone or other conference acceptable to the authority, as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the homeowner and the mortgagee reach an agreement to resolve the delinquency or default and, because of financial hardship due to circumstances beyond the homeowner's control, the homeowner is unable to fulfill the obligations of the agreement, the homeowner may apply to the authority for emergency mortgage assistance payments under sections 8-265cc to 8-265kk, inclusive, by the date thirty days after the date of any default in payment under the agreement. The mortgagee shall not be required to send any additional notice to the homeowner other than the notice required under subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(d) Nothing in sections 8-265cc to 8-265kk, inclusive, shall prevent a homeowner from exercising rights that may exist under the foreclosure mediation program and those rights may be exercised concurrently with the rights afforded under sections 8-265cc to 8-265kk, inclusive, provided the exercise of rights under the foreclosure mediation program shall not cause a delay in the determination under subsection (e) of section 8-265ff. Nothing in sections 8-265cc to 8-265kk, inclusive, shall prevent a homeowner from applying or reapplying and being considered for emergency mortgage assistance if such homeowner is referred to the emergency mortgage assistance program by the foreclosure mediation program.\n\n(P.A. 93-414, S. 3, 10; P.A. 94-185, S. 3, 10; P.A. 08-176, S. 7; P.A. 09-209, S. 29; 09-219, S. 1; June 12 Sp.

(c) to add other conference acceptable to authority and to make technical changes, and added Subsec.

(a) to replace a reference to “mortgagor” with “each homeowner who is a mortgagor” and replaced references to “mortgagor” with “homeowner” throughout section.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nNotice requirement is a mandatory condition precedent but not jurisdictional in nature and a mortgagee is required to provide notice for each foreclosure action initiated. 347 C. 381.\n\nSubsec. does not require mailing of notice by return receipt requested and introduction of certified mail receipt into evidence as a condition precedent to foreclosure. 181 CA 248. Compliance with notice requirement, when applicable, is a condition precedent to the commencement of a foreclosure action and the failure by a mortgagee to provide such notice to the mortgagor deprives the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over a foreclosure. 196 CA 636; judgment reversed, see 347 C. 381. When a mortgagee's initial in-court attempt to foreclose results in a dismissal of a foreclosure action, such that it must commence a foreclosure anew, Sec. 8-265ee(a) requires the mailing of a new EMAP notice in order to commence a subsequent foreclosure action. 206 CA 625.",

Pending claims for such items must be identified by the homeowner as contingent assets.\n\n(e) The authority shall make a determination of eligibility for emergency mortgage or lien assistance payments by the date thirty calendar days after the date the homeowner's application is received by the authority. During said thirty-day period no judgment of strict foreclosure or any judgment ordering foreclosure by sale shall be entered in any action for the foreclosure of any mortgage or lien any mortgagee or lienholder holds on the homeowner's real property.

Such payments shall be made directly to each mortgagee secured by the homeowner's real property in a total amount that does not exceed the amount of sixty months of emergency mortgage assistance payments, which amount shall include any such payments that the authority provides to reinstate a homeowner's mortgage or lien to a current status with the initial disbursement of an emergency mortgage assistance payment, either consecutively or nonconsecutively, except no such payments shall be made after sixty months have passed since the date of the initial payment. The total monthly payment made by the authority, to or on behalf of a homeowner under subsection (c) of this section, shall be not more than twenty-eight per cent of one hundred forty per cent of annual area median income, as published by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, divided by twelve. Upon receipt of payment in full from a homeowner of the monthly amount established under subsection (b) of this section, the authority shall pay to each mortgagee the full amount then due to the mortgagee pursuant to the terms of the mortgage without regard to any acceleration under the mortgage. Such payments shall include, but not be limited to, principal, interest, taxes, assessments and insurance premiums. The initial payment made by the authority to each mortgagee may be an amount which pays all arrearages, reasonable costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the mortgagee in connection with foreclosure of the mortgage, and, if approved by the authority as part of a restructuring of the mortgage debt, a sum to reduce the principal balance of the mortgage to an amount that will cause the homeowner to have a reasonable prospect of resuming full periodic mortgage payments following the disbursement of all emergency mortgage assistance payments provided by the authority under this subsection.\n\n(b) A homeowner on whose behalf the authority is making emergency mortgage assistance payments shall, during the period in which such assistance is provided, make monthly payments to the authority in lieu of the homeowner's monthly mortgage payments. Such payments to the authority shall be: (1) In an amount which shall cause the homeowner's total housing expense to be not greater than forty-five per cent of the homeowner's aggregate family income; or (2) if greater than the amount described in subdivision (1) of this subsection, in an amount which shall cause the ratio of the homeowner's total housing expense to aggregate family income to be not greater than such ratio for the one-year period immediately preceding the date when the homeowner experienced the financial hardship beyond the homeowner's control. The homeowner shall make such payments to the authority not later than seven days before each mortgage payment is due to the mortgagee.\n\n(c) The amount by which the emergency mortgage assistance payments made by the authority to the mortgagee exceeds the payments made by the homeowner to the authority shall be a loan in that amount made by the authority to the homeowner. Any such loan shall be evidenced by such documents as the authority may require and may be subject to repayment with interest, if any, and secured as provided in section 8-265hh.\n\n(d) The authority shall establish procedures for periodic review of the homeowner's financial circumstances for the purpose of determining the necessity for continuation, termination or adjustment of the amount of emergency mortgage assistance payments or adjustment of the payments by the homeowner pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Payments shall be discontinued when the authority determines that, due to changes in the homeowner's financial condition, the payments are no longer necessary in accordance with the standards contained in section 8-265ff, the maximum amount of emergency mortgage assistance payments allowed under subsection (a) of this section has been provided or the sixty-month period established under subsection (a) of this section, during which one or more emergency mortgage assistance payments were provided, has expired, whichever is sooner. A foreclosure of the homeowner's mortgage may, at any time thereafter, proceed without further restriction or requirement under sections 8-265cc to 8-265hh, inclusive. The authority may adjust payments by the homeowner pursuant to subsection (b) of this section based on a review under this subsection.\n\n(e) If the homeowner fails to pay to the authority any amounts due under subsection (b) of this section within seven days of the date due to the authority, the authority: (1) May, at the discretion of the authority, nevertheless advance emergency mortgage assistance payments to the mortgagee; and (2) shall, upon the homeowner's request, review the homeowner's financial circumstances to determine whether the delinquency is the result of additional financial hardship due to circumstances beyond the homeowner's control. If the homeowner does not demonstrate to the satisfaction of the authority that the delinquency is the result of additional financial hardship due to circumstances beyond the homeowner's control in the homeowner's financial circumstances, the authority may terminate emergency mortgage assistance payments and the foreclosure of the homeowner's mortgage may, at any time thereafter, continue without any further restriction or requirement under sections 8-265cc to 8-265kk, inclusive.

Such notice shall be in the form and manner prescribed by the department and the authority, and shall include contact information for the eligible financial institution. Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude an eligible financial institution that has elected to participate in the program from issuing loans to eligible borrowers outside of the loan guarantee program.\n\n(2) An eligible financial institution may suspend its participation in, or withdraw from, the loan guarantee program five business days after providing advance written notice to the department and the authority specifying the date on which such suspension or withdrawal becomes effective. Such withdrawal or suspension shall not affect the eligible financial institution's ability to submit a guarantee claim on any loan for which the eligible financial institution provided notice to the authority pursuant to subsection (d) of this section prior to the effective date of the withdrawal or suspension.\n\n(3) Not later than September 1, 2019, the department and the authority shall each publish on their Internet web sites a summary of the program and a list of the eligible financial institutions that have elected to participate in the program.

The forms and standards developed pursuant to this section shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be closely aligned with existing forms, policies and procedures used by eligible financial institutions participating in the program, but shall not require post-delinquency collection efforts extending beyond ninety days.\n\n(d) Each eligible financial institution that makes a loan pursuant to section 8-265vv, shall notify the authority in writing not later than one business day after making the loan, specifying the amount of the loan and any other information about the borrower and the loan the authority may request.
