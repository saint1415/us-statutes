(2) (former Subsec. (b)):\n\nInclusion within area of certain properties which are not substandard does not constitute unreasonable or arbitrary action because it is condition obtaining as to entire area and not as to individual properties which is determinative; addition of word “deteriorating” indicates legislative intent that Subsec. is to be liberally construed. 147 C. 321.

A redevelopment agency shall select from among its members a chairman and a vice-chairman, and may employ a secretary and such other officers, agents, technical consultants, legal counsel and employees as it requires. The members shall serve without compensation but may be reimbursed for necessary expenses.\n\n(b) The legislative body of any municipality may dissolve an agency authorized under subsection (a) of this section upon determination that such action would facilitate receipt and processing of federal funds and promote the purposes of this chapter. In the event a redevelopment agency to be dissolved has undertaken a project to which the state has contributed financial or other assistance, the legislative body of such municipality shall forward a request for approval to dissolve such agency to the Department of Housing. Upon receipt of such request, the department shall report, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a, to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to commerce (1) the nature and amounts of such financial assistance, (2) the department's preliminary decision to approve or disapprove such municipality's request, and (3) any other conditions on which such an approval would be based. Within thirty days of receipt of such report, the committee shall advise the department whether said committee agrees or disagrees with the department's preliminary decision and the reasons therefor. If the committee does not provide such advice within thirty days, the department shall proceed to issue its final decision to the legislative body of the municipality.

Each appraisal shall be conducted by a state-certified real estate appraiser without consultation with the appraiser conducting the other independent appraisal, and shall be conducted in accordance with generally accepted standards of professional appraisal practice as described in the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice issued by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation pursuant to Title XI of FIRREA and any regulations adopted pursuant to section 20-504. Each appraiser shall provide a copy of the appraisal to the agency and the property owner. The amount of compensation for such real property shall be equal to the average of the amounts determined by the two independent appraisals, except that the compensation for any real property to be acquired by eminent domain pursuant to section 8-193 or by condemnation pursuant to section 32-224 shall be one hundred twenty-five per cent of such average amount. If the agency acquires real property that is subject to this subdivision five years or more after acquiring another parcel of real property within one thousand feet of the property pursuant to a redevelopment plan or development plan, the agency shall increase the amount of compensation for the subsequent acquisition of real property by an additional five per cent for each year from the sixth year until the tenth year after the acquisition of the first parcel of real property. With respect to a redevelopment plan or development plan for a project that is funded in whole or in part by federal funds, the provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to the extent that such provisions are prohibited by federal law.\n\n(3) The redevelopment agency shall file a statement of compensation, containing a description of the property to be taken and the names of all persons having a record interest therein and setting forth the amount of such compensation, and a deposit as provided in section 8-130, with the clerk of the superior court for the judicial district in which the property affected is located.\n\n(b) Upon filing such statement of compensation and deposit, the redevelopment agency shall forthwith cause to be recorded, in the office of the town clerk of each town in which the property is located, a copy of such statement of compensation, such recording to have the same effect and to be treated the same as the recording of a lis pendens, and shall forthwith give notice, as provided in this section, to each person appearing of record as an owner of property affected thereby and to each person appearing of record as a holder of any mortgage, lien, assessment or other encumbrance on such property or interest therein (1) in the case of any such person found to be residing within this state, by causing a copy of such notice, with a copy of such statement of compensation, to be served upon each such person by a state marshal, constable or indifferent person, in the manner set forth in section 52-57 for the service of civil process, and (2) in the case of any such person who is a nonresident of this state at the time of the filing of such statement of compensation and deposit or of any such person whose whereabouts or existence is unknown, by mailing to each such person a copy of such notice and of such statement of compensation, by registered or certified mail, directed to such person's last-known address, and by publishing such notice and such statement of compensation at least twice in a newspaper published in the judicial district and having daily or weekly circulation in the town in which such property is located. Any such published notice shall state that it is notice to the widow or widower, heirs, representatives and creditors of the person holding such record interest, if such person is dead. If, after a reasonably diligent search, no last-known address can be found for any interested party, an affidavit stating such fact, and reciting the steps taken to locate such address, shall be filed with the clerk of the superior court and accepted in lieu of mailing to the last-known address.\n\n(c) Not less than thirty-five days or more than ninety days after such notice and such statement of compensation have been so served or so mailed and first published, the redevelopment agency shall file with the clerk of the superior court a return of notice setting forth the notice given and, upon receipt of such return of notice, such clerk shall, without any delay or continuance of any kind, issue a certificate of taking setting forth the fact of such taking, a description of all the property so taken and the names of the owners and of all other persons having a record interest therein. The redevelopment agency shall cause such certificate of taking to be recorded in the office of the town clerk of each town in which such property is located. Upon the recording of such certificate, title to such property in fee simple shall vest in the municipality, and the right to just compensation shall vest in the persons entitled thereto. At any time after such certificate of taking has been so recorded, the redevelopment agency may repair, operate or insure such property and enter upon such property, and take any action that is proposed with regard to such property by the project area redevelopment plan.\n\n(d) The notice required in subsection (b) of this section shall state that (1) not less than thirty-five days or more than ninety days after service or mailing and first publication thereof, the redevelopment agency shall file, with the clerk of the superior court for the judicial district in which such property is located, a return setting forth the notice given, (2) upon receipt of such return, such clerk shall issue a certificate for recording in the office of the town clerk of each town in which such property is located, (3) upon the recording of such certificate, title to such property shall vest in the municipality, the right to just compensation shall vest in the persons entitled thereto and the redevelopment agency may repair, operate or insure such property and enter upon such property and take any action that may be proposed with regard thereto by the project area redevelopment plan, and (4) such notice shall bind the widow or widower, heirs, representatives and creditors of each person named in the notice who then or thereafter may be dead.\n\n(e) When any redevelopment agency acting on behalf of any municipality has acquired or rented real property by purchase, lease, exchange or gift in accordance with the provisions of this section, or in exercising its right of eminent domain has filed a statement of compensation and deposit with the clerk of the superior court and has caused a certificate of taking to be recorded in the office of the town clerk of each town in which such property is located as provided in this section, any judge of such court may, upon application and proof of such acquisition or rental or such filing and deposit and such recording, order such clerk to issue an execution commanding a state marshal to put such municipality and the redevelopment agency, as its agent, into peaceable possession of the property so acquired, rented or condemned.

For the purposes of a specified project only, Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated may, upon a resolution with respect to such project adopted by the legislative body of the municipality, issue and administer bonds which are payable solely or in part from and secured by the pledge and security provided for in this section subject to the general terms and provisions of law applicable to the issuance of bonds by Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, except that the provisions of subsection (b) of section 32-23j shall not apply. Any bonds payable and secured as provided in this section shall be authorized by a resolution adopted by the legislative body of the municipality, notwithstanding the provisions of any other statute, local law or charter governing the authorization and issuance of bonds generally by the municipality. No such resolution shall be adopted until after a public hearing has been held upon such authorization. Notice of such hearing shall be published not less than five days prior to such hearing in a newspaper having a general circulation in the municipality. Such bonds shall be issued and sold in such manner; bear interest at such rate or rates, including variable rates to be determined in such manner as set forth in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds; provide for the payment of interest on such dates, whether before or at maturity; be issued at, above or below par; mature at such time or times not exceeding forty years from their date in the case of bonds issued to finance housing and facilities related thereto or thirty years from their date in all other cases; have such rank or priority; be payable in such medium of payment; be issued in such form, including, without limitation, registered or book-entry form, carry such registration and transfer privileges and be made subject to purchase or redemption before maturity at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions, including the condition that such bonds be subject to purchase or redemption on the demand of the owner thereof; and contain such other terms and particulars as the legislative body of the municipality or the officers delegated such authority by the legislative body of the municipality body shall determine. The proceedings under which bonds are authorized to be issued may, subject to the provisions of the general statutes, contain any or all of the following: (1) Provisions respecting custody of the proceeds from the sale of the bonds and any bond anticipation notes, including any requirements that such proceeds be held separate from or not be commingled with other funds of the municipality; (2) provisions for the investment and reinvestment of bond proceeds until such proceeds are used to pay project costs and for the disposition of any excess bond proceeds or investment earnings thereon; (3) provisions for the execution of reimbursement agreements, or similar agreements, in connection with credit facilities, including, but not limited to, letters of credit or policies of bond insurance, remarketing agreements and agreements for the purpose of moderating interest rate fluctuations; (4) provisions for the collection, custody, investment, reinvestment and use of the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged for payment of bonds as provided in this section; (5) provisions regarding the establishment and maintenance of reserves, sinking funds and any other funds and accounts as shall be approved by the legislative body of the municipality in such amounts as may be established by the legislative body of the municipality and the regulation and disposition thereof, including requirements that any such funds and accounts be held separate from or not be commingled with other funds of the municipality; (6) covenants for the establishment of maintenance requirements with respect to facilities and properties; (7) provisions for the issuance of additional bonds on a parity with bonds issued prior to the issuance of such additional bonds, including establishment of coverage requirements with respect to such bonds as herein provided; (8) provisions regarding the rights and remedies available to the bond owners, note owners or any trustee under any contract, loan agreement, document, instrument or trust indenture in case of a default, including the right to appoint a trustee to represent their interests upon occurrence of any event of default, as defined in any such default proceedings, provided that if any bonds or bond anticipation notes are secured by a trust indenture, the respective owners of such bonds or notes shall have no authority except as set forth in such trust indenture to appoint a separate trustee to represent them; and (9) other provisions or covenants of like or different character from the foregoing which are consistent with this section and which the legislative body of the municipality determines in such proceedings are necessary, convenient or desirable in order to better secure the bonds or bond anticipation notes, or will tend to make the bonds or bond anticipation notes more marketable, and which are in the best interests of the municipality. Any provisions which may be included in proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds under this section may be included in an indenture of trust duly approved in accordance with this section which secures the bonds and any notes issued in anticipation thereof, and in such case the provisions of such indenture shall be deemed to be a part of such proceedings as though they were expressly included therein. Any pledge made by the municipality shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made, and any revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the municipality shall be subject immediately to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the municipality, irrespective of whether such parties have notice of such lien. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded. The legislative body of the municipality may enter into a trust indenture by and between the municipality and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the municipality. Such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bond owners and note owners as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the municipality in relation to the exercise of its powers pursuant to this section and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. The municipality may provide by such trust indenture for the payment of the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys to the trustee under such trust indenture or to any other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as project costs. Such bonds shall not be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of the municipality, provided, if such bonds are made payable, in whole or in part, from funds contracted to be advanced by the municipality, the aggregate amount of such funds not yet appropriated to such purpose shall be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of the municipality. As used in this section, “bonds” means any bonds, including refunding bonds, notes, interim certificates, debentures or other obligations.

Upon approval of such deed by the court and filing in the land records of the municipality in which such property is located, transfer of ownership of such property shall be deemed fully effectuated.\n\n(h) Upon request of the receiver or any party in interest, the court may order the termination of a receivership of an abandoned property if the court finds:\n\n(1) The purposes of the receivership have been fulfilled, such as the remediation or abatement of the conditions described in subdivision (2) of subsection (c) of this section and the payment of or provision for each obligation, expense and improvement of the receivership, including any fee or expense incurred by the receiver;\n\n(2) The owner, a mortgagee or a lienholder has requested the receivership be terminated and has provided adequate assurance to the court that the purposes of the receivership will be fulfilled, such as the remediation or abatement of the conditions described in subdivision (2) of subsection (c) of this section and the payment of or provision for each obligation, expense and improvement of such receivership, including any fee or expense incurred by such receiver;\n\n(3) The abandoned property has been sold by the receiver and the proceeds of the sale have been distributed in accordance with subdivision (4) of subsection (g) of this section; or\n\n(4) The receiver has been unable, after diligent effort, to (A) develop a receiver's plan pursuant to subparagraph (C) of subdivision (2) of subsection (c) of this section for approval by the court, (B) implement any court-approved plan, or (C) fulfill the purposes of the receivership for any reason.\n\n(i) The provisions of this section shall not apply (1) to any commercial or residential building, structure or land owned by or held in trust for the United States government and regulated under the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended from time to time, and regulations promulgated under such act, and (2) if the owner of a building that would be determined by a court to be an abandoned property pursuant to this section has vacated such building to perform military service in time of war or armed conflict or to assist relief efforts during a declared federal or state emergency as a member of the United States armed forces or any reserve component of such armed forces.\n\n(P.A. 19-92, S. 1; P.A. 23-33, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 19-92 effective January 1, 2020; P.A. 23-33 amended Subsec.

The authority may pay into such special capital reserve funds (1) any moneys appropriated and made available by the state for the purposes of such special capital reserve funds, (2) any proceeds of the sale of bonds or notes of the authority, to the extent provided in the resolution of said authority authorizing the issuance of such bonds or notes, and (3) any moneys made available to the authority from any other source for the purposes of such special capital reserve funds. The amount of bonds of the authority secured by special capital reserve funds shall not exceed fifty million dollars in the aggregate.\n\n(c) (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the moneys held in or credited to any special capital reserve fund established under this section shall be used for:\n\n(A) The payment of the principal and interest as such payments become due, whether due at maturity or by mandatory sinking fund installments, on bonds of the authority secured by such special capital reserve fund; or\n\n(B) The purchase of such bonds and the payment of any redemption premium required to be paid when such bonds are redeemed prior to maturity, including reimbursement of a provider of bond insurance or of a credit or liquidity facility that has paid such redemption premium.\n\n(2) The authority may prohibit, except for the purpose of paying the principal of and interest and redemption premium on bonds of the authority secured by a special capital reserve fund for which other moneys of the authority are not available, the withdrawal of moneys in any special capital reserve fund in an amount that would result in the balance of such special capital reserve fund being less than (A) the maximum amount of principal and interest becoming due by reason of maturity or a required sinking fund installment on the bonds of the authority outstanding in the then current or any succeeding calendar year, or (B) the required minimum capital reserve.\n\n(3) The authority may provide at any time that it shall not issue bonds secured by a special capital reserve fund if the required minimum capital reserve on the bonds outstanding and the bonds to be issued and secured by the same special capital reserve fund at the time of issuance exceeds the moneys in the special capital reserve fund, unless the authority deposits proceeds from the bonds to be issued or moneys from other sources into such special capital reserve fund, in an amount that, together with the amount then in such special capital reserve fund, will be not less than the required minimum capital reserve.\n\n(d) (1) (A) Prior to December first, annually, the authority shall deposit, for any special capital reserve fund for which the balance is below the required minimum capital reserve, the full amount required to meet the required minimum capital reserve for such special capital reserve fund.
