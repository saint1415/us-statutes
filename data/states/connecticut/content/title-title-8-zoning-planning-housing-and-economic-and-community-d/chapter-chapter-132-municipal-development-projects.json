The legislative body of the municipality may enter into a trust indenture by and between the municipality and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the municipality. Such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bond owners and note owners as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the municipality in relation to the exercise of its powers pursuant to this section and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. The municipality may provide by such trust indenture for the payment of the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys to the trustee under such trust indenture or to any other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as project costs. Such bonds shall not be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of the municipality, provided, if such bonds are made payable, in whole or in part, from funds contracted to be advanced by the municipality, the aggregate amount of such funds not yet appropriated to such purpose shall be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of the municipality. As used in this section, “bonds” means any bonds, including refunding bonds, notes, temporary notes, interim certificates, debentures or other obligations. Temporary notes issued in accordance with this subsection in anticipation of the receipt of the proceeds of bond issues may be issued for a period of not more than five years and notes issued for a shorter period of time may be renewed by the issue of other notes, provided the period from the date of the original notes to the maturity of the last notes issued in renewal thereof shall not exceed five years.\n\n(b) For the purpose of carrying out or administering a development plan or other functions authorized under this chapter, a municipality, acting by and through its development agency, may accept grants, advances, loans or other financial assistance from the federal government, the state or other source, and may do any and all things necessary or desirable to secure such financial aid. To assist any development project located in the area in which it is authorized to act, any public body, including the state, or any city, town, borough, authority, district, subdivision or agency of the state, may, upon such terms as it determines, furnish service or facilities, provide property, lend or contribute funds, and take any other action of a character which it is authorized to perform for other purposes. To obtain funds for the temporary and definitive financing of any development project, a municipality may, in addition to other action authorized under this chapter or other law, issue its general obligation bonds, notes, temporary notes or other obligations secured by a pledge of the municipality's full faith and credit. Such bonds, notes, temporary notes and other obligations shall be authorized in accordance with the requirements for the authorization of such obligations generally by the municipality and the authorization, issuance and sale thereof shall be subject to the limitations contained in the general statutes, including provisions on the limitation of the aggregate indebtedness of the municipality. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 7-264, 7-378 and 7-378a, and any other public or special act or charter or bond ordinance or bond resolution which limits the issuance or renewal of temporary notes issued in anticipation of the receipt of the proceeds of bond issues to a period of time of less than five years from the date of the original notes or requires a reduction in the principal amount of such notes or renewal notes prior to the fifth anniversary of the date of the original notes, such temporary notes may be issued for a period of not more than five years and notes issued for a shorter period of time may be renewed by the issue of other notes, provided the period from the date of the original notes to the maturity of the last notes issued in renewal thereof shall not exceed five years.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section and any other public or special act or charter or bond ordinance or bond resolution which limits the renewal of temporary notes issued pursuant to said subsections in anticipation of the receipt of the proceeds of bond issues to five years or less from the date of the original notes, any municipality may renew temporary notes in accordance with the provisions of this section for an additional period of not more than four years from the end of such five-year period. The officers or board authorized to issue the bonds or determine the particulars of the bonds may adopt a resolution authorizing the renewal of temporary notes for such additional period under the following conditions: (1) All project grant payments and bond sale proceeds received shall be promptly applied toward project costs or toward payment of such temporary notes as the same shall become due and payable or shall be deposited in trust for such purposes; (2) no later than the end of each period of twelve months after the end of such five-year period a portion of such temporary notes equal to at least one-twentieth of the municipality's estimated cost of the project shall be retired from funds other than project grants or land sale proceeds or note proceeds; (3) the interest on all temporary notes renewed after such five-year period shall be paid from funds other than project grants or land sale proceeds or note proceeds; (4) the principal amount of each bond issue when sold shall be reduced by the amounts spent under subdivision (2) of this subsection, and the principal of such bonds shall be paid in annual installments commencing no later than one year from the date of issue; and (5) the maximum authorized term of the bonds when sold shall be reduced by not less than the number of months from the end of such five-year period to the date of issue. Any anticipated federal or state project grants or land sale proceeds may be used in computing the municipality's cost of the project. Any municipality in which such resolution is passed shall include in its annual budget or shall otherwise appropriate sufficient funds to make the payments required by subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection.\n\n(d) For the purposes of carrying out or administering a specified development plan authorized under this chapter, Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated may, upon a resolution with respect to such project adopted by the legislative body of the municipality, issue and administer bonds which are payable solely or in part from and secured by the pledge and security provided for in subsection (a) of this section subject to the general terms and provisions of law applicable to the issuance of bonds by Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, except that the provisions of subsection (b) of section 32-23j shall not apply.

The development agency shall cause notice of the time, place and subject of the hearing to be published in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the municipality not more than ten days before the date set for the hearing.

Such approval shall be by (i) separate vote on each parcel of real property to be acquired, or (ii) a vote on one or more groups of such parcels, provided each parcel to be acquired is identified for the purposes of a vote on a group of such parcels under this subparagraph. The legislative body or the board of selectmen, as the case may be, shall not approve the use of eminent domain by the development agency unless the legislative body or board of selectmen has (I) considered the benefits to the public and any private entity that will result from the development project and determined that the public benefits outweigh any private benefits, (II) determined that the current use of the real property cannot be feasibly integrated into the overall development plan, and (III) determined that the acquisition of the real property by eminent domain is reasonably necessary to successfully achieve the objectives of the development plan.\n\n(B) The municipality shall cause notice of any approved acquisition by eminent domain under this subdivision to be published in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the municipality not more than ten days after such approval.\n\n(C) (i) The development agency shall acquire any property identified in the plan as property to be acquired by eminent domain by a date that is five years after the date the first property is acquired by eminent domain under the plan unless the development agency approves an extension of the time for acquisition, except that no property may be acquired by eminent domain under the plan more than ten years after the first property is acquired by eminent domain under the plan.\n\n(ii) With respect to a development plan for a project that is funded in whole or in part by federal funds, the provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply to the extent that such provisions are prohibited by federal law.\n\n(4) The owner-occupant of property acquired by eminent domain under this section may file an application in the superior court for the judicial district in which the municipality is located to enjoin the acquisition of such property. The court may issue such injunction if the court finds that the development agency or municipality failed to comply with the requirements of this chapter. The filing of an application to enjoin the acquisition of property by eminent domain, in a court of competent jurisdiction, shall toll the five-year period or ten-year period set forth in subparagraph (C) of subdivision (3) of this subsection with respect to such property until the date a final judgment is entered in any such action, or any appeal thereof, whichever date is later.\n\n(c) (1) With respect to real property acquired by eminent domain pursuant to this section on or after June 25, 2007, if the municipality does not use the real property for the purpose for which it was acquired or for some other public use and seeks to sell the property, the municipality shall first offer the real property for sale pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection to the person from whom the real property was acquired, or heirs of the person designated pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection, if any, for a price not to exceed the lesser of (A) the amount paid by the development agency to acquire the property, or (B) the fair market value of the property at the time of any sale under this subsection. After the municipality provides notice pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection, the municipality may not sell such property to a third party unless the municipality has permitted the person or named heirs six months during which to exercise the right to purchase the property, and an additional six months to finalize the purchase if the person or named heirs provide the municipality with notice of intent to purchase the property within the initial six-month period.\n\n(2) For the purposes of any offer of sale pursuant to this subsection, the municipality shall provide a form to any person whose property is acquired by eminent domain pursuant to this section to permit such person to provide an address for notice of sale to be sent, or to provide the name and address of an agent to receive such notice. Such form shall be designed to permit the person to designate heirs of the person who shall be eligible to purchase such property pursuant to this subsection. The person or agent shall update information in the form in writing. If the person or agent does not provide or update the information in the form in a manner that permits the municipality to send notice of sale pursuant to this subsection, no such notice shall be required.\n\n(3) With respect to a development plan for a project that is funded in whole or in part by federal funds, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the extent that such provisions are prohibited by federal law.\n\n(d) The development agency may, with the approval of the legislative body and, of the commissioner if any grants were made by the state under section 8-190 or 8-195 for such development project, and in the name of such municipality, transfer by sale or lease at fair market value or fair rental value, as the case may be, the whole or any part of the real property in the project area to any person, in accordance with the project plan and such disposition plans as may have been determined by the commissioner.\n\n(e) A development agency shall have all the powers necessary or convenient to undertake and carry out development plans and development projects, including the power to clear, demolish, repair, rehabilitate, operate, or insure real property while it is in its possession, to make site improvements essential to the preparation of land for its use in accordance with the development plan, to install, construct or reconstruct streets, utilities and other improvements necessary for carrying out the objectives of the development project, and, in distressed municipalities, as defined in section 32-9p, to lend funds to businesses and industries in a manner approved by the commissioner.\n\n(1967, P.A. 760, S. 8; 1971, P.A. 505, S. 5; 1972, P.A. 87, S. 3; P.A. 74-184, S. 6, 10; P.A. 77-138, S. 2, 3; 77-410, S. 2, 5; P.A. 80-18, S. 2, 3; P.A. 84-243, S. 2; P.A. 07-141, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: 1971 act amended Subsec.

Special development grants, as provided in subsections (b) and (c), may be made to any municipality, regardless of whether or not it is a distressed municipality, in amounts up to one hundred per cent of such costs.\n\n(b) The commissioner is authorized to make special development grants to municipalities to plan, install, construct or reconstruct utilities, sewerage and water lines and systems, and water towers and to acquire rights-of-way, therefore, to the boundaries of development projects. Such development grants may be made in amounts to their total costs, but not to exceed, ten per cent of the estimated physical development costs within the development project as last approved by the commissioner.\n\n(c) The commissioner is authorized to make special development grants to municipalities for site improvement, utility, water, roads and sewerage facilities, renovation of building space, related engineering services, and for relocation expenses for the purpose of assisting industrial and business firms to locate or expand within development projects and which, upon such location or expansion, would result in a significant increase in employment or municipal real estate tax revenue to the municipality within which such development projects are located. All relocation assistance shall be in conformance with the provisions of chapter 135. Such grants may be made in amounts to their estimated total cost.\n\n(d) In allocating funds available for the making of development grants, said commissioner is authorized to establish priorities among municipalities, taking into account their relative needs for development projects, the effects of proposed projects on existing housing and the extent to which particular projects are likely to advance the purposes of this chapter.\n\n(1967, P.A. 760, S. 10; 1971, P.A. 505, S. 6; P.A. 74-184, S. 7, 10; P.A. 75-109; 75-480, S. 6, 8; P.A. 76-134, S. 2; P.A. 78-357, S. 12, 16; P.A. 79-229; P.A. 83-234; P.A. 84-243, S. 3; P.A. 85-50, S. 3; P.A. 86-232, S. 2.)\n\nHistory: 1971 act substituted Connecticut development commission for commissioner of community affairs; P.A. 74-184 substituted commissioner of commerce for Connecticut development commission; P.A. 75-109 allowed grants for up to 75% of net costs in project undertaken by two or more towns; P.A. 75-480 divided section into Subsecs., making former provisions Subsecs.

(a); P.A. 79-229 allowed inclusion of planning or special planning costs in net cost when planning costs already paid by municipality in Subsec. (a); P.A. 83-234 provided that special development grants could be made for renovation of building space or for expansion within development projects; P.A. 84-243 amended Subsec. (a) to provide for the use of funds for loans to businesses and industries in distressed municipalities; P.A. 85-50 amended Subsec. (a) to authorize grants in distressed municipalities to also be used for loans to businesses and industries renovating or operating within development projects; P.A. 86-232 amended Subsec.
