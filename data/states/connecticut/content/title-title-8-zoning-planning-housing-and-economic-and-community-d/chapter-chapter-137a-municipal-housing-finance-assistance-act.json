      "text": "(a) It is hereby found that as a result of the continuing increases in construction and rehabilitation costs, municipal taxes, heating and electricity expenses, maintenance and repair expenses and the cost of land, low and moderate income families and persons in many municipalities within the state, including municipalities which contained formerly stable neighborhoods, are unable to purchase, rehabilitate and maintain decent, safe and sanitary housing which provides an opportunity for home ownership either directly or through a condominium or cooperative form of ownership. The inability of such families and persons to purchase and hold housing in such municipalities results in the decline of new housing and in the decay of the existing housing stock and of existing neighborhoods with attendant increases in municipal costs for welfare, police and fire protection. The decline in new housing, together with the decay of existing housing stock, has produced a critical shortage of adequate housing in these municipalities adversely affecting the economy of the state and its municipalities and the well-being of their residents. Private enterprise, without the assistance contemplated by this chapter, cannot achieve the construction or rehabilitation of sufficient housing for low and moderate income families and persons and the alternative of forcing such families and persons to live in substandard housing is undesirable since it tends to decrease the interest of such families and persons in their communities, the maintenance of their property and the preservation of their neighborhoods.\n\n(b) It is further found and declared that unless the supply of housing and the ability of low and moderate income families and persons to obtain mortgage financing is increased significantly and expeditiously, a large number of residents of many of the state's municipalities will be compelled to live in unsanitary, overcrowded and unsafe conditions to the detriment of the health, welfare and well-being of these persons and of the whole community of which they are a part. By increasing the housing supply of the state and the ability of low and moderate income families and persons to obtain mortgage financing, the clearance, replanning, development and redevelopment of blighted areas will be aided, and the critical shortage of adequate housing will be ameliorated.\n\n(c) It is further found and declared that the cost of mortgage financing is a major factor materially affecting the supply and cost of housing and that, notwithstanding the past and present efforts of government agencies and instrumentalities both state and federal, there continues to exist a serious shortage of low interest mortgage financing available to low and moderate income families and persons in the state. It is therefore necessary and appropriate that municipalities take steps on a local level to reduce the cost of such financing and thereby promote the purchase of decent, safe and sanitary housing and the rehabilitation of existing substandard housing by low and moderate income families and persons.\n\n(d) It is further found and declared that the provision by municipalities of financial assistance for housing for low and moderate income families and persons through the making and purchase of mortgage loans to such families and persons for the purpose of purchasing and of rehabilitating housing, are public purposes and purposes for which public money may be expended by a municipality for the public benefit and good.\n\n(P.A. 79-596, S. 2, 17.)",

The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the municipality, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof.

All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the operating expenses of the housing finance assistance plan. If the bonds shall be secured by a trust indenture, the bondholders shall have no authority to appoint a separate trustee to represent them.\n\n(j) Whether or not the notes and bonds are of such form and character as to be negotiable instruments under the terms of the Uniform Commercial Code, the notes and bonds are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, subject only to the provisions of the notes and bonds for registration.\n\n(P.A. 79-596, S. 7, 17.)",
