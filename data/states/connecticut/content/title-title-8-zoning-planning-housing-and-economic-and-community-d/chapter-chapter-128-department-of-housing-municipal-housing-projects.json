      "text": "(a) For purposes of this section, a “tenant of the authority” means a tenant who lives in housing owned or managed by a housing authority or who is receiving housing assistance in a housing program directly administered by such authority. When the governing body of a municipality other than a town adopts a resolution as described in section 8-40, it shall promptly notify the chief executive officer of such adoption. Upon receiving such notice, the chief executive officer shall appoint five persons who are residents of such municipality as commissioners of the authority, except that the chief executive officer may appoint two additional persons who are residents of the municipality if (1) the authority operates more than three thousand units, or (2) upon the appointment of a tenant commissioner pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the additional appointments are necessary to achieve compliance with 24 CFR 964.415 or section 9-167a. If the governing body of a town adopts such a resolution, such body shall appoint five persons who are residents of such town as commissioners of the authority created for such town, except that such body may appoint two additional persons who are residents of the town if, upon the appointment of a tenant commissioner pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the additional appointments are necessary to achieve compliance with 24 CFR 964.415 or section 9-167a. The commissioners who are first so appointed shall be designated to serve for a term of either one, two, three, four or five years, except that if the authority has five members, the terms of not more than one member shall expire in the same year. Terms shall commence on the first day of the month next succeeding the date of their appointment, and annually thereafter a commissioner shall be appointed to serve for five years except that any vacancy which may occur because of a change of residence by a commissioner, removal of a commissioner, resignation or death shall be filled for the unexpired portion of the term. If a governing body increases the membership of the authority on or after July 1, 1995, such governing body shall, by resolution, provide for a term of five years for each such additional member. The term of the chairman shall be three years. At least one of such commissioners of an authority having five members, and at least two of such commissioners of an authority having more than five members, shall be a tenant or tenants of the authority selected pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. If, on October 1, 1979, a municipality has adopted a resolution as described in section 8-40, but has no tenants serving as commissioners, the chief executive officer of a municipality other than a town or the governing body of a town shall appoint a tenant who meets the qualifications set out in this section as a commissioner of such authority when the next vacancy occurs. No commissioner of an authority may hold any public office in the municipality for which the authority is created. A commissioner shall hold office until such commissioner's successor is appointed and has qualified. Not later than January 1, 2024, each commissioner who is serving on said date and, thereafter, upon appointment, each newly appointed commissioner who is not a reappointed commissioner, shall participate in a training for housing authority commissioners provided by an industry-recognized training provider. A certificate of the appointment or reappointment of any commissioner shall be filed with the clerk and shall be conclusive evidence of the legal appointment of such commissioner, after said commissioner has taken an oath in the form prescribed in the first paragraph of section 1-25. The powers of each authority shall be vested in the commissioners thereof. Three commissioners shall constitute a quorum if the authority consists of five commissioners. Four commissioners shall constitute a quorum if the authority consists of more than five commissioners. Action may be taken by the authority upon a vote of not less than a majority of the commissioners present unless the bylaws of the authority require a larger number. The chief executive officer, or, in the case of an authority for a town, the governing body of the town, shall designate which of the commissioners shall be the first chairman, but when the office of chairman of the authority becomes vacant, the authority shall select a chairman from among its commissioners. An authority shall select from among its commissioners a vice chairman, and it may employ a secretary, who shall be executive director, and technical experts and such other officers, agents and employees, permanent and temporary, as it requires, and shall determine their qualifications, duties and compensation, provided, in municipalities having a civil service law, all appointments and promotions, except the employment of the secretary, shall be based on examinations given and lists prepared under such law, and, except so far as may be inconsistent with the terms of this chapter, such civil service law and regulations adopted thereunder shall apply to such housing authority and its personnel. For such legal services as it requires, an authority may employ its own counsel and legal staff. An authority may delegate any of its powers and duties to one or more of its agents or employees. A commissioner, or any employee of the authority who handles its funds, shall be required to furnish an adequate bond. The commissioners shall serve without compensation, but shall be entitled to reimbursement for their actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties.\n\n(b) The authority shall designate a tenant organization as the recognized jurisdiction-wide tenant organization only if (1) the members of the governing board of such tenant organization were elected through a jurisdiction-wide election, and (2) such tenant organization satisfies the requirements for elected jurisdiction-wide resident councils pursuant to regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, except that a tenant of the authority shall be eligible to vote in any election for the governing board of such tenant organization and to serve on the governing board of such tenant organization without regard to whether such tenant receives or lives in housing that receives federal assistance. Any tenant organization that has been designated by the authority as the recognized jurisdiction-wide tenant organization may select tenants for appointment as tenant commissioner in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(c) (1) Not less than sixty days before the appointment of any tenant commissioner or the expiration of the term of any tenant commissioner, whichever is earlier, the housing authority shall notify all tenant organizations comprised of tenants residing within units owned or managed by such housing authority and all tenants of such authority of such pending appointment or expiration of term. The notice shall include information concerning procedures by which tenants may petition for an election pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(2) The appointee as tenant commissioner shall be selected by a fair election of the tenants of the authority if, not more than thirty days after the authority notifies such tenants of a pending appointment or expiration of term pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection, ten per cent of the tenants of the authority or seventy-five tenants of the authority, whichever is less, petition the authority for an election.\n\n(3) If the tenants of the authority have not petitioned for an election pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection, then the appointee as tenant commissioner shall be selected by the recognized jurisdiction-wide tenant organization, if any, by means provided for in the by-laws adopted by such tenant organization. Such means may include, without limitation, a fair election by the tenants of the authority or selection by the governing board of such tenant organization.\n\n(4) If an appointee as tenant commissioner has not been selected by an election of the tenants of the authority or by other means pursuant to the by-laws adopted by the recognized jurisdiction-wide tenant organization by the date ninety days after the date the housing authority provides notice of a pending appointment or expiration of term pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection, then the appointing authority shall select the appointee. In making such selection, the appointing authority shall consider any tenant recommended by any tenant organization within its jurisdiction or the jurisdiction-wide tenant organization.\n\n(5) The housing authority shall provide all tenants of the authority with written notice of any election conducted pursuant to this subsection or subsection (b) of this section not later than thirty days before the date of such election. For any election conducted pursuant to this subsection for an authority having more than five commissioners, the housing authority may establish qualifications for the second tenant commissioner as necessary to achieve compliance with 24 CFR 964.415 or section 9-167a.\n\n(d) For any election conducted pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the housing authority shall use its best efforts to secure an impartial entity to administer such election. To the extent practicable, such impartial entity shall be selected with the agreement of the recognized jurisdiction-wide tenant organization, if any. In the event of a dispute concerning the procedure for or results of such election, any person may petition the entity administering such election for a resolution of such dispute.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding any provision of subsection (a) of this section or any other provision of the general statutes, a commissioner of an authority may serve as a justice of the peace or a registrar of voters.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 926; 1949, S. 438d; 1967, P.A. 124, S. 1; P.A. 75-415, S. 1; P.A. 78-326; P.A. 79-546; P.A. 90-245; P.A. 94-35, S. 1, 2; 94-156, S. 4, 5; P.A. 97-307, S. 3, 4; June Sp.

Such program shall include the estimated costs of the services, rehabilitation and improvement and the method and staff required to carry out such program. After approval of such program by the commissioner, the state, acting by and in the discretion of the commissioner, may enter into a contract with the housing authority conditioned upon the housing authority performing the program approved. Such contract shall provide for state financial assistance in the form of a grant-in-aid, loan, deferred loan or combination thereof equal to the cost of such program, including administrative or other cost or expense to be incurred by the state in connection with such program as approved by the commissioner, provided such contract shall provide financial assistance in the form of a loan, or deferred loan rather than a grant only in a case where, and to the extent that, repayment ability exists because of an adequate rental structure or funds are made available by an agency of the United States government in such amounts and for such periods of time as are required to repay such loan, together with interest. The contract shall further provide that in the event such funds provided by an agency of the United States government shall terminate prior to complete repayment of a loan or deferred loan made pursuant to this subsection, the remaining balance of such loan shall be deemed to be a grant-in-aid.

None of said bonds shall be authorized except upon a finding by the State Bond Commission that there has been filed with it a request for such authorization, which is signed by or on behalf of the Commissioner of Housing and states such terms and conditions as said commission, in its discretion, may require. Said bonds issued pursuant to this section shall be general obligations of the state and the full faith and credit of the state of Connecticut are pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on said bonds as the same become due, and accordingly and as part of the contract of the state with the holders of said bonds, appropriation of all amounts necessary for punctual payment of such principal and interest is hereby made, and the Treasurer shall pay such principal and interest as the same become due.\n\n(d) The proceeds from the sale of the bonds and notes authorized by subsection (c) of this section, except refunding bonds and notes, shall be deposited in a fund designated the “Rental Rehabilitation Fund”, which fund shall be used to make the grants, loans and deferred loans authorized by subsection (b) of this section.

An authority shall fix the rentals for dwelling in its projects at no higher rates than it finds to be necessary in order to produce revenues which, together with all other available money, revenues, income and receipts of the authority from whatever sources derived, will be sufficient (1) to pay, as the same become due, the principal and interest on the bonds of the authority; (2) to meet the cost of, and to provide for, maintaining and operating the projects, including the cost of any insurance, and the administrative expenses of the authority; and (3) to create, during not less than six years immediately succeeding its issuance of any bonds, a reserve sufficient to meet the largest principal and interest payments which will be due on such bonds in any one year thereafter and to maintain such reserve.\n\n(b) In the operation or management of housing projects an authority shall, at all times, rent or lease the dwelling accommodations therein at rentals within the financial reach of families of low income. The authority, subject to approval by the Commissioner of Housing, shall fix maximum income limits for the admission and for the continued occupancy of families in such housing, provided such maximum income limits and all revisions thereof for housing projects operated pursuant to any contract with any agency of the federal government shall be subject to the prior approval of such federal agency. The commissioner shall define the income of a family to provide the basis for determining eligibility for the admission and for the continued occupancy of families under the maximum income limits fixed and approved. The definition of family income by the commissioner may provide for the exclusion of all or part of the income of family members which, in the judgment of the commissioner, is not generally available to meet the cost of basic living needs of the family.\n\n(c) Any housing authority administering a tenant-based rental assistance program, such as the federal Housing Choice Voucher program, shall, not later than thirty days after setting or updating the payment standard, as defined in 24 CFR 982.4, or any similar maximum monthly assistance payment for a dwelling accommodation, post such payment standard in a prominent and publicly accessible location on its Internet web site or the Internet web site of the municipality in which such authority is located.

Upon written request of an eligible tenant, the housing authority shall deposit in a non-interest-bearing escrow account for such tenant in a financial institution an amount equal to the difference between the rent due to the authority from the tenant and the fair market rental for a dwelling unit of equivalent size for the area established under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended. Each deposit into a tenant escrow account shall be made from rent payments received by the housing authority from the tenant. The funds in such account shall be used by the tenant to rent a private dwelling unit or for a down payment for a home. The written request shall state the amount the tenant determines to be sufficient to rent a private dwelling unit or to make a down payment for a home. Upon written request of the tenant, the director may revise such amount once a year, on or after the time the account reaches one hundred per cent of such amount or at such other time the director of the housing authority deems appropriate. Such revision shall be based on rental and sales price levels for housing in the area.\n\n(c) The director of the housing authority shall notify the tenant, in writing, when the balance in such account equals seventy-five per cent of the amount specified by the tenant in the notice to the authority under subsection (b) of this section. The authority shall also provide written notice to the tenant when the balance equals such specified amount. No deposit shall be made by the authority into a tenant escrow account in excess of such specified amount. The director shall annually provide the tenant with a report stating the balance in the account.\n\n(d) After receipt of notice that the balance in the account equals the specified amount, the tenant shall have one hundred eighty days to vacate the unit in the housing project. If the tenant fails to vacate, the funds in the account shall revert to the housing authority. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section to the contrary, the director shall extend the time period to vacate if additional time is needed for the tenant to find other housing or for other good cause.\n\n(e) Prior to vacating his dwelling unit, the tenant shall submit to the director documentation satisfactory to the director that the funds in the account shall be used for rental of a private dwelling unit or for a down payment on a house. The director shall remit the funds in the escrow account to the tenant upon receipt of such documentation.\n\n(f) The director shall order reversion to the housing authority of the funds in any escrow account established under this section (1) not less than one hundred eighty days after the tenant receives notice that the account equals the specified amount unless such time limit has been extended pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, (2) upon receipt by the tenant of a written finding by the director that it is not reasonable to expect the balance to ever equal the specified amount because of a financial hardship experienced by the tenant or (3) if the tenant becomes thirty days in arrears in his rental payments to the authority. In the case of reversion under subdivision (3) of this subsection, if, within one hundred twenty days of reversion, or later, as permitted by the director for good cause shown, the tenant pays to the authority all amounts in arrears, such escrow account shall be reinstated with the same balance as of the date of reversion.\n\n(g) Each housing authority shall establish written procedures to implement this section. Such procedures shall include provisions for tenants to dispute an action by a housing authority made under this section.\n\n(h) On or before November 1, 1992, and annually thereafter, the director of each housing authority shall submit a report to the Commissioner of Housing on the tenant escrow account program administered by the housing authority.\n\n(P.A. 91-202; P.A. 92-101; P.A. 95-250, S. 1; P.A. 96-211, S. 1, 5, 6; P.A. 13-234, S. 2.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 92-101 amended Subsec.

If such sale, assignment, transfer or conveyance takes place within seven years of the original purchase, the state, acting by and in the discretion of the commissioner, may recapture a portion of the assistance it provided to finance the purchase of the unit, to be determined as follows: The original purchaser shall pay to the state an amount equal to the sum of (1) additional interest representing the difference between the actual interest paid by the original purchaser on the permanent mortgage loan and the interest that the original purchaser would have paid had the terms of the mortgage loan required interest at a rate of eight per cent per annum, from the date of execution of the mortgage loan to the date of prepayment of the mortgage loan; and (2) fifty per cent of the net appreciation if the unit is resold in the first, second or third year, thirty per cent of the net appreciation if the unit is resold in the fourth or fifth year and twenty per cent of the net appreciation if the unit is resold in the sixth or seventh year following the original purchase. Notwithstanding the provisions contained in this subsection, the total amount of such recapture shall not exceed the net gain realized upon the resale of the unit. Permanent mortgage documents provided to original purchasers on and after July 1, 1987, shall contain provisions necessary to fulfill the requirements of this subsection.\n\n(e) The proceeds of any sale of any project, or of any part thereof, the cost of which was financed with a loan or deferred loan by the state to a housing authority, after payment of all necessary expenses incident to such sale, shall be applied to liquidate the outstanding balance of such loan or deferred loan. To this end, the authority shall endorse each purchase money note received by the authority in payment of the purchase price to the order of the state without recourse and shall deliver such note, together with a duly executed assignment of the mortgage securing the same, to the Commissioner of Housing, and the State Treasurer shall credit the face amount of such note as having been paid upon such loan. If the proceeds of the sale of such project or of any part thereof, including as such proceeds the face amount of any purchase money note received by an authority and endorsed and delivered by it to the Commissioner of Housing, as aforesaid, are more than sufficient to liquidate the outstanding balance of such loan, such proceeds shall be applied toward the outstanding balance, if any, on any loan or deferred loan made pursuant to this part on any other project owned and operated by such authority. If any balance remains after all such loans or deferred loans have been liquidated, an amount equal to one-half of any balance remaining shall be retained by or paid over to the state and an amount equal to the remaining one-half of such balance shall be retained by or paid over to the authority for payment by it to the municipality in which the project is located. The proceeds of the sale of any project the cost of which was financed by notes or bonds issued by the authority and guaranteed by the state, or of any part thereof, after payment of all necessary expenses incident to such sale, shall be applied so far as practicable to the redemption of all such outstanding notes or bonds. If such proceeds are more than sufficient to redeem all such outstanding notes and bonds, one-half of any balance remaining shall be paid over to the state and the remaining one-half of such balance shall be paid over to the authority for payment by it to the municipality in which the project is located. If such proceeds are insufficient for complete redemption of such notes and bonds, any balance remaining after redemption of the largest possible amount thereof shall be paid over to the state. No such sales shall affect the obligation of the authority upon such notes or bonds or the obligation of the state on its guarantee thereof.

Such bonds and notes shall be issued at such times, in such amounts and denominations, subject to such redemption provisions with or without premium and maturing at such time or times as shall be determined by said commission, and shall be subject to such further conditions and be secured by such covenants and agreement, on behalf of the state as the State Bond Commission determines will tend to make the bonds and notes more marketable. The full faith and credit of the state is pledged for the payment of the principal and interest on said bonds and notes as the same become due.\n\n(b) Such bond shall be sold at not less than par and accrued interest, shall be issued as serial or term bonds or any combination thereof, shall be in such form, either coupon or registered and carry such conversion or registration privileges, shall bear interest at such rate or rates and on such date or dates as the State Bond Commission shall determine, shall be payable at the Treasurer's office in Hartford and at such other place or places as the Treasurer may determine on dates to be determined by the State Bond Commission and shall be signed in the name of the state by the Governor, the State Treasurer and the Comptroller manually or by facsimile signature.\n\n(c) The State Treasurer shall, at least ten days before the date of issue of any bonds, advertise for proposals for bids for such portion of such bonds as has been determined to be issued at such date, such proposals to be under seal and opened in public by said Treasurer at some time and place by him appointed. Such bids shall contain proposals for the rate of interest to be paid on the interest coupons and shall be submitted in eighths of one per cent and multiples thereof. The State Treasurer shall have the power to reject any and all bids and to readvertise for the sale of such bonds.\n\n(d) Such notes shall be sold at not less than par and accrued interest, shall be in such form as may be determined by the State Bond Commission and shall be signed in the name of the state by the State Treasurer or his deputy. They shall be sold at public sale on such notice and terms as said commission shall determine and the Treasurer shall have the power to reject any and all bids and to readvertise the sale of such notes.\n\n(e) The proceeds from the sale of such bonds and notes, except refunding bonds and notes, shall be deposited in a fund designated the “Rental Housing Fund”, which fund shall be used to provide the state financial assistance authorized by section 8-70. Payments from the fund to eligible developers shall be made by the State Treasurer on certification of the Commissioner of Housing in accordance with the contract for financial assistance between the state and such developer. All payments by a developer of interest and principal on loans by the state and of state service charges, as authorized by section 8-70, shall be paid to the State Treasurer for deposit in said fund. State service charges, as authorized by section 8-72, shall be paid to the State Treasurer for deposit in the Housing Repayment and Revolving Loan Fund. The principal of, and interest on, bonds and notes referred to in subsection (a) of this section, not paid from refunding bonds and notes, shall be paid first out of the moneys in the Rental Housing Fund, and if in any year said fund is not sufficient, then such deficit shall be paid from the General Fund of the state; and if in any year said fund is more than sufficient to meet the principal of the bonds and notes maturing in such year and the interest thereon, the excess shall be applied to the payment of, and principal on, the bonds and notes maturing in any succeeding year or years. Notwithstanding the next preceding sentence, whenever the State Bond Commission authorizes the issuance of a series of bonds which consist of or include term bonds, it shall determine whether or not the annual sinking fund requirement for such term bonds shall be paid out of the moneys in the Rental Housing Fund or out of moneys in the General Fund of the state; if the State Bond Commission determines not to use such moneys in said Rental Housing Fund therefor, such moneys shall be used and expended to pay interest and redemption premium, if any, on any rental housing bonds or notes, or the principal of any rental housing notes or serial bonds, or the principal upon redemption of such term bonds, or to purchase and retire any rental housing bond at a price not to exceed the principal amount thereof and, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions may be used in whole or in part in any year to assist housing projects in the state upon the prior approval of the State Bond Commission of a request by the Commissioner of Housing which request shall briefly identify the projects and state the amount of such moneys to be used and expended therefor. Amounts paid from the General Fund to cover any deficits in the Rental Housing Fund, including any such amounts paid prior to July 1, 1994, shall be deemed appropriated for such purpose.\n\n(f) The State Treasurer is authorized to invest such moneys in the Rental Housing Fund as he deems to be available for such purpose in obligations of or guaranteed by the state or the United States of America or agencies or instrumentalities thereof and, without limitation on the foregoing, in such other obligations, including time deposits or certificates of deposit, as may be permitted investments by the Treasurer for the General Fund of the state and secured in such manner as the Treasurer may require.\n\n(g) Whenever the State Bond Commission authorizes the issuance of a series of bonds which consist of or include term bonds, the commission shall establish by resolution a sinking fund for such series which fund shall be held as the commission shall determine, by a trustee or by the Treasurer separate and apart from other funds of the state and shall be used and applied only to the payment of principal of and redemption premium, if any, on the term bonds of such series whether at maturity or on the redemption date thereof. The amount of the annual sinking fund requirement for the outstanding term bonds of such series shall be determined by the commission in such resolution but shall not be less than an amount which, computed from the date of such term bonds or from the last maturity date of any serial bonds of such series of bonds, whichever is later, would if thereafter annually contributed to such fund, with the fund and with the accumulations thereon invested at a rate of four per cent per annum, produce at the date of maturity of such term bonds an amount equal to the amount of such term bonds and shall be deposited in the sinking fund from the General Fund of the state annually commencing one year after the date of the bonds or after the last maturity date of any serial bonds of such series of bonds, whichever is later. Any part of the annual sinking fund requirement, which arises from deposit in the sinking fund of moneys from the Rental Housing Fund, when permitted pursuant to this section, shall be deducted from the amount of the annual sinking fund requirement to be paid from the General Fund of the state. Appropriation of all amounts necessary to meet the annual sinking fund requirement is hereby made and the State Bond Commission is hereby authorized to include as part of the contract of the state with the holders of such term bonds, provisions as to the pledging, or the application, use and disposition of all or any part of the sinking fund. The state pledges to and agrees with the holders of such term bonds that, from and after the date of issuance of any bonds for which a pledge of the moneys in the sinking fund has been made and until all such bonds together with interest thereon, with interest on any unpaid installments of interest and of costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceedings by or on behalf of such holders are fully met and discharged, or unless expressly permitted or otherwise authorized by the terms of each contract and agreement made or entered into by or on behalf of the state with or for the benefit of such holders, the state (1) will not limit or alter the duties imposed upon the Treasurer or other officers of the state or a trustee with respect to the application hereunder of the sinking fund and the moneys therein, (2) will carry out and perform or cause to be carried out and performed each and every promise, covenant and agreement entered into by the state or on its behalf pursuant to this section and on its behalf to be performed and (3) will not in any way impair the rights, exemptions and remedies of such holders. Any pledge made by or pursuant to this section shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made. Moneys pledged pursuant to this section and thereafter received shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the state or any officer thereof irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded. Pending use or application of moneys in said sinking fund as hereinabove directed, and subject to any agreement or covenant with the bond holders, such moneys shall be invested or reinvested by the Treasurer in bonds and other obligations of, or guaranteed by, the state or the United States of America or agencies or instrumentalities thereof or any other obligation, including time deposits and certificates of deposit, as may be permitted investments for the General Fund of the state or in accordance with the law governing the investment of savings banks or when deemed prudent, by the Treasurer, in accordance with the law governing the investment of trust funds and shall be secured in such manner as the Treasurer may require. Obligations purchased as such investment of moneys in said fund shall be held at all times as part of said fund and the interest thereon and any other gain arising from the sale thereof shall be credited to said fund and any loss resulting from the sale thereof shall be debited to said fund and the amount of such gain or loss shall decrease or increase the next annual sinking fund requirement by such amount, as the case may be, and notwithstanding any other provision of this section any net gain in any year arising from such crediting and debiting in excess of the next annual sinking fund requirement at the direction of the Treasurer may be used to pay interest on the term bonds.\n\n(h) For the purposes of this section, bonds of a series which are payable in installments in the next successive years from the date of all bonds of such series shall be known as “serial bonds”. All other bonds of such series shall be known as “term bonds”.\n\n(i) The right is expressly reserved at any time to alter, amend or repeal this section unless bonds, for which provisions as to a pledge, or the application, use and disposition of all or any part of the sinking fund has been made, have theretofore been issued and then remain outstanding, provided, if such provisions are made with respect to the sinking fund, the State Bond Commission may, in the resolution authorizing such bonds, reserve for the state the right to alter and amend such provisions to permit the application and use of moneys in the sinking fund to pay the principal and redemption premium, if any, on other term bonds of the state, whether at maturity or on the redemption date thereof.\n\n(j) The bonds issued pursuant to this section are made and declared to be (1) legal investments for savings banks and trustees unless otherwise provided in the instrument creating the trust, (2) securities in which all public officers and bodies, all insurance companies and associations and persons carrying on an insurance business, all banks, bankers, trust companies, savings banks and savings associations, including savings and loan associations, investment companies and persons carrying on a banking or investment business, all administrators, guardians, executors, trustees and other fiduciaries and all persons whatsoever who are or may be authorized to invest in bonds of the state, may properly and legally invest funds including capital in their control or belonging to them, and (3) securities which may be deposited with and shall be received by all public officers and bodies for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds of the state is or may be authorized.\n\n(k) All such bonds, their transfer and the income therefrom, including any profit on the sale or transfer thereof, shall at all times be exempt from all taxation by the state or under its authority.\n\n(1949, October, 1949, March, 1950, 1951, 1953, S. 455d; 1963, P.A. 54, S. 3; 1967, P.A. 522, S. 8; 1972, P.A. 245, S. 1; P.A. 73-598, S. 1, 3; P.A. 77-614, S. 284, 610; P.A. 78-303, S. 81, 136; 78-304, S. 17, 22; P.A. 79-598, S. 3, 4, 10; P.A. 80-382, S. 2, 3; 80-483, S. 24, 186; P.A. 81-370, S. 2, 13; P.A. 85-52, S. 1, 2; P.A. 86-307, S. 6, 12; 86-403, S. 16, 132; P.A. 90-238, S. 5, 32; P.A. 94-173, S. 4, 5; P.A. 95-250, S. 1; P.A. 96-211, S. 1, 5, 6; P.A. 13-234, S. 2.)\n\nHistory: 1963 act deleted provision in Subsec.
