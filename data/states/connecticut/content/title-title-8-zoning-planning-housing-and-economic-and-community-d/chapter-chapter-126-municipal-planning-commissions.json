      "text": "As used in this chapter: “Commission” means a planning commission; “municipality” includes a city, town or borough or a district establishing a planning commission under section 7-326; “subdivision” means the division of a tract or parcel of land into three or more parts or lots made subsequent to the adoption of subdivision regulations by the commission, for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale or building development expressly excluding development for municipal, conservation or agricultural purposes, and includes resubdivision; “resubdivision” means a change in a map of an approved or recorded subdivision or resubdivision if such change (a) affects any street layout shown on such map, (b) affects any area reserved thereon for public use or (c) diminishes the size of any lot shown thereon and creates an additional building lot, if any of the lots shown thereon have been conveyed after the approval or recording of such map; “cluster development” means a building pattern concentrating units on a particular portion of a parcel so that at least one-third of the parcel remains as open space to be used exclusively for recreational, conservation and agricultural purposes except that nothing herein shall prevent any municipality from requiring more than one-third open space in any particular cluster development; “town” and “selectmen” include district and officers of such district, respectively.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 853; 1953, S. 384d; 1959, P.A. 577, S. 2; 679, S. 1; 1967, P.A. 221; 677, S. 1; P.A. 77-545, S. 1; P.A. 91-395, S. 2, 11.)\n\nHistory: 1959 acts added district to definition of municipality, added words “parts or” before “lots” in definition of subdivision and added definition of town and selectmen; 1967 acts included changes which create additional building lot or lots in definition of “resubdivision” and excluded development for municipal and conservation purposes from definition of “subdivision”; P.A. 77-545 redefined “subdivision” to specify divisions made after adoption of subdivision regulations by commission; P.A. 91-395 added the definition of “cluster development”.\n\nDefinition of subdivision and resubdivision discussed. 146 C. 570. Cited. 149 C. 630. There is no authority for commission to adopt as a regulation definition of “subdivision” which modifies, restricts or enlarges upon statutory definition. 151 C. 450. Cited. 172 C. 60; 219 C. 303; 222 C. 216; Id., 294; 227 C. 601. Appropriate inquiry under section is whether one lot has been divided into 3 or more units, not whether topography of lot is maintained or the degree of lot line adjustment. 330 C. 502.\n\nCited. 5 CA 509; 8 CA 556; 18 CA 159; 20 CA 462; 23 CA 75; 29 CA 28. A map is not a resubdivision unless it alters a “subdivision”. 173 CA 256. The mere changing of lot lines or adding additional land to lots, no matter how sizeable, does not constitute a “subdivision”; Legislature intended the word “parts” to refer to separate but whole, not fractional, members of a tract of land, thus, when the word “parts” is read in light of its commonly approved usage and together with the definition of “resubdivision” under this section, its meaning is plain and unambiguous, and is to be read together with the word “lots” so as to clarify the latter's meaning. 199 CA 115.\n\nCited. 43 CS 508.",

The area of jurisdiction of a planning commission created by a town includes any city or borough therein without a legally constituted planning commission for all planning purposes except those specified in sections 8-24 and 8-29. Powers granted under said sections may be delegated by the legislative body of such city or borough to the planning commission of the town in which such city or borough is situated. Any city or borough in which a planning commission has been previously established may, by ordinance, designate the commission established under this section in the town in which such city or borough is situated to be the planning commission of such city or borough, and such commission shall supersede the planning commission previously established in such city or borough. The commission shall elect a chairman and a secretary from its members, shall adopt rules for the transaction of business and shall keep a public record of its activities.

      "text": "(a) No subdivision of land shall be made until a plan for such subdivision has been approved by the commission. Any person, firm or corporation making any subdivision of land without the approval of the commission shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars for each lot sold or offered for sale or so subdivided. Any plan for subdivision shall, upon approval, or when taken as approved by reason of the failure of the commission to act, be filed or recorded by the applicant in the office of the town clerk not later than ninety days after the expiration of the appeal period under section 8-8, or in the case of an appeal, not later than ninety days after the termination of such appeal by dismissal, withdrawal or judgment in favor of the applicant but, if it is a plan for subdivision wholly or partially within a district, it shall be filed in the offices of both the district clerk and the town clerk, and any plan not so filed or recorded within the prescribed time shall become null and void, except that the commission may extend the time for such filing for two additional periods of ninety days and the plan shall remain valid until the expiration of such extended time. All such plans shall be delivered to the applicant for filing or recording not more than thirty days after the time for taking an appeal from the action of the commission has elapsed or not more than thirty days after the date that plans modified in accordance with the commission's approval and that comply with section 7-31 are delivered to the commission, whichever is later, and in the event of an appeal, not more than thirty days after the termination of such appeal by dismissal, withdrawal or judgment in favor of the applicant or not more than thirty days after the date that plans modified in accordance with the commission's approval and that comply with section 7-31 are delivered to the commission, whichever is later. No such plan shall be recorded or filed by the town clerk or district clerk or other officer authorized to record or file plans until its approval has been endorsed thereon by the chairman or secretary of the commission, and the filing or recording of a subdivision plan without such approval shall be void. Before exercising the powers granted in this section, the commission shall adopt regulations covering the subdivision of land. No such regulations shall become effective until after a public hearing held in accordance with the provisions of section 8-7d. Such regulations shall provide that the land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used for building purposes without danger to health or the public safety, that proper provision shall be made for water, sewerage and drainage, including the upgrading of any downstream ditch, culvert or other drainage structure which, through the introduction of additional drainage due to such subdivision, becomes undersized and creates the potential for flooding on a state highway, and, in areas contiguous to brooks, rivers or other bodies of water subject to flooding, including tidal flooding, that proper provision shall be made for protective flood control measures and that the proposed streets are in harmony with existing or proposed principal thoroughfares shown in the plan of conservation and development as described in section 8-23, especially in regard to safe intersections with such thoroughfares, and so arranged and of such width, as to provide an adequate and convenient system for present and prospective traffic needs. Such regulations shall also provide that the commission may require the provision of open spaces, parks and playgrounds when, and in places, deemed proper by the planning commission, which open spaces, parks and playgrounds shall be shown on the subdivision plan. Such regulations may, with the approval of the commission, authorize the applicant to pay a fee to the municipality or pay a fee to the municipality and transfer land to the municipality in lieu of any requirement to provide open spaces. Such payment or combination of payment and the fair market value of land transferred shall be equal to not more than ten per cent of the fair market value of the land to be subdivided prior to the approval of the subdivision. The fair market value shall be determined by an appraiser jointly selected by the commission and the applicant. A fraction of such payment the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the number of approved parcels in the subdivision shall be made at the time of the sale of each approved parcel of land in the subdivision and placed in a fund in accordance with the provisions of section 8-25b. The open space requirements of this section shall not apply if the transfer of all land in a subdivision of less than five parcels is to a parent, child, brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle or first cousin for no consideration, or if the subdivision is to contain affordable housing, as defined in section 8-39a, equal to twenty per cent or more of the total housing to be constructed in such subdivision. Such regulations, on and after July 1, 1985, shall provide that proper provision be made for soil erosion and sediment control pursuant to section 22a-329. Such regulations shall not impose conditions and requirements on manufactured homes having as their narrowest dimension twenty-two feet or more and built in accordance with federal manufactured home construction and safety standards or on lots containing such manufactured homes which are substantially different from conditions and requirements imposed on single-family dwellings and lots containing single-family dwellings. Such regulations shall not impose conditions and requirements on developments to be occupied by manufactured homes having as their narrowest dimension twenty-two feet or more and built in accordance with federal manufactured home construction and safety standards which are substantially different from conditions and requirements imposed on multifamily dwellings, lots containing multifamily dwellings, cluster developments or planned unit developments. The commission may also prescribe the extent to which and the manner in which streets shall be graded and improved and public utilities and services provided and, in lieu of the completion of such work and installations previous to the final approval of a plan, the commission may accept a financial guarantee of such work and installations in an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to it securing to the municipality the actual construction, maintenance and installation of such public improvements and utilities within a period specified in the financial guarantee. Such regulations may provide, in lieu of the completion of the work and installations above referred to, previous to the final approval of a plan, for an assessment or other method whereby the municipality is put in an assured position to do such work and make such installations at the expense of the owners of the property within the subdivision. Such regulations may provide that in lieu of either the completion of the work or the furnishing of a financial guarantee as provided in this section, the commission may authorize the filing of a plan with a conditional approval endorsed thereon. Such approval shall be conditioned on (1) the actual construction, maintenance and installation of any improvements or utilities prescribed by the commission, or (2) the provision of a financial guarantee as provided in this section. Upon the occurrence of either of such events, the commission shall cause a final approval to be endorsed thereon in the manner provided by this section. Any such conditional approval shall lapse five years from the date it is granted, provided the applicant may apply for and the commission may, in its discretion, grant a renewal of such conditional approval for an additional period of five years at the end of any five-year period, except that the commission may, by regulation, provide for a shorter period of conditional approval or renewal of such approval. Any person who enters into a contract for the purchase of any lot subdivided pursuant to a conditional approval may rescind such contract by delivering a written notice of rescission to the seller not later than three days after receipt of written notice of final approval if such final approval has additional amendments or any conditions that were not included in the conditional approval and are unacceptable to the buyer. Any person, firm or corporation who, prior to such final approval, transfers title to any lot subdivided pursuant to a conditional approval shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars for each lot transferred. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the marketing of any lot prior to the granting of conditional approval or renewal of such conditional approval.\n\n(b) The regulations adopted under subsection (a) of this section shall also encourage energy-efficient patterns of development and land use, the use of solar and other renewable forms of energy, and energy conservation. The regulations shall require any person submitting a plan for a subdivision to the commission under subsection (a) of this section to demonstrate to the commission that such person has considered, in developing the plan, using passive solar energy techniques which would not significantly increase the cost of the housing to the buyer, after tax credits, subsidies and exemptions. As used in this subsection and section 8-2, “passive solar energy techniques” means site design techniques which maximize solar heat gain, minimize heat loss and provide thermal storage within a building during the heating season and minimize heat gain and provide for natural ventilation during the cooling season. The site design techniques shall include, but not be limited to: (1) House orientation; (2) street and lot layout; (3) vegetation; (4) natural and man-made topographical features; and (5) protection of solar access within the development.\n\n(c) The regulations adopted under subsection (a) of this section, may, to the extent consistent with soil types, terrain, infrastructure capacity and the plan of development for the community, provide for cluster development, and may provide for incentives for cluster development such as density bonuses, or may require cluster development.\n\n(d) (1) To satisfy any financial guarantee requirement in this section, the commission may accept surety bonds and shall accept cash bonds, passbook or statement savings accounts and other financial guarantees other than surety bonds including, but not limited to, letters of credit, provided such financial guarantee is in a form acceptable to the commission and the financial institution or other entity issuing any letter of credit is acceptable to the commission. Such financial guarantee may, at the discretion of the person posting such financial guarantee, be posted at any time before all approved public improvements and utilities are completed, except that the commission may require a financial guarantee for erosion and sediment controls prior to the commencement of any improvements. No lot shall be transferred to a buyer before any required financial guarantee is posted or before the approved public improvements and utilities are completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the commission or its agent. For any subdivision that is approved for development in phases, the financial guarantee provisions of this section shall apply as if each phase was approved as a separate subdivision. Notwithstanding the provisions of any special act, municipal charter or ordinance, no commission shall (A) require a financial guarantee or payment to finance the maintenance of roads, streets, retention or detention basins or other improvements approved with such subdivision for more than one year after the date on which such improvements have been completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the commission or its agent or accepted by the municipality, or (B) require the establishment of a homeowners association or the placement of a deed restriction, easement or similar burden on property for the maintenance of approved public site improvements to be owned, operated or maintained by the municipality, except that the prohibition of this subparagraph shall not apply to the placement of a deed restriction, easement or similar burden necessary to grant a municipality access to such approved site improvements.\n\n(2) If the person posting a financial guarantee under this section requests a release of all or a portion of such financial guarantee, the commission or its agent shall, not later than sixty-five days after receiving such request, (A) release or authorize the release of any such financial guarantee or portion thereof, provided the commission or its agent is reasonably satisfied that the improvements for which such financial guarantee or portion thereof was posted have been completed, or (B) provide the person posting such financial guarantee with a written explanation as to the additional improvements that must be completed before such financial guarantee or portion thereof may be released.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 858; November, 1955, S.

Fact that a performance bond was provided pursuant to statute that protects municipalities from being left with inadequate resources to complete subdivision improvements, coupled with unambiguous language of the bond, clearly supports conclusion that the bond was available to plaintiff to complete the subdivision even though plaintiff had become a successor developer. 71 CA 715. Planning commission cannot enact subdivision regulation that effectively amends or alters a zoning ordinance because commission would be exceeding its statutory mandate. 76 CA 280.

The commission shall have the authority to determine whether the existing division of any land constitutes a subdivision or resubdivision under the provisions of this chapter, provided nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorize the commission to approve any such subdivision or resubdivision which conflicts with applicable zoning regulations. Such regulations may contain provisions whereby the commission may waive certain requirements under the regulations by a three-quarters vote of all the members of the commission in cases where conditions exist which affect the subject land and are not generally applicable to other land in the area, provided that the regulations shall specify the conditions under which a waiver may be considered and shall provide that no waiver shall be granted that would have a significant adverse effect on adjacent property or on public health and safety. The commission shall state upon its records the reasons for which a waiver is granted in each case.\n\n(b) The commission may establish a schedule of fees and charge such fees. The amount of the fees shall be sufficient to cover the costs of processing subdivision applications, including, but not limited to, the cost of registered or certified mailings and the publication of notices, and the costs of inspecting subdivision improvements.

Notice of the decision of the commission shall be published in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the municipality and addressed by certified mail to any person applying to the commission under this section, by its secretary or clerk, under his signature in any written, printed, typewritten or stamped form, within fifteen days after such decision has been rendered. In any case in which such notice is not published within such fifteen-day period, the person who made such application may provide for the publication of such notice within ten days thereafter. Such notice shall be a simple statement that such application was approved, modified and approved or disapproved, together with the date of such action. The failure of the commission to act thereon shall be considered as an approval, and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the commission on demand. The grounds for its action shall be stated in the records of the commission. No planning commission shall be required to consider an application for approval of a subdivision plan while another application for subdivision of the same or substantially the same parcel is pending before the commission.
