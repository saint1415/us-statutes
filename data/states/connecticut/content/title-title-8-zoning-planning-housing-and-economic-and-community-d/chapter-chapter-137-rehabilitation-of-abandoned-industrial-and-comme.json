It is further found that the abandonment and forfeiture of real properties with structures thereon is adversely affecting the economic well being of the municipalities and is inimical to the health, safety and welfare of the residents of this state. It is further found that many of the vacant and abandoned buildings can be rehabilitated, reconstructed or reused so as to provide safe and productive industrial or commercial facilities and that such rehabilitation, reconstruction or reuse would eliminate, remedy and prevent the adverse conditions described above. It is further found that private enterprise has not been able to undertake and carry out the rehabilitation, reconstruction or reuse of abandoned and vacant industrial or commercial buildings within the blighted or dilapidated areas of the municipalities of this state and that the provisions of this chapter are necessary and in the public interest.\n\n(P.A. 77-503, S. 1.)",
