Zoning regulations adopted prior to new charter which contains no zoning regulation powers, prevail over charter and zoning commission could appoint its own agent as zoning enforcement officer of the town. 28 CS 278. Cited. Id., 419.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nOnce municipality adopts provisions of chapter and establishes a zoning commission which then commences its functions in accordance with chapter, commission is not subject to interference by municipality's legislative body; municipality's legislative body may not substitute its judgment for that of commission in a matter involving use of municipality's land. 49 CS 183.",

In any case in which such notice is not published within the fifteen-day period after a decision has been rendered, any applicant or petitioner may provide for the publication of such notice within ten days thereafter.\n\n(e) (1) The zoning commission shall provide for the manner in which the zoning regulations shall be enforced, except that any person newly appointed as a zoning enforcement officer on or after January 1, 2024, shall be certified in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n(2) Beginning January 1, 2024, and annually thereafter, each person newly appointed as a zoning enforcement officer shall obtain, as soon as practicable after such appointment, certification from the Connecticut Association of Zoning Enforcement Officials and maintain such certification for the duration of such person's employment as a zoning enforcement officer.\n\n(f) No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a building, use or structure subject to the zoning regulations of a municipality without certification in writing by the official charged with the enforcement of such regulations that such building, use or structure is in conformity with such regulations or is a valid nonconforming use under such regulations. Such official shall inform the applicant for any such certification that such applicant may provide notice of such certification by either (1) publication in a newspaper having substantial circulation in such municipality stating that the certification has been issued, or (2) any other method provided for by local ordinance. Any such notice shall contain (A) a description of the building, use or structure, (B) the location of the building, use or structure, (C) the identity of the applicant, and (D) a statement that an aggrieved person may appeal to the zoning board of appeals in accordance with the provisions of section 8-7.\n\n(g) (1) The zoning regulations may require that a site plan be filed with the commission or other municipal agency or official to aid in determining the conformity of a proposed building, use or structure with specific provisions of such regulations. If a site plan application involves an activity regulated pursuant to sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, the applicant shall submit an application for a permit to the agency responsible for administration of the inland wetlands regulations not later than the day such application is filed with the zoning commission. The commission shall, within the period of time established in section 8-7d, accept the filing of and shall process, pursuant to section 8-7d, any site plan application involving land regulated as an inland wetland or watercourse under chapter 440. The decision of the zoning commission shall not be rendered on the site plan application until the inland wetlands agency has submitted a report with its final decision. In making its decision, the commission shall give due consideration to the report of the inland wetlands agency and if the commission establishes terms and conditions for approval that are not consistent with the final decision of the inland wetlands agency, the commission shall state on the record the reason for such terms and conditions. A site plan may be modified or denied only if it fails to comply with requirements already set forth in the zoning or inland wetlands regulations. Approval of a site plan shall be presumed unless a decision to deny or modify it is rendered within the period specified in section 8-7d. A certificate of approval of any plan for which the period for approval has expired and on which no action has been taken shall be sent to the applicant within fifteen days of the date on which the period for approval has expired. A decision to deny or modify a site plan shall set forth the reasons for such denial or modification. A copy of any decision shall be sent by certified mail to the person who submitted such plan within fifteen days after such decision is rendered. The zoning commission may, as a condition of approval of a site plan or modified site plan, require a financial guarantee in the form of a bond, a bond with surety or similar instrument to ensure (A) the timely and adequate completion of any site improvements that will be conveyed to or controlled by the municipality, and (B) the implementation of any erosion and sediment controls required during construction activities. The amount of such financial guarantee shall be calculated so as not to exceed the anticipated actual costs for the completion of such site improvements or the implementation of such erosion and sediment controls plus a contingency amount not to exceed ten per cent of such costs. At any time, the commission may grant an extension of time to complete any site improvements. The commission shall publish notice of the approval or denial of site plans in a newspaper having a general circulation in the municipality. In any case in which such notice is not published within the fifteen-day period after a decision has been rendered, the person who submitted such plan may provide for the publication of such notice within ten days thereafter. The provisions of this subsection shall apply to all zoning commissions or other final zoning authority of each municipality whether or not such municipality has adopted the provisions of this chapter or the charter of such municipality or special act establishing zoning in the municipality contains similar provisions.\n\n(2) To satisfy any financial guarantee requirement, the commission may accept surety bonds and shall accept cash bonds, passbook or statement savings accounts and other financial guarantees other than surety bonds including, but not limited to, letters of credit, provided such other financial guarantee is in a form acceptable to the commission and the financial institution or other entity issuing any letter of credit is acceptable to the commission. Such financial guarantee may, at the discretion of the person posting such financial guarantee, be posted at any time before all approved site improvements are completed, except that the commission may require a financial guarantee for erosion and sediment controls prior to the commencement of any such site improvements. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued before a required financial guarantee is posted or the approved site improvements are completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the commission or its agent. For any site plan that is approved for development in phases, the financial guarantee provisions of this section shall apply as if each phase was approved as a separate site plan. Notwithstanding the provisions of any special act, municipal charter or ordinance, no commission shall (A) require a financial guarantee or payment to finance the maintenance of roads, streets, retention or detention basins or other improvements approved with such site plan for more than one year after the date on which such improvements have been completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the commission or its agent or accepted by the municipality, or (B) require the establishment of a homeowners association or the placement of a deed restriction, easement or similar burden on property for the maintenance of approved public site improvements to be owned, operated or maintained by the municipality, except that the prohibition of this subparagraph shall not apply to the placement of a deed restriction, easement or similar burden necessary to grant a municipality access to such approved site improvements.\n\n(3) If the person posting a financial guarantee under this section requests a release of all or a portion of such financial guarantee, the commission or its agent shall, not later than sixty-five days after receiving such request, (A) release or authorize the release of any such financial guarantee or portion thereof, provided the commission or its agent is reasonably satisfied that the site improvements for which such financial guarantee or portion thereof was posted have been completed, or (B) provide the person posting such financial guarantee with a written explanation as to the additional site improvements that must be completed before such financial guarantee or portion thereof may be released.\n\n(h) Notwithstanding the provisions of the general statutes or any public or special act or any local ordinance, when a change is adopted in the zoning regulations or boundaries of zoning districts of any town, city or borough, no improvements or proposed improvements shown on a site plan for residential property which has been approved prior to the effective date of such change, either pursuant to an application for special exception or otherwise, by the zoning commission of such town, city or borough, or other body exercising the powers of such commission, and filed or recorded with the town clerk, shall be required to conform to such change.\n\n(i) In the case of any site plan approved on or after October 1, 1984, except as provided in subsection (j) of this section, all work in connection with such site plan shall be completed within five years after the approval of the plan. The certificate of approval of such site plan shall state the date on which such five-year period expires. Failure to complete all work within such five-year period shall result in automatic expiration of the approval of such site plan, except in the case of any site plan approved on or after October 1, 1989, the zoning commission or other municipal agency or official approving such site plan may grant one or more extensions of the time to complete all or part of the work in connection with the site plan provided the total extension or extensions shall not exceed ten years from the date such site plan is approved. “Work” for purposes of this subsection means all physical improvements required by the approved plan.\n\n(j) In the case of any site plan for a project consisting of four hundred or more dwelling units approved on or after June 19, 1987, all work in connection with such site plan shall be completed within ten years after the approval of the plan. In the case of any commercial, industrial or retail project having an area equal to or greater than four hundred thousand square feet approved on or after October 1, 1988, the zoning commission or other municipal agency or official approving such site plan shall set a date for the completion of all work in connection with such site plan, which date shall be not less than five nor more than ten years from the date of approval of such site plan, provided such commission, agency or official approving such plan and setting a date for completion which is less than ten years from the date of approval may extend the date of completion for an additional period or periods, not to exceed ten years in the aggregate from the date of the original approval of such site plan. The certificate of approval of such site plan shall state the date on which such work shall be completed. Failure to complete all work within such period shall result in automatic expiration of the approval of such site plan. “Work” for purposes of this subsection means all physical improvements required by the approved plan.\n\n(k) A separate zoning district may be established for shorefront land areas utilized for water-dependent uses, as defined in section 22a-93, existing on October 1, 1987. Such district may be composed of a single parcel of land, provided the owner consents to such establishment. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to limit the authority of a zoning commission to establish and apply land use districts for the promotion and protection of water-dependent uses pursuant to section 8-2 and sections 22a-101 to 22a-104, inclusive. The provisions of this subsection shall apply to all zoning commissions or other final zoning authority of each municipality whether or not such municipality has adopted the provisions of this chapter or the charter of such municipality or special act establishing zoning in the municipality contains similar provisions.\n\n(l) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section to the contrary, any site plan approval made under this section on or before October 1, 1989, except an approval made under subsection (j) of this section, shall expire not more than seven years from the date of such approval and the commission may grant one or more extensions of time to complete all or part of the work in connection with such site plan, provided the time for all extensions under this subsection shall not exceed ten years from the date the site plan was approved.\n\n(m) (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any site plan approval made under this section prior to July 1, 2011, that has not expired prior to July 12, 2021, except an approval made under subsection (j) of this section, shall expire not less than fourteen years after the date of such approval and the commission may grant one or more extensions of time to complete all or part of the work in connection with such site plan, provided no approval, including all extensions, shall be valid for more than nineteen years from the date the site plan was approved.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any site plan approval made under this section on or after July 1, 2011, but prior to June 10, 2021, that did not expire prior to March 10, 2020, except an approval made under subsection (j) of this section, shall expire not less than fourteen years after the date of such approval and the commission may grant one or more extensions of time to complete all or part of the work in connection with such site plan, provided no approval, including all extensions, shall be valid for more than nineteen years from the date the site plan was approved.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 838; 1951, 1953, June, 1955, S. 375d; 1957, P.A. 662; 1959, P.A. 452; 577, S. 4; 614, S. 3; February, 1965, P.A. 622, S. 1; 1971, P.A. 862, S. 1; P.A. 77-450, S. 1; 77-509, S. 2; P.A. 78-104, S. 4; P.A. 80-177; P.A. 82-90; P.A. 84-147, S. 1; 84-174; P.A. 86-236, S. 1; P.A. 87-215, S. 2, 7; 87-371, S. 2, 5; 87-474, S. 2; 87-533, S. 7, 14; P.A. 88-105, S. 1; P.A. 89-277, S. 2; 89-356, S. 10, 11; P.A. 91-153, S. 1; P.A. 93-19, S. 1, 3; P.A. 00-145, S. 2; P.A. 02-74, S. 1; 02-77, S. 1; P.A. 03-144, S. 1; 03-177, S. 1; P.A. 06-20, S. 1; P.A. 07-102, S. 1; P.A. 08-38, S. 1; P.A. 09-181, S. 1; P.A. 11-5, S. 1; 11-79, S. 1; P.A. 12-182, S. 1; P.A. 21-29, S. 8; 21-34, S. 3; 21-163, S. 1; P.A. 23-173, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: 1959 acts provided notice of hearing be published “in the form of a legal advertisement appearing” in a newspaper, provided for filing of copy of regulations and proposed regulations in case of district, provided protest of change to be effective must be signed by at least 20% of property owners within 500 feet “in all directions” rather than “in any direction” and that a two-thirds rather than three-quarters vote of commission is needed to overcome protest, allowed petitions for change in regulations as well as boundaries and added “or substantially the same changes” in the last sentence; 1965 act required copy of zoning regulations, boundaries or changes in the case of a district be filed with both district and town clerk and specified notice of decision of commission, rather than of the filing of the regulation, boundary or change, be published; 1971 act required that hearing be held within 65, rather than 90, days after receipt of petition, that decision be made within 65, rather than 90, days after hearing and that extensions not exceed 65 days; P.A. 77-450 made provisions of Sec. 8-7d applicable to changes and amendments and replaced 65 periods for hearing, decision and extension with time period permitted under Sec. 8-7d; P.A. 77-509 divided section into Subsecs., placed provision for filing fee in Subsec.

Trial court properly determined that failure of planning and zoning commission to comply with statutory notice and hearing requirements entitled individual plaintiffs to automatic approval of their application for special permit and site plan approval; notice of commission hearing was invalid and because failure to give proper notice was a jurisdictional defect, action of commission in denying plaintiffs' application was void. 52 CA 763. 15-day notice requirement is substantive, not a matter of procedure or convenience. 55 CA 359.",

Mere financial loss does not constitute hardship warranting granting of variance; but if loss is so great as to amount to confiscation of applicant's property, variance might be justified; hardship warrants granting of variance only if it is different in kind from hardship imposed by regulations on property in general; it must be peculiarly oppressive to applicant's property. 150 C. 391.

In reviewing a zoning board's decision, reviewing court is bound by the substantial evidence rule; the question is not whether trial court would have reached the same conclusion but whether the record before the board supports the decision reached; if trial court finds there is substantial evidence to support board's findings, it cannot substitute its judgment for that of the board; person who seeks a variance must show that because of some unusual characteristic of a person's property, literal enforcement of zoning regulations would result in unusual hardship to such person; the hardship must arise directly out of the application of the regulations to circumstances or conditions beyond such person's control; where extreme hardship has not been established, the reduction of a nonconforming use to a less offensive prohibited use may constitute independent ground for granting a variance; conversion of property use from current nonconforming use as a foundry to prohibited use as automobile repair shop would be less offensive to surrounding residents; decision of board granting variance was proper because it reduced preexisting nonconforming use of property to a less offensive prohibited use. 281 C. 553.\n\nCited. 4 CA 271.

Planning and zoning commission was engaged in act of “enforcement” when it granted applicant's site plan application. 58 CA 399. Plaintiff's claimed financial loss is not valid basis for granting variance from zoning regulations because plaintiff's loss does not rise to an unusual hardship under section. 62 CA 528. Subdiv. (3): Claimed hardship for variance is legal where 20-foot setback requirement on 50-foot lot would limit defendant to constructing 10-foot-wide building in commercial zone, perpetuating property's present nonconforming use as single-family residence in a commercial zone, and where variance is in keeping with town's comprehensive plan. 66 CA 565. Issuance of certificate of zoning compliance by zoning enforcement officer is decision by such officer, and appeal from such decision is expressly permitted by statute. 106 CA 1. Because there was no record of an application to the zoning enforcement officer for a certificate of zoning compliance claiming that parcel at issue was a preexisting, nonconforming lot, and hence no denial of such application and appeal therefrom to the board, the issue of preexisting, nonconforming use was not properly before court; a parcel that was not approved as a buildable lot is not one of the conditions that a variance may be validly used to resolve. 117 CA 569. Errors of architect or contractor that resulted in roof exceeding maximum height requirement are attributable to homeowners because the voluntary acts of architect or contractor were on behalf of the homeowners whom the variance would benefit; hardship was self-created and zoning board of appeals was without authority to grant waiver sought; “de minimis” deviation is not recognized in Connecticut. 126 CA 400. Subdiv. (3): Appeal from denial of petition for a variance was not improperly dismissed where plaintiff's inability to build 4 homes on the property constituted a mere disappointment in use and not an unusual hardship. 149 CA 115.\n\nSubdiv. (3): Where zoning board granted plaintiffs variance from which a successful appeal was taken, fact that plaintiffs had begun construction did not constitute a hardship under section since such construction was begun before expiration of appeal period; no hardship existed by reason of the size, shape and topography of plaintiffs' lot where all properties in the area were similar in size, shape and grade and regulations affected all similar properties in the same manner. 26 CS 255. Subdiv. (3): Financial disappointment insufficient to support granting of variance absent showing strict application of zoning regulations would destroy economic utility of property; property owners purchasing, with knowledge, express or implied, of zoning regulations, cannot be deemed to prevent valid case of exceptional difficulty or unusual hardship since they were aware, in law or in fact, of zoning restrictions prior to taking title to premises. 29 CS 4. Subdiv. (3): It is improper for zoning board of appeals to grant a variance solely on the basis that variance would improve the neighborhood without another finding of hardship. 51 CS 190.",

An appeal may be taken to the zoning board of appeals by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of any municipality aggrieved and shall be taken within such time as is prescribed by a rule adopted by said board, or, if no such rule is adopted by the board, within thirty days, by filing with the zoning commission or the officer from whom the appeal has been taken and with said board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. Such appeal period shall commence for an aggrieved person at the earliest of the following: (1) Upon receipt of the order, requirement or decision from which such person may appeal, (2) upon the publication of a notice in accordance with subsection (f) of section 8-3, or (3) upon actual or constructive notice of such order, requirement or decision. The officer from whom the appeal has been taken shall forthwith transmit to said board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An appeal shall not stay any such order, requirement or decision which prohibits further construction or expansion of a use in violation of such zoning regulations except to such extent that the board grants a stay thereof. An appeal from any other order, requirement or decision shall stay all proceedings in the action appealed from unless the zoning commission or the officer from whom the appeal has been taken certifies to the zoning board of appeals after the notice of appeal has been filed that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed, except by a restraining order which may be granted by a court of record on application, on notice to the zoning commission or the officer from whom the appeal has been taken and on due cause shown. The board shall hold a public hearing on such appeal in accordance with the provisions of section 8-7d. Such board may reverse or affirm wholly or partly or may modify any order, requirement or decision appealed from and shall make such order, requirement or decision as in its opinion should be made in the premises and shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal has been taken but only in accordance with the provisions of this section.

Notice of the decision of the board shall be published in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the municipality and addressed by certified mail to any person who appeals to the board, by its secretary or clerk, under his signature in any written, printed, typewritten or stamped form, within fifteen days after such decision has been rendered. In any case in which such notice is not published within such fifteen-day period, the person who requested or applied for such special exception or variance or took such appeal may provide for the publication of such notice within ten days thereafter.

      "text": "(a) As used in this section:\n\n(1) “Aggrieved person” means a person aggrieved by a decision of a board and includes any officer, department, board or bureau of the municipality charged with enforcement of any order, requirement or decision of the board. In the case of a decision by a zoning commission, planning commission, combined planning and zoning commission or zoning board of appeals, “aggrieved person” includes any person owning land in this state that abuts or is within a radius of one hundred feet of any portion of the land involved in the decision of the board.\n\n(2) “Board” means a municipal zoning commission, planning commission, combined planning and zoning commission, zoning board of appeals or other board or commission the decision of which may be appealed pursuant to this section, or the chief elected official of a municipality, or such official's designee, in a hearing held pursuant to section 22a-250, whose decision may be appealed.\n\n(b) Except as provided in subsections (c), (d) and (r) of this section and sections 7-147 and 7-147i, any person aggrieved by any decision of a board, including a decision to approve or deny a site plan pursuant to subsection (g) of section 8-3 or a special permit or special exception pursuant to section 8-3c, may take an appeal to the superior court for the judicial district in which the municipality is located, notwithstanding any right to appeal to a municipal zoning board of appeals under section 8-6. The appeal shall be commenced by service of process in accordance with subsections (f) and (g) of this section within fifteen days from the date that notice of the decision was published as required by the general statutes. The appeal shall be returned to court in the same manner and within the same period of time as prescribed for civil actions brought to that court.\n\n(c) In those situations where the approval of a planning commission must be inferred because of the failure of the commission to act on an application, any aggrieved person may appeal under this section. The appeal shall be taken within twenty days after the expiration of the period prescribed in section 8-26d for action by the commission.\n\n(d) Any person affected by an action of a planning commission taken under section 8-29 may appeal under this section. The appeal shall be taken within thirty days after notice to such person of the adoption of a survey, map or plan or the assessment of benefits or damages.\n\n(e) The proceedings of the court for an appeal may be stayed by agreement of the parties when a mediation conducted pursuant to section 8-8a commences, provided any such stay shall terminate upon termination of the mediation.\n\n(f) Service of legal process for an appeal under this section shall be directed to a proper officer and shall be made as follows:\n\n(1) For any appeal taken before October 1, 2004, process shall be served by leaving a true and attested copy of the process with, or at the usual place of abode of, the chairman or clerk of the board, and by leaving a true and attested copy with the clerk of the municipality. Service on the chairman or clerk of the board and on the clerk of the municipality shall be for the purpose of providing legal notice of the appeal to the board and shall not thereby make the chairman or clerk of the board or the clerk of the municipality a necessary party to the appeal.\n\n(2) For any appeal taken on or after October 1, 2004, process shall be served in accordance with subdivision (5) of subsection (b) of section 52-57. Such service shall be for the purpose of providing legal notice of the appeal to the board and shall not thereby make the clerk of the municipality or the chairman or clerk of the board a necessary party to the appeal.\n\n(g) Service of process shall also be made on each person who petitioned the board in the proceeding, provided such person's legal rights, duties or privileges were determined therein. However, failure to make service within fifteen days on parties other than the board shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the appeal. If service is not made within fifteen days on a party in the proceeding before the board, the court, on motion of the party or the appellant, shall make such orders of notice of the appeal as are reasonably calculated to notify the party not yet served. If the failure to make service causes prejudice to the board or any party, the court, after hearing, may dismiss the appeal or may make such other orders as are necessary to protect the party prejudiced.\n\n(h) The appeal shall state the reasons on which it has been predicated and shall not stay proceedings on the decision appealed from. However, the court to which the appeal is returnable may grant a restraining order, on application, and after notice to the board and cause shown.\n\n(i) Within thirty days after the return date to court, or within any further time the court allows, the board shall transmit the record to the court. The record shall include, without limitation, (1) the original papers acted on by the board and appealed from, or certified copies thereof, (2) a copy of the transcript of the stenographic or sound recording prepared in accordance with section 8-7a, and (3) the written decision of the board including the reasons therefor and a statement of any conditions imposed. If the board does not provide a transcript of the stenographic or the sound recording of a meeting where the board deliberates or makes a decision on a petition, application or request on which a public hearing was held, a certified, true and accurate transcript of a stenographic or sound recording of the meeting prepared by or on behalf of the applicant or any other party shall be admissible as part of the record. By stipulation of all parties to the appeal, the record may be shortened. A party unreasonably refusing to stipulate to limit the record may be taxed by the court for additional costs. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record.\n\n(j) Any defendant may, at any time after the return date of the appeal, make a motion to dismiss the appeal. If the basis of the motion is a claim that the appellant lacks standing to appeal, the appellant shall have the burden of proving standing. The court may, on the record, grant or deny the motion. The court's order on the motion may be appealed in the manner provided in subsection (o) of this section.\n\n(k) The court shall review the proceedings of the board and shall allow any party to introduce evidence in addition to the contents of the record if (1) the record does not contain a complete transcript of the entire proceedings before the board, including all evidence presented to it, pursuant to section 8-7a, or (2) it appears to the court that additional testimony is necessary for the equitable disposition of the appeal. The court may take the evidence or may appoint a referee or committee to take such evidence as it directs and report the same to the court, with any findings of facts and conclusions of law. Any report of a referee, committee or mediator under subsection (f) of section 8-8a shall constitute a part of the proceedings on which the determination of the court shall be made.\n\n(l) The court, after a hearing thereon, may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may revise, modify or remand the decision from which the appeal was taken in a manner consistent with the evidence in the record before it. In an appeal from an action of a planning commission taken under section 8-29, the court may also reassess any damages or benefits awarded by the commission. Costs shall be allowed against the board if the decision appealed from is reversed, affirmed in part, modified or revised.\n\n(m) Appeals from decisions of the board shall be privileged cases and shall be heard as soon as is practicable unless cause is shown to the contrary.\n\n(n) No appeal taken under subsection (b) of this section shall be withdrawn and no settlement between the parties to any such appeal shall be effective unless and until a hearing has been held before the Superior Court and such court has approved such proposed withdrawal or settlement.\n\n(o) There shall be no right to further review except to the Appellate Court by certification for review, on the vote of three judges of the Appellate Court so to certify and under such other rules as the judges of the Appellate Court establish. The procedure on appeal to the Appellate Court shall, except as otherwise provided herein, be in accordance with the procedures provided by rule or law for the appeal of judgments rendered by the Superior Court unless modified by rule of the judges of the Appellate Court.\n\n(p) The right of a person to appeal a decision of a board to the Superior Court and the procedure prescribed in this section shall be liberally interpreted in any case where a strict adherence to these provisions would work surprise or injustice. The appeal shall be considered to be a civil action and, except as otherwise required by this section or the rules of the Superior Court, pleadings may be filed, amended or corrected, and parties may be summoned, substituted or otherwise joined, as provided by the general statutes.\n\n(q) If any appeal has failed to be heard on its merits because of insufficient service or return of the legal process due to unavoidable accident or the default or neglect of the officer to whom it was committed, or the appeal has been otherwise avoided for any matter of form, the appellant shall be allowed an additional fifteen days from determination of that defect to properly take the appeal. The provisions of section 52-592 shall not apply to appeals taken under this section.\n\n(r) In any case in which a board fails to comply with a requirement of a general or special law, ordinance or regulation governing the content, giving, mailing, publishing, filing or recording of any notice either of a hearing or of an action taken by the board, any appeal or action by an aggrieved person to set aside the decision or action taken by the board on the grounds of such noncompliance shall be taken not more than one year after the date of that decision or action.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 844; 1951, 1955, S. 379d; 1959, P.A. 460, S. 2; 1963, P.A. 45; February, 1965, P.A. 622, S. 3; 1967, P.A. 348; 712; 1971, P.A. 870, S. 9; P.A. 74-183, S. 179, 291; P.A. 76-436, S. 158, 681; P.A. 77-470; P.A. 78-280, S. 1, 127; P.A. 81-165; June Sp.

Power of court to modify or revise does not include power to substitute its own discretion for that of board; must find that board acted illegally or abused discretion. 120 C. 455. Cited. 123 C. 263. Appeal from zoning board is not an action within meaning of Sec. 54-131 which permits a new action when writ abated. 126 C. 603. Under same language in New Haven charter, right of appeal held not to be contingent upon restraining order; no vested right acquired by applicant by virtue of fact no such order was obtained when opponent appealed. 127 C. 309.

If sole basis of plaintiff's grievance was that new business would create competition, he would not be an aggrieved person; any taxpayer of a town who feels aggrieved at granting of license for sale of liquors therein has right of appeal. Id., 160. On an appeal from zoning board of appeals, record made before board should be annexed to, and incorporated by reference in, answer of board; where there is an incompleteness in summary of evidence, court must take evidence to determine what facts and considerations were presumptively in minds of members of board when they acted. Id., 332. Cited. Id., 425, 493. Admissibility of evidence outside of record; wide and liberal discretion in board. Id., 560.

Id.; 149 C. 284. On appeal, court cannot conduct a trial de novo and substitute its findings and conclusions for decision of board. 146 C. 27. Denial of motion to present evidence in addition to record held indicative that additional testimony was not necessary for equitable disposition of appeal. Id., 547. When building met zoning requirements, building inspector exceeded his authority in imposing additional conditions for certificate of occupancy. Id., 570. Scope of authority of committee appointed to take evidence. Id., 588. Action of board held an abuse of discretion since facts did not warrant granting of variance. Id., 595. Aggrievement from which one may appeal does not arise until board has acted. Id., 665. Former statute: On appeal, admission of testimony not presented to commission is within discretion of court; evidence of former applications admissible only when subsequent application seeks substantially same relief. 147 C. 65. Limits of court's power in reviewing refusal of board to grant variance. Id., 469. Cited. 148 C. 33, 299.

Under New Haven charter, person aggrieved by decision of zoning enforcement officer may appeal to board of zoning appeals which shall hear and determine reasonableness of decision; in such case, function of court on appeal from board of appeals is to decide whether board correctly interpreted ordinance and applied it with reasonable discretion to facts. 150 C. 113. Plaintiff has burden of proving that it is aggrieved; this burden requires that it establish that it was specially and injuriously affected in its property rights or other legal rights; it is not sufficient to show that action complained of would permit the operation of business in competition with its business.

Does not shorten legislatively prescribed time period within which plaintiff must serve process on the commission and the municipality, when fifteenth day falls on a day when municipal offices are closed, since to do so would deny plaintiff any remedy and leave it without recourse for what may be an otherwise meritorious appeal. 270 C. 42. Plain language of Subsec. clearly provides that any person statutorily aggrieved may take an appeal; thus, there was no merit to planning and zoning commission's claim that J Co. must be an applicant or partner in proposed project in order to be aggrieved by commission's denial of M's applications. 278 C. 660.\n\nCited. 13 CA 165; 18 CA 99; 24 CA 172; 29 CA 28; 31 CA 643; 35 CA 646; judgment reversed, see 235 C. 448; 45 CA 89; Id., 653.

Trial court's dismissal of plaintiff's zoning appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction reversed; right to appeal decision of zoning board to Superior Court and procedure prescribed in section shall be liberally interpreted in any case where strict adherence to these provisions would work surprise or injustice; although plaintiffs' zoning appeal citation should have named town clerk, plaintiffs had in fact served citation on town clerk, thus plaintiffs' failure to so name town clerk is not a defect that deprived trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal. 278 C. 751. In passing P.A. 04-78, legislature clearly and specifically provided that for any zoning appeal taken prior to October 1, 2004, process was to be served in accordance with Subsec. only; since appeal was served on July 15, 2003, and plaintiffs' marshal followed the service requirements of Sec. 52-57(b)(5), leaving two copies of appeal papers with town clerk, plaintiffs did not comply with service requirements of this Subsec. which sets forth exclusive method for service of process in zoning appeals taken before October 1, 2004, and plaintiffs failed to make proper service of process for their zoning appeal. 279 C. 672.

This section and Secs. 8-3 and 8-8 are not so linked that date of publication of notice must be considered as date decision was rendered. 26 CS 88. Plaintiffs' claim that logic dictates that legislature did not intend that there should be an inconsistent procedure relative to appeal from decisions of zoning boards of appeal and zoning boards and that therefore running of appeal period in case of zoning regulation should be contingent on statutory publication is without merit. Id., 90. Equitable relief outside the framework of appeal procedure set up by statute might be granted in the presence of allegations of fraudulent connivance or collusion on the part of local zoning board of appeals; plaintiffs have been granted equitable relief when the zoning authority lacked the jurisdiction to take the action which plaintiff was challenging; equitable relief by way of an injunction will not be granted if the court finds that the legal remedy afforded by statute has not been exhausted. 26 CS 334.
