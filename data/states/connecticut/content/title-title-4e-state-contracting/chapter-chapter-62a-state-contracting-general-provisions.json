The safeguards contained in such program shall be consistent with and comply with the safeguards for protection of confidential information as set forth in all applicable federal and state law and written policies of the state contained in the agreement. Such data-security program shall include, but not be limited to, the following: (A) A security policy for contractor employees related to the storage, access and transportation of data containing confidential information; (B) reasonable restrictions on access to records containing confidential information, including the area where such records are kept and secure passwords for electronically stored records; (C) a process for reviewing policies and security measures at least annually; and (D) an active and ongoing employee security awareness program that is mandatory for all employees who may have access to confidential information provided by the state contracting agency that, at a minimum, advises such employees of the confidentiality of the information, the safeguards required to protect the information and any applicable civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance pursuant to state and federal law;\n\n(3) Limit access to confidential information to authorized contractor employees and authorized agents of the contractor, for authorized purposes as necessary for the completion of the contracted services or provision of the contracted goods;\n\n(4) Maintain all electronic data constituting confidential information obtained from state contracting agencies: (A) In a secure server; (B) on secure drives; (C) behind firewall protections and monitored by intrusion detection software; (D) in a manner where access is restricted to authorized employees and their authorized agents; and (E) as otherwise required under state and federal law;\n\n(5) Implement, maintain and update security and breach investigation procedures that are appropriate given the nature of the information disclosed and that are reasonably designed to protect the confidential information from unauthorized access, use, modification, disclosure, manipulation or destruction;\n\n(6) Notify the state contracting agency and the Attorney General as soon as practical after the contractor becomes aware of or has reason to believe that any confidential information that the contractor possesses or controls has been subject to a confidential information breach;\n\n(7) Immediately cease all use of the data provided by the state contracting agency or developed internally by the contractor pursuant to a written agreement with the state if so directed by the state contracting agency; and\n\n(8) In accordance with the proposed timetable established pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (e) of this section, submit to the office of the Attorney General and the state contracting agency either (A) a report detailing the breach or suspected breach, including a plan to mitigate the effects of any breach and specifying the steps taken to ensure future breaches do not occur, or (B) a report detailing why, upon further investigation, the contractor believes no breach has occurred. Any report submitted under this subdivision shall be considered information given in confidence and not required by statute, under subparagraph (B) of subdivision (5) of subsection (b) of section 1-210.\n\n(c) A contractor shall not:\n\n(1) Store data constituting confidential information on stand-alone computer or notebook hard disks or portable storage devices such as external or removable hard drives, flash cards, flash drives, compact disks or digital video disks, except as provided for in the agreement and including alternate measures of security assurance approved pursuant to section 4e-71; or\n\n(2) Copy, reproduce or transmit data constituting confidential information, except as necessary for the completion of the contracted services or provision of the contracted goods.\n\n(d) All copies of data constituting confidential information of any type, including, but not limited to, any modifications or additions to data that contain confidential information, are subject to the provisions of this section in the same manner as the original data.\n\n(e) Except as provided in section 4e-71, every written agreement that authorizes a state contracting agency to share confidential information with a contractor shall:\n\n(1) Include a proposed timetable for submittal to the office of the Attorney General and the state contracting agency either (A) a report detailing the breach or suspected breach, or (B) a report detailing why, upon further investigation, the contractor believes no breach has occurred; and\n\n(2) Specify how the cost of any notification about, or investigation into, a confidential information breach is to be apportioned when the state contracting agency or contractor is the subject of such a breach.\n\n(f) The notice required by subsection (b) of this section may be delayed (1) at the state contracting agency's sole discretion based on the report and, if applicable, the plan provided, or (2) if a law enforcement agency or intelligence agency notifies the contractor that such notification would impede a criminal investigation or jeopardize homeland or national security.

If the Attorney General finds that a contractor has violated or is violating any provision of this section, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford under this section in the name of the state against such contractor. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create a private right of action.\n\n(h) If the confidential information or personally identifiable information, as defined in 34 CFR 99.3, that has been subject to a confidential information breach consists of education records, the contractor may be subject to a five-year ban from receiving access to such information imposed by the State Department of Education.\n\n(i) The requirements of this section shall be in addition to the requirements of section 36a-701b, and nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede a contractor's obligations pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 P.L. 104-191 (HIPAA), the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, 20 USC 1232g, (FERPA) or any other applicable federal or state law.\n\n(P.A. 15-142, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 15-142 effective July 1, 2015.",
