Each such person shall notify the department, in writing, not later than thirty days after the date of any change in such person's name, residential address or business address or if such person becomes subject to the registration requirements of chapter 969. A registration shall expire annually and may be renewed upon payment of a renewal fee of one hundred dollars.\n\n(c) The Commissioner of Consumer Protection may deny registration as a hypnotist to an individual who has been the subject of a finding rendered pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. The registry shall contain information concerning any individual who has been denied said registration, as well as any brief statement disputing such denial by such individual.\n\n(d) The Department of Consumer Protection shall receive and investigate complaints against individuals who are practicing or have practiced hypnosis in this state and may cause a prosecution to be instigated based on such investigation. The grounds for complaint shall include physical or sexual abuse, misappropriation of property, and fraud or deceit in obtaining or attempting to obtain registration as a hypnotist. A hypnotist shall be given written notice by certified mail by the commissioner of any complaint against him or her. A hypnotist who wishes to appeal a complaint against him or her shall, not later than thirty days after the date of the mailing, file with the department a request in writing for a hearing to contest the complaint. Any such hearing shall be conducted pursuant to chapter 54. The commissioner shall render a finding on such complaint and enter such finding on the registry. The commissioner shall have the authority to render a finding and enter such finding on the registry against an individual who is practicing or has practiced hypnosis in this state, without regard to whether such individual is on the registry or has obtained registration as a hypnotist from the department.\n\n(e) A hypnotist may petition the Commissioner of Consumer Protection to have the finding removed from the registry upon a determination by the commissioner that: (1) The employment and personal history of the hypnotist does not reflect a pattern of abusive, deceitful or fraudulent behavior; and (2) the conduct involved in the original finding was a singular occurrence. In no case shall a determination on a petition submitted under this subsection be made prior to the expiration of a one-year period beginning on the date on which the finding was added to the registry pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(f) The Commissioner of Consumer Protection may, after notice and hearing, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, assess a civil penalty of not more than one hundred dollars against any person who has practiced hypnosis in this state without first registering with the department pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(g) The Commissioner of Consumer Protection shall revoke the registration of a person under this section after notice and hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 if such person becomes subject to the registration requirements of chapter 969.\n\n(h) The provisions of this section do not apply to any person licensed in this state to provide medical, dental, nursing, counseling or other health care, substance abuse or mental health services.\n\n(i) The Commissioner of Consumer Protection, in consultation with the Commissioner of Public Health, may adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to implement the provisions of this section.\n\n(j) For purposes of this section, “hypnosis” means an artificially induced altered state of consciousness, characterized by heightened suggestibility and receptivity to direction.\n\n(P.A. 06-187, S. 44; June Sp.
