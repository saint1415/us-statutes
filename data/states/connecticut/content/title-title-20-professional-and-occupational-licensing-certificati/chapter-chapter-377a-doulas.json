Such application shall include: (1) Proof that the applicant is eighteen years of age or older; (2) two reference letters from families or professionals with direct knowledge of the applicant's experience as a doula verifying the applicant's training or experience; and (3) (A) demonstration of the applicant's completion of a doula training program or a combination of such programs approved pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, or (B) an attestation by the applicant that such applicant has provided doula services to at least three families and training in not less than four core competencies identified by the Doula Training Program Review Committee during the five years preceding the date of the application.\n\n(f) The commissioner may grant certification by endorsement to a doula who presents evidence satisfactory to the commissioner that the applicant is certified as a doula in another state or jurisdiction whose requirements for certification are substantially similar to those of this state for not less than two years before the date such doula submits an application for certification. No certification shall be issued under this section to any applicant against whom professional disciplinary action is pending or who is the subject of an unresolved complaint.\n\n(g) The commissioner shall adopt continuing education requirements for certified doulas provided by the Doula Training Program Review Committee pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(h) Certification issued under this section may be renewed every three years.
