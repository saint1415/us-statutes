      "text": "(a) The practice of nursing by a registered nurse is defined as the process of diagnosing human responses to actual or potential health problems, providing supportive and restorative care, health counseling and teaching, case finding and referral, collaborating in the implementation of the total health care regimen, and executing the medical regimen under the direction of a licensed physician, dentist or advanced practice registered nurse. A registered nurse may also execute orders issued by licensed physician assistants, podiatrists and optometrists, provided such orders do not exceed the nurse's or the ordering practitioner's scope of practice. A registered nurse may execute dietary orders written in a patient's chart by a certified dietitian-nutritionist.\n\n(b) (1) Advanced nursing practice is defined as the performance of advanced level nursing practice activities that, by virtue of post-basic specialized education and experience, are appropriate to and may be performed by an advanced practice registered nurse. The advanced practice registered nurse performs acts of diagnosis and treatment of alterations in health status, as described in subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(2) (A) An advanced practice registered nurse having been issued a license pursuant to section 20-94a shall, for the first three years after having been issued such license, collaborate with a physician licensed to practice medicine in this state. In all settings, such advanced practice registered nurse may, in collaboration with a physician licensed to practice medicine in this state, prescribe, dispense and administer medical therapeutics and corrective measures and may request, sign for, receive and dispense drugs in the form of professional samples in accordance with sections 20-14c to 20-14e, inclusive, except such advanced practice registered nurse licensed pursuant to section 20-94a and maintaining current certification from the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists who is prescribing and administrating medical therapeutics during surgery may only do so if the physician who is medically directing the prescriptive activity is physically present in the institution, clinic or other setting where the surgery is being performed. For purposes of this subdivision, “collaboration” means a mutually agreed upon relationship between such advanced practice registered nurse and a physician who is educated, trained or has relevant experience that is related to the work of such advanced practice registered nurse. The collaboration shall address a reasonable and appropriate level of consultation and referral, coverage for the patient in the absence of such advanced practice registered nurse, a method to review patient outcomes and a method of disclosure of the relationship to the patient. Relative to the exercise of prescriptive authority, the collaboration between such advanced practice registered nurse and a physician shall be in writing and shall address the level of schedule II and III controlled substances that such advanced practice registered nurse may prescribe and provide a method to review patient outcomes, including, but not limited to, the review of medical therapeutics, corrective measures, laboratory tests and other diagnostic procedures that such advanced practice registered nurse may prescribe, dispense and administer.\n\n(B) An advanced practice registered nurse having been issued a license pursuant to subsection (d) of section 20-94a who collaborated, prior to the issuance of such license, with a physician licensed to practice medicine in another state may count the time of such collaboration toward the three-year requirement set forth in subparagraph (A) of this subsection, provided such collaboration otherwise satisfies the requirements set forth in said subparagraph.\n\n(3) An advanced practice registered nurse having (A) been issued a license pursuant to section 20-94a, (B) maintained such license, or, for an advanced practice registered nurse having been issued a license pursuant to subsection (d) of said section, such license or a license to practice in another state as an advanced practice registered nurse or as a person entitled to perform similar services under a different designation, for a period of not less than three years, and (C) engaged in the performance of advanced practice level nursing activities in collaboration with a physician for a period of not less than three years and not less than two thousand hours in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection, may, thereafter, alone or in collaboration with a physician or another health care provider licensed to practice in this state: (i) Perform the acts of diagnosis and treatment of alterations in health status, as described in subsection (a) of this section; and (ii) prescribe, dispense and administer medical therapeutics and corrective measures and dispense drugs in the form of professional samples as described in subdivision (2) of this subsection in all settings. Any advanced practice registered nurse electing to practice not in collaboration with a physician in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision shall maintain documentation of having engaged in the performance of advanced practice level nursing activities in collaboration with a physician for a period of not less than three years and not less than two thousand hours. Such advanced practice registered nurse shall maintain such documentation for a period of not less than three years after completing such requirements and shall submit such documentation to the Department of Public Health for inspection not later than forty-five days after a request made by the department for such documentation. Any such advanced practice registered nurse shall submit written notice to the Commissioner of Public Health of his or her intention to practice without collaboration with a physician after completing the requirements described in this subdivision and prior to beginning such practice. Not later than December first, annually, the Commissioner of Public Health shall publish on the department's Internet web site a list of such advanced practice registered nurses who are authorized to practice not in collaboration with a physician.\n\n(4) An advanced practice registered nurse licensed under the provisions of this chapter may make the determination and pronouncement of death of a patient, provided the advanced practice registered nurse attests to such pronouncement on the certificate of death and signs the certificate of death not later than twenty-four hours after the pronouncement.\n\n(c) The practice of nursing by a licensed practical nurse is defined as the performing of selected tasks and sharing of responsibility under the direction of a registered nurse or an advanced practice registered nurse and within the framework of supportive and restorative care, health counseling and teaching, case finding and referral, collaborating in the implementation of the total health care regimen and executing the medical regimen under the direction of a licensed physician, physician assistant, podiatrist, optometrist or dentist. A licensed practical nurse may also execute dietary orders written in a patient's chart by a certified dietitian-nutritionist.\n\n(d) In the case of a registered or licensed practical nurse employed by a home health care agency, the practice of nursing includes, but is not limited to, executing the medical regimen under the direction of a physician licensed in a state that borders Connecticut.\n\n(P.A. 75-166, S. 1, 6; P.A. 89-107, S. 1; 89-389, S. 1, 22; P.A. 94-213, S. 4; P.A. 97-112, S. 2; P.A. 99-168, S. 1; P.A. 03-8, S. 1; P.A. 04-221, S. 34; 04-255, S. 22; May Sp.

In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action;\n\n(2) Issue a cease and desist order or impose an encumbrance on a nurse's authority to practice within such party state;\n\n(3) Complete any pending investigation of a nurse who changes such nurse's primary state of residence during the course of such investigation.
