All public service gas technicians employed by a public service company prior to July 1, 1995, who have completed a gas public service company's training program or are participating in such a program on said date shall be issued a certificate of registration upon the payment of the fee required in subsection (h) of this section.\n\n(c) The content and duration of the training and experience programs provided by the public service company shall be relevant to the duties of the employee and shall be approved biennially by the Labor Department. In reviewing the programs and training provided by a public service company, the Labor Department shall consider the specialization of the employees of the company, the employee's previous company training, the service record of the company, the experience of the company in training employees to perform gas service work and the quality assurance measures used by the company.\n\n(d) An employee enrolled in the company's training programs shall be issued a trainee's certificate by such company valid for the duration of the training program and may perform gas service work only under the supervision of an employee of the public service company who is a registered public service gas technician or holds a journeyman's license.\n\n(e) A public service company employing a public service gas technician shall inform the Department of Consumer Protection upon the change in job description or termination of any registered public service gas technician previously certified pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and upon the issuance or termination of a trainee's certificate provided to an employee pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(f) A registered public service gas technician or employee of a public service company issued a trainee's certificate by such company may only perform such work on behalf of such public service company and only while in the direct employment of such public service company. Such registration or trainee's certificate shall be immediately relinquished upon termination of employment from such public service company.\n\n(g) A registered public service gas technician may not supervise any duly registered apprentice performing work under a permit issued pursuant to subdivision (4) of subsection (a) of section 20-334a.\n\n(h) The public service gas technician's registration shall expire annually. Upon application for a license, the applicant shall pay to the department a nonrefundable application fee of ninety dollars. The fee for registration as a public service gas technician shall be the same fee as that charged for a journeyman's license under section 20-335.\n\n(i) The Department of Consumer Protection may deny, suspend or revoke an application of a certificate granted or issued by it pursuant to this section if the holder of such certificate is (1) convicted of a felony, provided any action taken is based upon (A) the nature of the conviction and its relationship to the certificate holder's ability to safely or competently perform work under such certificate, (B) information pertaining to the degree of rehabilitation of the certificate holder, and (C) the time elapsed since the conviction or release, (2) is grossly incompetent, (3) engages in malpractice or unethical conduct, or (4) knowingly makes false, misleading or deceptive representations regarding his work. Prior to such suspension or revocation, such holder shall be given notice and an opportunity for hearing as provided in regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Consumer Protection. Any person whose certificate has been suspended may, after ninety days, apply to the department to have such certificate reinstated.\n\n(j) The Department of Consumer Protection may, after notice and hearing, impose a civil penalty on any person who (1) engages in or practices gas service work without having first obtained a trainee's certificate or a certificate of registration for such work, (2) wilfully employs a person who does not have a certificate for such work, (3) wilfully and falsely pretends to qualify to engage in or practice such work, or (4) engages in or practices such work after the expiration of his certificate. Such penalty shall be in an amount not more than five hundred dollars for a first violation of this subsection, not more than seven hundred fifty dollars for a second violation and not more than one thousand five hundred dollars for each violation of this subsection occurring less than three years after a second or subsequent violation of this subsection.\n\n(k) The Department of Consumer Protection may act in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (7) of section 21a-7 in the case of a person who: (1) Knowingly engages in fraud or material deception in order to obtain a certificate to perform gas service work or doing so in order to aid another in obtaining such a certificate; (2) performs work beyond the scope of such a certificate; (3) illegally uses or transfers such a certificate; (4) performs incompetent or negligent gas service work; (5) knowingly makes false, misleading or deceptive representations to the public regarding gas service work to be performed; or (6) violates any provision of the general statutes or any regulation adopted thereunder, relating to his profession or occupation.\n\n(l) In lieu of displaying a contractor's license number, each public service company authorized pursuant to this section to employ registered public service gas technicians shall display its name, logo or other trademark which clearly identifies the company on all commercial vehicles used in its business and in a conspicuous manner on all printed advertisements, bid proposals, contracts, invoices and on all stationery used in its business.\n\n(m) (1) Any individual who has been convicted of any criminal offense may request, at any time, that the Department of Consumer Protection determine whether such individual's criminal conviction disqualifies such individual from obtaining a certificate or license issued or conferred pursuant to this section.\n\n(2) An individual making a request under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall make such request on a form, and in a manner, prescribed by the Commissioner of Consumer Protection, which form shall require the individual to (A) submit to state and national criminal history records checks conducted in accordance with section 29-17a, and (B) provide details of the individual's criminal conviction.\n\n(3) Not later than thirty days after receiving a complete request under subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection, the department shall inform the individual making such request whether, based on the criminal record information submitted, such individual is disqualified from receiving or holding a certificate or license issued pursuant to this section.\n\n(4) The department is not bound by a determination made under this section if, upon further investigation, the department determines that the individual's criminal conviction differs from the information presented in such individual's determination request made under this subsection.\n\n(P.A. 95-295, S. 1, 3; P.A. 96-259, S. 2; P.A. 98-3, S. 68; June 30 Sp.
