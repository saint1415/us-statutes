      "text": "(a) The commissioner shall establish and maintain the New Home Construction Guaranty Fund.\n\n(b) Each person who receives a certificate pursuant to sections 20-417a to 20-417j, inclusive, shall pay a fee of two hundred forty dollars annually to the New Home Construction Guaranty Fund. Such fees shall be payable with the fee for an application for a certificate or renewal of a certificate.\n\n(c) (1) For fiscal years commencing on or after July 1, 2003, payments received under subsection (b) of this section shall be credited to the New Home Construction Guaranty Fund until the balance in the fund equals seven hundred fifty thousand dollars. Annually, if the balance in the fund exceeds seven hundred fifty thousand dollars, the first three hundred thousand dollars of the excess shall be deposited in the consumer protection enforcement account established in section 21a-8a. On June 1, 2004, and each June first thereafter, if the balance in the fund exceeds seven hundred fifty thousand dollars, the excess shall be deposited in the General Fund.\n\n(2) Any money in the New Home Construction Guaranty Fund may be invested or reinvested in the same manner as funds of the state employees retirement system and the interest arising from such investments shall be credited to the fund.\n\n(d) Whenever a consumer obtains a binding arbitration decision, a court judgment, order or decree against or regarding any new home construction contractor holding a certificate or who has held a certificate under sections 20-417a to 20-417j, inclusive, within two years of the date of entering into the contract with the consumer, for loss or damages sustained by reason of any violation of the provisions of sections 20-417a to 20-417j, inclusive, by a person holding a certificate under said sections, such consumer may, upon the final determination of, or expiration of time for taking, an appeal in connection with any such decision, judgment, order or decree, apply to the commissioner for an order directing payment out of the New Home Construction Guaranty Fund of the amount, not exceeding thirty thousand dollars, unpaid upon the decision, judgment, order or decree for actual damages and costs taxed by the court against such contractor, exclusive of punitive damages. The application shall be made on forms provided by the commissioner and shall be accompanied by a copy of the decision, court judgment, order or decree obtained against the new home construction contractor together with a statement signed and sworn to by the consumer, affirming that the consumer has: (1) Complied with all the requirements of this subsection; (2) obtained a decision, judgment, order or decree stating the amount of the decision, judgment, order or decree and the amount owing on the decision, judgment, order or decree at the date of application; and (3) made a good faith effort to satisfy any such decision, judgment, order or decree in accordance with the provisions of chapter 906 which effort may include causing to be issued a writ of execution upon such decision, judgment, order or decree but the officer executing the same has made a return showing that no bank accounts or personal property of such contractor liable to be levied upon in satisfaction of the decision, judgment, order or decree could be found, or that the amount realized on the sale of them or of such of them as were found, under the execution, was insufficient to satisfy the actual damage portion of the decision, judgment, order or decree or stating the amount realized and the balance remaining due on the decision, judgment, order or decree after application on the decision, judgment, order or decree of the amount realized, except that the requirements of this subdivision shall not apply to a judgment, order or decree obtained by the consumer in small claims court. A true and attested copy of such executing officer's return, when required, shall be attached to such application. Whenever the consumer satisfies the commissioner or the commissioner's designee that it is not practicable to comply with the requirements of subdivision (3) of this subsection and that the consumer has taken all reasonable steps to collect the amount of the decision, judgment, order or decree or the unsatisfied part of the decision, judgment, order or decree and has been unable to collect the same, the commissioner or the commissioner's designee may, in the commissioner's or the commissioner's designee's discretion, dispense with the necessity for complying with such requirement. No application for an order directing payment out of the fund shall be made later than two years from the final determination of, or expiration of time for taking, an appeal of such decision, court judgment, order or decree and no such application shall be for an amount in excess of thirty thousand dollars.\n\n(e) Upon receipt of such application together with such copy of the decision, court judgment, order or decree, statement and, except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) of this section, true and attested copy of the executing officer's return, the commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall inspect such documents for their veracity and upon a determination that such documents are complete and authentic and that the consumer has not been paid, the commissioner shall order payment out of the New Home Construction Guaranty Fund of the amount not exceeding thirty thousand dollars unpaid upon the decision, judgment, order or decree for actual damages and costs taxed by the court against the contractor, exclusive of punitive damages.\n\n(f) Beginning October 1, 2000, whenever a consumer is awarded an order of restitution against any new home construction contractor for loss or damages sustained as a result of any violation of the provisions of sections 20-417a to 20-417j, inclusive, by a person holding a certificate or who has held a certificate under said sections within two years of the date of entering into the contract with the consumer, in (1) a proceeding brought by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (h) of this section or subsection (d) of section 42-110d, (2) a proceeding brought by the Attorney General pursuant to subsection (a) of section 42-110m or subsection (d) of section 42-110d, or (3) a criminal proceeding pursuant to section 20-417e, such consumer may, upon the final determination of, or expiration of time for taking, an appeal in connection with any such order of restitution, apply to the commissioner for an order directing payment out of the New Home Construction Guaranty Fund of the amount not exceeding thirty thousand dollars unpaid upon the order of restitution. The commissioner may issue such order upon a determination that the consumer has not been paid.\n\n(g) Before the commissioner may issue any order directing payment out of the New Home Construction Guaranty Fund to a consumer pursuant to subsection (e) or (f) of this section, the commissioner shall first notify the new home construction contractor of the consumer's application for an order directing payment out of the fund and of the new home construction contractor's right to a hearing to contest the disbursement in the event that such contractor has already paid the consumer. Such notice shall be given to the new home construction contractor not later than fifteen days after receipt by the commissioner of the consumer's application for an order directing payment out of the fund. If the new home construction contractor requests a hearing, in writing, by certified mail not later than fifteen days after receiving the notice from the commissioner, the commissioner shall grant such request and shall conduct a hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54. If the commissioner does not receive a written request for a hearing by certified mail from the new home construction contractor on or before the fifteenth day from the contractor's receipt of such notice, the commissioner shall conclude that the consumer has not been paid, and the commissioner shall issue an order directing payment out of the fund for the amount not exceeding thirty thousand dollars unpaid upon the judgment, order or decree for actual damages and costs taxed by the court against the new home construction contractor, exclusive of punitive damages, or for the amount not exceeding thirty thousand dollars unpaid upon the order of restitution.\n\n(h) The commissioner or the commissioner's designee may proceed against any new home construction contractor holding a certificate or who has held a certificate under sections 20-417a to 20-417j, inclusive, within two years of the effective date of entering into the contract with the consumer, for an order of restitution arising from loss or damages sustained by any consumer as a result of any violation of the provisions of said sections 20-417a to 20-417j, inclusive. Any such proceeding shall be held in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54. In the course of such proceeding, the commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall decide whether to (1) exercise the powers specified in section 20-417c, (2) order restitution arising from loss or damages sustained by any consumer as a result of any violation of the provisions of sections 20-417a to 20-417j, inclusive, and (3) order payment out of the New Home Construction Guaranty Fund. Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 54, the decision of the commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall be final with respect to any proceeding to order payment out of the fund and the commissioner and the commissioner's designee shall not be subject to the requirements of chapter 54 as such requirements relate to an appeal from any such decision. The commissioner or the commissioner's designee may hear complaints of all consumers submitting claims against a single new home construction contractor in one proceeding.\n\n(i) No application for an order directing payment out of the New Home Construction Guaranty Fund shall be made later than two years from the final determination of, or expiration of time for, an appeal in connection with any judgment, order or decree of restitution, and no such application shall be for an amount in excess of thirty thousand dollars.\n\n(j) In order to preserve the integrity of the New Home Construction Guaranty Fund, the commissioner, in the commissioner's sole discretion, may order payment out of the fund of an amount less than the actual loss or damages incurred by the consumer or less than the order of restitution awarded by the commissioner or the Superior Court. In no event shall any payment out of the fund be in excess of thirty thousand dollars for any single claim by a consumer.\n\n(k) If the money deposited in the New Home Construction Guaranty Fund is insufficient to satisfy any duly authorized claim or portion of a claim, the commissioner shall, when sufficient money has been deposited in the fund, satisfy such unpaid claims or portions of claims not exceeding thirty thousand dollars, in the order that such claims or portions of claims were originally determined.\n\n(l) Whenever the commissioner has caused any sum to be paid from the New Home Construction Guaranty Fund to a consumer, the commissioner shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the consumer up to the amount paid plus reasonable interest, and prior to receipt of any payment from the fund, the consumer shall assign all of the consumer's right, title and interest in the claim up to such amount to the commissioner, and any amount and interest recovered by the commissioner on the claim shall be deposited in the fund.\n\n(m) If the commissioner orders the payment of any amount as a result of a claim against a new home construction contractor, the commissioner shall determine if such contractor is possessed of assets liable to be sold or applied in satisfaction of the claim on the New Home Construction Guaranty Fund. If the commissioner discovers any such assets, the commissioner may request that the Attorney General take any action necessary for the reimbursement of the fund.\n\n(n) If the commissioner orders the payment of an amount as a result of a claim against a new home construction contractor, the commissioner may, after notice and hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, revoke the certificate of such contractor and such contractor shall not be eligible to receive a new or renewed certificate until such contractor has repaid such amount in full, plus interest from the time such payment is made from the New Home Construction Guaranty Fund, at a rate to be in accordance with section 37-3b, except that the commissioner may, in the commissioner's sole discretion, permit a new home construction contractor to receive a new or renewed certificate after such contractor has entered into an agreement with the commissioner whereby such contractor agrees to repay the fund in full in the form of periodic payments over a set period of time. Any such agreement shall include a provision providing for the summary suspension of any and all certificates held by the new home construction contractor if payment is not made in accordance with the terms of the agreement.\n\n(P.A. 99-246, S. 9; May 9 Sp.
