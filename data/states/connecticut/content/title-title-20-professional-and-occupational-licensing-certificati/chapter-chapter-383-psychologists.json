No amendment to the compact shall become effective and binding upon any compact state until it is enacted into the law of all compact states.\n\nARTICLE XIV\n\nCONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY\n\nThe compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. If the compact is held contrary to the constitution of any state member of the compact, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining compact states.\n\n(P.A. 22-81, S. 42; P.A. 23-13, S. 3.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 23-13 made a technical change in Art.

The commissioner may grant a waiver or extension for a period not to exceed one registration period, except the commissioner may grant additional waivers or extensions if the medical disability or illness upon which a waiver or extension is granted continues beyond the period of the waiver or extension and the licensee applies for an additional waiver or extension. The commissioner may grant a waiver of the continuing education requirements to a licensee who is not engaged in active professional practice, in any form, during a registration period, provided the licensee submits a notarized application on a form prescribed by the commissioner prior to the end of the registration period. A licensee who is granted a waiver under the provisions of this subsection may not engage in professional practice until the licensee has met the continuing education requirements of this section.\n\n(e) Any licensee granted a waiver of the continuing education requirements pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section shall be required to complete five hours of continuing education not later than six months after the date on which such licensee returns to active practice.
