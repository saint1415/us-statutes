The compact is substantially as follows:\n\nINTERSTATE MEDICAL LICENSURE COMPACT\n\nIn order to strengthen access to health care, and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of health care, the member states of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing licensing and regulatory authority of state medical boards, provides a streamlined process that allows physicians to become licensed in multiple states, thereby enhancing the portability of a medical license and ensuring the safety of patients. The compact creates another pathway for licensure and does not otherwise change a state's existing licensure requirements for physicians. The compact also adopts the prevailing standard for licensure and affirms that the practice of medicine occurs where the patient is located at the time of the physician-patient encounter, and therefore, requires the physician to be under the jurisdiction of the state medical board where the patient is located. State medical boards that participate in the compact retain the jurisdiction to impose an adverse action against a license to practice medicine in such state issued to a physician through the procedures in the compact.\n\nAs used in section 1, this section, and sections 3 to 24, inclusive, of the compact:\n\n(1) “Bylaws” means those bylaws established by the Interstate Commission pursuant to section 11 of the compact.\n\n(2) “Commissioner” means the voting representative appointed by each member board pursuant to section 11 of the compact.\n\n(3) “Compact” means the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact.\n\n(4) “Conviction” means a finding by a court that an individual is guilty of a criminal offense through adjudication, or entry of a plea of guilt or no contest to the charge by the offender.

If judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees.\n\n(c) The remedies set forth in the compact shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Interstate Commission.

A physician, advanced practice registered nurse or other health care provider shall have sixty days from the date the department mails or delivers the prepublication copy to dispute the accuracy of any information that the department proposes to include in such profile and to submit a written statement setting forth the basis for such dispute. If a physician, advanced practice registered nurse or other health care provider does not notify the department that the physician, advanced practice registered nurse or other health care provider disputes the accuracy of such information within such sixty-day period, the department shall make the profile available to the public and the physician, advanced practice registered nurse or other health care provider shall be deemed to have approved the profile and all information contained in the profile. If a physician, advanced practice registered nurse or other health care provider notifies the department that the physician, advanced practice registered nurse or other health care provider disputes the accuracy of such information in accordance with this subsection, the physician's, advanced practice registered nurse's or other health care provider's profile shall be released to the public without the disputed information, but with a statement to the effect that information in the identified category is currently the subject of a dispute and is therefore not currently available. Not later than thirty days after the department's receipt of notice of a dispute, the department shall review any information submitted by the physician, advanced practice registered nurse or other health care provider in support of such dispute and determine whether to amend the information contained in the profile. In the event that the department determines not to amend the disputed information, the disputed information shall be included in the profile with a statement that such information is disputed by the physician, advanced practice registered nurse or other health care provider.\n\n(f) A physician, advanced practice registered nurse or other health care provider may elect to have the physician's, advanced practice registered nurse's or other health care provider's profile omit information provided pursuant to subparagraphs (I) to (K), inclusive, of subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of this section. In collecting information for such profiles and in the dissemination of such profiles, the department shall inform physicians, advanced practice registered nurses and other health care providers that they may choose not to provide the information described in said subparagraphs (I) to (K), inclusive.\n\n(g) Each profile created pursuant to this section shall include the following statement: “This profile contains information that may be used as a starting point in evaluating a physician, advanced practice registered nurse or other health care provider. This profile should not, however, be your sole basis for selecting a physician, advanced practice registered nurse or other health care provider.”.\n\n(h) The department shall maintain a web site on the Internet for use by the public in obtaining profiles of physicians, advanced practice registered nurses and other health care providers.\n\n(i) No state law that would otherwise prohibit, limit or penalize disclosure of information about a physician, advanced practice registered nurse or other health care provider shall apply to disclosure of information required by this section.\n\n(j) All information provided by a physician, advanced practice registered nurse or other health care provider pursuant to this section shall be subject to the penalty for false statement under section 53a-157b.\n\n(k) Except for the information in subparagraphs (A), (B), (J) and (K) of subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of this section, a physician, advanced practice registered nurse or other health care provider shall notify the department of any changes to the information required in subsection (b) of this section not later than sixty days after such change.\n\n(P.A. 99-284, S. 33; P.A. 05-275, S. 22, 23; P.A. 08-109, S. 1; P.A. 14-217, S. 158.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 05-275 amended Subsec.
