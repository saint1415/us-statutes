Bad faith exception to the bar on a contractor's recovery under contracts that do not comply with section does not apply when a homeowner receives goods and services from a contractor in the belief that they ultimately will have to be paid for, but then repudiates the contract because the contractor's noncompliance with section gave rise to a genuine, good faith dispute about the scope of work or contract price. 325 C. 14.\n\nCited. 18 CA 581; 20 CA 625; 24 CA 223; 27 CA 162; 33 CA 294; 35 CA 253; 38 CA 420; 40 CA 351; 43 CA 184. Requirement that a consumer is fully notified and understands his or her right to cancel a contract is central to Home Improvement Act; home improvement contract violated requirements of the act because contract and cancellation form did not have a transaction date. 72 CA 53. Neither the fact that plaintiff was represented by counsel throughout the process nor plaintiff's failure to raise noncompliance with the act until defendant raised a claim of nonpayment constituted bad faith without additional evidence. 122 CA 295. Under the bad faith exception, contractor is entitled to recover the value of the work performed but not additional damages provided for in the contract, such as attorney's fees, when the contract is otherwise unenforceable due to contractor's violation of section. 126 CA 94.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nBad faith exception to enforcement of provisions discussed. 224 C. 231. Provisions of statute mandatory but strict compliance not required and contract valid even though 2 copies of cancellation notice not attached to contract and cancellation date not noted. 247 C. 218. Court rejected plaintiffs' argument that, because language of Subsec. mandates that all changes to a home improvement contract must be signed by both owner and contractor in order to be valid and enforceable, arbitration award based on 5 change orders that were not signed by owner were a manifest disregard of the law. 279 C. 300. Subsec. was not intended to supersede established principles of contract damages and allow a homeowner affirmatively to recover damages to which he would not otherwise be entitled; in an action brought by a homeowner against a home improvement contractor for breach of contract, Subsec. does not preclude the damages award from being reduced by an amount equal to the unpaid balance remaining on the contract. 290 C. 1.\n\nCited. 18 CA 463; 31 CA 682; Id., 294; 45 CA 586. Because the contract in this case consists of 2 separate documents, the documents read together constitute a contract that satisfies section's requirements. 69 CA 136. Homeowner not responsible for contractor's failure to comply with the act, including contractor's failure to have homeowner sign contract before proceeding with work, failure to give homeowner notice of cancellation rights before beginning work, failure to include contractor's address, and failure to document changes from original plan in writing; the fact that contract was not signed by either party was not evidence that plaintiff waived compliance with the act or that plaintiff acted in bad faith. 121 CA 105. Failure of homeowner's contract with general contractor to comply with requirements of Subsec. does not bar subcontractor's right to recover against homeowner under mechanic's lien statute. 136 CA 184.\n\nComplete absence of a written contract that complies with Home Improvement Act, or at the very least a written and signed memorialization of changes in the terms and conditions of the original contract, as required by Subsec., cannot be deemed “minor and highly technical” deviation from the act. 48 CS 248.\n\nSubsec. (f):\n\nDamages may be awarded under theory of unjust enrichment even if all requirements of Home Improvement Act, revised to 2003, are not met. 307 C. 582.\n\nIf court determines that requirements of Subsec. are met, it may award damages under a theory of unjust enrichment even if all requirements of Home Improvement Act are not met. 103 CA 566.",

      "text": "(a) The commissioner shall establish and maintain the Home Improvement Guaranty Fund.\n\n(b) Each salesman who receives a certificate pursuant to this chapter shall pay a fee of forty dollars annually. Each contractor (1) who receives a certificate pursuant to this chapter, or (2) receives a certificate pursuant to chapter 399a and has opted to engage in home improvement pursuant to subsection (f) of section 20-417b shall pay a fee of one hundred dollars annually to the guaranty fund. Such fee shall be payable with the fee for an application for a certificate or renewal thereof. The annual fee for a contractor who receives a certificate of registration as a home improvement contractor acting solely as the contractor of record for a corporation shall be waived, provided the contractor of record shall use such registration for the sole purpose of directing, supervising or performing home improvements for such corporation.\n\n(c) Payments received under subsection (b) of this section shall be credited to the guaranty fund until the balance in such fund equals seven hundred fifty thousand dollars. Annually, if the balance in the fund exceeds seven hundred fifty thousand dollars, the first four hundred thousand dollars of the excess shall be deposited into the consumer protection enforcement account established in section 21a-8a. Any excess thereafter shall be deposited in the General Fund. Any money in the guaranty fund may be invested or reinvested in the same manner as funds of the state employees retirement system, and the interest arising from such investments shall be credited to the guaranty fund.\n\n(d) Whenever an owner obtains a binding arbitration decision, a court judgment, order or decree against any contractor holding a certificate or who has held a certificate under this chapter within two years of the effective date of entering into the contract with the owner, for loss or damages sustained by reason of performance of or offering to perform a home improvement within this state by a contractor holding a certificate under this chapter, such owner may, upon the final determination of, or expiration of time for, taking an appeal in connection with any such decision, judgment, order or decree, apply to the commissioner for an order directing payment out of said guaranty fund of the amount unpaid upon the decision, judgment, order or decree, for actual damages and costs taxed by the court against the contractor, exclusive of punitive damages. The application shall be made on forms provided by the commissioner and shall be accompanied by a copy of the decision, court judgment, order or decree obtained against the contractor. No application for an order directing payment out of the guaranty fund shall be made later than two years after the final determination of, or expiration of time for, taking an appeal of said decision, court judgment, order or decree.\n\n(e) Upon receipt of said application together with said copy of the decision, court judgment, order or decree, and true and attested copy of the executing officer's return, the commissioner or his designee shall inspect such documents for their veracity and upon a determination that such documents are complete and authentic, and a determination that the owner has not been paid, the commissioner shall order payment out of the guaranty fund of the amount unpaid upon the decision, judgment, order or decree for actual damages and costs taxed by the court against the contractor, exclusive of punitive damages.\n\n(f) Whenever an owner is awarded an order of restitution against any contractor for loss or damages sustained by reason of performance of or offering to perform a home improvement in this state by a contractor holding a certificate or who has held a certificate under this chapter within two years of the date of entering into the contract with the owner, in a proceeding brought by the commissioner pursuant to this section or subsection (d) of section 42-110d, or in a proceeding brought by the Attorney General pursuant to subsection (a) of section 42-110m or subsection (d) of section 42-110d, or a criminal proceeding pursuant to section 20-427, such owner may, upon the final determination of, or expiration of time for, taking an appeal in connection with any such order of restitution, apply to the commissioner for an order directing payment out of said guaranty fund of the amount unpaid upon the order of restitution. The commissioner may issue said order upon a determination that the owner has not been paid.\n\n(g) Before the commissioner may issue any order directing payment out of the guaranty fund to an owner pursuant to subsection (e) or (f) of this section, the commissioner shall first notify the contractor of the owner's application for an order directing payment out of the guaranty fund and of the contractor's right to a hearing to contest the disbursement in the event that the contractor has already paid the owner or is complying with a payment schedule in accordance with a court judgment, order or decree. Such notice shall be given to the contractor not later than fifteen days after receipt by the commissioner of the owner's application for an order directing payment out of the guaranty fund. If the contractor requests a hearing, in writing, by certified mail not later than fifteen days after receiving the notice from the commissioner, the commissioner shall grant such request and shall conduct a hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54. If the commissioner does not receive a request by certified mail from the contractor for a hearing not later than fifteen days after the contractor's receipt of such notice, the commissioner shall determine that the owner has not been paid, and the commissioner shall issue an order directing payment out of the guaranty fund for the amount unpaid upon the judgment, order or decree for actual damages and costs taxed by the court against the contractor, exclusive of punitive damages, or for the amount unpaid upon the order of restitution.\n\n(h) The commissioner or his designee may proceed against any contractor holding a certificate or who has held a certificate under this chapter within the past two years of the effective date of entering into the contract with the owner, for an order of restitution arising from loss or damages sustained by any person by reason of such contractor's performance of or offering to perform a home improvement in this state. Any such proceeding shall be held in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54. In the course of such proceeding, the commissioner or his designee shall decide whether to exercise his powers pursuant to section 20-426; whether to order restitution arising from loss or damages sustained by any person by reason of such contractor's performance or offering to perform a home improvement in this state; and whether to order payment out of the guaranty fund. Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 54, the decision of the commissioner or his designee shall be final with respect to any proceeding to order payment out of the guaranty fund and the commissioner and his designee shall not be subject to the requirements of chapter 54 as they relate to appeal from any such decision. The commissioner or his designee may hear complaints of all owners submitting claims against a single contractor in one proceeding.\n\n(i) No application for an order directing payment out of the guaranty fund shall be made later than two years from the final determination of, or expiration of time for, appeal in connection with any decision, judgment, order or decree of restitution.\n\n(j) Whenever the owner satisfies the commissioner or his designee that it is not practicable to comply with the requirements of subsection (d) of this section and that the owner has taken all reasonable steps to collect the amount of the decision, judgment, order or decree or the unsatisfied part thereof and has been unable to collect the same, the commissioner or his designee may in his discretion dispense with the necessity for complying with such requirement.\n\n(k) In order to preserve the integrity of the guaranty fund, the commissioner, in the commissioner's sole discretion, may order payment out of said fund of an amount less than the actual loss or damages incurred by the owner or less than the order of restitution awarded by the commissioner or the Superior Court. In no event shall any payment out of said guaranty fund be in excess of twenty-five thousand dollars for any single claim by an owner.\n\n(l) If the money deposited in the guaranty fund is insufficient to satisfy any duly authorized claim or portion thereof, the commissioner shall, when sufficient money has been deposited in the fund, satisfy such unpaid claims or portions thereof, in the order that such claims or portions thereof were originally determined.\n\n(m) Whenever the commissioner has caused any sum to be paid from the guaranty fund to an owner, the commissioner shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the owner up to the amount paid plus reasonable interest, and prior to receipt of any payment from the guaranty fund, the owner shall assign all of this right, title and interest in the claim up to such amount to the commissioner, and any amount and interest recovered by the commissioner on the claim shall be deposited to the guaranty fund.\n\n(n) If the commissioner orders the payment of any amount as a result of a claim against a contractor, the commissioner shall determine if the contractor is possessed of assets liable to be sold or applied in satisfaction of the claim on the guaranty fund. If the commissioner discovers any such assets, he may request that the Attorney General take any action necessary for the reimbursement of the guaranty fund.\n\n(o) If the commissioner orders the payment of an amount as a result of a claim against a contractor, the commissioner may, after notice and hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, revoke the certificate of the contractor and the contractor shall not be eligible to receive a new or renewed certificate until he has repaid such amount in full, plus interest from the time said payment is made from the guaranty fund, at a rate to be in accordance with section 37-3b, except that the commissioner may, in his sole discretion, permit a contractor to receive a new or renewed certificate after that contractor has entered into an agreement with the commissioner whereby the contractor agrees to repay the guaranty fund in full in the form of periodic payments over a set period of time. Any such agreement shall include a provision providing for the summary suspension of any and all certificates held by the contractor if payment is not made in accordance with the terms of the agreement.\n\n(P.A. 88-269, S. 11; P.A. 89-251, S. 150, 203; P.A. 90-233, S. 2; 90-321, S. 5; P.A. 91-325, S. 2; P.A. 94-68, S. 3; P.A. 96-117, S. 3; P.A. 97-129; P.A. 99-74, S. 1, 3; P.A. 04-257, S. 105; P.A. 10-9, S. 6; P.A. 13-196, S. 12, 25; P.A. 15-60, S. 6; P.A. 21-37, S. 38; 21-197, S. 8; P.A. 22-70, S. 6; P.A. 23-99, S. 16.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 89-251 amended Subsec.
