Such licensed podiatrist shall restrict treatment of displaced ankle fractures to the initial diagnosis and the initial attempt at closed reduction at the time of presentation and shall not treat tibial pilon fractures. For purposes of this section, “ankle” means the distal metaphysis and epiphysis of the tibia and fibula, the articular cartilage of the distal tibia and distal fibula, the ligaments that connect the distal metaphysis and epiphysis of the tibia and fibula and the talus, and the portions of skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia, muscles, tendons and nerves at or below the level of the myotendinous junction of the triceps surae.\n\n(c) A licensed podiatrist may independently engage in the surgical treatment of the ankle, including the surgical treatment of the anatomical structures of the ankle, as well as the administration and prescription of drugs incidental thereto, and the surgical treatment of manifestations of systemic diseases as they appear on the ankle, after the podiatrist provides documentation to the Department of Public Health of the following: (1) (A) Graduation on or after June 1, 2006, from a three-year residency program in podiatric medicine and surgery that was accredited by the Council on Podiatric Medical Education, or its successor organization, at the time of graduation, and (B) current board certification or qualification in reconstructive rearfoot ankle surgery by the American Board of Foot and Ankle Surgery, or its successor organization; or (2) (A) graduation prior to June 1, 2006, from a residency program in podiatric medicine and surgery that was at least two years in length and accredited at the time of graduation by said council, and (B) current board certification or qualification in reconstructive rearfoot ankle surgery by the American Board of Foot and Ankle Surgery, or its successor organization. For purposes of this section, “surgical treatment of the ankle” includes all soft tissue and osseous procedures, including ankle fracture fixation, ankle fusion, ankle arthroscopy, insertion or removal of external fixation pins into or from the tibial diaphysis at or below the level of the myotendinous junction of the triceps surae, insertion and removal of retrograde tibiotalocalcaneal intramedullary rods and locking screws up to the level of the myotendinous junction of the triceps surae and Chopart joint-level amputation, but does not include the surgical treatment of complications within the tibial diaphysis related to the use of external fixation pins, the performance of total ankle replacements or the treatment of tibial pilon fractures.\n\n(d) The Department of Public Health shall implement a mechanism for (1) a podiatrist to provide the documentation required pursuant to subsection (c) of this section as part of the initial licensure application, and (2) credentialing boards and the public to access the names of podiatrists who submitted the documentation required pursuant to said subsection.
