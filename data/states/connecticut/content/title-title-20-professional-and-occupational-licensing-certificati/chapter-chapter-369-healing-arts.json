Any person who violates the provisions of this section shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars.\n\n(b) Each practitioner of the healing arts who recommends a test to aid in the diagnosis of a patient's physical condition shall, to the extent the practitioner is reasonably able, inform the patient of the approximate range of costs of such test.\n\n(c) Each practitioner of the healing arts who (1) has an ownership or investment interest in an entity that provides diagnostic or therapeutic services, or (2) receives compensation or remuneration for referral of patients to an entity that provides diagnostic or therapeutic services shall disclose such interest to any patient prior to referring such patient to such entity for diagnostic or therapeutic services and provide reasonable referral alternatives. Such information shall be verbally disclosed to each patient or shall be posted in a conspicuous place visible to patients in the practitioner's office. The posted information shall list the therapeutic and diagnostic services in which the practitioner has an ownership or investment interest and therapeutic and diagnostic services from which the practitioner receives compensation or remuneration for referrals and state that alternate referrals will be made upon request. Therapeutic services include physical therapy, radiation therapy, intravenous therapy and rehabilitation services including physical therapy, occupational therapy or speech and language pathology, or any combination of such therapeutic services. This subsection shall not apply to in-office ancillary services. As used in this subsection, “ownership or investment interest” does not include ownership of investment securities that are purchased by the practitioner on terms available to the general public and are publicly traded; and “entity that provides diagnostic or therapeutic services” includes services provided by an entity that is within a hospital but is not owned by the hospital. Violation of this subsection constitutes conduct subject to disciplinary action under subdivision (7) of subsection (a) of section 19a-17.\n\n(d) No person or entity, other than a physician licensed under chapter 370, a clinical laboratory, as defined in section 19a-490, or a referring clinical laboratory, shall directly or indirectly charge, bill or otherwise solicit payment for the provision of anatomic pathology services, unless such services were personally rendered by or under the direct supervision of such physician, clinical laboratory or referring laboratory in accordance with section 353 of the Public Health Service Act, (42 USC 263a). A clinical laboratory or referring laboratory may only solicit payment for anatomic pathology services from the patient, a hospital, the responsible insurer of a third party payor, or a governmental agency or such agency's public or private agent that is acting on behalf of the recipient of such services. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a clinical laboratory from billing a referring clinical laboratory when specimens are transferred between such laboratories for histologic or cytologic processing or consultation. No patient or other third party payor, as described in this subsection, shall be required to reimburse any provider for charges or claims submitted in violation of this section. For purposes of this subsection, (1) “referring clinical laboratory” means a clinical laboratory that refers a patient specimen for consultation or anatomic pathology services, excluding the laboratory of a physician's office or group practice that takes a patient specimen and does not perform the professional diagnostic component of the anatomic pathology services involved, and (2) “anatomic pathology services” means the gross and microscopic examination and histologic or cytologic processing of human specimens, including histopathology or surgical pathology, cytopathology, hematology, subcellular pathology or molecular pathology or blood banking service performed by a pathologist.\n\n(P.A. 73-159; P.A. 91-168; P.A. 92-24; P.A. 05-272, S. 18; P.A. 06-196, S. 246; P.A. 09-232, S. 72; P.A. 10-18, S. 19; P.A. 17-10, S. 4; P.A. 22-58, S. 28.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 91-168 added a new Subsec.

(c) to change disclosure requirements from diagnostic imaging equipment to diagnostic or therapeutic services or compensation or remuneration for referrals of such services, to explain verbal and posted disclosure requirements, to add definition of entity which provides diagnostic or therapeutic services, and to make violation of Subsec. subject to disciplinary action; P.A. 05-272 amended Subsec.

      "text": "(a) For purposes of this section, “clinical laboratory” has the same meaning as provided in section 19a-490. “Clinical laboratory” does not include any state laboratory established by the Department of Public Health pursuant to section 19a-26 or 19a-29.\n\n(b) Except as provided for in subsection (e) of this section, a provider shall (1) supply to a patient upon request complete and current information possessed by that provider concerning any diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of the patient, and (2) notify a patient of any test results in the provider's possession or requested by the provider for the purposes of diagnosis, treatment or prognosis of such patient. In addition, upon the request of a patient or a provider who orders medical tests on behalf of a patient, a clinical laboratory shall provide medical test results relating to the patient to (A) the patient, or (B) any other provider who is treating the patient for the purposes of diagnosis, treatment or prognosis of such patient.\n\n(c) A provider, who requests that his or her patient submit to repeated medical testing at regular intervals, over a specified period of time, for purposes of ascertaining a diagnosis, prognosis or recommended course of treatment for such patient, may issue a single authorization that allows the entity that conducts such medical testing, including, but not limited to, a clinical laboratory, to directly communicate the results of such testing to the patient for the period of time that such testing is requested by the provider.\n\n(d) Upon a written request of a patient, a patient's attorney or authorized representative, or pursuant to a written authorization, a provider, except as provided in section 4-194, shall furnish to the person making such request a copy of the patient's health record, including but not limited to, bills, x-rays and copies of laboratory reports, contact lens specifications based on examinations and final contact lens fittings given within the preceding three months or such longer period of time as determined by the provider but no longer than six months, records of prescriptions and other technical information used in assessing the patient's health condition. No provider shall refuse to return to a patient original records or copies of records that the patient has brought to the provider from another provider. When returning records to a patient, a provider may retain copies of such records for the provider's file, provided such provider does not charge the patient for the costs incurred in copying such records. No provider shall charge more than sixty-five cents per page, including any research fees, handling fees or related costs, and the cost of first class postage, if applicable, for furnishing a health record pursuant to this subsection, except such provider may charge a patient the amount necessary to cover the cost of materials for furnishing a copy of an x-ray, provided no such charge shall be made for furnishing a health record or part thereof to a patient, a patient's attorney or authorized representative if the record or part thereof is necessary for the purpose of supporting a claim or appeal under any provision of the Social Security Act or a claim or appeal for veterans' benefits under any provision of Title 38 of the United States Code or chapter 506 and the request is accompanied by documentation of the claim or appeal. A provider shall furnish a health record requested pursuant to this section within thirty days of the request. No health care provider, who has purchased or assumed the practice of a provider who is retiring or deceased, may refuse to return original records or copied records to a patient who decides not to seek care from the successor provider. When returning records to a patient who has decided not to seek care from a successor provider, such provider may not charge a patient for costs incurred in copying the records of the retired or deceased provider.\n\n(e) If a provider reasonably determines that the information is detrimental to the physical or mental health of the patient, or is likely to cause the patient to harm himself, herself or another, the provider may withhold the information from the patient. The information may be supplied to an appropriate third party or to another provider who may release the information to the patient. If disclosure of information is refused by a provider under this subsection, any person aggrieved thereby may, within thirty days of such refusal, petition the superior court for the judicial district in which such person resides for an order requiring the provider to disclose the information. Such a proceeding shall be privileged with respect to assignment for trial. The court, after hearing and an in camera review of the information in question, shall issue the order requested unless it determines that such disclosure would be detrimental to the physical or mental health of the person or is likely to cause the person to harm himself, herself or another.\n\n(f) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any information relative to any psychiatric or psychological problems or conditions.\n\n(g) In the event that a provider abandons his or her practice, the Commissioner of Public Health may appoint a licensed health care provider to be the keeper of the records, who shall be responsible for disbursing the original records to the provider's patients, upon the request of any such patient.\n\n(h) The Commissioner of Public Health shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to carry out the provisions of this section.\n\n(P.A. 83-413, S. 2; P.A. 86-43, S. 2; P.A. 91-137, S. 2; P.A. 93-316, S. 3; P.A. 94-158, S. 2; P.A. 95-100; June Sp.
