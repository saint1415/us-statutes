When the prescribing practitioner is not reasonably available for consultation and the prescribed drug does not use a unique delivery system technology, the pharmacist may substitute an oral tablet, capsule or liquid form of the prescribed drug as long as the form dispensed has the same strength, dose and dose schedule and is therapeutically equivalent to the drug prescribed. The pharmacist shall inform the patient or a representative of the patient, and the practitioner of the substitution at the earliest reasonable time.\n\n(c) Except as limited by subsections (f), (h) and (l) of this section, unless the purchaser instructs otherwise, the pharmacist may substitute a biological product for a prescribed biological product if: (1) It is an interchangeable biological product, and (2) the practitioner has not specified, in the manner described in subsection (f) of this section, that there shall be no substitution for the prescribed biological product.\n\n(d) Upon the dispensing of an interchangeable biological product to a patient, the pharmacist or a duly authorized agent of the pharmacist shall inform the patient or a representative of the patient of a substitution of an interchangeable biological product for a prescribed biological product.

The entry shall be made in a manner that provides notice to the prescriber and may be made through one of the following means: (1) An interoperable electronic medical records system, (2) an electronic prescribing technology, (3) a pharmacy benefit management system, or (4) a pharmacy record. If the entry is not made by any of the means specified in subdivision (1), (2), (3) or (4) of this subsection, the pharmacist shall communicate the product dispensed to the prescriber using either facsimile, telephone or electronic transmission, provided such communication shall not be required when a refill prescription is not changed from the product dispensed on the prior filling of the prescription. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to interchangeable biological products dispensed by a pharmacy operated by a hospital licensed in accordance with the provisions of chapter 368v.\n\n(n) The commissioner, with the advice and assistance of the commission, shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to carry out the provisions of this section.\n\n(P.A. 76-166, S. 1, 8; P.A. 94-32, S. 1; P.A. 95-264, S. 40; P.A. 99-175, S. 39; June Sp.
