The commissioner may take action pursuant to said section 19a-17 after providing notice and an opportunity for a hearing on any contemplated action under said section 19a-17.\n\n(i) Any person who violates any provision of this section shall, for each offense, be guilty of a class C misdemeanor.\n\n(P.A. 14-178, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 14-178 effective June 11, 2014.",
