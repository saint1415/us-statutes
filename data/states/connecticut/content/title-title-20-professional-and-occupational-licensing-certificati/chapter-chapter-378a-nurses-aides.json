The grounds for complaint shall include resident abuse, resident neglect, misappropriation of resident property, and fraud or deceit in obtaining or attempting to obtain a registration as a nurse's aide. A nurse's aide shall be given written notice by certified mail by the commissioner of any complaint against him or her. A nurse's aide who wishes to appeal a complaint against him or her shall, not later than thirty days after the date of the mailing, file with the department a request in writing for a hearing to contest the complaint. The commissioner shall render a finding on such complaint, and, if a hearing is requested, it shall be conducted pursuant to chapter 54. The commissioner shall have the authority to render a finding and enter such finding on the registry against an individual who is providing or has provided services as a nurse's aide in a chronic and convalescent nursing home or rest home with nursing supervision, without regard to whether such individual is on the registry or has obtained registration as a nurse's aide from the department.\n\n(b) In the case of a finding of resident neglect made after January 1, 1995, pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, a nurse's aide may petition the commissioner to have the finding removed from the registry upon a determination by the commissioner that: (1) The employment and personal history of the nurse's aide does not reflect a pattern of abusive behavior or neglect; and (2) the neglect involved in the original finding was a singular occurrence. In no case shall a determination on a petition submitted under this subsection be made prior to the expiration of a one-year period beginning on the date on which the finding was added to the registry pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(P.A. 93-121, S. 4, 8; 93-381, S. 9, 39; 93-435, S. 59, 95; P.A. 95-257, S. 12, 21, 58; 95-271, S. 28, 40; P.A. 98-250, S. 1, 39; P.A. 03-252, S. 11.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 93-121 effective June 14, 1993; P.A. 93-381 and P.A. 93-435 authorized substitution of commissioner and department of public health and addiction services for commissioner and department of health services, effective July 1, 1993; P.A. 95-257 replaced Commissioner and Department of Public Health and Addiction Services with Commissioner and Department of Public Health, effective July 1, 1995; P.A. 95-271 required notice by certified mail and allowed a request for a hearing to contest the complaint, effective July 6, 1995; P.A. 98-250 added Subsec. (b) re petition to have a finding removed from the registry, effective July 1, 1998; P.A. 03-252 amended Subsec. (a) to change deadline for appeal of a complaint from within 30 days of the date of the notice to not later than 30 days after the date of mailing and to make conforming and technical changes.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\n“Resident abuse” requires that resident suffer harm or adverse impact as a result of alleged abuse, and, in making that determination, an objective, rather than subjective, standard should be applied; “resident abuse” requires an element of wilfulness and is satisfied when one voluntarily engages in the act resulting in the abuse; specific intent to harm is not required. 259 C. 288.",
