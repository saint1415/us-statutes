      "text": "(a) Subject to the provisions of section 10a-26, the Board of Trustees of the Connecticut State University System shall fix fees for tuition and shall fix fees for such other purposes as the board deems necessary at the university, and may make refunds of the same.\n\n(b) The Board of Regents for Higher Education shall establish and administer a fund to be known as the Connecticut State University System Operating Fund. Appropriations from general revenues of the state and upon request by the Connecticut State University System and with the annual review and approval by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, the amount of the appropriations for fringe benefits pursuant to subsection (a) of section 4-73, shall be transferred from the State Comptroller and all tuition revenue received by the Connecticut State University System in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall be deposited in said fund. Income from student fees or related charges, the proceeds of auxiliary activities and business enterprises, gifts and donations, federal funds and grants, subject to the provisions of sections 10a-98 to 10a-98g, inclusive, and all receipts derived from the conduct by a state university of its education extension program and its summer school session shall be credited to said fund but shall be allocated to the central office and institutional operating accounts which shall be established and maintained for the central office and each state university. Any such gifts and donations, federal funds and grants for purposes of research shall be allocated to separate accounts within such central office and institutional operating accounts. If the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management disapproves such transfer, the secretary may require the amount of the appropriation for operating expenses to be used for personal services and fringe benefits to be excluded from said fund. The State Treasurer shall review and approve the transfer prior to such request by the university. The board shall establish an equitable policy, in accordance with section 10a-8, for allocation of appropriations from general revenues of the state, fringe benefits transferred from the State Comptroller and tuition revenue deposited in the Connecticut State University System Operating Fund. At the beginning of each quarter of the fiscal year, the board shall allocate and transfer, in accordance with said policy, moneys for expenditure in such institutional operating accounts, exclusive of amounts retained for central office operations and reasonable reserves for future distribution. All costs of waiving or remitting tuition pursuant to subsection (f) of this section shall be charged to the Connecticut State University System Operating Fund. Repairs, alterations or additions to facilities supported by the Connecticut State University System Operating Fund and costing one million dollars or more shall require the approval of the General Assembly, or when the General Assembly is not in session, of the Finance Advisory Committee. Any balance of receipts above expenditures shall remain in said fund, except such sums as may be required for deposit into a debt service fund or the General Fund for further payment by the Treasurer of debt service on general obligation bonds of the state issued for purposes of the Connecticut State University System.\n\n(c) Commencing December 1, 1984, and thereafter not later than sixty days after the close of each quarter, the board of trustees shall submit to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to appropriations and the budgets of state agencies, the Office of Higher Education and the Office of Policy and Management a report on the actual expenditures of the Connecticut State University System Operating Fund.\n\n(d) Said board shall waive the payment of tuition fees for undergraduate and graduate degree programs at the Connecticut State University System (1) for any dependent child of a person whom the armed forces of the United States has declared to be missing in action or to have been a prisoner of war while serving in such armed forces after January 1, 1960, which child has been accepted for admission to such institution and is a resident of the state at the time such child is accepted for admission to such institution, (2) subject to the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, for any veteran, as defined in section 27-103, who performed service in time of war, as defined in section 27-103, except that for purposes of this subsection, “service in time of war” shall not include time spent in attendance at a military service academy, which veteran has been accepted for admission to such institution and is domiciled in this state at the time such veteran is accepted for admission to such institution, (3) for any resident of the state sixty-two years of age or older who has been accepted for admission to such institution, provided (A) such resident is enrolled in a degree-granting program, or (B) at the end of the regular registration period, there are enrolled in the course a sufficient number of students other than those residents eligible for waivers pursuant to this subdivision to offer the course in which such resident intends to enroll and there is space available in such course after accommodating all such students, (4) for any student attending the Connecticut Police Academy who is enrolled in a law enforcement program at said academy offered in coordination with the university which accredits courses taken in such program, (5) for any active member of the Connecticut Army or Air National Guard who (A) has been certified by the Adjutant General or such Adjutant General's designee as a member in good standing of the guard, and (B) is enrolled or accepted for admission to such institution on a full-time or part-time basis in an undergraduate or graduate degree-granting program, (6) for any dependent child of a (A) police officer, as defined in section 7-294a, or supernumerary or auxiliary police officer, (B) firefighter, as defined in section 7-323j, or member of a volunteer fire company, (C) municipal employee, or (D) state employee, as defined in section 5-154, killed in the line of duty, (7) for any resident of this state who is a dependent child or surviving spouse of a specified terrorist victim who was a resident of the state, (8) for any dependent child of a resident of the state who was killed in a multivehicle crash at or near the intersection of Routes 44 and 10 and Nod Road in Avon on July 29, 2005, and (9) for any resident of the state who is a dependent child or surviving spouse of a person who was killed in action while performing active military duty with the armed forces of the United States on or after September 11, 2001, and who was a resident of this state. If any person who receives a tuition waiver in accordance with the provisions of this subsection also receives educational reimbursement from an employer, such waiver shall be reduced by the amount of such educational reimbursement. Veterans and members of the National Guard described in subdivision (5) of this subsection shall be given the same status as students not receiving tuition waivers in registering for courses at Connecticut state universities. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 10a-30, as used in this subsection, “domiciled in this state” includes domicile for less than one year.\n\n(e) (1) If any veteran described in subsection (d) of this section has applied for federal educational assistance under the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, the board of trustees shall waive the payment of tuition at the Connecticut State University System for such veteran in accordance with subdivision (2) of this subsection. If any such veteran certifies to said board that such veteran's application for such federal educational assistance has been denied or withdrawn, said board of trustees shall waive the payment of tuition in accordance with subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(2) (A) For purposes of this subdivision, “veteran tuition benefit” means the portion of federal educational assistance under the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 to be paid to the Connecticut State University System on behalf of a veteran that represents payment for tuition. Such portion shall be calculated by multiplying (i) the total amount of such federal educational assistance to be paid to the Connecticut State University System on behalf of such veteran by (ii) an amount obtained by dividing (I) the actual tuition charged by the Connecticut State University System to such veteran by (II) the sum of the actual tuition and fees charged by the Connecticut State University System to such veteran.\n\n(B) Said board of trustees shall waive the payment of tuition in excess of the veteran tuition benefit at the Connecticut State University System for such veteran.\n\n(f) Said board shall set aside from its anticipated tuition revenue, an amount not less than that required by the board of governors' tuition policy established under subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of section 10a-6. Such funds shall be used to provide tuition waivers, tuition remissions, grants for educational expenses and student employment for any undergraduate or graduate student who is enrolled as a full or part-time matriculated student in a degree-granting program, or enrolled in a precollege remedial program, and who demonstrates substantial financial need. Said board may also set aside from its anticipated tuition revenue an additional amount equal to one per cent of said tuition revenue for financial assistance for students who would not otherwise be eligible for financial assistance but who do have a financial need as determined by the university in accordance with this subsection. In determining such financial need, the university shall exclude the value of equity in the principal residence of the student's parents or legal guardians, or in the student's principal residence if the student is not considered to be a dependent of his parents or legal guardians and shall assess the earnings of a dependent student at the rate of thirty per cent.\n\n(g) The Connecticut State University System Operating Fund shall be reimbursed for the amount by which the tuition waivers granted under subsection (d) of this section exceed two and one-half per cent of tuition revenue through an annual state appropriation. The board of trustees shall request such an appropriation and said appropriation shall be based upon an estimate of tuition revenue loss using tuition rates in effect for the fiscal year in which such appropriation will apply.\n\n(h) Said board of trustees shall allow any student who is a member of the armed forces called to active duty during any semester to enroll in any course for which such student had remitted tuition but which was not completed due to active duty status. Such course reenrollment shall be offered to any qualifying student for a period not exceeding four years after the date of release from active duty without additional tuition, student fee or related charge, except if such student has been fully reimbursed for the tuition, fees and charges for the course that was not completed.\n\n(i) The Board of Regents for Higher Education shall not assess or charge a graduation fee to any student enrolled in the Connecticut State University System for the purpose of graduating from a state university within such system.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 1419; 1955, S. 937d; 1959, P.A. 411, S. 12; February, 1965, P.A. 330, S. 38; 372, S. 1; 1969, P.A. 530, S. 4; June, 1971, P.A. 5, S. 123, 127; P.A. 73-542, S. 3; P.A. 74-266, S. 3, 5; 74-282, S. 3; P.A. 75-484, S. 3, 5; P.A. 76-181, S. 3, 5; 76-313, S. 1, 3; P.A. 77-241; 77-573, S. 24, 30; P.A. 78-175, S. 3, 5; P.A. 81-252, S. 3, 5; 81-468, S. 10, 11; P.A. 82-218, S. 37, 39, 46; 82-463, S. 3, 7; P.A. 83-457, S. 3, 6; P.A. 84-241, S. 2, 5; 84-365, S. 4, 12; 84-438, S. 3, 5; P.A. 85-553, S. 3, 5; P.A. 86-325, S. 3, 5; P.A. 87-450, S. 9, 17; P.A. 88-136, S. 22, 37; P.A. 89-380, S. 4, 7; P.A. 90-147, S. 8, 9, 20; P.A. 91-174, S. 10, 16; 91-208, S. 7, 11; 91-256, S. 26, 69; 91-303, S. 8, 22; 91-407, S. 31, 42; June Sp.

The borrowing of money and the issuance of securities by the university shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the state or any municipality or political subdivision to levy or to pledge any form of taxation and such securities shall not constitute an indebtedness of the state within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation or restriction and accordingly, shall not be subject to any statutory limitation on the indebtedness of the state and such securities, when issued, shall not be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of the state in respect to and to the extent of any such limitation, except that the amount of securities in each fiscal year in which the General Assembly has authorized the board of trustees to provide for the issuance and sale of securities pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for purposes of section 3-21, but subject to the exclusions or deductions provided in said section 3-21, shall be deemed to be indebtedness of the state until deemed paid or retired. For any years for which there is not an estimate of net tax revenues, the Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates projection of consumer price index growth shall be applied to the most recently adopted state revenue estimate and shall be deemed to satisfy the provisions of subsection (d) of said section 3-21.\n\n(i) In connection with the issuance of securities, the university may create and establish one or more reserve funds to be known as special capital reserve funds and may pay into such special capital reserve funds (1) any moneys appropriated and made available by the state for the purposes of such funds, (2) any proceeds of sale of securities, to the extent provided in the resolution of the university authorizing the issuance thereof, and (3) any other moneys which may be made available to the university for the purpose of such funds from any other source or sources. The moneys held in or credited to any special capital reserve fund established under this subsection, except as provided in this subsection, shall be used solely for the payment of the principal of special obligation securities of the university secured by such special capital reserve fund as the same become due, the purchase of such special obligation securities of the university, the payment of interest on such special obligation securities of the university or the payment of any redemption premium required to be paid when such special obligation securities are redeemed prior to maturity; provided the university may provide that moneys in any such fund shall not be withdrawn therefrom at any time in such amount as would reduce the amount of such funds to less than the maximum amount of principal and interest becoming due by reason of maturity or a required sinking fund installment in the succeeding calendar year on the special obligation securities of the university then outstanding and secured by such special capital reserve fund or such lesser amount specified by the university in its resolution authorizing the issuance of any such special obligation securities, such amount being referred to in this subsection as the “required minimum capital reserve”, except for the purpose of paying such principal of, redemption premium and interest on such special obligation securities of the university secured by such special capital reserve becoming due and for the payment of which other moneys of the university are not available. The university may provide that it shall not issue special obligation securities at any time if the required minimum capital reserve on the special obligation securities outstanding and the special obligation securities then to be issued and secured by a special capital reserve fund will exceed the amount of such special capital reserve fund at the time of issuance, unless the university, at the time of the issuance of such special obligation securities, shall deposit in such special capital reserve fund from the proceeds of the special obligation securities so to be issued, or otherwise, an amount which, together with the amount then in such special capital reserve fund, will be not less than the required minimum capital reserve. On or before December first, annually, there is deemed to be appropriated from the state General Fund such sums, if any, as shall be certified by the chairperson of the board of trustees to the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and Treasurer of the state, as necessary to restore each such special capital reserve fund to the amount equal to the required minimum capital reserve of such fund, and such amounts shall be allotted and paid to the university for deposit therein. For the purpose of evaluation of any such special capital reserve fund, obligations acquired as an investment for any such fund shall be valued at amortized costs. Nothing contained in this section or section 10a-105 shall preclude the university from establishing and creating other debt service reserve funds in connection with the issuance of securities of the university. Subject to any agreement or agreements with holders of outstanding special obligation securities of the university, any amount or amounts allotted and paid to the university by the state pursuant to this section shall be repaid to the state from moneys of the university at such time as such moneys are not required for any other of its corporate purposes and in any event shall be repaid to the state on the date one year after all special obligation securities of the university theretofore issued on the date or dates such amount or amounts are allotted and paid to the university or thereafter issued, together with interest on such special obligation securities, with interest on any unpaid installments of interest and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding by or on behalf of the holders thereof, are fully met and discharged. A special capital reserve fund shall not be created, established or applicable or available pursuant to this subsection unless the board of trustees of the university is of the opinion and determines its self-sufficiency in that (A) project revenues or assured revenues, other than those to be derived from the state debt service commitment and the minimum state operating provision, and as a result of the implementation of its rate covenant, are estimated and expected, assuming continued compliance by the state and the university with the provisions of sections 10a-109a to 10a-109y, inclusive, be sufficient (i) to pay the applicable special debt service requirements on special obligation securities, (ii) to establish, increase and maintain any reserves deemed by the university to be advisable to secure the payment of the special debt service requirements on such special obligation securities and to maintain its renewal and replacement fund and (iii) to operate and maintain in a prudent and economical manner the physical infrastructure of the university and (B) the university has recently reviewed and resolved that it is in compliance with its rate covenant referred to in section 10a-109e. Prior to the issuance of special obligation securities, the security for which is to be enhanced by such a special capital reserve fund, the aforementioned self-sufficiency finding by the university shall be submitted to and confirmed as not unreasonable or arbitrary in the certificate of determination referred to in subsection (e) of this section by the Treasurer of the state. In addition, a special capital reserve fund shall be used only if such use improves or is essential to the rating of the securities or provides interest savings as determined by the Treasurer of the state. The provisions of this subsection respecting the creation, establishment and enhancement of a special capital reserve fund shall not be available or applicable to any general obligation securities issued by the university pursuant to sections 10a-109a to 10a-109y, inclusive.\n\n(P.A. 95-230, S. 7, 45; P.A. 96-180, S. 134, 166; P.A. 98-124, S. 6, 12; May 9 Sp.

      "text": "(a) For the period from July 1, 2001, to June 30, 2027, or until completion of the UConn 2000 infrastructure improvement program, whichever is later, the university shall have charge and supervision of the design, planning, acquisition, remodeling, alteration, repair, enlargement or demolition of any real asset or any other project on its campuses.\n\n(b) (1) The university shall cause to be prepared, proposed construction standards for all projects. The proposed standards shall, subject to applicable law, include, among other things, provisions relating to the quality and type of materials to be used, provisions for safety, fire protection, health and sanitation, provisions for the installation of fixtures, furnishings, equipment, machinery and apparatus, and construction features.\n\n(2) Pursuant to such construction standards in effect at such time, the university shall cause to be prepared, within the costs available therefor, the detailed plans and specifications for each project. The university may from time to time modify, or authorize modifications to, such detailed plans and specifications, provided the plans and specifications as so modified shall comply with the construction standards, if any, adopted pursuant to sections 10a-109a to 10a-109y, inclusive, and in effect at the time of the modifications, and the provisions of section 10a-109e are complied with.\n\n(3) The university shall identify the scope of work and hire, and contract with persons with the necessary experience and capability to perform such scope of work.\n\n(4) The university may contract with a design professional for the design of any project, with a general contractor for the construction of any project; and with one or more prime trade contractors with respect to such construction work if the university determines that to do so will be in the public interest of the state.\n\n(c) (1) Any construction contract to which the university is a party may include a provision that the design professional who designed the project, or an architect or professional engineer or construction manager retained or employed specifically for the purpose of supervision, may supervise the work to be performed through to completion and ensure that the materials furnished and the work performed are in accordance with the drawings, plans, specifications and contracts therefor.\n\n(2) (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision, any total cost basis contract or other contract for the construction of a university project which is estimated to cost more than five hundred thousand dollars, shall be publicly let by the university. The university shall give notice to contractors interested in submitting a project proposal or bid, by posting any such notice on the university web site and on the State Contracting Portal. The notice to contractors shall contain (i) the requirement that contractors be prequalified pursuant to section 4a-100, or subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, as applicable to such contract, (ii) a statement of the time and place where the responses shall be received, and (iii) such additional information as the university deems appropriate. Upon receipt of such responses, the university shall select any contractor who (I) to the extent required pursuant to the provisions of section 4b-91, has been prequalified pursuant to section 4a-100, (II) has shown itself able to post surety bonds required by such contract, (III) has no conflict of interest in the performance of work required by such contract, and (IV) for any such contract that is estimated to cost more than one million dollars, has been prequalified by the university pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this subdivision.\n\n(B) For any contract subject to the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision that is estimated to cost more than one million dollars, the university shall prequalify each contractor by evaluating whether (i) such contractor (I) has demonstrated that it possesses the financial, managerial and technical ability and integrity necessary to faithfully and efficiently perform work for the university in accordance with the requirements set forth in the prequalification application issued by the university, and (II) is responsible and qualified based on its experience with projects similar to that for which the bid or proposal is to be submitted and based on objective written criteria included in the prequalification application issued by the university, and (ii) any subcontractor on the contractor's previous projects, has been in compliance with the provisions of part III of chapter 557 and chapter 558 during the previous five calendar years. The university, in its discretion, may include additional qualification requirements in the notice posted pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this subdivision.\n\n(C) The university may issue a confirmation of prequalification for contracts subject to the provisions of this subdivision to any contractor who meets the requirements set forth in subparagraph (B) of this subdivision. Such confirmation of prequalification shall be effective for one year from the date of issuance and, upon receipt of a completed renewal application and any other materials as prescribed by the university, may be renewed for a period not exceeding two years.\n\n(D) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, the board of trustees may approve a total cost basis contract or other contract for the construction of a university project which is estimated to cost more than five hundred thousand dollars that has not been publicly let pursuant to the provisions of said subparagraph (A), provided the board deems the contract to address an emergency.\n\n(3) Each bid or proposal shall be kept sealed until opened publicly at the time and place as set forth in the notice soliciting such bid or proposal. The university shall not award any construction contract, including, but not limited to, any total cost basis contract, after public letting, except to the responsible qualified contractor, submitting the lowest bid or proposal in compliance with the bid or proposal requirements of the solicitation document. The university may, however, waive any informality in a bid or proposal, and may either reject all bids or proposals and again advertise for bids or proposals or interview at least three responsible qualified contractors and negotiate and enter into with any one of such contractors that construction contract which is both fair and reasonable to the university.\n\n(4) The construction contract, including each total cost basis contract, awarded by the university shall contain such other terms and conditions, and such provisions for penalties as the university may deem appropriate.\n\n(5) No payments shall be made by the university on account of any contract for the project awarded by or for the university until the bills or estimates presented for such payment shall have been duly certified to be correct by the university. No payments shall be made from any other fund on account of any contract for any project awarded by or for the university until the bills or estimates presented for such payment shall have been duly certified to be correct by the university.\n\n(6) Provision shall be made in each contract to the effect that payment is limited to the amount provided therein and that no liability of the university or state shall and may be incurred beyond such amount.\n\n(7) The university shall require, for the protection of the state and the university, such deposits, bonds and security in connection with the submission of bids or proposals, the award of construction contracts and the performance of work as the university shall determine to be appropriate and in the public interest of the state.\n\n(8) Any contract awarded by the university shall be a contract with the state acting through the university.\n\n(9) (A) The university shall not enter into a construction manager at-risk project delivery contract that does not provide for a maximum guaranteed price for the cost of construction which shall be determined not later than the time of the receipt and approval by the university of the trade contractor bids. Each construction manager at-risk shall invite bids and give notice of opportunities to bid on project elements, by posting any such invitation or notice on the State Contracting Portal. Each bid shall be kept sealed until opened publicly at the time and place as set forth in the notice soliciting such bid. The construction manager at-risk shall, after consultation with and approval by the university, award any related contracts for project elements to the responsible qualified contractor, who shall be prequalified pursuant to section 4a-100, submitting the lowest bid in compliance with the bid requirements, provided (i) the construction manager at-risk shall not be eligible to submit a bid for any such project element, and (ii) construction shall not begin prior to the determination of the maximum guaranteed price, except (I) for the project elements of site preparation and demolition that have been previously put out to bid and awarded, and (II) for the project elements of site preparation, demolition, public utility installation and connections and building envelope components, including the roof, doors, windows and exterior walls, as provided in subparagraph (B) of this subdivision.\n\n(B) Construction may begin prior to the determination of the maximum guaranteed price for the project elements of site preparation, demolition, public utility installation and connections and building envelope components, including the roof, doors, windows and exterior walls, provided (i) the project involves the renovation of an existing building or facility; (ii) the project element or elements involved in such early work have been previously put out to bid and awarded; and (iii) the total cost of construction of the early work does not exceed twenty-five per cent of the estimated cost of construction for the entire project.\n\n(C) If such project involves the renovation of an existing building or facility that will be performed in multiple phases while such building or facility remains occupied, the university may enter into a construction manager at-risk project delivery contract that provides for the maximum guaranteed price to be determined for each phase of the project, prior to beginning each such phase, provided each party to the contract complies with all of the requirements of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, except the timing of the determination of the maximum guaranteed price set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii) of this subdivision.\n\n(10) If the university designates a project as suitable for a design-build contract, the university may enter into a single contract with a design-builder recommended by a selection panel and selected by the university. The university shall give notice of such project and specifications for such project by posting such notice on the State Contracting Portal. The university shall establish a selection panel for each project to score the qualifications and past performance of each design-builder who submits a competitive proposal to the university for such project. The selection panel shall score the qualifications and past performance of each design-builder using a predetermined scoring method developed by the university and provided to each design-builder in advance of such design-builder's development of the competitive proposal. The selection panel's scoring method may be unique to each project, but shall consist of combining the score of each design-builder's qualifications and past performance and evaluating the technical merit of the competitive proposal and each design-builder's projected project cost. The design-build contract shall (A) include, but not be limited to, such project elements as permitting, engineering, design, construction and, if applicable, site acquisition, and (B) be based on the competitive proposal submitted by the design-builder that is selected by the university. No design-build contract for which the total cost is estimated to be more than the amount set forth in subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 4b-91 may be awarded to a design-builder who is not prequalified for the project in accordance with section 4a-100. Such design-build contracts shall state the responsibilities of the design-builder to deliver a completed and acceptable project on a date certain and the maximum costs of the project and, if applicable, as a separate item, the cost of any site acquisition. The university shall determine all other requirements and conditions for such competitive proposals, selection of a design-builder and other awards and shall have sole responsibility for all other aspects of such design-build contracts.\n\n(d) For the purposes of part III of chapter 557, a project undertaken by the university shall be deemed to be a state public works project and consist of public buildings.\n\n(e) (1) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, any license, permit, and approval required or permitted to be issued and any administrative action required or permitted to be taken pursuant to the general statutes in connection with any project by the university shall be issued or taken upon application to the particular commissioner or commissioners having jurisdiction over such license, permit, approval or other administrative action or such other state official as such commissioner shall designate. As used in this section, the term commissioner shall mean commissioners if more than one commissioner has jurisdiction over the subject matter and their designee, if any. No agency, commission, council, committee, panel or other body whatsoever other than such commissioner shall have jurisdiction over or cognizance of any licenses, permits, approvals or administrative actions concerning any project and no notice of any tentative determination or any final determination regarding any such license, permit, approval or administrative action and no notice of any such license, permit, approval or administrative action shall be required except as expressly provided pursuant to this subsection. For purposes of sections 10a-109a to 10a-109y, inclusive, a capital project is a state facility and accordingly, no ordinance, law or regulation promulgated by or any authority granted to any municipality or any other political subdivision of the state shall apply to a capital project. The State Properties Review Board shall have jurisdiction over any project in the same manner as provided in chapter 60 for a priority higher education facility project. Such commissioner may issue licenses and permits, give such approval and take such administrative action as shall be necessary or desirable.\n\n(2) All applications, supporting documentation and other records submitted to the commissioner and pertaining to any application for any license, permit, approval or other administrative action, together with all records of the proceedings of the commissioner relating to any license, permit, approval or administrative action shall be a public record and shall be made, maintained and disclosed in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act, as defined in section 1-200.\n\n(3) All applications for licenses, permits, approvals and other administrative action required by any applicable provision of the general statutes shall be submitted to the commissioner as provided in subdivision (1) of this subsection.\n\n(4) (A) Any hearing regarding all or any part of any project, provided for by this section, shall be conducted by the particular commissioner having jurisdiction over the applicable license, permit, approval or other administrative action. Legal notice of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper having general circulation in an area which includes the municipality in which the particular part of such project is proposed to be built or is being built not more than ten nor less than five days in advance of such hearing.\n\n(B) In rendering any decision in connection with any project, the commissioner shall weigh all competent material and substantial evidence presented by the applicant and the public in accordance with the applicable statute. The commissioner shall issue written findings and determinations upon which the commissioner's decision is based. Such findings and determinations shall consist of evidence presented, including such matters as the commissioner deems appropriate, provided such matters, to the extent applicable to the particular permit, shall include the nature of any major adverse health and environmental impact of any project. The commissioner may reverse or modify any order or action at any time on the commissioner's own motion. The procedure for such reversal or modification shall be the same as the procedure for the original proceeding.\n\n(C) Any administrative action taken by any commissioner in connection with any project may be appealed by an aggrieved party to the superior court for the judicial district of New Britain in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183, except as otherwise provided in sections 10a-109a to 10a-109y, inclusive. Such appeal shall be brought not later than ten days after the date of mailing to the parties to the proceeding of a notice of such order, decision or action by certified mail, return receipt requested, and the appellant shall serve a copy of the appeal on each party listed in the final decision at the address shown in such decision. Failure to make such service within such ten days on parties other than the commissioner who rendered the final decision may not, in the discretion of the court, deprive the court of jurisdiction over such appeal. Within ten days after the service of such appeal, or within such further time as may be allowed by the court, the commissioner who rendered such decision shall cause any portion of the record that had not been transcribed to be transcribed and shall cause either the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding appealed from to be transmitted to the reviewing court. Such record shall include the commissioner's findings of fact and conclusions of law, separately stated. If more than one commissioner has jurisdiction over the matter, such commissioners shall issue joint findings of fact and conclusions of law. Such appeal shall state the reasons upon which it is predicated and, notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, shall not stay the development of any project. The commissioner who rendered such decision shall appear as the respondent. Such appeals to the superior court shall each be privileged matters and shall be heard as soon after the return date as practicable. A court shall render its decision not later than twenty-one days after the date that the entire record, with the transcript, is filed with the court by the commissioner who rendered the decision.\n\n(D) The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the commissioner as to the weight of the evidence presented on a question of fact. The court shall affirm the decision of the commissioner unless the court finds that substantial rights of the party appealing such decision have been materially prejudiced because the findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions of the commissioner are: (i) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions, (ii) in excess of the statutory authority of the commissioner, (iii) made upon unlawful procedure, (iv) affected by an error of law, (v) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record, or (vi) arbitrary, capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\n\n(E) If the court finds material prejudice, it may sustain the appeal. Upon sustaining an appeal, the court may render a judgment which modifies the decision of the commissioner, orders particular action of the commissioner or orders the commissioner to take such action as may be necessary to effect a particular action and the commissioner may issue a permit consistent with such judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an applicant may file an amended application and the commissioner may, pursuant to the procedures set forth in sections 10a-109a to 10a-109y, inclusive, consider an amended application for an order, permit or other administrative action following court action.\n\n(F) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3-125, in consultation with the Attorney General, the university may use the legal services of any private attorney, in connection with the construction, operation and maintenance of any project. The board of trustees shall determine the effective and efficient method or methods of legal services to accomplish the construction, operation and maintenance of all projects, taking into account the capacity, cost and expense of private counsel for such services and the capacity and direct and indirect cost and expense of and identified by the Attorney General for such services.\n\n(f) On or before December thirty-first and June thirtieth of each year, the university shall submit a report to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to finance, revenue and bonding. Such report shall include the following information: (1) The names and addresses of contractors and subcontractors performing repair, addition, alteration and new construction on the university's campuses in the previous six calendar months, (2) the extent to which such contractors and subcontractors have been in compliance with the provisions of part III of chapter 557 and the provisions of chapter 558, and (3) any actions taken by the university to cooperate with the Labor Department in the enforcement of said provisions.\n\n(P.A. 88-230, S. 1, 12; P.A. 90-98, S. 1, 2; P.A. 93-142, S. 4, 7, 8; P.A. 95-220, S. 4–6; 95-230, S. 14, 45; P.A. 97-47, S. 31; P.A. 99-215, S. 24, 29; May 9 Sp.
