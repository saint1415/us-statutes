The issuer shall fund borrower fee reductions, interest rate reductions, rebates, loan forgiveness or other borrower benefits allowable under the programs authorized by this chapter in an aggregate annual amount at least equal to the net reduction in program financing cost achieved by the issuer in each year through the issuance of private activity bonds, as defined in section 32-140, taking into account any federal loan program terms and any federal loan program or tax requirements resulting from such financing. Any officer with whom, or any bank or trust company with which, such moneys shall be deposited shall act as trustee of such moneys and shall hold and apply the same for the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this chapter and the resolution authorizing the bonds of any issue or the trust agreement securing such bonds may provide.\n\n(n) Any holder of bonds, notes or other obligations issued under the provisions of this section or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee or trustees under any trust agreement, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by any resolution authorizing the issuance of, or any such trust agreement securing, such bonds, notes or other obligations, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the state or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust agreement, and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by this section or by such resolution or trust agreement to be performed by the issuer or by any officer, employee or agent of the issuer, including the appointment of a receiver to administer any loans or other pledged assets and revenues.\n\n(o) The corporation and any subsidiary created pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 10a-204 is authorized and empowered, from time to time, to issue bonds, notes or other obligations the interest on which, if so designated by resolution of the issuer, shall be includable in the gross income of the holder or holders of such bonds, notes or other obligations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, and in the same manner that interest on bills, bonds, notes or other obligations of the United States is includable in the gross income of the holder or holders thereof under said Internal Revenue Code; the state hereby consents to such inclusion only for the bonds, notes and other obligations of the corporation or such a subsidiary, as applicable, authorized by this section.\n\n(p) In connection with, or incidental to, the issuance or carrying of bonds, notes or other obligations, or acquisition or carrying of any investment or program of investment, the corporation or any subsidiary created pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 10a-204 may enter into any contract with any financial institution having a rating of at least “A”, or into any contract secured by security so rated, which the issuer determines to be necessary or appropriate to place the obligation or investment of the issuer, as represented by the bonds, notes or other obligations, investment or program of investment and the contract or contracts, in whole or in part, on the interest rate cash flow or other basis desired by the issuer.\n\n(q) In connection with, or incidental to, the issuance or carrying of bonds, notes or other obligations or entering into any of the contracts or agreements referred to in subsection (p) of this section, the corporation or any subsidiary created pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 10a-204 may enter into credit enhancement or liquidity agreements, with payment, interest rate, security, default, remedy and other terms and conditions as the issuer determines.\n\n(r) The state covenants with the purchasers and all other subsequent owners and transferees of bonds, notes or other obligations issued by the corporation or by any subsidiary created pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 10a-204 pursuant to this section, in consideration of the acceptance of and payment for the bonds, notes or other obligations, until the bonds, notes or other obligations, together with the interest thereon, with interest on any unpaid installment of interest and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding on behalf of the owners, are fully met and discharged or unless expressly permitted or otherwise authorized by the terms of each contract and agreement made or entered into by or on behalf of the issuer with or for the benefit of such owners, that the state: (1) Will not create or cause to be created any lien or charge on the assets or revenues pledged to secure such bonds, notes or other obligations, other than a lien or pledge created thereon pursuant to this section; (2) will not in any way impair the rights, exemptions or remedies of the owners; and (3) will not limit, modify, rescind, repeal or otherwise alter the rights or obligations of the issuer to take such action as may be necessary to fulfill the terms of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, notes or other obligations; provided nothing in this section shall preclude the state from exercising its power, through a change in law, to limit, modify, rescind, repeal or otherwise alter this chapter if and when adequate provision shall be made by law for the protection of the holders of outstanding bonds, notes or other obligations, pursuant to the resolution under which the bonds, notes or other obligations are issued. The state further covenants with the purchasers and all subsequent owners and transferees of bonds, notes or other obligations issued by the corporation or by such a subsidiary pursuant to this section, in consideration of the acceptance of and payment for the bonds, notes or other obligations that, notwithstanding any provision of title 12, the bonds, notes or other obligations shall be free at all times from taxes levied by any municipality or political subdivision or special district having taxing powers of the state, and the principal and interest of any bonds, notes or other obligations issued under the provisions of this section, the transfer of such bonds, notes or other obligations and the income from such bonds, notes or other obligations, including any profit on the sale or transfer of such bonds, notes or other obligations, shall at all times be exempt from any taxation by the state or under its authority, except for estate or succession taxes. The issuer is authorized to include covenants of the state provided for in this subsection, as a contract of the state, in any agreement with the owners of any bonds, notes or other obligations, in any credit facility or reimbursement agreement with respect to the bonds, notes or other obligations and in any agreement authorized by subsection (p) or (q) of this section.\n\n(s) The provisions of this section shall be deemed to provide a complete, additional and alternative method for the actions and the things authorized thereby and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers granted by other laws; the issuance of bonds, notes or other obligations under the provisions of this section need not comply with the requirements of any law applicable to the issuance of bonds, notes or other obligations. This section, being necessary for the welfare of the state and its inhabitants, shall be liberally construed to affect its purpose. None of the powers granted to the corporation or to any subsidiary created pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 10a-204 under the provisions of this section shall be subject to the supervision or regulation or require the approval or consent of any municipality or political subdivision or any department, division, commission, board, body, bureau, official or agency thereof or of the state, and the exercise thereof shall not cause the corporation or any such subsidiary to be construed to be an agency within the scope of chapter 54 or a department, institution or agency of the state.\n\n(t) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) to (s), inclusive, of this section, any subsidiary created by a corporation pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 10a-204 may issue bonds, notes or other obligations to refund corporation bonds if approved by resolution of the subsidiary, and the corporation may issue bonds, notes or other obligations to refund subsidiary bonds, if approved by resolution of the corporation. No bond, note or other obligation issued by any such subsidiary shall constitute a debt or liability of the corporation, except as may be designated by resolution of the corporation, or of any other subsidiary created pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 10a-204 except as may be designated by resolution of such other subsidiary. No bond, note or other obligation of the corporation shall constitute a debt or liability of a subsidiary, except as may be designated by resolution of such subsidiary.
