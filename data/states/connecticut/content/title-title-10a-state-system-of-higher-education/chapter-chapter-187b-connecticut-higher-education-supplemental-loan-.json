In determining “other forms of student assistance” the authority may consider (A) grants received under any federal or state grant programs, (B) loan proceeds received under any federal or other state loan program, (C) scholarship, grants or other nonrepayable assistance received from government agencies, educational institutions or organizations, including, but not limited to, the authority, and (D) expected family contributions. The authority shall require that each borrower under an education loan shall use the proceeds solely for educational purposes and purposes reasonably related thereto, or for the refinancing of an eligible loan.\n\n(c) Whenever refunding bonds are issued to refund bonds the proceeds of which were used to make authority loans, the authority may reduce the amounts of principal or interest, or both, it is owed by the participating institution for higher education which had received authority loans from the proceeds of the refunded bonds. Such institutions may, or in accordance with guidelines established by the authority shall, use any reduced amount to reduce the amount of interest being paid on education loans which the institution has made pursuant to the authority loans from the proceeds of the refunded bonds.\n\n(d) (1) The authority may develop and require the use of a master promissory note for education loans. Each master promissory note shall allow borrowers to receive, in addition to initial education loans, additional education loans for the same or subsequent periods of enrollment. Each master promissory note shall include a provision stating that the note shall be governed by and construed pursuant to the laws of the state of Connecticut.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes or any regulation adopted pursuant to said statutes, each education loan made under a master promissory note pursuant to this subsection may be sold or assigned independently of any other education loan made under the same master promissory note and each such loan shall be separately enforceable on the basis of an original or copy of the master promissory note in accordance with the terms of the master promissory note.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, each such master promissory note shall be fully negotiable within the meaning and for all purposes of title 42a, regardless of whether the form and character of such master promissory note qualifies under the terms of the provisions of title 42a.\n\n(4) The authority may pledge all or any part of its interest in any such master promissory note or the education loan evidenced by such note as security for any issue of bonds or notes or any other obligations. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; the interest so pledged by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the authority or any participating institution for higher education, irrespective of whether such parties have notice of the lien. Such lien shall have priority over all other liens, including, without limitation, the lien of any person who in the ordinary course of business furnishes services or materials to the authority. Notwithstanding the provisions of title 42a, neither the bond resolution nor any financing statement, continuation statement or other instrument by which a pledge or security interest is created or by which the authority's interest in such master promissory notes is assigned need be filed in any public records in order to perfect the security interest or lien thereof as against third parties. Any outright sale by the authority of any education loan evidenced by such a master promissory note shall be effective and perfected automatically upon attachment as defined in title 42a.\n\n(P.A. 82-313, S. 5, 28; P.A. 87-295, S. 4, 8; P.A. 88-266, S. 25, 46; P.A. 93-96, S. 4; P.A. 94-180, S. 16, 17; P.A. 07-108, S. 2; P.A. 15-200, S. 2; P.A. 21-62, S. 6.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 87-295 made the section conform with the definitions in Sec. 10a-223 as amended by P.A. 87-295 and made technical changes; P.A. 88-266 amended Subsec.
