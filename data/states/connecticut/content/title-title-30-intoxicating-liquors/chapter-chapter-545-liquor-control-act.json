The holder of a wholesaler permit may apply for and shall thereupon receive an out-of-state shipper's permit for direct importation from abroad of alcoholic liquors manufactured outside the United States and an out-of-state shipper's permit for direct importation from abroad of beer manufactured outside the United States. The annual fee for a wholesaler permit shall be two thousand six hundred fifty dollars.\n\n(2) When a holder of a wholesaler permit has had the distributorship of any alcohol, beer, spirits or wine product of a manufacturer or out-of-state shipper for six months or more, such distributorship may be terminated or its geographic territory diminished upon (A) the execution of a written stipulation by the wholesaler and manufacturer or out-of-state shipper agreeing to the change and the approval of such change by the Department of Consumer Protection; or (B) the sending of a written notice by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, by the manufacturer or out-of-state shipper to the wholesaler, a copy of which notice has been sent simultaneously to the department in a manner prescribed by the Commissioner of Consumer Protection. No such termination or diminishment shall become effective except for just and sufficient cause, provided such cause shall be set forth in such notice and the department shall determine, after hearing, that just and sufficient cause exists. If an emergency occurs, caused by the wholesaler, prior to such hearing, which threatens the manufacturers' or out-of-state shippers' products or otherwise endangers the business of the manufacturer or out-of-state shipper and said emergency is established to the satisfaction of the department, the department may temporarily suspend such wholesaler permit or take whatever reasonable action the department deems advisable to provide for such emergency and the department may continue such temporary action until its decision after a full hearing. The department shall render its decision with reasonable promptness following such hearing. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, a manufacturer or out-of-state shipper may appoint one or more additional wholesalers as the distributor for an alcohol, spirits or wine product within such territory, provided such appointment shall not be effective until six months from the date such manufacturer or out-of-state shipper sets forth such intention in written notice to the existing wholesaler by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, with a copy of such notice simultaneously sent to the department in a manner prescribed by the Commissioner of Consumer Protection.

Such written notice shall include the name of each additional wholesaler appointed as a distributor and provide a detailed description of the just and sufficient cause necessitating such appointment. For the purposes of this section, “just and sufficient cause” means the existence of circumstances which, in the opinion of a reasonable person considering all of the equities of both the wholesaler and the manufacturer or out-of-state shipper warrants a termination or a diminishment of a distributorship as the case may be.

If the holder of a Connecticut craft cafe permit also holds a manufacturer permit for beer issued under subsection (b) of section 30-16, such holder may sell, at retail for consumption on the permit premises, any brand of beer that such holder manufactured in collaboration with at least one other holder of such a manufacturer permit, provided not more than one such brand of beer may be sold from the permit premises at any time. The holder of a Connecticut craft cafe permit shall also hold a manufacturer permit issued under section 30-16, and shall keep food available during the majority of the hours such permit premises are open under this subsection for sale to, and consumption by, customers on such permit premises. The availability of food from outside vendors located on or near the permit premises, delivered either directly by such outside vendors or indirectly through a third party, is sufficient to satisfy such requirement. The permit premises shall at all times comply with all regulations of the local department of health. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require that any food be sold or purchased with any alcoholic liquor, and no rule, regulation or standard shall be promulgated or enforced to require that sales of food be substantial or that the business's receipts from sales of alcoholic liquor equal any set percentage of total receipts from all sales made on the permit premises.

Such sales shall be conducted only during the hours that the holder of a manufacturer permit for beer issued under subsection (b) of section 30-16 is permitted to sell alcoholic liquor under the provisions of subsection (d) of section 30-91.

When an application is filed for any type of permit for a building that has not been constructed, such applicant shall erect and maintain in a legible condition a sign not less than six feet by four feet upon the site where such place of business is to be located, instead of such placard upon the outer door of the building.

Notice of any such change shall be given to the department and the permit shall be endorsed to show correct ownership. When any partnership changes by reason of the addition of one or more persons, a new application with new fees shall be required.\n\n(c) Any ten persons who are at least eighteen years of age, and are residents of the town within which the business for which the permit or renewal thereof has been applied for, is intended to be operated, or, in the case of a manufacturer's or a wholesaler's permit, any ten persons who are at least eighteen years of age and are residents of the state, may file with the department, within three weeks from the last date of publication of notice made pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection (b) of this section for an initial permit, and in the case of renewal of an existing permit, at least twenty-one days before the renewal date of such permit, a remonstrance containing any objection to the suitability of such applicant or proposed place of business, provided any such issue is not controlled by local zoning.

If no new permit is issued within twelve months of the filing date, as defined in subsection (a) of this section, the application may, in the discretion of the department, be deemed withdrawn and shall then be returned to the applicant. Six months' or seasonal permits may be renewed, provided the renewal application and fee shall be filed at least twenty-one days before the reopening of the business, there is no change in the permittee, ownership or type of permit, and the permittee or backer did not receive a rebate of the permit fee with respect to the permit issued for the previous year.\n\n(e) The department may renew a permit that has expired if the applicant pays to the department a nonrefundable late fee pursuant to subsection (c) of section 21a-4, which fee shall be in addition to the fees prescribed in this chapter for the permit applied for. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to one-day permits, to any permit which is the subject of administrative or court proceedings, or where otherwise provided by law.\n\n(f) No person who assists an applicant, backer or permittee in submitting an application for a liquor permit shall submit, or cause to be submitted, any false statement in connection with such application, or engage in any conduct which delays or impedes the department in processing such application. A violation of this subsection shall be deemed an unfair or deceptive trade practice under subsection (a) of section 42-110b. The commissioner, after providing an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with chapter 54, may impose on any person who violates the provisions of this subsection a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars per violation, and may order such person to pay restitution to the applicant, backer or permittee.

A wholesaler permittee or backer, or a manufacturer permittee or backer, that has not received payment in full from a retailer permittee or backer within thirty days after the date such credit was extended to such retailer or backer or to an employee or agent of any such retailer or backer, shall give a written notice of obligation to such retailer within the five days following the expiration of the thirty-day period of credit. The notice of obligation shall state: The amount due; the date credit was extended; the date the thirty-day period ended; and that the retailer is in violation of this section. A retailer who disputes the accuracy of the “notice of obligation” shall, within the ten days following the expiration of the thirty-day period of credit, give a written response to notice of obligation to the department and give a copy to the wholesaler or manufacturer who sent the notice. The response shall state the retailer's basis for dispute and the amount, if any, admitted to be owed for more than thirty days; the copy forwarded to the wholesaler or manufacturer shall be accompanied by the amount admitted to be due, if any, and such payment shall be made and received without prejudice to the rights of either party in any civil action. Upon receipt of the retailer's response, the chairman of the commission or such chairman's designee shall conduct an informal hearing with the parties being given equal opportunity to appear and be heard. If the chairman or such chairman's designee determines that the notice of obligation is accurate, the department shall forthwith issue an order directing the wholesaler or manufacturer to promptly give all manufacturers and wholesalers engaged in the business of selling alcoholic liquor to retailers in this state, a “notice of delinquency”. The notice of delinquency shall identify the delinquent retailer, and state the amount due and the date of the expiration of the thirty-day credit period. No wholesaler or manufacturer receiving a notice of delinquency shall extend credit by the sale of alcoholic liquor or otherwise to such delinquent retailer until after the manufacturer or wholesaler has received a “notice of satisfaction” from the sender of the notice of delinquency. If the chairman or such chairman's designee determines that the notice of obligation is inaccurate, the department shall forthwith issue an order prohibiting a notice of delinquency. The party for whom the determination by the chairman or such chairman's designee was adverse, shall promptly pay to the department a part of the cost of the proceedings as determined by the chairman or such chairman's designee, which shall not be less than fifty dollars. The department may suspend or revoke the permit of any permittee who, in bad faith, gives an incorrect notice of obligation, an incorrect response to notice of obligation, or an unauthorized notice of delinquency. If the department does not receive a response to the notice of obligation within such ten-day period, the delinquency shall be deemed to be admitted and the wholesaler or manufacturer who sent the notice of obligation shall, within the three days following the expiration of such ten-day period, give a notice of delinquency to the department and to all wholesalers and manufacturers engaged in the business of selling alcoholic liquor to retailers in this state. A notice of delinquency identifying a retailer who does not file a response within such ten-day period shall have the same effect as a notice of delinquency given by order of the chairman or such chairman's designee. A wholesaler permittee or manufacturer permittee that has given a notice of delinquency and that receives full payment for the credit extended, shall, within three days after the date of full payment, give a notice of satisfaction to the department and to all wholesalers and manufacturers to whom a notice of delinquency was sent. The prohibition against extension of credit to such retailer shall be void upon such full payment. The department may revoke or suspend any permit for a violation of this section. An appeal from an order of revocation or suspension issued in accordance with this section may be taken in accordance with section 30-60.\n\n(c) If there is a proposed change or change in ownership of a retail permit premises, no application for a permit shall be approved until the applicant files with the department an affidavit executed by the seller of the retail permit premises stating that all obligations of the predecessor permittee for the purchase of alcoholic liquor at such permit premises have been paid or that such applicant did not receive direct or indirect consideration from the predecessor permittee. The commissioner may waive the requirement of such seller's affidavit upon finding that (1) the predecessor permittee abandoned the premises prior to the filing of the application, and (2) such permittee did not receive any consideration, direct or indirect, for such permittee's abandonment. For the purposes of this subsection, “consideration” means the receipt of legal tender or goods or services for the purchase of alcoholic liquor remaining on the premises of the predecessor permittee, for which bills remain unpaid.\n\n(d) A permittee may file a designation of an authorized agent with the department to issue or receive all notices or documents provided for in this section. The permittee shall be responsible for the issuance or receipt of such notices or documents by the agent.\n\n(e) The period of credit permitted under this section shall be calculated as the time elapsing between the date of receipt of the alcoholic liquors by the purchaser and the date of full legal discharge of the purchaser through the payment of cash or its equivalent from all indebtedness arising from the transaction except that, if the last day for payment falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the last day for payment shall then be the next business day.\n\n(f) A permittee shall be a director, employee, member, officer, partner or shareholder of the backer. For the purposes of this subsection, “employee” means an individual whose (1) manner and means of work performance are subject to the right of control of, or are controlled by, the backer, and (2) compensation is reported, or required to be reported, on a federal Form W-2 issued by, or caused to be issued by, the backer.\n\n(1949, Rev., S. 4266; 1969, P.A. 150, S. 1; 1972, P.A. 143; P.A. 73-533, S. 6; 73-543, S. 9, 14; P.A. 74-307, S. 9; P.A. 75-598, S. 4; 75-641, S. 13; P.A. 77-132, S. 1, 2; 77-614, S. 165, 587, 610; P.A. 78-303, S. 80, 85, 136; P.A. 79-404, S. 41, 45; P.A. 80-482, S. 4, 170, 191, 345, 348; P.A. 82-32, S. 1, 2; 82-332, S. 5, 13; P.A. 84-494, S. 8, 11; P.A. 85-380, S. 3, 12; P.A. 93-139, S. 51; P.A. 95-161, S. 5; 95-195, S. 51, 83; P.A. 96-7, S. 3, 5; 96-220, S. 5, 7; P.A. 97-66; P.A. 98-164, S. 1; P.A. 03-34, S. 1; P.A. 04-9, S. 2; 04-31, S. 1; P.A. 05-274, S. 5; P.A. 09-47, S. 5; P.A. 11-164, S. 4; P.A. 13-299, S. 85; P.A. 14-189, S. 2; P.A. 15-30, S. 1; P.A. 17-160, S. 4; P.A. 19-24, S. 16; P.A. 21-37, S. 68; 21-50, S. 8; P.A. 22-56, S. 4; 22-70, S. 13; 22-104, S. 19; P.A. 23-50, S. 19, 20.)\n\nHistory: 1969 act permitted backer of hotel or restaurant permit to be a backer “in both such classes”; 1972 act permitted backer of restaurant or cafe permit to be backer of both such classes; P.A. 73-533 added provisions re backers of coliseum concession permits; P.A. 73-543 allowed backer or permittee of airline permit to be backer or permittee in other classes; P.A. 74-307 added provisions re backers of special sporting facility permits, allowed permittees to have more than one permit where commission determines that location of permits will allow for sufficient supervision, etc. and allowed operators of racing or jai alai exhibitions to back permits; P.A. 75-598 allowed backer or permittee of night club permit to be backer or permittee in other classes; P.A. 75-641 required that appeals be taken in accordance with Sec. 30-60 rather than Sec. 30-55; P.A. 77-132 allowed backer of university permit to be backer of nonprofit theater permit; P.A. 77-614 and P.A. 78-303 replaced liquor control commission with division of liquor control within the department of business regulation, effective January 1, 1979; P.A. 79-404 replaced commission on special revenue with gaming policy board in provision re licensing of racing or jai alai exhibition; P.A. 80-482 made division of liquor control an independent department and abolished the department of business regulation, overriding provision of same act which would have placed the division within the public safety department; P.A. 82-32 permitted a person who is a holder or backer of a restaurant permit to be a holder or backer of a bowling establishment permit; P.A. 82-332 divided section into Subsecs., eliminated provision in Subsec.

The provisions of this subsection shall apply to any such interest without regard to whether such interest is a controlling interest. For the purposes of this subsection, “person” means (A) an individual, (B) a corporation or any subsidiary of a corporation, or (C) any combination of corporations or individuals any of whom, or any combination of whom, owns or controls, directly or indirectly, more than five per cent of any entity which is a backer, as defined in section 30-1.\n\n(b) A retail permit, for the purposes of subsection (a) of this section, means a package store liquor permit or a druggist liquor permit.\n\n(c) Membership in any organization which is or may become the holder of a club or nonprofit club permit issued under section 30-22aa shall not constitute acquisition of an interest in a retail permit.\n\n(d) Any person who violates any provision of this section or of any regulation adopted pursuant to this section shall be fined not less than fifty dollars nor more than two hundred fifty dollars and any permit issued in violation of this section shall be revoked.\n\n(1963, P.A. 555, S. 1–4; P.A. 81-294, S. 8, 22; 81-367, S. 6, 9; P.A. 84-401; P.A. 96-86; P.A. 12-17, S. 7; P.A. 15-244, S. 81; P.A. 21-37, S. 69; P.A. 22-104, S. 20.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 81-294 amended Subsec.

Such notice shall be given (1) within one hundred twenty days of the occurrence of such injury to person or property, or (2) in the case of the death or incapacity of any aggrieved person, within one hundred eighty days of the occurrence of such injury to person or property. Such notice shall specify the time, the date and the person to whom such sale was made, the name and address of the person injured or whose property was damaged, and the time, date and place where the injury to person or property occurred. No action under the provisions of this section shall be brought but within one year from the date of the act or omission complained of. Such injured person shall have no cause of action against such seller for negligence in the sale of alcoholic liquor to a person twenty-one years of age or older.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 4307; 1955, S. 2172d; 1957, P.A. 306; 1959, P.A. 631, S. 1; 1961, P.A. 432; P.A. 74-144, S. 1, 2; P.A. 86-338, S. 7; P.A. 87-227, S. 11; P.A. 03-91, S. 1; P.A. 06-69, S. 1; P.A. 07-165, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: 1959 act limited recovery to $25,000 and extended the notice period from 60 to 90 days; 1961 act reduced recoverable amount to $20,000 and notice period to 60 days and placed $50,000 limitation on aggregate amount recoverable; P.A. 74-144 specified factors to be considered in computing 60-day period; P.A. 86-338 added Subsec. (b) establishing a rebuttable presumption that the last seller is solely liable; P.A. 87-227 deleted provision added in 1986 which established a rebuttable presumption that the last seller is solely liable; P.A. 03-91 made technical changes for the purpose of gender neutrality, raised damages limits to $250,000 for injured person or persons and prohibited negligence action against seller for sale of alcoholic liquor to person 21 years of age or older, effective June 3, 2003; P.A. 06-69 extended notice period from 60 to 120 days and deleted provision re time excluded from computation of 60-day period, effective October 1, 2006, and applicable to causes of action arising on or after that date; P.A. 07-165 repositioned existing provision re written notice within 120 days of occurrence of injury as Subdiv. (1) and added provision re notice in case of death or incapacity of aggrieved person as Subdiv. (2), effective July 1, 2007, and applicable to causes of action arising on or after that date.\n\nPrior to 1957 amendment, statute governed by a 3-year statute of limitations. 142 C. 452. It is not necessary to prove a causal connection between the sale of the intoxicating liquor and the injury; the delict defined is not the sale of liquor to create the condition of intoxication but sale to one already intoxicated. 143 C. 53. The word “sell” is used in the sense of purvey or furnish; the dispensing of food in a restaurant for consumption on the premises does not constitute a sale but rather a service; a permit to sell liquor is a matter of privilege and not of right; by engaging in the liquor business, the permittee assumes the risk of a variety of situations which could impose liability on him; it is not an unconstitutional exercise of the police power for a permittee who sells in violation of the law to be prevented from defending on the ground that the particular drink which he sold did not cause or contribute to the buyer's intoxication; the furnishing of intoxicants for a price to a group of 2 or more in one company may be considered a sale to each member of that group. 144 C. 241. 1959 act limiting recovery to $25,000 held substantive in nature and not applicable to pending action. 149 C. 402. Requirement of written notice to seller does not require plaintiff to give a “signed” written notice. Id., 405. Dram Shop Act modifies common law rule that the proximate cause of intoxication is consumption of liquor, not furnishing of it, and is restricted to its terms; history of section. 154 C. 432. As a matter of law, negligent act of seller or donor of intoxicating beverages is not a substantial factor in recipient's injury of third party. 170 C. 356. Cited. 176 C. 676; 180 C. 252. There is no common law right of action in negligence against one who furnishes intoxicating liquor to another who becomes intoxicated and causes injury; however, an individual may be liable for the injurious consequences of wanton and reckless conduct in furnishing alcoholic beverages to another. 181 C. 355. Cited. 187 C. 147. To recover under statute, an essential element is proof that patron was intoxicated; to be intoxicated is something more than to be merely under the influence of, or affected to some extent by, liquor; it means an abnormal or physical condition due to the influence of intoxicating liquors, a visible excitation of the passions and impairment of the judgment, or a derangement or impairment of physical functions and energies. 196 C. 341. Cited. 201 C. 385. Payments under this section not encompassed by set off provisions of Sec. 38-175c(b)(1). 205 C. 178. Cited. 207 C. 88; 211 C. 67. Neither common law negligence action nor a public nuisance action exist against commercial vendor selling intoxicating liquor to an adult who because of his intoxication thereafter injures another. 213 C. 343. Cited. 214 C. 1; 223 C. 22. Section creates cause of action; does not require insurance coverage. Id., 31. Cited. 233 C. 174; 236 C. 670. Dram Shop Act does not occupy the field so as to preclude a common-law action in negligence against purveyor of alcoholic beverages for service of alcoholic liquor to an adult patron who, as a result of intoxication, injures another. 262 C. 312. Intoxication under section requires both an internal effect and an external manifestation; plaintiff not entitled to judgment in his favor without proving that patron was visibly or otherwise perceivably intoxicated when sold alcoholic liquor. 307 C. 231.\n\nCited. 6 CA 491; 11 CA 122; Id., 420; 15 CA 392; 16 CA 497; 22 CA 384; 26 CA 509; 31 CA 757; 34 CA 655. 60-day notice requirement is a condition precedent to maintaining an action that alleges only a violation of Dram Shop Act. 53 CA 282. Bar and restaurant owners may be liable for harm caused by employees consuming liquor on the job. 82 CA 186. To prove intoxication pursuant to section, plaintiff must present evidence showing visible or perceivable intoxication. 128 CA 794; judgment affirmed in part, see 307 C. 231. Award of interest pursuant to Sec. 52-192a for an unaccepted offer of compromise, in addition to judgment award of $250,000 as limited by this section, did not undermine the legislative purpose of limiting recoverable damages under Dram Shop Act. 136 CA 805.\n\nUnder former section, 1-year limitation period under statute enumerating classes of torts did not apply. 18 CS 224. Corporation is liable as seller; history of section reviewed. Id., 271. Statute is compensatory as well as criminal; public policy not against a liquor seller insuring against his liability. 19 CS 222. Permittee not liable under statute for injuries to the intoxicated person himself. Id., 311. Connecticut will enforce provisions of the New York Dram Shop Act where injury occurred in this state. 20 CS 165. Court could not enlarge upon the cause of action created by the legislature. Id., 183. By “just damages” is meant compensatory, rather than exemplary or punitive, damages. 22 CS 297. Notice provision is mandatory and not excused by death of person injured. 23 CS 104. Statute does not specify no action shall be maintained unless requirement of notice is met, only limitation being that action be brought within 1 year from date of act or omission complained of. Id., 146. Dram Shop Act does not give remedy to one who joins and participates in and contributes to its violation. Id., 193. The 60-day notice is a condition precedent to bringing of action. 25 CS 1. Notice which contained no information relative to the names of the persons to whom the sale was made, held invalid. 31 CS 405. Contributory negligence and assumption of risk not defenses to dram shop action; participation defense discussed. 35 CS 91. “Participation” and “assumption of risk” are not applicable defenses. 39 CS 20. Sufficiency of notice discussed. 40 CS 48. Cited. Id., 331.\n\nConstitutionality of act no longer an open question. 4 Conn. Cir. Ct. 89.",
