Section is a sentence enhancer rather than a separate offense; a separate conviction under section is improper. 242 C. 143. When jury convicts based on an underlying felony, jury must also determine issue of whether a firearm was used in commission of the felony. 253 C. 210. Unarmed accomplice is subject to an enhanced penalty under section. 255 C. 782. Where court failed to instruct jury as to elements of statute which provided for enhancement of sentence, enhanced sentence was vacated and case remanded for trial on that issue. 256 C. 785. Based on plain language of section, its legislative history, and prior court decisions interpreting its provisions, application of sentence enhancement to manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm, a class B felony, does not violate double jeopardy; based on section's language and its legislative history, trial court properly applied section's sentence enhancement to defendant's split sentence. 257 C. 544. State need not prove that firearm was capable of discharging a shot to apply statute as sentence enhancement. 259 C. 799. Section imposes separate enhancements of 5 years each where defendant is convicted of multiple qualifying felonies arising from the same incident. 263 C. 136. Possession of firearm by one coconspirator is not attributable to other coconspirators for purposes of enhancement statute. 276 C. 452. State is required to prove only that defendant was guilty of being an accessory to underlying robbery and that a firearm was used in the commission of the robbery, and need not prove that defendant intended that firearm would be used during the robbery. 315 C. 500.\n\nCited. 43 CA 801; 44 CA 561; 48 CA 361. Since section is sentence enhancement provision and not a separate crime, conviction under section must be vacated. 49 CA 420. Trial court improperly rendered judgment convicting defendant of the crime of commission of class A, B or C felony with a firearm because statute does not establish a separate criminal offense but is a sentence enhancement provision. 51 CA 171. Section intended to serve as sentence enhancement provision, not as a separate crime. Id., 541. Reaffirmed ruling that statute is sentence enhancement provision and not a separate crime. 52 CA 599. Reaffirmed prior holdings that statute is sentence enhancement provision and not a separate crime. 54 CA 18. Under section, state is not required to demonstrate that defendant actually had a gun, but that defendant represented, by words or conduct, that he was holding a gun. 60 CA 487. Failure to instruct jury re elements of statute was harmless error, since evidence against defendant was overwhelming and uncontested, and not violative of due process. 61 CA 417. Trial court determination that defendant fulfilled requirements of sentence enhancement pursuant to statute results in harmless error if jury would have, upon proper instruction, reached the same determination. 65 CA 551. Statute permits multiple enhancements. 69 CA 717. Failure of court to instruct jury that finding defendant used a firearm was harmless error where state has proven the elements necessary for sentence enhancement. 74 CA 129. Plaintiff's claim that trial court did not put issue of enhancement under statute to the jury was harmless error since verdict required finding that the murder was committed with a firearm. Id., 391. Court declines to create a presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness when the state seeks sentence enhancement pursuant to section after defendant elects a jury trial; sentence enhancement pursuant to section not treated as essential element of statute and state need only prove to jury the two elements of statute and is not required to prove that length of defendant's incarceration should be increased. 81 CA 824. Legislature's use of “shall” in section, coupled with precedent, amply supports conclusion that legislature intended sentence enhancement to apply to conviction under Sec. 53a-59(a)(5). 90 CA 445. Since section is a sentence enhancement provision and not a separate offense, conviction under section must be vacated. 94 CA 715. Trial court properly applied sentence enhancement provisions of section in a matter where defendant knowingly and voluntarily pled nolo contendere to section's provisions; in doing so, defendant waived his right to a jury determination of the facts with respect to that charge. 103 CA 100. Enhancement of defendant's sentence for conviction of conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree was improper because section does not apply to unarmed coconspirators; where defendant was convicted of risk of injury to a child only as a principal, and not as an accessory, and there was no evidence that defendant personally had used a firearm in the commission of the offense, sentence enhancement pursuant to section was not appropriate; section is not an offense. 160 CA 815. Enhancement of sentences for unarmed accomplices is permissible under section; finding beyond a reasonable doubt that a firearm had been used in the commission of each of the crimes of which defendant was found guilty as an accessory provided sufficient basis to impose sentence enhancement pursuant to section. Id., 851. Brandishing a gun as a show of force to indicate to victims that the gun could be fired satisfies the statutory definition of firearm for sentence enhancement pursuant to section so that jury instruction regarding operability of firearm is not required. 215 CA 167.",

Offense of carrying a dangerous weapon is not constitutionally overbroad in violation of the first and fourteenth amendments to the U.S. Constitution; the circumstances surrounding an alleged threat are critical in determining if the threat is a true threat; the trial court should have instructed jury to consider the particular factual context in which the allegedly threatening conduct occurred, including the victim's reaction to defendant's actions before and after the allegedly threatening conduct; defendant's threatened use of a table leg to inflict serious bodily injury against victim, in the event that victim continued to bother him, constitutes a violation of this section and Sec. 53a-3 if the threat is found to be a true threat not protected by the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 287 C. 237.\n\nCited. 1 CA 642; 7 CA 149; 9 CA 330; 10 CA 532; 11 CA 665; 17 CA 556; 21 CA 299; 25 CA 433; 27 CA 601; 39 CA 175; 41 CA 391; 43 CA 488.\n\nCompared with Sec. 29-38. 10 CS 272.

History discussed; concealment is not an element of the crime; .22 caliber air-operated single-shot pellet gun held to be a dangerous weapon. 24 CS 85.\n\nCited. 5 Conn. Cir. Ct. 313. Knife not coming within description of statute cannot be included as “any other dangerous or deadly weapon” and is not within prohibition of section. Id., 551.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\nExceptions in Subdiv. (3)(D) and (E) plainly and unambiguously apply only to the carrying of long knives, and said Subdiv. implicitly provides an exception for carrying a long knife in one's residence or abode; in this case, defendant carried a switchblade knife which was prohibited irrespective of location, and section recognizes no presumed lawful reason for carrying a switchblade knife. 300 C. 368.",

      "text": "(a) No person shall purchase or receive or sell, deliver or otherwise transfer an unfinished frame or lower receiver, except as provided in: (1) Subsections (b) and (c) of this section; or (2) subsection (d) of this section; or (3) subsection (e) of this section.\n\n(b) The procedures for the purchase or receipt or sale, delivery or other transfer of an unfinished frame or lower receiver shall be the same procedures as apply to the purchase or receipt or sale, delivery or other transfer of a pistol or revolver under subsections (b) to (e), inclusive, of section 29-33, provided such purchase or receipt or sale, delivery or other transfer of an unfinished frame or lower receiver is in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(c) (1) No person shall sell, deliver or otherwise transfer an unfinished frame or lower receiver pursuant to subsection (b) of this section that does not have a unique serial number or other mark of identification, obtained pursuant to: (A) The serial numbering program of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or (B) subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection.\n\n(2) A person may obtain a unique serial number or other mark of identification for an unfinished frame or lower receiver by providing to the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection any identifying information concerning the unfinished frame or lower receiver and the owner of such unfinished frame or lower receiver, in a manner prescribed by the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection. Upon receiving a properly submitted request for a unique serial number or other mark of identification for an unfinished frame or lower receiver, the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection shall determine if such person is prohibited from purchasing a firearm, and if not, shall issue to such person a unique serial number or other mark of identification immediately and in no instance more than (A) three business days after the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection receives such request, or (B) ten business days after the system to distribute a unique serial number or other mark of identification pursuant to section 29-36b is operational, whichever date is later.\n\n(3) Such unique serial number or other mark of identification shall be engraved upon or permanently affixed to the unfinished frame or lower receiver in a manner that conforms with the requirements imposed on licensed importers and licensed manufacturers of firearms pursuant to 18 USC 923(i), as amended from time to time, and any regulation adopted thereunder.\n\n(d) The provisions of subsections (a) to (c), inclusive, of this section shall not apply to the sale, delivery or transfer of any unfinished frame or lower receiver between (1) a federally licensed firearm manufacturer and a federally licensed firearm dealer, (2) a federally licensed firearm importer and a federally licensed firearm dealer, or (3) federally licensed firearm dealers.\n\n(e) Any person may arrange in advance to deliver and transfer an unfinished frame or lower receiver to a police department or the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection.\n\n(f) On and after October 1, 2019, no person shall possess an unfinished frame or lower receiver unless such person is eligible to purchase a firearm under state and federal law.\n\n(g) If the court finds that a violation of this section is not of a serious nature and that the person charged with such violation (1) will probably not offend in the future, (2) has not previously been convicted of a violation of this section, and (3) has not previously had a prosecution under this section suspended pursuant to this subsection, the court may order suspension of prosecution. The court shall not order suspension of prosecution unless the accused person has acknowledged that he or she understands the consequences of the suspension of prosecution. Any person for whom prosecution is suspended shall agree to the tolling of any statute of limitations with respect to such violation and to a waiver of his or her right to a speedy trial. Such person shall appear in court and shall be released to the supervision of the Court Support Services Division for such period, not exceeding two years, and under such conditions as the court shall order. If the person refuses to accept, or, having accepted, violates such conditions, the court shall terminate the suspension of prosecution and the case shall be brought to trial. If such person satisfactorily completes such person's period of probation, he or she may apply for dismissal of the charges against such person and the court, on finding such satisfactory completion, shall dismiss such charges. If the person does not apply for dismissal of the charges against such person after satisfactorily completing such person's period of probation, the court, upon receipt of a report submitted by the Court Support Services Division that the person satisfactorily completed such person's period of probation, may on its own motion make a finding of such satisfactory completion and dismiss such charges. Upon dismissal, all records of such charges shall be erased pursuant to section 54-142a. An order of the court denying a motion to dismiss the charges against a person who has completed such person's period of probation or terminating the participation of a defendant in such program shall be a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\n\n(h) Any person who violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of a class C felony for which two years of the sentence imposed may not be suspended or reduced by the court, and five thousand dollars of the fine imposed may not be remitted or reduced by the court unless the court states on the record its reasons for remitting or reducing such fine, except that any person who sells, delivers or otherwise transfers an unfinished frame or lower receiver in violation of the provisions of this section knowing that such unfinished frame or lower receiver is stolen or that the manufacturer's number or other mark of identification on such unfinished frame or lower receiver has been altered, removed or obliterated, shall be guilty of a class B felony for which three years of the sentence imposed may not be suspended or reduced by the court, and ten thousand dollars of the fine imposed may not be remitted or reduced by the court unless the court states on the record its reasons for remitting or reducing such fine, and any unfinished frame or lower receiver found in the possession of any person in violation of any provision of this section shall be forfeited.\n\n(i) For purposes of this section, “unfinished frame or lower receiver” means a blank, casting or machined body intended to be turned into the frame or lower receiver of a firearm, as defined in section 53a-3, with additional machining, and which has been formed or machined to the point where most major machining operations have been completed to turn the blank, casting or machined body into a frame or lower receiver of a firearm, even if the fire-control cavity area of such blank, casting or machined body is still completely solid and unmachined. An “unfinished frame or lower receiver” is not a firearm, as defined in 18 USC 921(a), as amended from time to time.\n\n(P.A. 19-6, S. 5; P.A. 22-26, S. 25.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 19-6 effective June 3, 2019; P.A. 22-26 amended Subsec. (g) to replace “custody” with “supervision”.",
