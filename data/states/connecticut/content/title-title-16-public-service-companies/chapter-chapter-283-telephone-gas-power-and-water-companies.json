Until such time as the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection issues standards for identifying such compatible trees and shrubs, the standards and identification of such compatible trees and shrubs shall be as set forth in the 2012 final report of the State Vegetation Management Task Force;\n\n(5) “Pruning” means the selective removal of plant parts to meet specific utility infrastructure reliability goals and objectives, when performed according to current professional tree care standards and in a manner that retains the structural integrity and health of the vegetation;\n\n(6) “Abutting property owner” means the owner of the property abutting or adjacent to that portion of a public road, public highway or public grounds where the tree or shrub that the utility proposes to remove or prune is located; and\n\n(7) “Private property owner” means the owner of the property where a tree or shrub the utility proposes to remove or prune is located, which may include municipally owned land.\n\n(b) A utility may perform vegetation management within the utility protection zone, as necessary, to secure the reliability of utility services.\n\n(c) (1) In conducting vegetation management, no utility shall prune or remove any tree or shrub within the utility protection zone, or on or overhanging any public road, public highway or public ground, without delivering notice of the proposed vegetation management to the abutting property owner or private property owner. Such notice shall include the option for the abutting property owner or private property owner to consent, in writing, to such proposed pruning or removal, object to such proposed pruning or removal or modify such proposed pruning or removal. The notice shall include instructions regarding how the recipient may object in accordance with subdivision (3) of this subsection. Such notice shall also include a statement that if a person objects to the proposed pruning or removal, and such tree falls on any utility infrastructure, such person shall not be billed by the utility for any resulting damage. If requested by an owner of private property, the utility, municipality or the Commissioner of Transportation, as appropriate, shall provide such owner with information regarding whether a tree or shrub to be pruned or removed is in the public right-of-way or whether such tree or shrub is on such owner's private property.\n\n(2) Notice shall be considered delivered when it is (A) mailed to the abutting property owner or private property owner via first class mail, electronic mail or text message, (B) delivered, in writing, at the location of the abutting property or private property owner, or (C) simultaneously conveyed verbally and provided in writing to the abutting property owner or private property owner. A utility shall deliver such notice to the abutting property owner or private property owner at least fifteen business days before the starting date of any such pruning or removal.

This decision shall not be issued before a consultation with the abutting property owner if such a consultation has been requested. The abutting property owner or the utility may appeal the tree warden's decision to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority within ten business days after the tree warden's decision.\n\n(A) Prior to the final decision in the docket described in subsection (c) of section 16-32h, the authority shall hold a hearing within sixty calendar days of receipt of the abutting property owner's or utility's written appeal of the tree warden's decision and shall provide notice of such hearing to the abutting property owner, the tree warden or the Commissioner of Transportation, as appropriate, and the utility. The authority may authorize the pruning or removal of any tree or shrub whose pruning or removal has been at issue in the hearing if it finds that public convenience and necessity requires such action. The burden of proving that public convenience and necessity requires such action shall be on the utility.\n\n(B) On and after the effective date of the final decision issued in the docket described in subsection (c) of section 16-32h, the entity designated by the authority, as determined by such docket, shall hold a mediation session not later than thirty calendar days after receipt of the abutting property owner's or utility's appeal of the tree warden's or the Commissioner of Transportation's decision and shall provide notice of such mediation session to the abutting property owner, the tree warden or the Commissioner of Transportation, as appropriate, and the utility, provided the abutting property owner may opt not to utilize such mediation session and proceed to the hearing described in this subparagraph. In the event that the appeal is not settled by mediation, or the abutting owner elects not to use such mediation session, the authority shall hold a hearing not later than thirty calendar days after the conclusion of the mediation session, or within sixty calendar days of the receipt of the abutting property owner's written appeal if there is no mediation session, and shall provide notice of such hearing to the abutting property owner, the tree warden, or the Commissioner of Transportation, as appropriate, and the utility.

If the hazardous tree is outside of the public right-of-way, the utility shall make a reasonable effort to notify the property owner of the proposed pruning or removal at least three days prior to performing such pruning or removal. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a utility to prune or remove a tree.\n\n(e) No utility shall be required to obtain a permit pursuant to subsection (f) of section 23-65 or provide notice under subsection (c) of this section to prune or remove a tree, as necessary, if any part of a tree is in direct contact with an energized electrical conductor or has visible signs of burning. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a utility to prune or remove a tree.\n\n(f) No utility shall exercise any powers which may have been conferred upon it to change the location of, or to erect or place, wires, conductors, fixtures, structures or apparatus of any kind over, on or under any public road, public highway or public ground, without the consent of the adjoining proprietors or, if such company is unable to obtain such consent, without the approval of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, which shall be given only after a hearing upon notice to such proprietors. The authority may, if it finds that public convenience and necessity require, authorize the changing of the location of, or the erection or placing of, such wires, conductors, fixtures, structures or apparatus over, on or under such public road or highway or public ground.\n\n(g) Each utility shall operate an electronic mail account to receive objections, requests for modification, inquiries or complaints pursuant to subsections (a) to (f), inclusive, of this section.\n\n(h) When conducting vegetation management within a utility protection zone pursuant to this section, the utility shall provide for the removal or disposition of any debris generated as a result of such pruning or removal.

In making a decision on an application filed under subdivision (4) of this subsection, the authority shall consider whether such transmission would (A) adversely impact the customers of the company, cooperative or utility which would transmit energy or capacity to the private power producer, (B) result in an uncompensated loss for, or unduly burden, such company, cooperative, utility or private power producer, (C) impair the reliability of service of such company, cooperative or utility, or (D) impair the ability of the company, cooperative or utility to provide adequate service to its customers. The authority shall issue a decision on such an application not later than one hundred twenty days after the application is filed, provided, the authority may, before the end of such period and upon notifying all parties and intervenors to the proceeding, extend the period by thirty days. If the authority does not issue a decision within one hundred twenty days after receiving such an application, or within one hundred fifty days if the authority extends the period in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, the application shall be deemed to have been approved. The requirements under subdivisions (3), (4) and (5) of this subsection shall be subject to reasonable standards for operating safety and reliability and the nondiscriminatory assessment of costs against private power producers, approved by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority with respect to electric public service companies or determined by municipal electric energy cooperatives and municipal electric utilities.\n\n(c) The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, with respect to electric public service companies, and each municipal electric energy cooperative and municipal electric utility shall establish rates and conditions of service for: (1) The purchase of electrical energy and capacity made available by a private power producer; and (2) the sale of backup electricity to a private power producer. The rates for electricity purchased from a private power producer shall be based on the full avoided costs of the electric public service company, municipal electric energy cooperative or municipal electric utility, regardless of whether the purchaser is simultaneously making sales to the private power producer. Payment for energy and capacity purchased from a private power producer by any such company, cooperative or utility shall be pursuant to such rates and conditions or the terms of a contract between the parties. The rates and conditions of service for the purchase of energy and capacity established by the authority pursuant to this subsection shall include specific schedules for pricing in long-term contracts for the sale of electricity from small renewable power projects to electric public service companies by private power producers. Such schedules shall not exceed the present worth of the projected avoided costs of the electric public service company over the term of the contract. The authority shall apply to a proposed contract filed with the authority after January 1, 1992, by a private power producer for a small renewable power project the rates and conditions of service, including the pricing schedule, in effect on the date the private power producer submits its proposed contract to the authority, regardless of the subsequent creation of differing schedules or the subsequent amendment of existing schedules.\n\n(d) When any person, firm or corporation proposes to enter into a contract to sell energy and capacity as a private power producer, an electric public service company, municipal electric energy cooperative or municipal electric utility shall respond promptly to all requests and offers and negotiate in good faith to arrive at a contract which fairly reflects the provisions of this section and the anticipated avoided costs over the life of the contract. Upon application by a private power producer, the authority may approve a contract which provides for payment of less than the anticipated avoided costs if, considering all of the provisions, the contract is at least as favorable to the private power producer as a contract providing for the full avoided costs. The contract may extend for a period of not more than thirty years at the option of the private power producer if it has a generating facility with a capacity of at least one hundred kilowatts.\n\n(e) The authority shall consider generating capacity available from cogeneration technology and renewable energy resources in its periodic reviews of electric public service companies and shall require the companies to include the availability of such capacity in applications for rate relief filed in accordance with section 16-19a.\n\n(f) If a private power producer believes that an electric distribution company has violated any provision of this section it may submit a written petition alleging such violation to the authority. Upon receipt of the petition, the authority shall fix a time and place for a hearing and mail notice of the hearing to the parties in interest at least one week in advance. Upon the hearing, the authority may, if it finds the company has violated any such provision, prescribe the manner in which it shall comply.\n\n(g) After January 1, 1992, the authority shall approve each proposed contract submitted by a private power producer for a small renewable power project, with any modifications agreed to by the parties to the contract, if the filing meets the standards for exemption from the proposal process and for an approvable contract established pursuant to section 16-6b, and is consistent with the pricing schedules adopted pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. Nothing in this section shall preclude a modification of such a contract if the parties to the contract agree to the modification. Any such modification shall be approved by the authority. The authority shall reconsider each decision issued pursuant to this section between January 1, 1992, and June 29, 1993, regarding such contracts and shall make any modifications to each such decision necessary to ensure that each such decision conforms with the provisions of this section.\n\n(h) Not later than January 1, 2008, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall issue a final decision approving interconnection standards that meet or exceed national standards of interconnectivity. If the authority does not issue a final decision by October 1, 2008, each electric distribution company, municipal electric energy cooperative and municipal electric utility shall meet the standards set forth in Title 4, Chapter 4, Subchapter 9, “Net Metering and Interconnection Standards for Class I Renewable Energy Systems” of the New Jersey Administrative Code.\n\n(P.A. 79-214, S. 2; P.A. 80-167, S. 2; 80-482, S. 4, 40, 345, 348; P.A. 81-439, S. 6, 14; P.A. 82-164; P.A. 85-534, S. 4, 5; P.A. 86-289, S. 2, 5; 86-403, S. 111, 132; P.A. 89-43, S. 1, 2; P.A. 93-299, S. 1, 3; P.A. 07-242, S. 37, 38; P.A. 11-80, S. 1; P.A. 14-134, S. 74.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 80-167 included municipal electric energy cooperatives under provisions of section; P.A. 80-482 made division of public utility control an independent department and abolished department of business regulation; P.A. 81-439 repealed Subsecs.

Affiliates of the electric distribution company may submit proposals consistent with section 16-244h, regulations adopted under section 16-244h and other requirements the authority may impose. The authority may request from a person submitting a proposal further information that the authority determines to be in the public interest to be used in evaluating the proposal. The authority shall determine whether costs associated with subsection (k) of this section shall be considered in the evaluation or selection of bids.\n\n(d) The authority shall publish such request for proposals in one or more newspapers or periodicals, as selected by the authority, and shall post such request for proposals on its web site. The authority may retain the services of a third-party entity with expertise in the area of energy procurement to oversee the development of the request for proposals and to assist the authority in its approval of proposals pursuant to this section. The reasonable and proper expenses for retaining such third-party entity shall be recoverable through federally mandated congestion charges, as defined in section 16-1, which charges the authority shall allocate to electric distribution companies in proportion to their revenue.\n\n(e) Any person, other than an electric distribution company, submitting a proposal pursuant to subdivision (2), (3) or (4) of subsection (c) of this section shall include with its proposal a draft of a contract that includes the transfer to the electric distribution company of all the rights to the installed capacity, including, but not limited to, forward reserve capacity, locational forward reserve capacity and similar rights associated with such proposal, provided such rights shall not include energy. No such draft of a contract shall have a term exceeding fifteen years. Such draft contract shall include such provisions as the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority directs.\n\n(f) Each person submitting a proposal pursuant to this section shall agree to forgo or credit reliability must run payments, locational installed capacity payments or payments for similar purposes for any project approved pursuant to subsection (g) of this section.\n\n(g) The authority shall, on or before May 1, 2006, evaluate such proposals received pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and may approve one or more of such proposals.

Projects proposed by persons other than electric distribution companies approved pursuant to this subsection may enter into long-term contracts pursuant to subsection (i) of this section. Projects approved pursuant to this subsection are eligible for expedited siting pursuant to subsection (a) of section 16-50k. Customer-side distributed resource projects approved pursuant to this subsection shall be eligible for the incentives provided pursuant to sections 16-243j, 16-243l,and 16-243o and this section, but shall not be eligible for the programs described in section 16-243i.\n\n(h) If a proposal from an electric distribution company is approved pursuant to subsection (g) of this section, such company may develop, own and operate such resource, provided such company shall, not later than five years after such resource begins commercial operation, (1) sell such resource in accordance with section 16-43, or (2) auction the power or capacity, or both, associated with such resource pursuant to a plan approved by the authority. The authority shall, after notice and hearing, waive the requirements of subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection if it determines that compliance with such requirements would be detrimental to retail customers. Such electric distribution company shall recover, as federally mandated congestion charges, the unrecovered portions of the full projected costs in its proposal made under subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(i) An electric distribution company shall negotiate in good faith the final terms of the draft contract, submitted under subsection (e) of this section and included in a proposal approved under subsection (g) of this section, and shall apply to the authority for approval of each such contract. After thirty days, either party may request the assistance of the authority to resolve any outstanding issues. No such contract may become effective without approval of the authority. The authority shall hold a hearing that shall be conducted as a contested case, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to approve, reject or modify an application for approval of a capacity purchase contract. No contract shall be approved unless the authority finds that approval of such contract would (1) result in the lowest reasonable cost of such products and services, (2) increase reliability, and (3) minimize federally mandated congestion charges to the state over the life of the contract. Such a contract shall contain terms that mitigate the long-term risk assumed by ratepayers. No contract approved by the authority shall have a term exceeding fifteen years. As determined by the authority, the electric distribution company shall either sell into the capacity markets all or a portion of capacity rights transferred pursuant to this section and use all proceeds from such sales to offset federally mandated congestion charges incurred by all customers, or shall retain such capacity rights to offset electric capacity charges associated with transitional standard offer, standard service or service as supplier of last resort under section 16-244c. The costs associated with long-term electric capacity contracts shall be recovered through federally mandated congestion charges.\n\n(j) The authority may order an electric distribution company to submit a proposal pursuant to the provisions of this section and may approve such a proposal under this section. Nothing in sections 16-1, 16-32f, 16-50i, 16-50k, 16-50x, 16-243i to 16-243q, inclusive, 16-244c, 16-245d, 16-245m, 16-245n and 16-245z and section 21 of public act 05-1 of the June special session* shall limit the authority's ability to conduct requests for proposals, in addition to that in subsection (c) of this section, to reduce federally mandated congestion charges and to approve such proposals or otherwise to meet its responsibility under this title.\n\n(k) The authority shall hold a hearing that shall be conducted as a contested case, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to investigate any impact on the financial condition of electric distribution companies of long-term contracts entered into pursuant to this section and to establish, before issuing a request for proposals in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, the methodology for compensating the companies for such impacts. The methodology for addressing such impacts shall be included in the request for proposals under subsection (c) of this section, if appropriate. If the authority determines that entering into such long-term contracts results in increased costs incurred by the electric distribution companies, the authority, annually, shall allow such costs to be recovered through rates or in such manner as the authority considers appropriate. The authority shall determine whether such costs shall be considered in the evaluation or selection of bids under this section.\n\n(l) An electric distribution company may not submit a proposal under this section on or after February 1, 2011. On or before January 1, 2010, the authority shall submit a report, in accordance with section 11-4a, to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to energy with a recommendation as to whether the period during which such company may submit proposals under this section should be extended.\n\n(m) For purposes of subdivision (1) of subsection (c) of section 16-50p, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that there is a public benefit in building a facility, as defined in subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i, that has been approved by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority pursuant to this section.\n\n(n) The aggregate electric generating capacity for all approved proposals by electric distribution companies pursuant to subsections (g) and (j) of this section may not exceed two hundred fifty megawatts of generating capacity state-wide. The authority shall give guiding preference in approving the amount of generation capacity in proposals from electric distribution companies to the approximate proportion of each company's service area load.\n\n(o) When the authority selects a bid pursuant to subdivisions (2) and (3) of subsection (c) of this section from a person other than an electric distribution company, the authority shall grant the electric distribution company that serves the area in which the subject grid-side distributed resource or new generation facility is to be located a one-time, nonrecurring award, for investments necessary to improve the electric distribution company's transmission and distribution system to accommodate such facilities, in accordance with the following: For a grid-side distributed resource or new generation facility that is operational (1) on or before January 1, 2010, twenty-five dollars per kilowatt, (2) on or before January 1, 2011, fifteen dollars per kilowatt, and (3) on or before January 1, 2012, five dollars per kilowatt. The cost of the award shall be recoverable from federally mandated congestion charges. No such award may be made unless the projected reduction in federally mandated congestion charges attributed to the investment is greater than the amount of the award. Revenues from such award shall not be included in calculating the electric distribution company's earnings for the purpose of determining whether its rates are just and reasonable under sections 16-19, 16-19a and 16-19e.\n\n(p) Sixty days after the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority issues a final decision approving long-term contracts pursuant to this section, the authority shall direct an electric distribution company to negotiate, in good faith, long-term contracts for the electric energy output of each of the generation projects selected and approved by the authority to provide capacity pursuant to this section, provided the rates paid for such electric energy output when added to the payments made pursuant to such capacity contracts shall be the project's cost of service plus a reasonable rate of return. The electric distribution company shall apply to the authority for approval of any such energy output contract. No such contract shall be effective unless approved by the authority. The authority may approve only such contracts it finds would reduce and stabilize the cost of electricity to Connecticut ratepayers. Such contract may not exceed the term of the capacity contract for such generation project.\n\n(June Sp. Sess.

The authority shall only approve such proposed plan if the authority finds that (1) the solicitation and evaluation conducted by the electric distribution company was the result of a fair, open, competitive and transparent process; (2) approval of the procurement plan would result in the greatest expected ratepayer value from energy from Class I or renewable energy credits at the lowest reasonable cost; and (3) such procurement plan satisfies other criteria established in the approved solicitation plan. The authority shall not approve any proposal made under such plan unless it determines that the plan and proposals encompass all foreseeable sources of revenue or benefits and that such proposals, together with such revenue or benefits, would result in the greatest expected ratepayer value from energy technologies that emit no pollutants or renewable energy credits. The authority may, in its discretion, retain the services of an independent consultant with expertise in the area of energy procurement to assist in such determination. The independent consultant shall be unaffiliated with the electric distribution company or its affiliates and shall not, directly or indirectly, have benefited from employment or contracts with the electric distribution company or its affiliates in the preceding five years, except as an independent consultant. The electric distribution company shall provide the independent consultant immediate and continuing access to all documents and data reviewed, used or produced by the electric distribution company in its bid solicitation and evaluation process. The electric distribution company shall make all its personnel, agents and contractors used in the bid solicitation and evaluation available for interview by the consultant. The electric distribution company shall conduct any additional modeling requested by the independent consultant to test the assumptions and results of the bid evaluation process. The independent consultant shall not participate in or advise the electric distribution company with respect to any decisions in the bid solicitation or bid evaluation process. The authority's administrative costs in reviewing the electric distribution company's procurement plan and the costs of the consultant shall be recovered through a reconciling component of electric rates as determined by the authority.\n\n(e) The electric distribution company shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and fees prudently incurred of complying with its approved procurement plan through a reconciling component of electric rates as determined by the authority. Nothing in this section shall preclude the resale or other disposition of energy or associated renewable energy credits purchased by the electric distribution company, provided the distribution company shall net the cost of payments made to projects under the long-term contracts against the proceeds of the sale of energy or renewable energy credits and the difference shall be credited or charged to distribution customers through a reconciling component of electric rates as determined by the authority that is nonbypassable when switching electric suppliers.\n\n(f) Failure by the electric distribution company to execute its approved solicitation plan shall result in a noncompliance fee. Unless, upon petition by the electric distribution company, the authority grants the distribution company an extension not to exceed ninety days to correct this deficiency, the electric distribution company shall be assessed a noncompliance fee one hundred twenty-five per cent of the difference between the annual distribution company expenditures required pursuant to subsection (c) of section 16-244r and the contractually committed expenditure for renewable energy credits from eligible zero emissions customer-sited generating projects in that year. The noncompliance fees associated with the procurement shortfall shall be collected by the distribution company, maintained in a separate interest-bearing account and disbursed to the department on a quarterly basis. Funds collected by the authority pursuant to this section shall be used to support the deployment of Class I zero emissions generating systems installed in the state with priority given to otherwise underserved market segments, including, but not limited to, low-income housing, schools and other public buildings and nonprofits. The authority may waive a noncompliance fee assessed pursuant to this section if the authority determines that meeting the requirements of this subsection would be commercially infeasible.\n\n(g) Not later than sixty days after its approval of the distribution company procurement plans submitted on or before January 1, 2013, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall submit a report to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to energy. The report shall document for each distribution company procurement plan: (1) The total number of renewable energy credits bid relative to the number of renewable energy credits requested by the distribution company; (2) the total number of bidders in each market segment; (3) the number and value of contracts awarded; (4) the total weighted average price of the renewable energy credits or energy so purchased; and (5) the extent to which the costs of the technology has been reduced. The authority shall not report individual bid information or other proprietary information.\n\n(P.A. 11-80, S. 108.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 11-80 effective July 1, 2011.",

No electric distribution company shall be eligible to claim stranded costs unless a public auction has been held to divest itself of all nonnuclear generation assets or the electric distribution company has sold its nonnuclear generation assets in accordance with section 16-43.\n\n(c) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (1) of subsection (e) of section 16-244g, any electric distribution company seeking to claim stranded costs shall, in accordance with this subsection, mitigate such costs to the fullest extent possible. Prior to the approval by the authority of any stranded costs, the electric distribution company shall show to the satisfaction of the authority that the electric distribution company has taken all reasonable steps to mitigate to the maximum extent possible the total amount of stranded costs that it seeks to claim and to minimize the cost to be recovered from customers. Mitigation shall include: (A) Except to the extent provided in collective bargaining agreements or agreements to purchase generation assets entered into prior to July 1, 1998, the obtaining of written commitments from purchasers of generation facilities divested pursuant to section 16-244g, that the purchasers will offer employment to persons who were employed in nonmanagerial positions by a divested generation facility at any time during the three-month period prior to the divestiture, at levels of wages and overall compensation not lower than the employees' lowest level during the six-month period prior to the date the contract to divest the asset was entered into; (B) good faith efforts to negotiate the buyout, buydown or renegotiation of independent power producer contracts and purchased power contracts approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, provided the fixed present value of any contract to which a political subdivision of the state is a party shall be calculated using the political subdivision's tax-exempt borrowing rate as the discount rate; and (C) the reasonable costs of the consultants appointed to conduct the auctions of generation assets pursuant to section 16-244g.

Mitigation shall not include any expenditures to restart a nuclear generation asset that was not operating for reasons other than scheduled maintenance or refueling at the time such expenditure was made. Any mitigation efforts and associated costs shall be subject to approval by the authority.\n\n(2) The authority shall allow the cost of such mitigation efforts to be included in the calculation of stranded costs to the extent that such mitigation costs are reasonable relative to the amount of the reduction in stranded costs resulting from the mitigation.\n\n(d) An electric distribution company shall submit to the authority an application for recovery of that portion of generation-related regulatory assets, long-term contract costs, generation assets and mitigation costs which are determined by the authority in accordance with subsections (c), (e), (f) and (g) of this section and subdivision (1) of subsection (e) of section 16-244g. The application shall include a description of mitigation efforts and a request for recovery through the competitive transition assessment and may include a request for a financing order. The authority shall hold a hearing for each electric distribution company and issue a finding of the calculation of stranded costs in a time frame that allows for collection of the competitive transition assessment to begin on January 1, 2000. Any hearing shall be conducted as a contested case in accordance with chapter 54.\n\n(e) The authority shall calculate the stranded costs for generation-related regulatory assets to be their book value as of January 1, 2000. In calculating the value of generation-related regulatory assets that are being provided in a lump sum as the result of a funding with the proceeds of rate reduction bonds, the authority shall adjust the value of each such asset to reflect the time value of such lump sum, if any.\n\n(f) (1) The authority shall calculate the stranded costs for long-term contract costs that have been reduced to a fixed present value through the buyout, buydown, or renegotiation of independent power producer contracts and purchased power contracts approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as such present value. In making such calculation, the authority shall net purchased power contracts approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that are below market value against any such contracts that are above-market value.\n\n(2) The authority shall calculate the stranded costs for any portion of a long-term contract cost that has not been reduced to a fixed present value by comparing the contract price to the market price at least annually. In making such calculation, the authority shall net purchased power contracts approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that are below market value against any such contracts that are above-market value. The costs described in this subdivision shall be included in the competitive transition assessment pursuant to section 16-245g but shall not be included in any funding with the proceeds of rate reduction bonds.\n\n(g) The authority shall calculate the stranded cost for each generation asset to be the difference between its book value and the market value of a prudently and efficiently managed nonnuclear generating facility of comparable size, age and technical characteristics in a competitive market. In determining the market value of any such asset, the authority may consider (A) the dollars per kilowatt received from the sale of similar generation facilities, if any, (B) income capitalization based on the operating history and capacity of the facility, the market rates for power, and any existing long-term contracts for the sale of power or capacity, (C) independent market appraisals, or (D) other relevant factors. The authority shall calculate the stranded costs for generation assets at least every three years. The costs described in this subsection shall be included in the competitive transition assessment pursuant to section 16-245g but shall not be included in any funding with the proceeds of rate reduction bonds.\n\n(h) (1) On or before January 1, 2004, an electric distribution company may submit to the authority an application for recovery of that portion of nuclear generation assets which is determined by the authority in accordance with this subsection, which application shall include a request for recovery through the competitive transition assessment. The authority shall hold a hearing for each electric distribution company and issue a finding of the calculation of such nuclear generation assets in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. Any hearing shall be conducted as a contested case proceeding in accordance with chapter 54. The costs described in this subsection shall be included in the competitive transition assessment pursuant to section 16-245g but shall not be included in any funding with proceeds of rate reduction bonds.\n\n(2) The authority shall calculate the stranded costs for each nuclear generation asset that was divested at a price less than book value as described in subdivision (5) of subsection (c) of section 16-244g as the difference between the book value of this asset and the final bid price of the asset. The authority's calculation of stranded costs pursuant to this subdivision shall be final and shall not be subject to further adjustment by the authority.\n\n(3) The authority shall calculate the stranded costs for each nondivested nuclear generation asset described in subdivision (1) of subsection (d) of section 16-244g to be the difference between its book value and the market value of a prudently and efficiently managed nuclear generating facility of comparable size, age and technical characteristics in a competitive market. In determining the market value of any such asset, the authority may consider (A) the dollars per kilowatt received from the sale of similar generation facilities, if any, (B) income capitalization based on the operating history and capacity of the facility, the market rates for power, and any existing long-term contracts for the sale of power or capacity, (C) the provision for decommissioning and related costs to be paid from the systems benefits charge provided in section 16-245l, (D) independent market appraisals, or (E) other relevant factors. At least every four years after the date when the authority issues an initial finding of the calculation of the stranded costs for such nondivested nuclear generation assets as provided in this subdivision until the earlier of (i) the expiration of the collection of the competitive transition assessment, or (ii) the date when such an asset is divested, the authority shall hold a hearing and issue a finding to adjust the stranded cost calculation of each such asset and to adjust the competitive transition assessment accordingly to true up the stranded cost recovery for the difference between the market value projected in such initial finding and the actual market value of a prudently and efficiently managed nuclear generating facility of comparable size, age and technical characteristics during the time period between the initial finding and the adjustment date, provided the second and subsequent adjustments shall reflect the difference during the time period since the most recent true-up. The authority shall calculate the value of each such asset in accordance with the methodology provided in this subdivision. Any hearing shall be conducted as a contested case in accordance with chapter 54.\n\n(4) After the authority has calculated the total value of stranded costs for all nuclear generation assets, the authority shall (A) reduce such amount by the net proceeds that are above book value realized by an electric distribution company from the sale of nonnuclear generation assets, (B) reduce such valuation to reflect the total net proceeds that are above book value realized by an electric distribution company from the sale of any nuclear generation assets pursuant to subsection (c) of section 16-244g, and (C) reduce such amount by the net proceeds that are above book value received by an electric distribution company for the sale or lease of any real property after July 1, 1998.\n\n(i) If any net proceeds described in subdivision (4) of subsection (h) of this section remain after the reduction in the calculation of nuclear generation assets pursuant to said subdivision (4) or are realized after said reduction is calculated, the additional amount of such net proceeds shall be netted against long-term contract costs described in subdivision (2) of subsection (f) of this section, and the competitive transition assessment shall be adjusted accordingly.\n\n(j) No electric distribution company shall be eligible to claim any stranded costs for a nuclear generation asset or for any generation-related regulatory asset related to such generation asset, if the generation asset is not operating as a result of an order issued by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission that applies specifically to such asset. Any such asset that is not eligible to be claimed as a stranded cost shall be eligible after it is permitted to and has resumed operation and is selling power.\n\n(k) If an electric distribution company elected to transfer any of its nuclear generation assets and related operations and functions to a separate corporate affiliate or to a division that is functionally separate from the electric distribution company pursuant to section 16-244g and subsequently sold any such assets in an arm's length transaction to an unrelated entity prior to January 1, 2012, the net proceeds realized from such sale that exceed book value for such assets shall be netted against the total amount of stranded costs, and the competitive transition assessment shall be adjusted accordingly and, if appropriate, other reimbursement shall be ordered by the authority.\n\n(P.A. 98-28, S. 8, 117; June 30 Sp.

The electric distribution company shall have no right, title or interest in transition property in respect to the economic recovery transfer or in respect of disbursements to the General Fund to sustain funding of conservation and load management and renewable energy investment programs, and in respect of such transition property shall be only a collection agent on behalf of the financing entity.\n\n(b) Any surplus competitive transition assessment described in subparagraph (A) of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 16-245e in excess of the amounts necessary to pay principal, premium, if any, interest and expenses of the issuance of the rate reduction bonds shall be remitted to the financing entity and may be used to benefit customers if this would not result in a recharacterization of the tax, accounting, and other intended characteristics of the financing, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n(1) Avoiding the recognition of debt on the electric distribution company's balance sheet for financial accounting and regulatory purposes;\n\n(2) Treating the rate reduction bonds as debt of the electric distribution company or its affiliates for federal income tax purposes;\n\n(3) Treating the transfer of the transition property by the electric distribution company as a true sale for bankruptcy purposes; or\n\n(4) Avoiding any adverse impact of the financing on the credit rating of the rate reduction bonds or the electric distribution company.\n\n(c) Electric distribution companies may sell and assign all or portions of their interest in transition property to an affiliate. Electric distribution companies or their affiliates may sell or assign their interests to one or more financing entities that make that property the basis for issuance of rate reduction bonds to the extent approved in the pertinent financing orders. Electric distribution companies, their affiliates, or financing entities may pledge transition property as collateral, directly or indirectly, for rate reduction bonds to the extent approved in the pertinent financing orders providing for a security interest in the transition property, in the manner as set forth in section 16-245k. In addition, transition property may be sold or assigned by (1) the financing entity or a trustee for the holders of rate reduction bonds in connection with the exercise of remedies upon a default, or (2) any person acquiring the transition property after a sale or assignment pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(d) To the extent that any interest in transition property is so sold or assigned, or is so pledged as collateral, the authority shall authorize the electric distribution company to contract with the financing entity that it will continue to operate its system to provide service to its customers, will collect amounts in respect of the competitive transition assessment for the benefit and account of the financing entity, and will account for and remit these amounts to or for the account of the financing entity. Contracting with the financing entity in accordance with that authorization shall not impair or negate the characterization of the sale, assignment, or pledge as an absolute transfer, a true sale, or security interest, as applicable.\n\n(P.A. 98-28, S. 11, 117; Sept. 8 Sp.

In such case, the financing statement shall be filed as if the debtor were located in this state. Any description of the transition property shall be sufficient if it refers to the financing order creating the transition property. A copy of the financing statement shall be filed with the authority by the electric distribution company or the financing entity that is the pledgor or transferor of the transition property, and the authority may require the electric distribution company or the financing entity to make other filings with respect to the security interest in accordance with procedures it may establish, provided that the filings shall not affect the perfection of the security interest.\n\n(c) A perfected security interest in transition property is a continuously perfected security interest in all revenues and proceeds arising with respect thereto, whether or not the revenues or proceeds have accrued. Conflicting security interests shall rank according to priority in time of perfection. Transition property shall constitute property for all purposes, including for contracts securing rate reduction bonds, whether or not the revenues and proceeds arising with respect thereto have accrued.\n\n(d) Subject to the terms of the security agreement covering the transition property and the rights of any third parties holding security interests in the transition property perfected in the manner described in this section, the validity and relative priority of a security interest created under this section are not defeated or adversely affected by the commingling of revenues arising with respect to the transition property with other funds of the electric distribution company that is the pledgor or transferor of, or the collection agent with respect to, the transition property, or by any security interest in a deposit account of that electric distribution company into which the revenues are deposited or in such revenues themselves perfected under article 9 of title 42a or otherwise. Subject to the terms of the security agreement, the pledgees of the transition property shall have a perfected security interest in all cash and deposit accounts of the electric distribution company in which revenues arising with respect to the transition property have been commingled with other funds, but the perfected security interest shall be limited to an amount not greater than the amount of the revenues with respect to the transition property received by the electric distribution company within twelve months before (1) any default under the security agreement, or (2) the institution of insolvency proceedings by or against the electric distribution company, less payments from the revenues to the pledgees during that twelve-month period.\n\n(e) If an event of default occurs under the security agreement covering the transition property, the pledgees of the transition property, subject to the terms of the security agreement, shall have all rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under article 9 of title 42a, and shall be entitled to foreclose or otherwise enforce their security interest in the transition property, subject to the rights of any third parties holding prior security interests in the transition property perfected in the manner provided in this section. In addition, the authority may require, in the financing order creating the transition property, that, in the event of default by the electric distribution company in payment of revenues arising with respect to the transition property, the authority and any successor thereto, upon the application by the pledgees or transferees, including transferees under this section, of the transition property, and without limiting any other remedies available to the pledgees or transferees by reason of the default, shall order the sequestration and payment to the pledgees or transferees of revenues arising with respect to the transition property. Any order shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any bankruptcy, reorganization, or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the debtor, pledgor, or transferor of the transition property. Any surplus in excess of amounts necessary to pay principal, premium, if any, interest, costs, and arrearages on the rate reduction bonds, and other costs arising under the security agreement, shall be remitted to the debtor or to the pledgor or transferor.\n\n(f) Sections 42a-9-204 and 42a-9-205 shall apply to a pledge of transition property by an electric distribution company, an affiliate of an electric distribution company, or a financing entity.\n\n(g) This section sets forth the terms by which a consensual security interest can be created and perfected in the transition property. Unless otherwise ordered by the authority with respect to any series of rate reduction bonds on or prior to the issuance of the series, there shall exist a statutory lien as provided in this subsection. Upon the effective date of the financing order, there shall exist a first priority lien on all transition property then existing or thereafter arising pursuant to the terms of the financing order. This lien shall arise by operation of this section automatically without any action on the part of the electric distribution company, any affiliate thereof, the financing entity, or any other person. This lien shall secure all obligations, then existing or subsequently arising, to the holders of the rate reduction bonds issued pursuant to the financing order, the trustee or representative for the holders, and any other entity specified in the financing order. The persons for whose benefit this lien is established shall, upon the occurrence of any defaults specified in the financing order, have all rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under article 9 of title 42a, and shall be entitled to foreclose or otherwise enforce this statutory lien in the transition property. This lien shall attach to the transition property regardless of who shall own, or shall subsequently be determined to own, the transition property including any electric distribution company, any affiliate thereof, the financing entity, or any other person. This lien shall be valid, perfected, and enforceable against the owner of the transition property and all third parties upon the effectiveness of the financing order without any further public notice; provided, however, that any person may, but shall not be required to, file a financing statement in accordance with subsection (b) of this section. Financing statements so filed may be “protective filings” and shall not be evidence of the ownership of the transition property. A perfected statutory lien in transition property is a continuously perfected lien in all revenues and proceeds arising with respect thereto, whether or not the revenues or proceeds have accrued. Conflicting liens shall rank according to priority in time of perfection. Transition property shall constitute property for all purposes, including for contracts securing rate reduction bonds, whether or not the revenues and proceeds arising with respect thereto have accrued. In addition, the authority may require, in the financing order creating the transition property, that, in the event of default by the electric distribution company in payment of revenues arising with respect to transition property, the authority and any successor thereto, upon the application by the beneficiaries of the statutory lien, and without limiting any other remedies available to the beneficiaries by reason of the default, shall order the sequestration and payment to the beneficiaries of revenues arising with respect to the transition property. Any order shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any bankruptcy, reorganization, or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the debtor, pledgor, or transferor of the transition property. Any surplus in excess of amounts necessary to pay principal, premium, if any, interest, costs, and arrearages on the rate reduction bonds, and other costs arising in connection with the documents governing the rate reduction bonds, shall be remitted to the debtor or to the pledgor or transferor.\n\n(h) A transfer of transition property by an electric distribution company to an affiliate or to a financing entity, or by an affiliate of an electric distribution company or a financing entity to another financing entity, which the parties have in the governing documentation expressly stated to be a sale or other absolute transfer, in a transaction approved in a financing order, shall be treated as an absolute transfer of all of the transferor's right, title, and interest, as in a true sale, and not as a pledge or other financing, of the transition property, in each case notwithstanding any contrary treatment of such transfer for accounting, tax, or other purposes. Granting to holders of rate reduction bonds a preferred right to revenues of the electric distribution company or the financing entity, or the provision by the company of other credit enhancement with respect to rate reduction bonds, shall not impair or negate the characterization of any transfer as a true sale, in each case notwithstanding any contrary treatment of such transfer for accounting, tax or other purposes.\n\n(i) A transfer of transition property shall be deemed perfected as against third persons when both of the following have taken place:\n\n(1) The authority has issued the financing order authorizing the competitive transition assessment included in the transition property.\n\n(2) An assignment of the transition property in writing has been executed and delivered to the transferee.\n\n(j) As between bona fide assignees of the same right for value without notice, the assignee first filing a financing statement in accordance with part 5 of article 9 of title 42a naming the assignor of the transition property as debtor and identifying the transition property has priority. In such case, the financing statement shall be filed as if the debtor were located in this state. Any description of the transition property shall be sufficient if it refers to the financing order creating the transition property. A copy of the financing statement shall be filed by the assignee or the financing entity with the authority, and the authority may require the assignor or the assignee or the financing entity to make other filings with respect to the transfer in accordance with procedures it may establish, but these filings shall not affect the perfection of the transfer.\n\n(k) Any successor to the electric distribution company, whether pursuant to any bankruptcy, reorganization, or other insolvency proceeding, or pursuant to any merger, sale, or transfer, by operation of law, or otherwise, shall perform and satisfy all obligations of the electric distribution company pursuant to sections 16-245e to 16-245k, inclusive, in the same manner and to the same extent as the electric distribution company, including, but not limited to, collecting and paying to the holders of rate reduction bonds or their representatives or the applicable financing entity revenues arising with respect to the transition property sold to the applicable financing entity or pledged to secure rate reduction bonds.\n\n(l) The authority of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority to issue financing orders pursuant to sections 16-245e to 16-245k, inclusive, shall expire on December 31, 2008, with respect to bonds other than economic recovery revenue bonds. The authority of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority to issue financing orders pursuant to sections 16-245e to 16-245k, inclusive, with respect to economic recovery revenue bonds shall expire on December 31, 2012. The expiration of such authority shall have no effect upon financing orders adopted by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority pursuant to sections 16-245e to 16-245k, inclusive, or any transition property arising therefrom, or upon the charges authorized to be levied thereunder, or the rights, interests, and obligations of the electric distribution company or a financing entity or holders of rate reduction bonds pursuant to the financing order, or the authority of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority to monitor, supervise, or take further action with respect to the financing order in accordance with the terms of sections 16-245e to 16-245k, inclusive, and of the financing order.\n\n(P.A. 98-28, S. 14, 117; P.A. 01-132, S. 166, 167; P.A. 03-62, S. 19, 20; Sept. 8 Sp.

      "text": "(a) The Connecticut Green Bank is authorized from time to time to issue its negotiable bonds for any corporate purpose. In anticipation of the sale of such bonds, the Connecticut Green Bank may issue negotiable bond anticipation notes and may renew the same from time to time. Such notes shall be paid from any revenues of said bank or other moneys available for such purposes and not otherwise pledged, or from the proceeds of sale of the bonds of said bank in anticipation of which they were issued. The notes shall be issued in the same manner as the bonds. Such notes and the resolution or resolutions authorizing the same may contain any provisions, conditions or limitations which a bond resolution of said bank may contain.\n\n(b) Every issue of the bonds, notes or other obligations issued by the Connecticut Green Bank shall be special obligations of said bank payable from any revenues or moneys of said bank available for such purposes and not otherwise pledged, subject to any agreements with the holders of particular bonds, notes or other obligations pledging any particular revenues or moneys, and subject to any agreements with any individual, partnership, corporation or association or other body, public or private. Notwithstanding that such bonds, notes or other obligations may be payable from a special fund, they shall be deemed to be for all purposes negotiable instruments, subject only to the provisions of such bonds, notes or other obligations for registration.\n\n(c) The bonds may be issued as serial bonds or as term bonds, or the Connecticut Green Bank, in its discretion, may issue bonds of both types. The bonds shall be authorized by resolution of the members of the board of directors of said bank and shall bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times, not exceeding twenty-five years for bonds issued for clean energy and fifty years for bonds issued for environmental infrastructure from their respective dates and in each case not to exceed the expected useful life of the underlying project or projects, bear interest at such rate or rates, be payable at such time or times, be in such denominations, be in such form, either coupon or registered, carry such registration privileges, be executed in such manner, be payable in lawful money of the United States at such place or places, and be subject to such terms of redemption, as such resolution or resolutions may provide. The bonds or notes may be sold at public or private sale for such price or prices as said bank shall determine. The power to fix the date of sale of bonds, to receive bids or proposals, to award and sell bonds, and to take all other necessary action to sell and deliver bonds may be delegated to the chairperson or vice-chairperson of the board, a subcommittee of the board or other officers of said bank by resolution of the board. The exercise of such delegated powers may be made subject to the approval of a majority of the members of the board which approval may be given in the manner provided in the bylaws of said bank. Pending preparation of the definitive bonds, said bank may issue interim receipts or certificates which shall be exchanged for such definitive bonds.\n\n(d) Any resolution or resolutions authorizing any bonds or any issue of bonds may contain provisions, which shall be a part of the contract with the holders of the bonds to be authorized, as to: (1) Pledges of the full faith and credit of the Connecticut Green Bank, the full faith and credit of any individual, partnership, corporation or association or other body, public or private, all or any part of the revenues of a project or any revenue-producing contract or contracts made by said bank with any individual, partnership, corporation or association or other body, public or private, any federally guaranteed security and moneys received therefrom purchased with bond proceeds or any other property, revenues, funds or legally available moneys to secure the payment of the bonds or of any particular issue of bonds, subject to such agreements with bondholders as may then exist; (2) the rentals, fees and other charges to be charged, and the amounts to be raised in each year thereby, and the use and disposition of the revenues; (3) the setting aside of reserves or sinking funds, and the regulation and disposition thereof; (4) limitations on the right of said bank or its agent to restrict and regulate the use of the project funded by such bonds or issue of bonds; (5) the purpose and limitations to which the proceeds of sale of any issue of bonds then or thereafter to be issued may be applied, including as authorized purposes all costs and expenses necessary or incidental to the issuance of bonds, to the acquisition of or commitment to acquire any federally guaranteed security and to the issuance and obtaining of any federally insured mortgage note, and pledging such proceeds to secure the payment of the bonds or any issue of the bonds; (6) limitations on the issuance of additional bonds, the terms upon which additional bonds may be issued and secured and the refunding of outstanding bonds; (7) the procedure, if any, by which the terms of any contract with bondholders may be amended or abrogated, the amount of bonds the holders of which must consent thereto, and the manner in which such consent may be given; (8) limitations on the amount of moneys derived from such project to be expended for operating, administrative or other expenses of said bank; (9) definitions of the acts or omissions to act which shall constitute a default in the duties of said bank to holders of its obligations and the rights and remedies of such holders in the event of a default; and (10) the mortgaging of a project and the site thereof for the purpose of securing the bondholders.\n\n(e) Neither the members of the board of directors of the Connecticut Green Bank nor any person executing the bonds, notes or other obligations shall be liable personally on the bonds, notes or other obligations or be subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance thereof.\n\n(f) The Connecticut Green Bank shall have the power to purchase its bonds, notes or other obligations out of any funds available for such purposes. Said bank may hold, pledge, cancel or resell such bonds, notes or other obligations, subject to and in accordance with agreements with bondholders. Said bank may sell, transfer or assign any of its loan assets to a trustee or other third party for the purposes of providing security for its bonds, notes or other obligations, or for bonds, notes or other obligations issued by the trustee or other third party on its behalf.\n\n(g) The Connecticut Green Bank is further authorized and empowered to issue bonds, notes or other obligations under this section, the interest on which may be includable in the gross income of the holder or holders thereof under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, to the same extent and in the same manner that interest on bills, notes, bonds or other obligations of the United States is includable in the gross income of the holder or holders thereof under said internal revenue code. Any such bonds, notes or other obligations may be issued only upon a finding by said bank that such issuance is necessary, is in the public interest, and is in furtherance of the purposes and powers of said bank. The state hereby consents to such inclusion only for the bonds, notes or other obligations of said bank so issued.\n\n(h) At the discretion of the Connecticut Green Bank, any bonds issued under the provisions of this section may be secured by a trust agreement by and between said bank and a corporate trustee or trustees, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Such trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds or other instrument of said bank may secure such bonds by a pledge or assignment of any revenues to be received, any contract or proceeds of any contract, or any other property, revenues, moneys or funds available to said bank for such purpose. Any pledge made by said bank pursuant to this subsection shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against said bank, irrespective of whether the parties have notice of the claims. Notwithstanding any provision of the Uniform Commercial Code, no instrument by which such pledge is created need be recorded or filed except in the records of said bank. Any revenues, contract or proceeds of any contract, or other property, revenues, moneys or funds so pledged and thereafter received by said bank shall be subject immediately to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and such lien shall have priority over all other liens. Such trust agreement or resolution may mortgage, assign or convey any real property to secure such bonds. Such trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including such provisions as have been specifically authorized by this section to be included in any resolution of said bank authorizing bonds thereof. Any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state, which may act as depositary of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues or other moneys, may furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by said bank. Any such trust agreement or resolution may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee or trustees, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as said bank may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of a project.\n\n(i) Bonds issued under the provisions of this section shall not be deemed to constitute a debt or liability of the state or of any political subdivision thereof, other than the Connecticut Green Bank, or a pledge of the full faith and credit of the state or any of its political subdivisions other than said bank, but shall be payable solely from the funds provided for such purposes by this section. All such bonds shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the effect that neither the state of Connecticut nor any political subdivision thereof, other than said bank, shall be obligated to pay the same or the interest thereon except from revenues of the project or the portion thereof for which such bonds are issued, and that neither the full faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state of Connecticut or of any political subdivision thereof, other than said bank, is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on such bonds. The issuance of bonds under the provisions of this section shall not directly, indirectly or contingently obligate the state or any political subdivision thereof to levy or to pledge any form of taxation or to make any appropriation for the payment of such bonds. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent or be construed to prevent said bank from pledging its full faith and credit or the full faith and credit of any individual, partnership, corporation or association or other body, public or private, to the payment of bonds or issue of bonds authorized pursuant to this section.\n\n(j) The state of Connecticut does hereby pledge to and agree with the holders of any bonds, notes or other obligations issued under this section and with those parties who may enter into contracts with the Connecticut Green Bank or its successor agency pursuant to the provisions of this section that the state shall not limit or alter the rights hereby vested in said bank until such obligations, together with the interest thereon, are fully met and discharged and such contracts are fully performed on the part of said bank, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall preclude such limitation or alteration if and when adequate provision is made by law for the protection of the holders of such bonds, notes or other obligations of said bank or those entering into such contracts with said bank. Said bank is authorized to include this pledge and undertaking for the state in such bonds, notes or other obligations, or contracts.\n\n(k) (1) The Connecticut Green Bank is authorized to fix, revise, charge and collect rates, rents, fees and charges for the use of and for the services furnished or to be furnished by each project, and to contract with any individual, partnership, corporation or association, or other body, public or private, in respect thereof. Such rates, rents, fees and charges shall be fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate of rates, rents, fees and charges from such project so as to provide funds sufficient with other revenues or moneys available for such purposes, if any, (A) to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the project and each and every portion thereof, to the extent that the payment of such cost has not otherwise been adequately provided for, (B) to pay the principal of and the interest on outstanding bonds of said bank issued in respect of such project as the same shall become due and payable, and (C) to create and maintain reserves required or provided for in any resolution authorizing, or trust agreement securing, such bonds of said bank. Such rates, rents, fees and charges shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any department, commission, board, body, bureau or agency of this state other than said bank.\n\n(2) A sufficient amount of the revenues derived in respect of a project, except such part of such revenues as may be necessary to pay the cost of maintenance, repair and operation and to provide reserves and for renewals, replacements, extensions, enlargements and improvements as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of any bonds of the Connecticut Green Bank or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or trust agreement in a sinking or other similar fund which is hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds as the same shall become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made. The rates, rents, fees and charges and other revenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by said bank shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against said bank, irrespective of whether such parties have notice of such claims. Notwithstanding any provision of the Connecticut Uniform Commercial Code, neither the resolution nor any trust agreement nor any other agreement nor any lease by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of said bank. The use and disposition of moneys to the credit of such sinking or other similar fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or of such trust agreement. Except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or such trust agreement, such sinking or other similar fund may be a fund for all such bonds issued to finance projects for any individual, partnership, corporation or association, or other body, public or private, without distinction or priority of one over another; provided said bank in any such resolution or trust agreement may provide that such sinking or other similar fund shall be the fund for a particular project for any individual, partnership, corporation or association, or other body, public or private, and for the bonds issued to finance a particular project and may, additionally, permit and provide for the issuance of bonds having a subordinate lien in respect of the security authorized by this subsection to other bonds of said bank, and, in such case, said bank may create separate sinking or other similar funds in respect of such subordinate lien bonds.\n\n(l) All moneys received pursuant to the provisions of this section, whether as proceeds from the sale of bonds or as revenues, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this section. Any officer with whom, or any bank or trust company with which, such moneys are deposited shall act as trustee of such moneys and shall hold and apply the same for the purposes of this section, subject to the resolution authorizing the bonds of any issue or the trust agreement securing such bonds.\n\n(m) Any holder of bonds, bond anticipation notes, other notes or other obligations issued under the provisions of this section, or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee or trustees under any trust agreement, except to the extent the rights given by this section may be restricted by any resolution authorizing the issuance of, or any such trust agreement securing, such bonds, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the state or granted by this section or under such resolution or trust agreement, and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by this section or by such resolution or trust agreement to be performed by the Connecticut Green Bank or by any officer, employee or agent thereof, including the fixing, charging and collecting of the rates, rents, fees and charges authorized by this section and required by the provisions of such resolution or trust agreement to be fixed, established and collected.\n\n(n) The Connecticut Green Bank shall have power to contract with the holders of any of its bonds or notes as to the custody, collection, securing, investment and payment of any reserve funds of said bank, or of any moneys held in trust or otherwise for the payment of bonds or notes, and to carry out such contracts. Any officer with whom, or any bank or trust company with which, such moneys shall be deposited as trustee thereof shall hold, invest, reinvest and apply such moneys for the purposes thereof, subject to such provisions as this section and the resolution authorizing the issue of the bonds or notes or the trust agreement securing such bonds or notes may provide.\n\n(o) The exercise of the powers granted by this section shall be in all respects for the benefit of the people of this state, for the increase of their commerce, welfare and prosperity, and for the improvement of their health and living conditions, and, as the exercise of such powers shall constitute the performance of an essential public function, neither the Connecticut Green Bank, any affiliate of said bank, nor any collection or other agent of said bank nor any such affiliate shall be required to pay any taxes or assessments upon or in respect of any revenues or property received, acquired, transferred or used by said bank, any affiliate of said bank or any collection or other agent of said bank or any such affiliate or upon or in respect of the income from such revenues or property. Any bonds, notes or other obligations issued under the provisions of this section, their transfer and the income therefrom, including any profit made on the sale of such bonds, notes or other obligations, shall at all times be free from taxation of every kind by the state and by the municipalities and other political subdivisions in the state, except for estate and succession taxes. The interest on such bonds, notes or other obligations shall be included in the computation of any excise or franchise tax.\n\n(p) (1) The Connecticut Green Bank is hereby authorized to provide for the issuance of bonds of said bank for the purpose of refunding any bonds of said bank then outstanding, including the payment of any redemption premium thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue to the earliest or subsequent date of redemption, purchase or maturity of such bonds, and, if deemed advisable by said bank, for the additional purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of constructing and acquiring additions, improvements, extensions or enlargements of a project or any portion thereof.\n\n(2) The proceeds of any such bonds issued for the purpose of refunding outstanding bonds may, at the discretion of the Connecticut Green Bank, be applied to the purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption of such outstanding bonds either on their earliest or any subsequent redemption date or upon the purchase or at the maturity thereof and may, pending such application, be placed in escrow to be applied to such purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption on such date as may be determined by said bank.\n\n(3) Any such escrowed proceeds, pending such use, may be invested and reinvested in direct obligations of, or obligations unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States and certificates of deposit or time deposits secured by direct obligations of, or obligations unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States, or obligations of a state, a territory, or a possession of the United States, or any political subdivision of any of the foregoing, within the meaning of Section 103(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time, the full and timely payment of the principal of and interest on which are secured by an irrevocable deposit of direct obligations of the United States which, if the outstanding bonds are then rated by a nationally recognized rating agency, are rated in the highest rating category by such rating agency, maturing at such time or times as shall be appropriate to assure the prompt payment, as to principal, interest and redemption premium, if any, of the outstanding bonds to be so refunded. The interest, income and profits, if any, earned or realized on any such investment or reinvestment may also be applied to the payment of the outstanding bonds to be so refunded. After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied and carried out, any balance of such proceeds and interest, income and profits, if any, earned or realized on the investments or reinvestments thereof may be returned to the Connecticut Green Bank for use by it in any lawful manner.\n\n(4) The portion of the proceeds of any such bonds issued for the additional purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of constructing and acquiring additions, improvements, extensions or enlargements of a project or any portion thereof may be invested and reinvested as the provisions of this section and the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or the trust agreement securing such bonds may provide. The interest, income and profits, if any, earned or realized on such investment or reinvestment may be applied to the payment of all or any part of such cost or may be used by the Connecticut Green Bank in any lawful manner.\n\n(5) All such bonds shall be subject to the provisions of this section in the same manner and to the same extent as other bonds issued pursuant to this section or section 16-245n, 16-245llor 16-245mm.\n\n(q) Bonds issued by the Connecticut Green Bank under the provisions of this section are hereby made securities in which all public officers and public bodies of the state and its political subdivisions, all insurance companies, state banks and trust companies, national banking associations, savings banks, savings and loan associations, investment companies, executors, administrators, trustees and other fiduciaries may properly and legally invest funds, including capital in their control or belonging to them. Such bonds are hereby made securities which may properly and legally be deposited with and received by any state or municipal officer or any agency or political subdivision of the state for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds or obligations of the state is now or may hereafter be authorized by law.\n\n(r) In conjunction with the issuance of the bonds, notes or other obligations, the Connecticut Green Bank may: (1) Make representations and agreements for the benefit of the holders of the bonds, notes or other obligations to make secondary market disclosures; (2) enter into interest rate swap agreements and other agreements for the purpose of moderating interest rate risk on the bonds, notes or other obligations; (3) enter into such other agreements and instruments to secure the bonds, notes or other obligations; and (4) take such other actions as necessary or appropriate for the issuance and distribution of the bonds, notes or other obligations and may make representations and agreements for the benefit of the holders of the bonds, notes or other obligations which are necessary or appropriate to ensure exclusion of the interest payable on the bonds, notes or other obligations from gross income under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time.\n\n(June 12 Sp.

The board shall also include two representatives selected by the gas companies. The members of the board shall serve for a period of five years and may be reappointed. Representatives of gas companies, electric distribution companies and the municipal electric energy cooperative shall be nonvoting members of the board. The members of the board shall elect a chairperson from its voting members. If any vote of the board results in an equal division of its voting members, such vote shall fail.\n\n(d) (1) Not later than November 1, 2012, and every three years thereafter, electric distribution companies, as defined in section 16-1, in coordination with the gas companies, as defined in section 16-1, shall submit to the Energy Conservation Management Board a combined electric and gas Conservation and Load Management Plan, in accordance with the provisions of this section, to implement cost-effective energy conservation programs, demand management and market transformation initiatives. All supply and conservation and load management options shall be evaluated and selected within an integrated supply and demand planning framework. Services provided under the plan shall be available to all customers of electric distribution companies and gas companies, provided a customer of an electric distribution company may not be denied such services based on the fuel such customer uses to heat such customer's home. The Energy Conservation Management Board shall advise and assist the electric distribution companies and gas companies in the development of such plan. The Energy Conservation Management Board shall approve the plan before transmitting it to the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection for approval. The commissioner shall, in an uncontested proceeding during which the commissioner may hold a public meeting, approve, modify or reject said plan prepared pursuant to this subsection. Following approval by the commissioner, the board shall assist the companies in implementing the plan and collaborate with the Connecticut Green Bank to further the goals of the plan. Said plan shall include a detailed budget sufficient to fund all energy efficiency that is cost-effective or lower cost than acquisition of equivalent supply, and shall be reviewed and approved by the commissioner. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall, not later than sixty days after the plan is approved by the commissioner, ensure that the balance of revenues required to fund such plan is provided through fully reconciling conservation adjustment mechanisms. Electric distribution companies shall collect a conservation adjustment mechanism that ensures the plan is fully funded by collecting an amount that is not more than the sum of six mills per kilowatt hour of electricity sold to each end use customer of an electric distribution company during the three years of any Conservation and Load Management Plan. The authority shall ensure that the revenues required to fund such plan with regard to gas companies are provided through a fully reconciling conservation adjustment mechanism for each gas company of not more than the equivalent of four and six-tenth cents per hundred cubic feet during the three years of any Conservation and Load Management Plan. Said plan shall include steps that would be needed to achieve the goal of weatherization of eighty per cent of the state's residential units by 2030 and to reduce energy consumption by 1.6 million MMBtu, or the equivalent megawatts of electricity, as defined in subdivision (4) of section 22a-197, annually each year for calendar years commencing on and after January 1, 2020, up to and including calendar year 2025. Each program contained in the plan shall be reviewed by such companies and accepted, modified or rejected by the Energy Conservation Management Board prior to submission to the commissioner for approval. The Energy Conservation Management Board shall, as part of its review, examine opportunities to offer joint programs providing similar efficiency measures that save more than one fuel resource or otherwise to coordinate programs targeted at saving more than one fuel resource. Any costs for joint programs shall be allocated equitably among the conservation programs. The Energy Conservation Management Board shall give preference to projects that maximize the reduction of federally mandated congestion charges.\n\n(2) There shall be a joint committee of the Energy Conservation Management Board and the board of directors of the Connecticut Green Bank. The boards shall each appoint members to such joint committee. The joint committee shall examine opportunities to coordinate the programs and activities funded by the Clean Energy Fund pursuant to section 16-245n with the programs and activities contained in the plan developed under this subsection and to provide financing to increase the benefits of programs funded by the plan so as to reduce the long-term cost, environmental impacts and security risks of energy in the state. Such joint committee shall hold its first meeting on or before August 1, 2005.\n\n(3) Programs included in the plan developed under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be screened through cost-effectiveness testing that compares the value and payback period of program benefits for all energy savings to program costs to ensure that programs are designed to obtain energy savings and system benefits, including mitigation of federally mandated congestion charges, whose value is greater than the costs of the programs. Program cost-effectiveness shall be reviewed by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection annually, or otherwise as is practicable, and shall incorporate the results of the evaluation process set forth in subdivision (4) of this subsection. If a program is determined to fail the cost-effectiveness test as part of the review process, it shall either be modified to meet the test or shall be terminated, unless it is integral to other programs that in combination are cost-effective. On or before March 1, 2005, and on or before March first annually thereafter, the board shall provide a report, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a, to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to energy and the environment that documents (A) expenditures and fund balances and evaluates the cost-effectiveness of such programs conducted in the preceding year, and (B) the extent to and manner in which the programs of such board collaborated and cooperated with programs, established under section 7-233y, of municipal electric energy cooperatives. To maximize the reduction of federally mandated congestion charges, programs in the plan may allow for disproportionate allocations between the amount of contributions pursuant to this section by a certain rate class and the programs that benefit such a rate class. Before conducting such evaluation, the board shall consult with the board of directors of the Connecticut Green Bank. The report shall include a description of the activities undertaken during the reporting period.\n\n(4) The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall adopt an independent, comprehensive program evaluation, measurement and verification process to ensure the Energy Conservation Management Board's programs are administered appropriately and efficiently, comply with statutory requirements, programs and measures are cost effective, evaluation reports are accurate and issued in a timely manner, evaluation results are appropriately and accurately taken into account in program development and implementation, and information necessary to meet any third-party evaluation requirements is provided. An annual schedule and budget for evaluations as determined by the board shall be included in the plan filed with the commissioner pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection. The electric distribution and gas company representatives and the representative of a municipal electric energy cooperative may not vote on board plans, budgets, recommendations, actions or decisions regarding such process or its program evaluations and their implementation. Program and measure evaluation, measurement and verification shall be conducted on an ongoing basis, with emphasis on impact and process evaluations, programs or measures that have not been studied, and those that account for a relatively high percentage of program spending. Evaluations shall use statistically valid monitoring and data collection techniques appropriate for the programs or measures being evaluated. All evaluations shall contain a description of any problems encountered in the process of the evaluation, including, but not limited to, data collection issues, and recommendations regarding addressing those problems in future evaluations. The board shall contract with one or more consultants not affiliated with the board members to act as an evaluation administrator, advising the board regarding development of a schedule and plans for evaluations and overseeing the program evaluation, measurement and verification process on behalf of the board. Consistent with board processes and approvals and the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection's decisions regarding evaluation, such evaluation administrator shall implement the evaluation process by preparing requests for proposals and selecting evaluation contractors to perform program and measure evaluations and by facilitating communications between evaluation contractors and program administrators to ensure accurate and independent evaluations. In the evaluation administrator's discretion and at his or her request, the electric distribution and gas companies shall communicate with the evaluation administrator for purposes of data collection, vendor contract administration, and providing necessary factual information during the course of evaluations. The evaluation administrator shall bring unresolved administrative issues or problems that arise during the course of an evaluation to the board for resolution, but shall have sole authority regarding substantive and implementation decisions regarding any evaluation. Board members, including electric distribution and gas company representatives, may not communicate with an evaluation contractor about an ongoing evaluation except with the express permission of the evaluation administrator, which may only be granted if the administrator believes the communication will not compromise the independence of the evaluation. The evaluation administrator shall file evaluation reports with the board and with the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection in its most recent uncontested proceeding pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection and the board shall post a copy of each report on its Internet web site. The board and its members, including electric distribution and gas company representatives, may file written comments regarding any evaluation with the commissioner or for posting on the board's Internet web site. Within fourteen days of the filing of any evaluation report, the commissioner, members of the board or other interested persons may request in writing, and the commissioner shall conduct, a transcribed technical meeting to review the methodology, results and recommendations of any evaluation. Participants in any such transcribed technical meeting shall include the evaluation administrator, the evaluation contractor and the Office of Consumer Counsel at its discretion. On or before November 1, 2011, and annually thereafter, the board shall report to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to energy, with the results and recommendations of completed program evaluations.\n\n(5) Programs included in the plan developed under subdivision (1) of this subsection may include, but not be limited to: (A) Conservation and load management programs, including programs that benefit low-income individuals; (B) research, development and commercialization of products or processes which are more energy-efficient than those generally available; (C) development of markets for such products and processes; (D) support for energy use assessment, real-time monitoring systems, engineering studies and services related to new construction or major building renovation; (E) the design, manufacture, commercialization and purchase of energy-efficient appliances and heating, air conditioning and lighting devices; (F) program planning and evaluation; (G) indoor air quality programs relating to energy conservation; (H) joint fuel conservation initiatives programs targeted at reducing consumption of more than one fuel resource; (I) conservation of water resources; (J) public education regarding conservation; and (K) demand-side technology programs recommended by the Conservation and Load Management Plan. Support for such programs may be by direct funding, manufacturers' rebates, sale price and loan subsidies, leases and promotional and educational activities. The Energy Conservation Management Board shall periodically review contractors to determine whether they are qualified to conduct work related to such programs and to ensure that in making the selection of contractors to deliver programs, a fair and equitable process is followed. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that such contractors are deemed technically qualified if certified by the Building Performance Institute, Inc. or by an organization selected by the commissioner. The plan shall also provide for expenditures by the board for the retention of expert consultants and reasonable administrative costs provided such consultants shall not be employed by, or have any contractual relationship with, an electric distribution company or a gas company. Such costs shall not exceed five per cent of the total cost of the plan.\n\n(e) Deleted by P.A. 11-80, S. 33.\n\n(f) Not later than December 31, 2006, and not later than December thirty-first every five years thereafter, the Energy Conservation Management Board shall, after consulting with the Connecticut Green Bank, conduct an evaluation of the performance of the programs and activities specified in the plan approved by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (d) of this section and submit a report, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a, of the evaluation to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to energy.\n\n(g) Repealed by P.A. 06-186, S. 91.\n\n(P.A. 98-28, S. 33, 117; P.A. 03-135, S. 9; June 30 Sp.

Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, such fee shall apply to customers who have installed self-generation facilities that begin operation on or after July 1, 1998.\n\n(c) An exit fee shall not apply to a customer who has installed a self-generation facility that (1) exclusively services the load of one to four residential units, or (2) is installed in conjunction with the expansion of an industrial plant that began operation before July 1, 1998, if the self-generation facility predominantly services such industrial plant and the expansion of said industrial plant results in economic development, as determined by the authority. The exemption under subdivision (2) of this subsection shall only apply to the amount of any new load provided by the self-generation facility to service the expansion.\n\n(d) The authority shall develop criteria for excluding units based on size or specialized use, balancing concerns of the potential impact on small businesses, equity among customer classes, and the need to offset losses to the competitive transition assessment and the systems benefits charge. The authority shall establish procedures for distinguishing between existing load and new load for purposes of self-generation facilities described in subdivision (2) of subsection (c) of this section. The authority shall determine how to identify self-generation facilities, such as through a registration process, and how to enforce the collection of such fees. The authority shall establish criteria to determine how such fee shall be valued and the process for its collection, which shall include the ability of self-generation facilities to pay the fee over a period of time.\n\n(e) Not later than January 1, 1999, the authority shall submit its findings and recommendations to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to energy.\n\n(P.A. 98-28, S. 69, 117; P.A. 11-80, S. 1; P.A. 18-50, S. 23.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 98-28 effective July 1, 1998; pursuant to P.A. 11-80, “Department of Public Utility Control” and “department” were changed editorially by the Revisors to “Public Utilities Regulatory Authority” and “authority”, respectively, and “Renewable Energy Investment Fund” was changed editorially by the Revisors to “Clean Energy Fund”, effective July 1, 2011; P.A. 18-50 amended Subsec.

At least annually, the authority shall compute the rate differential for electric service between residential and industrial customers by comparing the total average residential rate and the total average industrial rate, based on filings made by electric suppliers and electric distribution companies with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the authority. The rate differential shall be the difference between the total average residential rate and the total average industrial rates, divided by the total average residential rate.\n\n(2) If the authority determines that the rate differential for electric service between residential and industrial customers has increased by three percentage points or more from the rate differential that existed on January 1, 1998, the authority shall institute an investigatory proceeding in which the Office of the Consumer Counsel shall participate. Not more than ninety days after the official commencement of the proceeding, the authority shall issue written findings that identify the factors or circumstances that contributed to such increase in the rate differential. If the authority finds that such increase is a result of a violation of this title or of other state or federal laws, the authority shall take appropriate enforcement action or refer such violation to the appropriate state or federal authority. If the authority finds that such increase is due to factors or circumstances other than a violation of state or federal law, the authority shall take action in accordance with methods of allocation in effect on January 1, 1997, to minimize to the greatest extent possible such differential to less than three percentage points, within the authority granted to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority pursuant to section 16-7, subsection (a) or (b) of section 16-8, section 16-8c, 16-9, 16-10, 16-10a, 16-15, 16-19 or 16-19a, subsection (g) of section 16-19b or section 16-19e, 16-19f, 16-19gg, 16-19hh, 16-19kk, 16-20, 16-21, 16-24, 16-28, 16-32, 16-41, 16-244c 16-245, 16-245g or 16-245l, provided any action taken by the authority shall be in compliance with the principles set forth in section 16-244, and provided further the authority shall not allow inter or intra-class rate subsidization.\n\n(3) Not later than January first, as applicable, the authority shall report its findings described in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection, including a description of the factors or circumstances that contributed to such increase in the rate differential and a description of actions taken by the authority, along with any legislative recommendations to minimize such differential to less than three percentage points without creating intra or inter class rate subsidization, to members of the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to energy.\n\n(c) Each electric distribution company shall submit, on a form prescribed by the authority, quarterly reports containing the average price for electric service for each customer class.\n\n(d) The authority shall require electric distribution companies and electric suppliers to supply to the authority whatever pricing information the authority needs to complete its reporting and monitoring requirements under this section. The authority may grant confidential status to certain data if a valid claim is made that the information is competitively sensitive, provided composite numbers shall be public information.

The authority may suspend a tariff or any portion of a tariff during such investigation. The investigation may include, but is not limited to, an inquiry to determine whether the tariff is predatory, deceptive, anticompetitive or violates the pricing standard set forth in subdivision (1) of subsection (c) of section 16-247b. Not later than seventy-five days after the effective date of the tariff, unless the party filing the tariff, all statutory parties to the proceeding and the authority agree to a specific extension of time, the authority shall issue its decision, including whether to approve, modify or deny the tariff.

Such application shall include such information as the authority shall require, and any reasonable fees, not to exceed actual cost, the authority may prescribe, in regulations adopted pursuant to chapter 54. The authority may issue such certificate and may, as a precondition to certification, require any applicant to procure a performance bond sufficient to cover moneys due or to become due to other telecommunications companies for the provision of access to local telecommunications networks, to protect any advances or deposits it may collect from its customers if the authority does not order that such advances or deposits be held in escrow or trust, and to otherwise protect customers. Following receipt of such application, the authority shall give notice of such application to all interested persons. The authority may approve or deny the application after holding a hearing with notice to all interested persons if any person requests such hearing.\n\n(2) Any person may object to a fee charged pursuant to this section by filing with the authority, not later than thirty days after the fee was charged, a petition stating the amount of the fee charged to which it objects and the grounds upon which it claims such fee is excessive, erroneous, unlawful or invalid. Upon the request of the person filing the petition, the authority shall hold a hearing. After reviewing the petition and testimony, if any, the authority shall issue its order in accordance with its findings. The person shall pay the authority the amount indicated in the order not later than thirty days after the date of the order.\n\n(b) A certified telecommunications provider may petition the authority to expand the authority granted in its certificate of public convenience and necessity to the provision of a previously-authorized service in an additional service area or to the provision of a service not previously authorized, or to both. Such petition shall include such information as the authority shall require by regulations adopted pursuant to chapter 54. The authority may expand the authority granted in such a certificate and may, as a precondition to such expansion, require a petitioner to procure a performance bond sufficient to cover moneys due or to become due to other telecommunications companies for the provision of access to local telecommunications networks, to protect any advances or deposits it may collect from its customers if the authority does not order that such advances or deposits be held in escrow or trust, and to otherwise protect customers. Following receipt of such petition, the authority may, on petition or its own motion, hold a hearing with notice to all interested parties, after which the authority may approve or deny the application.\n\n(c) The authority may certify an applicant if the applicant: (1) Provides the information requested by the authority pursuant to the provisions of sections 16-247f to 16-247h, inclusive, and section 16-247j; (2) provides a performance bond or complies with escrow or trust requirements, if required by the authority; (3) provides a fee, if required by this section; and (4) possesses and demonstrates adequate financial resources, managerial ability and technical competency to provide the proposed service.\n\n(d) Any certified telecommunications provider and any telephone company shall (1) maintain its accounts in such manner as the authority shall require; (2) file financial reports at such times and in such form as the authority shall prescribe; (3) file with the authority such current descriptions of services and listings of rates and charges as it may require; (4) cooperate with the authority in its investigations of consumer complaints and comply with any resulting orders; (5) comply with standards established pursuant to section 16-247p; and (6) comply with additional requirements as the authority shall prescribe by regulation.\n\n(e) Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, on or after July 1, 2001, each certified telecommunications provider shall, within a period of time the authority determines is reasonable after said provider is certified, be obligated to serve a residential or business customer in its authorized area of operation who is seeking from said provider telecommunications services that are provided by said provider.\n\n(f) Any community antenna television company that is a certified telecommunications provider or an affiliate of a community antenna television company that is a certified telecommunications provider and that provides telecommunications services shall be obligated to serve all residential and business customers seeking local exchange service in its entire franchise area in which said company provides community antenna television services pursuant to section 16-331. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the authority shall not require any such company to provide local exchange service outside of its franchise area. If, however, any such company elects to provide local exchange service to customers outside its franchise area, such company shall be subject to all geographic service requirements established by the authority.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding any decision of the authority to allow the competitive provision of a telecommunications service or to grant a certificate pursuant to this section, the authority, after holding a hearing with notice to all interested parties and determining that (1) continued competitive provision of a telecommunications service would be contrary to the goals set forth in section 16-247a, or would not be in accordance with the provisions of sections 16-247a to 16-247c, inclusive, section 16-247e or 16-247f, this section, or section 16-247h or 16-247k, (2) a certified telecommunications provider does not have adequate financial resources, managerial ability or technical competency to provide the service, or (3) a certified telecommunications provider has failed to comply with an applicable order made or regulation adopted by the authority, may suspend or revoke the authorization to provide said telecommunications service or take any other action it deems appropriate. In determining whether to suspend or revoke such authorization, the authority shall consider, without limitation, (A) the effect of such suspension or revocation on the customers of the telecommunications service, (B) the technical feasibility of suspending or revoking the authorized usage only on an intrastate basis, and (C) the financial impact of such suspension or revocation on the provider of the telecommunications service.\n\n(h) The authority shall remit all fees collected under this section to the State Treasurer for deposit in the Consumer Counsel and Public Utility Control Fund established in section 16-48a.\n\n(i) On October first, annually, the authority shall submit to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to energy and technology a report of all fees collected pursuant to this section during the preceding fiscal year.\n\n(P.A. 87-415, S. 4, 13; P.A. 93-330, S. 5, 9; P.A. 94-83, S. 7, 16; P.A. 95-86, S. 1, 2; P.A. 99-222, S. 11, 19; P.A. 02-98, S. 1; P.A. 11-80, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 93-330 amended Subsec.

Such combined heat and power system shall be (A) procured by a thermal energy transportation company through a competitive bidding process, (B) in a configuration compatible for use with a district heating system, and (C) installed at a location that will maximize the efficient use of the thermal energy from the combined heat and power system by a thermal energy transportation company. The thermal energy produced by such combined heat and power system shall be subject to firm customer commitments to subscribe to thermal energy services from such thermal energy transportation company, as demonstrated by such thermal energy transportation company, for the term of the power purchase agreement entered into pursuant to this section. After reviewing any proposals submitted in response to such procurement, the electric distribution company may enter into a power purchase agreement with a thermal energy distribution company for the purchase of electricity and renewable energy credits for a period of not more than twenty years.\n\n(b) No later than fifteen days after an electric distribution company enters into a power purchase agreement pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the electric distribution company shall submit such agreement to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority for review and approval. The authority shall evaluate such agreement and may approve such agreement if the authority finds that the agreement (1) complies with the requirements of this section, and (2) serves the long-term interests of ratepayers. The authority shall not approve any agreement supported in any form of cross subsidization by entities affiliated with the electric distribution company. A combined heat and power system acquired and built pursuant to a power purchase agreement entered into pursuant to this section shall not exceed a total nameplate capacity rating of ten megawatts in the aggregate. The electric distribution company may not, under any circumstances, recover more than the full costs of the agreement approved by the authority. The net costs of any such agreement, including costs incurred by the electric distribution company under the agreement and reasonable costs incurred by the electric distribution company in connection with the agreement, shall be recovered on a timely basis through a reconciling component of electric rates as determined by the authority that is nonbypassable when switching electric suppliers. Any net revenues from the sale of products purchased in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to this section shall be credited to customers through the same reconciling component of electric rates that is utilized to recover the costs of such agreement. Certificates issued by the New England Power Pool Generation Information System for any Class I or Class III source procured by an electric distribution company pursuant to this section may be (A) sold into the New England Power Pool Generation Information System renewable energy credit market to be used by an electric supplier or electric distribution company to meet the requirements of section 16-245a, so long as the revenues from such sale are credited to electric distribution company customers as described in this subsection, or (B) retained by the electric distribution company to meet the requirements of section 16-245a. In considering whether to sell or retain such certificates, the company shall select the option that is in the best interest of such company's ratepayers, consistent with the procurement plan approved pursuant to sections 16-244c and 16-244m.\n\n(c) Any thermal energy distribution company that has entered into a power purchase agreement approved by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority pursuant to this section may elect to extend the timeframes established in such agreement for the completion of significant milestones, as specified in such agreement, in the development of a combined heat and power system pursuant to such agreement. Such company may elect to extend all such timeframes for milestones that such company has not already completed by not more than two six-month periods. Any such extension shall be in addition to extensions specified in such agreement. For each six-month extension that such company elects to use pursuant to this subsection, such company shall post additional security as specified in such agreement.\n\n(June Sp. Sess.

From November first to May first, inclusive, no gas company and no municipal utility furnishing gas shall terminate, deny or refuse to reinstate residential gas service in hardship cases where the customer uses such gas for heat and lacks the financial resources to pay his or her entire account, except a gas company that, between May second and October thirty-first, terminated gas service to a residential customer who uses gas for heat and who, during the previous period of November first to May first, had gas service maintained because of hardship status, may refuse to reinstate the gas service from November first to May first, inclusive, only if the customer has failed to pay, since the preceding November first, the lesser of: (A) Twenty per cent of the outstanding principal balance owed the gas company as of the date of termination, (B) one hundred dollars, or (C) the minimum payments due under the customer's amortization agreement. Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, no electric distribution or gas company, no electric supplier and no municipal utility furnishing electricity or gas shall terminate, deny or refuse to reinstate residential electric or gas service where the customer lacks the financial resources to pay his or her entire account and if the termination, denial of or failure to reinstate such service would create a life-threatening situation for such customer or a member of such customer's household. No electric distribution or gas company, no electric supplier and no municipal utility furnishing electricity or gas shall terminate, deny or refuse to reinstate residential electric or gas service where the customer is a hardship case and lacks the financial resources to pay his or her entire account and a child not more than twenty-four months old resides in the customer's household and such child has been admitted to the hospital and received discharge papers on which the attending physician, physician assistant or an advanced practice registered nurse has indicated such service is a necessity for the health and well-being of such child.\n\n(2) During any period in which a residential customer is subject to termination, an electric distribution or gas company, an electric supplier or a municipal utility furnishing electricity or gas shall provide such residential customer whose account is delinquent an opportunity to enter into a reasonable amortization agreement with such company, electric supplier or utility to pay such delinquent account and to avoid termination of service. Such amortization agreement shall allow such customer adequate opportunity to apply for and receive the benefits of any available energy assistance program. An amortization agreement shall be subject to amendment on customer request if there is a change in the customer's financial circumstances.\n\n(3) As used in this section, (A) “household income” means the combined income over a twelve-month period of the customer and all adults, except children of the customer, who are and have been members of the household for six months or more, and (B) “hardship case” includes, but is not limited to: (i) A customer receiving local, state or federal public assistance; (ii) a customer whose sole source of financial support is Social Security, United States Department of Veterans Affairs or unemployment compensation benefits; (iii) a customer who is head of the household and is unemployed, and the household income is less than three hundred per cent of the poverty level determined by the federal government; (iv) a customer who is seriously ill or who has a household member who is seriously ill; (v) a customer whose income falls below one hundred twenty-five per cent of the poverty level determined by the federal government; and (vi) a customer whose circumstances threaten a deprivation of food and the necessities of life for himself or dependent children if payment of a delinquent bill is required.\n\n(4) (A) Each gas company and electric distribution company shall deduct an arrearage from the account of a residential customer of such company if the customer (i) meets the income eligibility requirements of the Connecticut energy assistance program or state appropriated fuel assistance program; (ii) authorizes the gas or electric distribution company to send a copy of the customer's monthly bill directly to any energy assistance agency for payment; (iii) enters into and complies with an amortization agreement, which agreement is consistent with decisions and policies of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority; and (iv) is eligible for financial hardship programs with the gas or electric distribution company. The amount of an arrearage deducted under this subparagraph shall be equal to the customer's monthly payment pursuant to an amortization agreement under this subdivision, provided the customer meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A)(i) to (A)(iv), inclusive, of this subdivision for the month immediately preceding such payment.\n\n(B) Each gas company and electric distribution company shall deduct an arrearage from the account of a residential customer who meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A)(i) to (A)(iv), inclusive, of this subdivision in an amount equal to any payment such customer receives from the Connecticut energy assistance program, state appropriated fuel assistance program or other energy assistance sources. Such deduction shall be in addition to any amount deducted pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this subdivision.\n\n(C) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (7) of this subsection, any amortization agreement under this subdivision shall distribute customer payments over a period of twelve months, from November first to October thirty-first, and shall create a monthly payment that is affordable to the customer in accordance with the decisions and policies of the authority.\n\n(D) In no event shall the deduction of any amounts pursuant to this subdivision result in a credit balance to the customer's account. No customer shall be denied the benefits of this subdivision due to an error by the gas or electric distribution company. If the customer fails to comply with the terms of the amortization agreement, any decision of the authority rendered in lieu of such agreement or the requirements of subparagraphs (A)(i) to (A)(iv), inclusive, of this subdivision, the company may terminate service to the customer, pursuant to all applicable regulations, provided such termination shall not occur between November first and May first.\n\n(E) Each gas and electric distribution company shall submit to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority annually, on or before June first, an implementation plan that shall include information concerning amortization agreements, counseling, reinstatement of eligibility, rate impacts and any other information deemed relevant by the authority. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority may approve or modify such plan not later than one hundred twenty-seven days after receipt of the plan. If the authority does not take any action on such plan by such date, the plan shall automatically take effect at the end of such one-hundred-twenty-seven-day period, provided the authority may extend such period for an additional thirty days by notifying the company before the end of such one-hundred-twenty-seven-day period. The authority may deny all or part of the recovery of costs incurred pursuant to this subsection if it determines that the company seeking recovery has been imprudent, inefficient or acting in violation of statutes or regulations regarding amortization agreements.\n\n(5) (A) All electric distribution and gas companies, electric suppliers and municipal utilities furnishing electricity or gas shall collaborate in developing, subject to approval by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, standard provisions for the notice of delinquency and impending termination under subsection (a) of section 16-262d. Each such company and utility shall place on the front of such notice a provision that the company, electric supplier or utility shall not effect termination of service to a residential dwelling for nonpayment of disputed bills during the pendency of any complaint. In addition, the notice shall state that the customer is required to pay current and undisputed bill amounts during the pendency of the complaint. (B) At the beginning of any discussion with a customer concerning a reasonable amortization agreement, any such company or utility shall inform the customer (i) of the availability of a process for resolving disputes over what constitutes a reasonable amortization agreement, (ii) that the company, electric supplier or utility will refer such a dispute to one of its review officers as the first step in attempting to resolve the dispute, and (iii) that the company, electric supplier or utility shall not effect termination of service to a residential dwelling for nonpayment of a delinquent account during the pendency of any complaint, investigation, hearing or appeal initiated by the customer, unless the customer fails to pay undisputed bills, or undisputed portions of bills, for service received during such period. (C) Each such company, electric supplier and utility shall inform and counsel all customers who are hardship cases as to the availability of all public and private energy conservation programs, including programs sponsored or subsidized by such companies and utilities, eligibility criteria, where to apply, and the circumstances under which such programs are available without cost.\n\n(6) The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 to carry out the provisions of this subsection. Such regulations shall include, but not be limited to, criteria for determining hardship cases and for reasonable amortization agreements, including appeal of such agreements, for categories of customers. Such regulations may include the establishment of a reasonable rate of interest that a company may charge on the unpaid balance of a customer's delinquent bill and a description of the relationship and responsibilities of electric suppliers to customers.\n\n(7) The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority may find that a reasonable amortization agreement, other than a reasonable amortization agreement under subdivision (4) of this subsection, is a period of not more than thirty-six months, unless the authority determines that a longer period is warranted. Not later than October 1, 2024, the authority shall amend any regulations adopted pursuant to subdivision (6) of this subsection to carry out the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(8) The chairperson of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority may distribute not more than one million dollars in total each year to organizations or individuals providing legal services with the express purpose of attaining participation in public service company programs designed to assist customers with utility bill or arrearage payments, including negotiating a reasonable amortization agreement pursuant to this subsection. Any funds distributed pursuant to this subdivision shall be paid by all public service companies, in proportion to such companies' annual load and the amount of services provided to end use customers or revenue, as determined by the authority.\n\n(c) Each electric distribution and gas company, electric supplier and municipal utility shall, not later than December first, annually, submit a report to the authority and the General Assembly indicating (1) the number of customers in each of the following categories and the total delinquent balances for such customers as of the preceding May first: (A) Customers who are hardship cases and (i) who made arrangements for reasonable amortization agreements, (ii) who did not make such arrangements, and (B) customers who are nonhardship cases and who made arrangements for reasonable amortization, (2) (A) the number of heating customers receiving energy assistance during the preceding heating season and the total amount of such assistance, and (B) the total balance of the accounts of such customers after all energy assistance is applied to the accounts, (3) the number of hardship cases reinstated between November first of the preceding year and May first of the same year, the number of hardship cases terminated between May first of the same year and November first and the number of hardship cases reinstated during each month from May to November, inclusive, of the same year, (4) the number of reasonable amortization agreements executed and the number breached during the same year by (A) hardship cases, and (B) nonhardship cases, and (5) the number of accounts of (A) hardship cases, and (B) nonhardship cases for which part or all of the outstanding balance is written off as uncollectible during the preceding year and the total amount of such uncollectibles.\n\n(d) Nothing in this section shall (1) prohibit a public service company, electric supplier or municipal utility from terminating residential utility service upon request of the customer or in accordance with section 16-262d upon default by the customer on an amortization agreement or collecting delinquent accounts through legal processes, including the processes authorized by section 16-262f, or (2) relieve such company, electric supplier or municipal utility of its responsibilities set forth in sections 16-262d and 16-262e to occupants of residential dwellings or, with respect to a public service company or electric supplier, the responsibilities set forth in section 19a-109.\n\n(e) No provision of the Freedom of Information Act, as defined in section 1-200, shall be construed to require or permit a municipal utility furnishing electric, gas or water service, a municipality furnishing water or sewer service, a district established by special act or pursuant to chapter 105 and furnishing water or sewer service or a regional authority established by special act to furnish water or sewer service to disclose records under the Freedom of Information Act, as defined in section 1-200, which identify or could lead to identification of the utility usage or billing information of individual customers, to the extent such disclosure would constitute an invasion of privacy. Nothing in this section prohibits the disclosure of delinquencies or enforcement actions.\n\n(f) If an electric supplier suffers a loss of revenue by operation of this section, the supplier may make a claim for such revenue to the authority. The electric distribution company shall reimburse the electric supplier for such losses found to be reasonable by the authority at the lower of (1) the price of the contract between the supplier and the customer, or (2) the electric distribution company's price to customers for default service, as determined by the authority. The electric distribution company may recover such reimbursement, along with transaction costs, through the systems benefits charge.\n\n(1969, P.A. 194, S. 1; P.A. 75-625, S. 2, 8; P.A. 79-362, S. 1, 2; P.A. 83-505, S. 1, 3; P.A. 90-338; P.A. 91-150, S. 1, 2; P.A. 95-39, S. 1, 3; 95-274, S. 2; P.A. 96-46, S. 3; 96-204; P.A. 97-9, S. 1, 2; 97-20, S. 1, 2; 97-47, S. 32; P.A. 98-28, S. 38, 117; P.A. 99-222, S. 14, 19; P.A. 03-47, S. 1; P.A. 07-242, S. 67; P.A. 11-80, S. 1, 120; P.A. 12-197, S. 31; P.A. 13-276, S. 41; P.A. 14-134, S. 100; P.A. 18-72, S. 27; P.A. 21-196, S. 16; P.A. 23-102, S. 30.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 75-625 included telephone companies and service and municipal utilities providing gas, electric, telephone or water service in provisions and added “notwithstanding” phrase; P.A. 79-362 prohibited cessation of services to any customer because of delinquent payment “within one hour before the closing” of business office and added Subsecs.

In the event that multiple dates of proposed termination are provided to a customer, no such company, electric supplier or municipal utility shall terminate service prior to the latest of such dates. For purposes of this subsection, the thirteen-day periods and seven-day period shall commence on the date such notice is mailed. If such company, electric supplier or municipal utility does not terminate service within one hundred twenty days after mailing the initial notice of termination, such company, electric supplier or municipal utility shall give the customer a new notice at least thirteen days prior to termination.

      "text": "(a)(1) Upon default of the owner, agent, lessor or manager of a residential dwelling who is billed directly by an electric distribution, gas or telephone company or by a municipal utility for electric or gas utility service furnished to such building, such company or municipal utility or electric supplier providing electric generation services may petition the Superior Court or a judge thereof, for appointment of a receiver of the rents or payments for use and occupancy or common expenses, as defined in section 47-202, for any dwelling for which the owner, agent, lessor or manager is in default. The court or judge shall forthwith issue an order to show cause why a receiver should not be appointed, which shall be served upon the owner, agent, lessor or manager or his agent in a manner most reasonably calculated to give notice to such owner, agent, lessor or manager as determined by such court or judge, including, but not limited to, a posting of such order on the premises in question.\n\n(2) A hearing shall be had on such order no later than seventy-two hours after its issuance or the first court day thereafter. The sole purpose of such a hearing shall be to determine whether there is an amount due and owing between the owner, agent, lessor or manager and the company, electric supplier or municipal utility. The court shall make a determination of any amount due and owing and any amount so determined shall constitute a lien upon the real property of such owner. A certificate of such amount may be recorded in the land records of the town in which such property is located describing the amount of the lien and the name of the party in default. When the amount due and owing has been paid the company, electric supplier or municipality shall issue a certificate discharging the lien and shall file the certificate in the land records of the town in which such lien was recorded.\n\n(3) The receiver appointed by the court shall collect all rents or payments for use and occupancy or common expenses forthcoming from or paid on behalf of the occupants or residents of the building or facility in question in place of the owner, agent, lessor, manager or administrator. The receiver may also petition the court to obtain any remedy available under chapter 906 against such owner, agent, lessor or manager in order to recover amounts due as determined under subdivision (2) of this subsection and continuing charges for such utility service until all such charges and other costs have been paid.\n\n(4) The receiver shall pay the petitioner or other supplier, from such rents or payments for use and occupancy or common expenses for electric, gas, telephone, water or heating oil supplied on and after the date of his appointment. The owner, agent, lessor or manager shall be liable for such reasonable fees and costs determined by the court to be due the receiver, which fees and costs may be recovered from the rents or payments for use and occupancy under the control of the receiver, provided no such fees or costs shall be recovered until after payment for current electric, gas, telephone and water service and heating oil deliveries has been made. The owner, agent, lessor or manager shall be liable to the petitioner for reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by the petitioner, provided no such fees or costs shall be recovered until after payment for current electric, gas, telephone and water service and heating oil deliveries has been made and after payments of reasonable fees and costs to the receiver. Any moneys from rental payments or payments for use and occupancy or common expenses remaining after payment for current electric, gas, telephone and water service or heating oil deliveries, and after payment for reasonable costs and fees to the receiver, and after payment to the petitioner for reasonable attorney's fees and costs, shall be applied to any arrearage found by the court to be due and owing the company, electric supplier or municipal utility from the owner, agent, lessor or manager for service provided such building. Any moneys remaining thereafter shall be turned over to the owner, agent, lessor or manager. The court may order an accounting to be made at such times as it determines to be just, reasonable, and necessary.\n\n(b) Any receivership established pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be terminated by the court upon its finding that the arrearage which was the subject of the original petition has been satisfied, or that all occupants have agreed to assume liability in their own names for prospective service supplied by the petitioner, or that the building has been sold and the new owner has assumed liability for prospective service supplied by the petitioner.\n\n(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the petitioner from pursuing any other action or remedy at law or equity that it may have against the owner, agent, lessor or manager.\n\n(d) Any owner, agent, lessor or manager who collects or attempts to collect any rent or payment for use and occupancy from any occupant of a building subject to an order appointing a receiver shall be found, after due notice and hearing, to be in contempt of court.\n\n(e) If a proceeding is initiated pursuant to sections 47a-14a to 47a-14h, inclusive, or sections 47a-56 to 47a-56i, inclusive, or if a receiver of rents is appointed pursuant to chapter 735a or pursuant to any other action involving the making of repairs to residential rental property under court supervision, rent or use and occupancy payments shall be made pursuant to such proceeding or action without regard to whether such proceeding or action is initiated before or after a receivership is established under this section, and such proceeding or action shall take priority over a receivership established under this section in regard to expenditure of such rent or use and occupancy payments.\n\n(P.A. 75-625, S. 4, 8; P.A. 77-452, S. 51, 72; P.A. 84-394, S. 1; P.A. 89-254, S. 15; P.A. 91-310, S. 2; P.A. 98-28, S. 41, 117; 98-102, S. 1; P.A. 07-217, S. 62; 07-228, S. 2; P.A. 13-78, S. 10; P.A. 14-134, S. 103.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 77-452 replaced court of common pleas with superior court and deleted phrase which had limited judge's power to act to time when court not in session; P.A. 84-394 inserted references to payment for heating oil in Subsec.

The court or judge shall forthwith issue an order to show cause why a receiver should not be appointed, which shall be served upon the owner, agent, lessor or manager or his agent in a manner most reasonably calculated to give notice to such owner, agent, lessor or manager as determined by such court or judge, including, but not limited to, a posting of such order on the premises in question. If a petition or petitions are filed by a single petitioner regarding more than one building under the same ownership, the court shall, if practicable, appoint a common receiver for all such buildings and, if filed as separate actions, may consolidate such petitions and treat them as a single action.\n\n(2) A hearing shall be had on such order no later than seventy-two hours after its issuance or the first court day thereafter. The sole purpose of such a hearing shall be to determine whether there is an amount due and owing between the owner, agent, lessor or manager and the company or municipal utility. The court shall make a determination of any amount due and owing and any amount so determined shall constitute a lien upon the real property of such owner. A certificate of such amount may be recorded in the land records of the town in which such property is located describing the amount of the lien and the name of the party in default. When the amount due and owing has been paid, the company or municipality shall issue a certificate discharging the lien and shall file the certificate in the land records of the town in which such lien was recorded.\n\n(3) Not more than ten days after receipt of the order of appointment by the receiver, such receiver shall provide written notice to all occupants of the building or buildings, delivered separately to each dwelling unit, stating that the receiver has been authorized to collect all rents or payments for use and occupancy or common expenses, as defined in section 47-202, due from such occupant and that the owner, agency, lessor or manager, as the case may be, is prohibited from collecting such rents or payments for use and occupancy or common expenses. The notice shall include the address to which payments are to be made and a telephone number at which the receiver can be contacted. The notice shall be in plain and simple language and shall be written in English and in Spanish. A copy of the court order appointing the receiver and authorizing the collection of rents shall be attached to the notice.\n\n(4) The receiver appointed by the court shall collect all rents or payments for use and occupancy or common expenses forthcoming from the occupants of the building or buildings in question in place of the owner, agent, lessor or manager. The court may authorize the receiver to make reasonable repairs and provide reasonable maintenance to the premises, as determined by the court, the reasonable cost of which shall be added to the total amount due and owing from the owner, agency, lessor or manager. The receiver may also petition the court to obtain any remedy available under chapter 906 against such owner, agent, lessor or manager in order to recover amounts due as determined under subdivision (2) of this subsection and continuing charges for such water service until all such charges and other costs have been paid.\n\n(5) The receiver shall pay to the petitioner, other supplier or receiver, as is appropriate, from such rents or payments for use and occupancy or common expenses from such building or buildings, in the following priority: (A) For electric, gas, telephone, water or heating oil supplied on and after the date of his appointment and for the reasonable cost of repairs and maintenance made or provided pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection; (B) for such reasonable fees and costs determined by the court to be due the receiver; (C) for reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by the petitioner; and (D) for any arrearage found by the court to be due and owing the company or municipal utility from the owner, agent, lessor or manager for service provided such building or buildings. The owner, agent, lessor or manager shall be liable for all such costs. Any moneys remaining thereafter shall be turned over to the owner, agent, lessor or manager. The court may order an accounting to be made at such times as it determines to be just, reasonable and necessary.\n\n(b) Any receivership established pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, shall be terminated by the court upon its finding that the arrearage which was the subject of the original petition or petitions have been satisfied for all buildings subject to the receivership, or that all occupants of a building have agreed to assume liability in their own names for prospective service supplied by the petitioner, or that the building has been sold and the new owner has assumed liability for prospective service supplied by the petitioner.\n\n(c) On motion by the receiver, the court may authorize the receiver to institute a summary process action pursuant to chapter 832 against an occupant, upon a prima facie showing that: (1) The occupant has received notice in accordance with subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section; (2) the receiver has made reasonable efforts to supplement such notice with other written and oral notice; (3) after the occupant has received notice in accordance with subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section, payments equal to one month's rent or use and occupancy have not been made by or on behalf of the occupant during the most recent sixty consecutive days; and (4) the duty to make such payments has not been suspended as a result of the condition of the premises or any applicable preoccupancy certification requirements. In any such summary process action, the receiver shall be subject to all claims and defenses that the occupant could assert against the owner, agent, lessor or manager of the dwelling.\n\n(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the petitioner from pursuing any other action or remedy at law or equity that it may have against the owner, agent, lessor or manager.\n\n(e) Any owner, agent, lessor or manager who collects or attempts to collect any rent or payment for use and occupancy or common expenses, as defined in section 47-202, from any occupant of a building or buildings subject to an order appointing a receiver or who in any other way interferes with the receiver in the performance of his duties shall be found, after due notice and hearing, to be in contempt of court.\n\n(f) If a proceeding is initiated pursuant to sections 47a-14a to 47a-14h, inclusive, or sections 47a-56 to 47a-56i, inclusive, or if a receiver of rents is appointed pursuant to chapter 735a or pursuant to any other action involving the making of repairs to residential rental property under court supervision, rent or use and occupancy payments and common expenses, as defined in section 47-202, shall be made pursuant to such proceeding or action without regard to whether such proceeding or action is initiated before or after a receivership is established under this section, and such proceeding or action shall take priority over a receivership established under this section in regard to expenditure of such rent or use and occupancy payments.\n\n(P.A. 98-102, S. 2; P.A. 13-78, S. 11.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 13-78 amended Subsec.

The amount of the adjustment shall be reset to zero as of the effective date of new base rates approved pursuant to section 16-19. If, after any adjustments pursuant to section 16-262y are made, the company exceeds the allowable rate of return by more than one hundred basis points for the rolling twelve-month period ending with the two most recent consecutive financial quarters, the authority shall establish an earnings sharing mechanism that provides for any earnings that are more than one hundred basis points in excess of the allowed return on equity to be shared equally between ratepayers and shareholders.\n\n(j) On or before February twenty-eighth of each year, a water company shall submit to the authority an annual reconciliation report for any WICA charges applied to customers' rates through December thirty-first of the previous calendar year. Such reconciliation report shall identify those projects that have been completed, demonstrate that the WICA charges are limited to eligible projects that are in service and used and useful as of the end of the calendar year, and include any other information required as a result of the generic docket conducted pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. The company shall indicate in its report any significant changes in the extent of infrastructure spending, the priorities for determining eligible projects or the criteria established in the infrastructure assessment report. In addition, the reconciliation report shall compare the WICA revenues actually collected to the allowed amount of the adjustment. If upon completion of the review of the annual reconciliation report the authority determines that a water company overcollected or undercollected the WICA adjustment, the difference between the revenue and costs for eligible projects will be recovered or refunded, as appropriate, as a reconciliation adjustment over a one-year period commencing on April first. The company shall refund the customers with interest for any overcollection but shall not be eligible for interest for any undercollection.\n\n(P.A. 07-139, S. 2; P.A. 11-80, S. 1; P.A. 13-78, S. 7; P.A. 17-138, S. 2.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 07-139 effective June 19, 2007; pursuant to P.A. 11-80, “Department of Public Utility Control” and “department” were changed editorially by the Revisors to “Public Utilities Regulatory Authority” and “authority”, respectively, effective July 1, 2011; P.A. 13-78 amended Subsec.

Such company shall file with the authority an annual reconciliation of actual revenues to allowed revenues that shall include a report of the changes in water demands and any measures such company has taken to promote water conservation.\n\n(c) (1) On or after June 5, 2013, and before a water company with actual revenues at least one per cent less than allowed revenues files for its next general rate case pursuant to section 16-19, such company may request, and the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall initiate, a docket for a limited reopener to approve a revenue adjustment mechanism.\n\n(2) After approval of a revenue adjustment mechanism pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection, such mechanism shall be authorized by the authority annually thereafter until the later of the sixth year after either (A) the last general rate case, (B) the initial establishment of such mechanism by a company, or (C) the company's prior rate case is reopened and either (i) rate levels are reset by the authority, (ii) WICA surcharges are rolled into base rates, or (iii) other authorized changes in rates are made pursuant to a settlement agreement or other action by the authority. After such six-year period, the authority may authorize continuation of the revenue adjustment mechanism for up to an additional three-year period upon request by the company, pursuant to a filing with the authority at least ninety days before the revenue adjustment mechanism is due to be discontinued. The authority shall act on such request within such ninety-day period in an uncontested proceeding. Such company shall file with the authority an annual reconciliation of actual revenues to allowed revenues that shall include a report of the changes in water demands and any measures such company has taken to promote water conservation.

Such company shall file with the authority an annual reconciliation of actual revenues to allowed revenues that shall include a report of the changes in water demands and any measures such company has taken to promote water conservation.\n\n(e) A revenue adjustment mechanism approved pursuant to subsection (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall be implemented through a modification to the authorized rates or a rate surcharge or recorded as a deferral on the balance sheet for recovery in rates at the time of the next general rate case filed by a water company pursuant to section 16-19. Any under-recovery or over-recovery of the revenue adjustment or deferred amount of the previous year shall be included in the calculation of the subsequent annual adjustment or general rate case proceeding, whichever occurs first.\n\n(f) Concurrent with implementation of a revenue adjustment mechanism pursuant to subsection (b), (c) or (d) of this section, the authority shall establish an earnings sharing mechanism that provides for any earnings in excess of the allowed return on equity to be shared equally between ratepayers and shareholders.\n\n(P.A. 13-78, S. 3; P.A. 14-134, S. 17; P.A. 15-178, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 13-78 effective June 5, 2013; P.A. 14-134 amended Subsec.
