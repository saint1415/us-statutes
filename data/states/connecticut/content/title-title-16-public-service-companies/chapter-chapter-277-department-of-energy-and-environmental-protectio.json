      "text": "(a) The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority may, in its discretion, delegate its powers, in specific cases, to one or more of its directors or to a hearing officer to ascertain the facts and report thereon to the authority. The authority, or any director thereof, in the performance of its duties or in connection with any hearing, or at the request of any person, corporation, company, town, borough or association, may summon and examine, under oath, such witnesses, and may direct the production of, and examine or cause to be produced and examined, such books, records, vouchers, memoranda, documents, letters, contracts or other papers in relation to the affairs of any public service company or person involved in the transportation of gas, as such terms are defined in section 16-280a, as it may find advisable, and shall have the same powers in reference thereto as are vested in magistrates taking depositions. If any witness objects to testifying or to producing any book or paper on the ground that such testimony, book or paper may tend to incriminate him, and the authority directs such witness to testify or to produce such book or paper, and he complies, or if he is compelled so to do by order of court, he shall not be prosecuted for any matter concerning which he or she has so testified. The fees of witnesses summoned by the authority to appear before it under the provisions of this section, and the fees for summoning witnesses shall be the same as in the Superior Court. All such fees, together with any other expenses authorized by statute, the method of payment of which is not otherwise provided, shall, when taxed by the authority, be paid by the state, through the business office of the authority, in the same manner as court expenses. The authority may designate in specific cases a hearing officer who may be a member of its technical staff or a member of the Connecticut Bar engaged for that purpose under a contract approved by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management to hold a hearing and make report thereon to the authority. A hearing officer so designated shall have the same powers as the authority, or any director thereof, to conduct a hearing, except that only a director of the authority shall have the power to grant immunity from prosecution to any witness who objects to testifying or to producing any book or paper on the ground that such testimony, book or paper may tend to incriminate him or her.\n\n(b) (1) The authority may employ professional personnel to perform management audits. The authority shall promptly establish such procedures as it deems necessary or desirable to provide for management audits to be performed on a regular or irregular schedule on all or any portion of the operating procedures and any other internal workings of any public service company or person involved in the transportation of gas, as such terms are defined in section 16-280a, including the relationship between any public service company or person involved in the transportation of gas, as such terms are defined in section 16-280a, and a related holding company or subsidiary, consistent with the provisions of section 16-8c, provided no such audit shall be performed on a community antenna television company, except with regard to any noncable communications services which the company may provide, or when (A) such an audit is necessary for the authority to perform its regulatory functions under the Communications Act of 1934, 47 USC 151, et seq., as amended from time to time, other federal law or state law, (B) the cost of such an audit is warranted by a reasonably foreseeable financial, safety or service benefit to subscribers of the company which is the subject of such an audit, and (C) such an audit is restricted to examination of the operating procedures that affect operations within the state.\n\n(2) In any case where the authority determines that an audit is necessary or desirable, it may (A) order the audit to be performed by one of the management audit teams, (B) require the affected company or person to perform the audit utilizing the company's own internal management audit staff as supervised by designated members of the authority's staff or the person's own internal management audit staff as supervised by designated members of the authority's staff, or (C) require that the audit be performed under the supervision of designated members of the authority's staff by an independent management consulting firm selected by the authority, in consultation with the affected company or person. If the affected company or person has more than seventy-five thousand customers, such independent management consulting firm shall be of nationally recognized stature. All reasonable and proper expenses of the audits, including, but not limited to, the costs associated with the audit firm's testimony at a public hearing or other proceeding, shall be borne by the affected companies or persons and shall be paid by such companies or persons at such times and in such manner as the authority directs.\n\n(3) For purposes of this section, a complete audit shall consist of (A) a diagnostic review of all functions of the audited company or person, which shall include, but not be limited to, documentation of the operations of the company or person, assessment of the company's system of internal controls or assessment of the person's system of internal controls, and identification of any areas of the company or person which may require subsequent audits, and (B) the performance of subsequent focused audits identified in the diagnostic review and determined necessary by the authority. All audits performed pursuant to this section shall be performed in accordance with generally accepted management audit standards. The authority shall adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 setting forth such generally accepted management audit standards. Each audit of a community antenna television company shall be consistent with the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 USC 151, et seq., as amended from time to time, and of any other applicable federal law. The authority shall certify whether a portion of an audit conforms to the provisions of this section and constitutes a portion of a complete audit.\n\n(4) A complete audit of each portion of each gas company, electric distribution company or water company having more than seventy-five thousand customers shall begin no less frequently than every six years, so that a complete audit of such a company's operations shall be performed every six years. Such an audit of each such company having more than seventy-five thousand customers shall be updated as required by the authority.\n\n(5) The results of an audit performed pursuant to this section shall be filed with the authority and shall be open to public inspection. Upon completion and review of the audit, if the person or firm performing or supervising the audit determines that any of the operating procedures or any other internal workings of the affected public service company or person involved in the transportation of gas, as such terms are defined in section 16-280a, are inefficient, improvident, unreasonable, negligent or in abuse of discretion, the authority may, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, order the affected public service company or person involved in the transportation of gas, as such terms are defined in section 16-280a, to adopt such new or altered practices and procedures as the authority shall find necessary to promote efficient and adequate service to meet the public convenience and necessity. The authority shall annually submit a report of audits performed pursuant to this section to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to public utilities which report shall include the status of audits begun but not yet completed and a summary of the results of audits completed. Any such report may be submitted electronically.\n\n(6) All prudent, reasonable and proper costs and expenses, as determined by the authority, of complying with any order of the authority pursuant to this subsection shall be recognized by the authority for all purposes as proper business expenses of the affected company or person. Any costs or expenses, as determined by the authority, incurred by the company or person to address or remediate an inefficient, improvident, unreasonable, negligent or imprudent management or company practice identified in the course of the management audit shall not constitute prudent, reasonable and proper costs and expenses.\n\n(7) After notice and hearing, the authority may modify the scope and schedule of a management audit of a telephone company which is subject to an alternative form of regulation so that such audit is consistent with that alternative form of regulation.\n\n(c) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to interfere or conflict with any powers of the authority or its staff provided elsewhere in the general statutes, including, but not limited to, the provisions of this section and sections 16-7, 16-28 and 16-32, to conduct an audit, investigation or review of the books, records, plants and equipment of any regulated public service company or person involved in the transportation of gas, as such terms are defined in section 16-280a.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 5398; P.A. 73-355, S. 2; P.A. 75-486, S. 6, 69; P.A. 77-614, S. 19, 162, 587, 610; P.A. 78-303, S. 85, 136; P.A. 80-168; 80-482, S. 4, 40, 45, 345, 348; P.A. 81-348, S. 1; P.A. 82-472, S. 50, 183; P.A. 85-509, S. 2, 11; 85-552, S. 4, 8; P.A. 90-221, S. 2, 15; P.A. 94-229, S. 1; P.A. 97-23; P.A. 98-28, S. 83, 117; June Sp.

(b) added provision that the affected companies shall pay all reasonable and proper costs of an audit, including the costs of the audit firm's testimony at a public hearing and a provision that such costs shall be paid as directed by the department; P.A. 94-229 amended Subsec.

In making such determination, the authority may conduct such further investigation as it deems necessary and may consider whether such rates, if excessive, are the result of such factors as the overall size, stability and financial condition of such company, the organization, including technical and managerial expertise and efficiency, of such company and the physical condition and capacity of such company's plant. If the authority finds that such company is unable or unwilling to provide service at a reasonable cost to its customers, as determined by the authority, it may (1) make such order as may be necessary to provide such service, or (2) revoke the franchise held by such company. The authority shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to implement the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(c) If any such franchise is revoked, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, when the General Assembly is not in session, may grant a franchise to any person, firm or corporation, incorporated under the general statutes or any special act, qualified and prepared to provide such services within a reasonable time, as determined by said authority provided the authority first finds there is an immediate need for such a franchise after a public hearing in the area to be served thereunder. Such hearing shall be advertised at least twice prior thereto in a newspaper having a general circulation in each town of the area to be serviced by such franchise, once at least three days before said hearing, once at least fifteen days before said hearing, both advertisements to be at least ten days apart. Such franchise shall carry the same authority and powers and shall be subject to the same conditions and restrictions, if any, as the original franchise.\n\n(1969, P.A. 789, S. 1; P.A. 73-353; P.A. 75-486, S. 7, 69; P.A. 77-614, S. 162, 610; P.A. 80-482, S. 48, 348; P.A. 81-472, S. 24, 159; P.A. 85-246, S. 9; P.A. 87-96; P.A. 89-261, S. 1; P.A. 94-219, S. 2; P.A. 11-80, S. 1; P.A. 14-134, S. 3.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 73-353 added provisions re revocation of franchise upon failure to provide or discontinuance of service in Subsec.

For water companies, existing rates shall include the amount of any adjustments approved pursuant to section 16-262w since the company's most recent general rate case, provided any adjustment amount shall be separately identified in any customer bill. Each public service company shall file any proposed amendment of its existing rates with the authority in such form and in accordance with such reasonable regulations as the authority may prescribe. Each electric distribution, gas or telephone company filing a proposed amendment shall also file with the authority an estimate of the effects of the amendment, for various levels of consumption, on the household budgets of high and moderate income customers and customers having household incomes not more than one hundred fifty per cent of the federal poverty level. Each electric distribution company shall also file such an estimate for space heating customers. Each water company, except a water company that provides water to its customers less than six consecutive months in a calendar year, filing a proposed amendment, shall also file with the authority a plan for promoting water conservation by customers in such form and in accordance with a memorandum of understanding entered into by the authority pursuant to section 4-67e. Each public service company shall notify each customer who would be affected by the proposed amendment, by mail, at least one week prior to the first public hearing thereon, but not earlier than six weeks prior to such first public hearing, that an amendment has been or will be requested. Such notice shall also indicate (1) the date, time and location of any scheduled public hearing, (2) a statement that customers may provide written comments regarding the proposed amendment to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority or appear in person at any scheduled public hearing, (3) the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority telephone number for obtaining information concerning the schedule for public hearings on the proposed amendment, and (4) whether the proposed amendment would, in the company's best estimate, increase any rate or charge by five per cent or more, and, if so, describe in general terms any such rate or charge and the amount of the proposed increase. If a company fails to provide adequate notice, the authority shall consider the effective filing date of such company's proposed amendment to be the date that the company provides adequate notice to customers, as determined by the authority. Until the effective filing date, no days shall count toward the time limit for a final decision in this subsection. In the case of a proposed amendment to the rates of any public service company, the authority shall hold one or more public hearings thereon, except as permitted with respect to interim rate amendments by subsections (d) and (g) of this section, and shall make such investigation of such proposed amendment of rates as is necessary to determine whether such rates conform to the principles and guidelines set forth in section 16-19e, or are unreasonably discriminatory or more or less than just, reasonable and adequate, or that the service furnished by such company is inadequate to or in excess of public necessity and convenience, provided the authority may (A) evaluate the reasonableness and adequacy of the performance or service of the public service company using any applicable metrics or standards adopted by the authority pursuant to section 16-244aa, and (B) determine the reasonableness of the allowed rate of return of the public service company based on such performance evaluation. The authority, if in its opinion such action appears necessary or suitable in the public interest may, and, upon written petition or complaint of the state, under direction of the Governor, shall, make the aforesaid investigation of any such proposed amendment which does not involve an alteration in rates. If the authority finds any proposed amendment of rates to not conform to the principles and guidelines set forth in section 16-19e, or to be unreasonably discriminatory or more or less than just, reasonable and adequate to enable such company to provide properly for the public convenience, necessity and welfare, or the service to be inadequate or excessive, it shall determine and prescribe, as appropriate, an adequate service to be furnished or just and reasonable maximum rates and charges to be made by such company. In the case of a proposed amendment filed by an electric distribution, gas or telephone company, the authority shall also adjust the estimate filed under this subsection of the effects of the amendment on the household budgets of the company's customers, in accordance with the rates and charges approved by the authority. The authority shall issue a final decision on each electric distribution or gas company rate filing not later than three hundred fifty days after the effective filing date of the proposed amendment. The authority shall issue a final decision on all public service company rate filings, except electric distribution or gas company rate filings, not later than two hundred seventy days after the effective filing date of the proposed amendment.\n\n(b) If the authority has not made its finding respecting an amendment of any electric distribution or gas company rate within three hundred fifty days from the proposed effective date of such amendment thereof, or if the authority has not made its finding respecting an amendment of any public service company rate, except an electric distribution or a gas company rate, within two hundred seventy days from the proposed effective date of such amendment thereof, such amendment may become effective pending the authority's finding with respect to such amendment upon the filing by the company with the authority of assurance satisfactory to the authority, which may include a bond with surety, of the company's ability and willingness to refund to its customers with interest such amounts as the company may collect from them in excess of the rates fixed by the authority in its finding or fixed at the conclusion of any appeal taken as a result of a finding by the authority.\n\n(c) Upon conclusion of its investigation of the reasonableness of any proposed increase of rates, the authority shall order the company to refund to its customers with interest any amounts the company may have collected from them during the period that any amendment permitted by subsection (b) of this section was in force, which amounts the authority may find to have been in excess of the rates fixed by the authority in its finding or fixed at the conclusion of any appeal taken as a result of a finding by the authority. Any such refund ordered by the authority shall be paid by the company, under direction of the authority, to its customers in such amounts as are determined by the authority.\n\n(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the authority from approving an interim rate increase, if the authority finds that such an interim rate increase is necessary to prevent substantial and material deterioration of the financial condition of a public service company, to prevent substantial deterioration of the adequacy and reliability of service to its customers or to conform to the applicable principles and guidelines set forth in section 16-19e, provided the authority shall first hold a special public hearing on the need for such interim rate increase and the company, at least one week prior to such hearing, notifies each customer who would be affected by the interim rate increase that such an increase is being requested. The company shall include the notice in a mailing of customer bills, unless such a mailing would not provide timely notice, in which case the authority shall authorize an alternative manner of providing such notice. Any such interim rate increase shall only be permitted if the public service company submits an assurance satisfactory to the authority, which may include a bond with surety, of the company's ability and willingness to refund to its customers with interest such amounts as the company may collect from such interim rates in excess of the rates approved by the authority in accordance with subsection (a) of this section. The authority shall order a refund in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the amount collected pursuant to the interim rates over the amount which would have been collected pursuant to the rates finally approved by the authority in accordance with subsection (a) of this section or fixed at the conclusion of any appeal taken as a result of any finding by the authority. Such refund ordered by the authority shall be paid by the company to its customers in such amounts and by such procedure as ordered by the authority.\n\n(e) If the authority finds that the imposition of any increase in rates would create a hardship for a municipality, because such increase is not reflected in its then current budget, or cannot be included in the budget of its fiscal year which begins less than five months after the effective date of such increase, the authority may defer the applicability of such increase with respect to services furnished to such municipality until the fiscal year of such municipality beginning not less than five months following the effective date of such increase; provided the revenues lost to the public service company through such deferral shall be paid to the public service company by the municipality in its first fiscal year following the period of such deferral.\n\n(f) Any public service company, as defined in section 16-1, filing an application with the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority to reopen a rate proceeding under this section, which application proposes to increase the company's revenues or any rate or charge of the company by five per cent or more, shall, not later than one week prior to the hearing under the reopened proceeding, notify each customer who would be affected thereby that such an application is being filed. Such notice shall indicate the rate increases proposed in the application. The company shall include the notice in a mailing of customer bills, unless such a mailing would not provide timely notice to customers of the reopening of the proceeding, in which case the authority shall authorize an alternative manner of providing such notice. The authority shall only grant an application by a public service company to reopen a rate proceeding under this section upon a unanimous vote of the utility commissioners.\n\n(g) The authority shall hold either a special public hearing or combine an investigation with an ongoing four-year review conducted in accordance with section 16-19a or with a general rate hearing conducted in accordance with subsection (a) of this section on the need for an interim rate decrease (1) when a public service company has, for the rolling twelve-month period ending with the two most recent consecutive financial quarters, earned a return on equity which exceeds the return authorized by the authority by at least one-half of one percentage point, (2) if it finds that any change in municipal, state or federal tax law creates a significant increase in a company's rate of return, or (3) if it provides appropriate notice that a public service company may be collecting rates or may have an authorized rate of return which is or are more than just, reasonable and adequate, as determined by the authority, provided the authority shall require appropriate notice of hearing to the company and its customers who would be affected by an interim rate decrease in such form as the authority deems reasonable. The company shall be required to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the authority that earning such a return on equity, having an authorized rate of return or collecting rates which are more than just, reasonable and adequate is directly beneficial to its customers. At the completion of the proceeding, the authority may order an interim rate decrease if it finds that such return on equity or rates exceeds a reasonable rate of return or is more than just, reasonable and adequate as determined by the authority. Any such interim rate decrease shall be subject to a customer surcharge if the interim rates collected by the company are less than the rates finally approved by the authority or fixed at the conclusion of any appeal taken as a result of any finding by the authority. Such surcharge shall be assessed against customers in such amounts and by such procedure as ordered by the authority.\n\n(h) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the regulation of a telecommunications service which is a competitive service, as defined in section 16-247a, or to a telecommunications service to which an approved plan for an alternative form of regulation applies, pursuant to section 16-247k.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 5409; 1969, P.A. 217; 1972, P.A. 192, S. 1; P.A. 74-216, S. 2, 8; P.A. 75-486, S. 8, 69; P.A. 77-121; 77-614, S. 162, 587, 610; P.A. 78-303, S. 85, 136; P.A. 80-482, S. 55, 348; P.A. 83-190, S. 1–3; P.A. 84-113, S. 1, 2, 4; 84-342, S. 9, 13; 84-546, S. 49, 173; P.A. 85-33, S. 1; P.A. 87-202, S. 1; 87-331, S. 1, 4; P.A. 89-327, S. 5, 7; P.A. 94-83, S. 12, 16; 94-242, S. 2, 9; P.A. 98-28, S. 89, 117; P.A. 00-17, S. 1; P.A. 01-49, S. 4; P.A. 11-61, S. 6; 11-80, S. 1; P.A. 13-119, S. 4; P.A. 14-134, S. 50; P.A. 17-138, S. 1; Sept.

In making such determination, the authority shall consider the gross and net earnings of such company since its last previous general rate hearing, its retained earnings, its actual and proposed capital expenditures, its advertising expenses, the dividends paid to its stockholders, the rate of return paid on its preferred stock, bonds, debentures and other obligations, its credit rating, and such other financial and operating information as the authority may deem pertinent.\n\n(2) The authority may conduct a general rate hearing in accordance with subsection (a) of section 16-19, in lieu of the periodic review and investigation proceedings required under subdivision (1) of this subsection.

      "text": "(a) No adjustment clause of any kind whatsoever shall be authorized by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority if such a clause operates automatically to permit charges, assessments or amendments to existing rate schedules to be made which have not been first approved by the authority.\n\n(b) If the authority finds that the changed price of purchased gas required for distribution by a gas company substantially threatens the ability of the company to earn a reasonable rate of return, or will cause the company to have an excessive rate of return, the authority shall, after investigation and public hearing, approve a suitable purchased gas adjustment clause to be superimposed upon the existing rate schedule of the company. The authority shall design any such purchased gas adjustment clause to allow the gas company to charge or to reimburse the consumer only for the changes in the cost of purchased gas which occur when the actual price of purchased gas differs from the price reflected in the base rates of the company. The authority may establish an efficiency factor in the purchased gas adjustment clause of each gas company, which may provide for less than one hundred per cent recovery of the gross earnings tax imposed by section 12-264 on the revenues from such purchased gas. A purchased gas adjustment clause approved pursuant to this section shall apply to all gas companies similarly affected by the costs which form the basis for the adjustment clause.\n\n(c) If the authority, after notice and hearing, determines that the adoption of an energy adjustment clause would protect the interests of ratepayers of an electric distribution company, ensure economy and efficiency in energy production and purchase by the electric distribution company and achieve the objectives set forth in subsection (a) of section 16-19 and in section 16-19e better than would the continued operation of a fuel adjustment clause and a generation utilization adjustment clause, the authority shall approve an energy adjustment clause to be superimposed upon the existing rate schedule of the electric distribution company. The authority shall design any such energy adjustment clause to reflect cost-efficient energy resource procurement and to recover the costs of energy that are proper for rate-making purposes and for which the authority has not authorized recovery through base rates. These costs, reflecting prudent and efficient management and operations, may include, but are not limited to, the costs of oil, gas, coal, nuclear fuel, wood or other fuels, and energy transactions with other utilities, nonutility generators or power pools, all or part of the cost of conservation and load management, and the gross earnings tax imposed by section 12-264 on the revenues from the energy sources subject to the energy adjustment clause. The authority shall design the energy adjustment clause to provide for recovery of energy costs prudently incurred by an electric distribution company in accordance with section 16-19e. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 16-19, the authority shall change an energy adjustment clause in accordance with the provisions of subsections (e) and (h) of this section. An energy adjustment clause approved pursuant to this section shall apply to all electric distribution companies similarly affected by the costs which form the basis for the adjustment clause.\n\n(d) The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall adjust the retail rate charged by each electric distribution company for electric transmission services periodically to recover all transmission costs prudently incurred by each electric distribution company. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, after notice and hearing, shall design the retail transmission rate to provide for recovery of all Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved transmission costs, rates, tariffs and charges and of other transmission costs prudently incurred by an electric distribution company in accordance with section 16-19e. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 16-19, the authority shall adjust the retail transmission rate in accordance with the provisions of subsections (e) and (h) of this section. A transmission rate adjustment clause approved pursuant to this section shall apply to all electric distribution companies similarly affected by transmission costs. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority's authority to review the prudence of costs shall not apply to any matter over which any agency, department or instrumentality of the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction, or has jurisdiction concurrent with that of the state and has exercised such jurisdiction to the exclusion of regulation of such matter by the state.\n\n(e) No proposed purchased gas adjustment, energy adjustment charge or credit or transmission rate shall become effective until the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority has approved such charges or credits. The authority may hold a hearing on such charges, provided the authority shall hold a hearing on such charges at the request of the electric distribution or gas company, interested persons or members of the public. Any such hearing shall be open to the public and, if held, shall be convened within ten days of the filing of an application by an electric distribution or gas company. Notice of such application and any hearing shall be published at least five days prior to such hearing, which may include publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the area served by such company. The authority shall receive and consider comments of interested persons and members of the public at such a hearing, which shall not be considered a contested case for purposes of title 4, this title or any regulation adopted thereunder. Any approval or denial of the authority pursuant to this subsection shall not be deemed an order, authorization or decision of the authority for purposes of section 16-35. After notice and hearing, the authority shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, which shall include the requirements of the filing to support the requested charge or credit. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, in the event that the authority has not rendered an approval or denial concerning any such application within fifteen days of the day the authority received the application, the proposed charges or credits (1) shall become effective at the option of the company pending the authority's finding with respect to such charges, or (2) in the discretion of the authority, may become effective upon the filing by the company with the authority of an assurance. Such assurance may include a bond with surety, and shall satisfy the authority of the company's ability and willingness to refund to its customers any such amounts as the company may collect from them in excess of the charges approved by the authority in its finding.\n\n(f) Each company subject to a purchased gas adjustment clause or an energy adjustment clause shall disclose in its customer bills the per unit rate of the charges or credits made under the clause and the actual amount thereof in dollars and cents.\n\n(g) The authority shall not suspend or discontinue a purchased gas adjustment clause or an energy adjustment clause which it has approved except (1) after general rate hearings for the companies affected by the clause, and (2) upon a finding by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority that the market prices of purchased gas or the costs of energy have stabilized and are likely to remain stable.\n\n(h) The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall continually monitor and oversee the application of the purchased gas adjustment clause, the energy adjustment clause, and the transmission rate adjustment clause. The authority shall hold a public hearing thereon whenever the authority deems it necessary or upon application of the Office of Consumer Counsel, but no less frequently than annually, and undertake such other proceeding thereon to determine whether charges or credits made under such clauses reflect the actual prices paid for purchased gas or energy and the actual transmission costs and are computed in accordance with the applicable clause. If the authority finds that such charges or credits do not reflect the actual prices paid for purchased gas or energy, and the actual transmission costs or are not computed in accordance with the applicable clause, it shall recompute such charges or credits and shall direct the company to take such action as may be required to insure that such charges or credits properly reflect the actual prices paid for purchased gas or energy and the actual transmission costs and are computed in accordance with the applicable clause for the applicable period.\n\n(i) The authority shall establish procedures conforming to the requirements of this section after notice and opportunity for a public hearing.\n\n(j) Any purchased gas adjustment clause or energy adjustment clause approved by the authority may include a provision designed to allow the electric distribution or gas company to charge or reimburse the customer for any under-recovery or over-recovery of overhead and fixed costs due solely to the deviation of actual retail sales of electricity or gas from projected retail sales of electricity or gas. The authority shall include such provision in any energy adjustment clause approved for an electric distribution company if it determines (1) that a significant cause of excess earnings by the electric distribution company is an increase in actual retail sales of electricity over projected retail sales of electricity as determined at the time of the electric distribution company's most recent rate amendment, and (2) that such provision is likely to benefit the customers of the electric distribution company.\n\n(k) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, upon the application of any gas company, the authority may modify, suspend or discontinue a purchased gas adjustment clause for one or more gas companies if the authority determines that as part of an overall performance-based rate plan, such modification, suspension or discontinuance will ensure safety and reliability, will provide substantial financial benefits to ratepayers at least equal to those provided to the gas company and will lower the rates below what they would be without such modification, suspension or discontinuance, as determined by the authority.\n\n(P.A. 74-216, S. 4, 8; P.A. 75-486, S. 10, 69; P.A. 77-614, S. 162, 610; P.A. 78-370; P.A. 80-482, S. 57, 348; P.A. 82-150, S. 4; P.A. 83-97; P.A. 84-105; P.A. 85-233, S. 1, 2; P.A. 87-331, S. 2, 4; P.A. 90-221, S. 3, 15; P.A. 95-43, S. 1, 2; P.A. 00-221, S. 2; P.A. 05-210, S. 30; P.A. 06-196, S. 229; P.A. 11-80, S. 1; P.A. 13-119, S. 5; P.A. 14-134, S. 52–54; P.A. 17-35, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 75-486 replaced public utilities commission with public utilities control authority and essentially rewrote provisions, expanding and clarifying them greatly; P.A. 77-614 replaced authority with division of public utility control within the department of business regulation, effective January 1, 1979; P.A. 78-370 amended Subsec.

The authority shall determine whether existing or future rate structures place an undue burden upon those persons of poverty status and shall make such adjustment in the rate structure as is necessary or desirable to take account of their indigency. The authority shall require the utilization of such new principles and structures to the extent that the authority determines that their implementation is in the public interest, as identified by the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection in the Integrated Resources Plan and the Comprehensive Energy Strategy, and necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this provision without being unfair or discriminatory or unduly burdensome or disruptive to any group or class of customers, and determines that such principles and structures are capable of yielding required revenues. In reviewing the rates and rate structures of electric and gas companies, the authority shall be guided by the goals of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, as described in section 22a-2d, the Comprehensive Energy Strategy, the Integrated Resources Plan and the Conservation and Load Management Plan. The authority shall issue its initial findings on such investigation by December 1, 1976, and its final findings and order by June 1, 1977; provided that after such final findings and order are issued, the authority shall at least once every two years undertake such further investigations as it deems appropriate with respect to new developments or desirable modifications in pricing principles and rate structures and, after holding at least one public hearing thereon, shall issue its findings and order thereon.\n\n(c) The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection shall coordinate and integrate its actions, decisions and policies pertaining to gas and electric distribution companies, so far as possible, with the actions, decisions and policies of other agencies and instrumentalities in order to further the development and optimum use of the state's energy resources and conform to the greatest practicable extent with the state energy policy as stated in section 16a-35k, the Comprehensive Energy Strategy and the Integrated Resources Plan taking into account prudent management of the natural environment and continued promotion of economic development within the state. The department shall defer, as appropriate, to any actions taken by other agencies and instrumentalities on matters within their respective jurisdictions.\n\n(d) The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection, the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development, and the Connecticut Siting Council may be made parties to each proceeding on a rate amendment proposed by a gas or electric distribution company and shall participate in such proceedings to the extent necessary.\n\n(e) The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, in a proceeding on a rate amendment proposed by an electric distribution company based upon an alleged need for increased revenues to finance an expansion of the capacity of its electric distribution system, shall determine whether demand-side management would be more cost-effective in meeting any demand for electricity for which the increase in capacity is proposed.\n\n(f) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the regulation of a telecommunications service which is a competitive service, as defined in section 16-247a, or to a telecommunications service to which an approved plan for an alternative form of regulation applies, pursuant to section 16-247k.\n\n(g) The authority may, upon application of any gas or electric public service company, which has, as part of its existing rate plan, an earnings sharing mechanism, modify such rate plan to allow the gas or electric public service company, after a hearing that is conducted as a contested case, in accordance with chapter 54, to include in its rates the reasonable costs of security of assets, facilities, and equipment, both existing and foreseeable, that are incurred solely for the purpose of responding to security needs associated with the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the continuing war on terrorism.\n\n(P.A. 75-486, S. 5, 69; P.A. 77-614, S. 19, 162, 284, 587, 610; P.A. 78-303, S. 85, 136; P.A. 79-449, S. 4, 7; P.A. 80-482, S. 59, 348; P.A. 81-439, S. 7, 14; P.A. 86-187, S. 5, 10; P.A. 87-202, S. 2; P.A. 94-83, S. 13, 16; P.A. 95-250, S. 1; P.A. 96-211, S. 1, 5, 6; P.A. 98-28, S. 52, 117; P.A. 02-94, S. 1, 2; P.A. 07-242, S. 7; P.A. 11-80, S. 1, 27; P.A. 13-298, S. 10; P.A. 14-134, S. 57.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 77-614 and P.A. 78-303 replaced “Connecticut energy agency”, i.e. department of planning and energy policy, with office of policy and management and, effective January 1, 1979, replaced public utilities control authority with division of public utility control within the department of business regulation and commissioner of commerce with commissioner of economic development; P.A. 79-449 required conformity “to the greatest practicable extent with the state energy policy” in Subsec.

The authority shall investigate and, not more than sixty days after receipt of a petition, (1) if appropriate, issue an order prescribing the service to be furnished by the company, the conditions under which and maximum rates or charges at which the service shall be furnished, or (2) order that a hearing be held on the matter or that the matter be set for alternative dispute resolution. If at any time during such sixty-day period, any party in interest requests a hearing, the authority shall, after notice to all parties and not more than ninety days after receiving the request, hold a hearing and, if appropriate, issue an order prescribing the service to be furnished by the company and the conditions under which and maximum rates or charges at which the service shall be furnished.\n\n(c) The authority, on its own initiative, or upon request by the Commissioner of Public Health, may initiate an investigation to determine whether the rates of a small community water system are inadequate for such water system to maintain economic viability and provide adequate service to its customers. As used in this subsection, “small community water system” means a water system that is not required to submit a water supply plan under section 25-32d. The authority shall, not more than one hundred fifty days after the commencement of such investigation, if appropriate, issue an order prescribing the appropriate service to be furnished by the water system and the appropriate rates or charges that are necessary to furnish such service. Prior to the issuance of any such order raising rates or charges of such water system's customers, the authority, in consultation with the Office of Consumer Counsel and the Attorney General, shall consider the financial impact that any such rate increase may have on such water system's ratepayers. If such rate increase is one hundred per cent or more, such increase shall be phased in over the course of a two-year period. If at any time during such investigation any party in interest requests a hearing, the authority shall, after notice to all parties and not more than thirty days after receiving the request, hold a hearing and, if appropriate, issue an order prescribing the service to be furnished by the small community water system and the appropriate rates or charges at which the service shall be furnished.

Any such disposition of an essential part of such other real property of a public service company shall be by public auction or other procedure for public sale, provided such auction or public sale shall be conducted upon notice of auction or sale published at least once each week for two weeks preceding the date of such auction or sale in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the county in which such property is located. The public service company shall submit evidence to the authority of the notice given. On a showing of good cause by such company to use a means of disposal other than by public auction or other procedure for public sale, the authority may, on a finding of such good cause, authorize the use of an alternative sales process. No public auction or other procedure for public sale shall be required for the sale or other disposition of real property by a water company to the state, a municipality or land conservation organization if at least seventy per cent of the area of the real property sold or disposed of is to be used for open space or recreational purposes, as defined in subsection (f) of section 16-50d, and if the consideration received for such sale or disposition is not less than the appraised value of such property. A public service company other than a water company may sell, lease, assign, mortgage or otherwise dispose of improved real property with an appraised value of two hundred fifty thousand dollars or less or unimproved real property with an appraised value of fifty thousand dollars or less without such approval. The authority shall follow the procedures in section 16-50c for transactions involving unimproved land owned by a public service company other than a water company. A water company supplying water to more than five hundred consumers may sell, lease, assign, mortgage, or otherwise dispose of real property, other than public watershed or water supply lands, with an appraised value of fifty thousand dollars or less without such approval. The authority shall not accept an application to sell watershed or water supply lands until the Commissioner of Public Health issues a permit pursuant to section 25-32. The condemnation by a state department, institution or agency of any land owned by a public service company shall be subject to the provisions of this subsection. On February 1, 1996, and annually thereafter, each public service company shall submit a report to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority of all real property sold, leased, assigned, mortgaged, or otherwise disposed of without the approval of said authority during the previous calendar year. Such report shall include for each transaction involving such property, without limitation, the appraised value of the real property, the actual value of the transaction and the accounting journal entry which recorded the transaction.\n\n(b) A public service company shall obtain the approval of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority to (1) issue any notes, bonds or other evidences of indebtedness or securities of any nature, (2) lend or borrow any moneys for a period of more than one year for any purpose other than paying the expenses, including taxes, of conducting its business or for the payment of dividends, or (3) amend any provision of an indenture or similar financial instrument if such amendment would affect the issuance or terms of any such notes, bonds or other evidences of indebtedness or securities. The authority shall approve or disapprove each such issue or amendment within sixty days after the filing of a written application for such approval unless the applicant agrees to an extension of time. If not disapproved within said sixty days or within such extension, such issue shall be deemed to be approved. The authority shall not require a company to issue its common stock under terms or conditions not required by the general statutes. The provisions of this subsection shall apply to a community antenna television company only with regard to any noncable communications services which the company may provide.\n\n(c) Any managerial service contract made by a public service company shall be voidable on order of the authority, but may be enforced as between the parties unless disapproved.\n\n(d) Any water company selling land that at any time has been in the water company's rate base shall use the net proceeds from the sale of such land for capital projects which improve or protect the water supply system or for the acquisition of a water supply source or land to protect a water supply source. In the case of a water company required to file a water supply plan pursuant to section 25-32d, the capital projects or acquisition shall be consistent with such plan.\n\n(e) For the purposes of rate making, the authority shall use an accounting method for allocating the economic benefits of sales of land by a water company, as defined in section 16-1, that at any time has been in the water company's rate base that equitably allocates all of the economic benefits of any such sale between the ratepayers and the shareholders of the company based on the facts of each application for sale, except as follows:\n\n(1) For any sale of land where the property is not more than ten acres and has not been taxed under the provisions of sections 12-107c to 12-107e, inclusive, during the previous ten years, the authority shall equitably allocate all of the economic benefits of any such sale between the ratepayers and the shareholders of the company. Any such allocation shall be based on the facts of each application for sale and the authority may allocate all of the economic benefits of any such sale to either the ratepayers or the shareholders.\n\n(2) For a sale of class I or class II land to another water company for water supply purposes or to the state, a municipality, or a land conservation organization, which land has a permanent conservation easement in accordance with section 25-32, the authority shall equitably allocate, in a contested case proceeding, all of the economic benefits of any such sale between the ratepayers and the shareholders of the company.\n\n(3) For the sale of land for an educational use, as defined in section 16-43b, the authority shall allocate the economic benefits of any such sale in accordance with past practices for nonopen space transactions pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(4) For the sale of class III land where the property is more than ten acres and promotes a perpetual public interest in the use of land for open space or recreation purposes, as defined in section 16-43b, the authority shall allocate the benefits in accordance with the following:\n\n(A) If twenty-five per cent of the land or less is to be used for open space or recreational purposes, the authority shall allocate one hundred per cent of the benefits to the ratepayers;\n\n(B) If more than twenty-five per cent but less than eighty per cent of the land is to be used for open space or recreational purposes, the authority shall calculate the benefit allocated to a water company's shareholders by multiplying by a factor of eighty per cent of the portion of class III land in the transaction that is reserved for open space;\n\n(C) If eighty per cent or more but less than ninety per cent of the area of such land is to be used for open space or recreational purposes, the authority shall allocate the benefits of such sale in favor of a water company's shareholders in an amount that is proportionate to the percentage of class III land in such sale that is to be used for open space or recreational purposes;\n\n(D) If not less than ninety per cent of the area of such land is to be used for open space or recreational purposes, the authority shall allocate one hundred per cent of the benefits to the shareholders.\n\n(f) For the sale of class III land by a water company that at any time has been in the water company's rate base and that is to be used for open space or recreational purposes, the water company shall file with the authority a certified copy of a conservation easement that is recorded on the land records for the portion of class III land preserved as open space. Such conservation easement shall state that the land subject to such easement shall be permanently dedicated for land uses such as public parks or forests or natural areas, including, but not limited to, reservoirs and water company land. Such land shall be preserved predominantly in its natural scenic and open space condition that may allow for camping, hiking, forestry, fishing, wildlife or natural resource conservation, which easement shall prohibit all other building or development except as may be required for source protection and to meet water quality standards, if used as a public water supply.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 5433; 1969, P.A. 644, S. 3; P.A. 74-303, S. 2; P.A. 75-486, S. 1, 69; P.A. 77-614, S. 162, 323, 610; P.A. 80-156; 80-482, S. 75, 348; P.A. 82-252, S. 3; P.A. 85-509, S. 5, 11; P.A. 88-354, S. 3, 11; P.A. 89-301, S. 6; P.A. 90-221, S. 10; P.A. 93-381, S. 9, 39; P.A. 95-48, S. 1; 95-211, S. 4; 95-257, S. 12, 21, 58; P.A. 98-157, S. 9, 15; P.A. 01-49, S. 5; P.A. 03-163, S. 1; P.A. 04-200, S. 1; P.A. 05-288, S. 216; June Sp.

The hearing shall be held in the municipality where such land is located. If such land is located in more than one municipality, the authority shall determine in which municipality the hearing shall be held.

Such public notice shall be published in a display form that shall serve substantially to notify the public of the availability of the property and shall be published in print no smaller than ten-point type size. If a recipient of notice under this subsection enters into a contract to purchase such land, the closing on the sale shall take place not later than twelve months after the contract is entered into unless the period for closing is extended by mutual agreement of the parties to the contract. No agreement to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of such land may be entered into by such water company except as provided in this section.

Any such recipient of notice, upon entering into a contract which provides for an option to acquire such land, shall pay reasonable consideration for such option with due regard for the market value of the land. Such consideration shall be applied, without interest, as a credit against the purchase price if the option is exercised. Any such consideration shall not be refundable unless the authority disapproves the disposition of such land.\n\n(1967, P.A. 577, S. 2; 1972, P.A. 189, S. 2; P.A. 74-256, S. 1, 4; P.A. 75-486, S. 17, 69; P.A. 77-614, S. 321, 610; P.A. 78-303, S. 132, 136; 78-378, S. 1, 2, 6; P.A. 80-482, S. 84, 348; P.A. 87-70, S. 1, 4; P.A. 88-354, S. 1; P.A. 89-261, S. 2; 89-301, S. 4; P.A. 90-221, S. 1, 15; P.A. 91-93, S. 1, 2; P.A. 93-381, S. 9, 39; P.A. 95-48, S. 2; 95-118, S. 1; 95-257, S. 12, 21, 58; P.A. 97-314, S. 2; P.A. 98-157, S. 8, 15; P.A. 99-225, S. 22, 33; P.A. 00-53, S. 3; P.A. 01-49, S. 6; P.A. 11-80, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: 1972 act required notification of commissioner of environmental protection of intention to dispose of land; P.A. 74-256 required commission to approve or disapprove disposition of land within 150 days, else inaction deemed approval; P.A. 75-486 replaced public utilities commission with public utilities control authority, exempted from notice requirement dispositions of land to United States or to municipality and required hearing if land cost exceeds $20,000; P.A. 77-614 affirmed notification of public utilities control authority despite conflicting provision replacing authority with division of public utility control within the department of business regulation; P.A. 78-303 made technical corrections; P.A. 78-378 required notification of commissioner of health services; P.A. 80-482 made division of public utility control an independent department and deleted reference to abolished department of business regulation; P.A. 87-70 changed “parcel of unimproved real property” to “contiguous area of unimproved real property”, made a technical change in the reference to Sec. 16-43, and required that the municipality in which the real property is located be a party to all proceedings involving such property brought before the department of public utility control; P.A. 88-354 organized the section into Subsecs., amended Subsec.
