The authority may issue more than one such certificate for any franchise area or portion of a franchise area. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 33-645, any such certificate shall authorize the holder thereof to occupy public highways to the extent required to provide community antenna television system service. A certificate shall be issued only after written application for the same has been made to the authority, accompanied by a fee of fifty dollars, and public hearing has been held thereon. No certificate shall be sold or transferred without the approval of the authority. For due cause shown, the authority may amend, suspend or revoke any such certificate. If a certificate is not exercised within two years from the date of issue, the authority may revoke the certificate. The authority may specify in the certificate at the time of issue and from time to time thereafter such terms and conditions as the public interest may require.\n\n(b) In determining whether a new certificate shall be issued or an existing certificate transferred, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall only take into consideration the suitability of the applicant or, if the applicant is a corporation, of its management, the financial responsibility of the applicant and the ability of the applicant to perform efficiently the service for which authority is requested. In the case of an application filed on or after October 1, 1981, (1) if the applicant or an affiliate thereof is the holder of one or more other certificates in the state, the authority shall also consider the possible adverse effects of increasing the concentration of ownership of community antenna television systems and related services, which would result from granting the application, and (2) suitability of the applicant shall include consideration of participating owners resident in the proposed service area as well as involvement in local civic and community activities. In considering concentration of ownership, the authority shall only take into account the following factors: (A) Federal and state antitrust and unfair trade practices laws, regulations and policies, and (B) the reduced ability of the authority to make comparisons with other certificate holders. In the case of an application filed on or after January 1, 1983, for the approval of the transfer of an existing certificate, the authority shall also (i) consult with the advisory council established by regulation for the franchise area specified in the certificate, and (ii) if the applicant or an affiliate thereof is the holder of one or more other certificates in the state, consider the adequacy of the service provided by such holder in the franchise areas specified in such certificate or certificates. The authority may adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 to carry out the purposes of this subsection.\n\n(c) (1) A representative of a community antenna television company issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity in accordance with this section shall, twice a year, arrange for and hold a meeting with the advisory council established, in accordance with regulations adopted by the authority in accordance with chapter 54, for the franchise area served by such company. (2) The authority shall designate an advisory council as an intervenor in any contested case before the authority involving the community antenna television company which the council is advising. Such company shall provide to the chairperson of its advisory council a copy of any report, notice or other document it files with the authority. If a community antenna television company fails or refuses to furnish adequate service to any customer, the advisory council for the franchise area served by the company may file a written petition with the authority alleging the failure or refusal. The authority shall hold a hearing on such petition and, not later than one hundred fifty days after receiving the petition, shall issue a written decision on the petition. The company shall thereafter furnish service to the customer in accordance with the conditions prescribed under the authority's decision. (3) Each community antenna television company shall, every six months, provide on bills, bill inserts or letters to subscribers, and shall prominently post in the company's primary subscriber service area and community access facility, a notice indicating the name and an address of the chairperson of the company's advisory council and describing the responsibilities of the advisory council. Each such company shall provide its advisory council with an opportunity to review such notice prior to distributing or posting the notice.\n\n(d) (1) An initial certificate issued prior to June 1, 1988, shall grant a franchise for fifteen years, provided that for certificates issued prior to January 1, 1975, the initial franchise term shall be deemed to end for four such companies each year, starting in 1989, in order of those companies having the highest gross revenues under chapter 211 or 212a during the calendar year ending December 31, 1982. An initial, renewal or transfer certificate issued on or after June 1, 1988, shall grant a franchise for a term of not less than five years and not more than ten years, except that under special circumstances, as described in subdivision (2) of this subsection, a franchise may be granted for a term of more than ten years but not more than fifteen years. The authority shall have the discretion to determine the appropriate length of a franchise term, initial, renewal or transfer, and in making its decision shall consider the following without limitation: (A) The operator's past performance in terms of meeting the needs of the cable-related community; (B) the operator's past performance in terms of complying with the material terms of the existing franchise; (C) the operator's compliance with authority regulations and the general statutes; (D) the ability of the operator's management to properly operate the franchise; (E) the operator's effectiveness in dealing with consumer requests, complaints and billing questions or disputes; (F) the operator's effectiveness in dealing with the advisory council; (G) the quality and diversity of the operator's programming; (H) the quality of the operator's community access programming, including public access, educational access and governmental access programming, in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (3) of this subsection; (I) the quality of the operator's equipment and facilities; (J) the operator's proposals for future extensions and upgrading to technologically advanced equipment, facilities and systems; (K) the operator's past performance in terms of meeting the needs of the cable-related community by providing African-American and Hispanic programming; (L) the operator's good faith efforts, as determined by the authority, to provide service, when practicable, to all customers within the service area; (M) the operator's past performance in making available addressable converters, traps or other devices or services which enable subscribers to voluntarily block transmission of specific programming to their homes or places of business; and (N) the applicant's provision of innovative services, including audio services, information services, electronic publishing and information concerning the proceedings of the General Assembly and legislative committees.\n\n(2) Under special circumstances, the authority in its discretion, may issue, renew or transfer a franchise for a term of not more than fifteen years if the franchisee has committed itself, as outlined in the franchise agreement, to provide or maintain technologically advanced equipment, facilities and systems, as determined by the authority, to enhance and promote technologically advanced educational programming and to comply with specific quality of service standards, including, but not limited to, the time between installation and repair following a subscriber request, the response time to consumer complaints and the quality of the operator's customer service policies and practices.\n\n(3) In evaluating the quality of community access programming the authority shall consider, without limitation, (A) compliance with federal laws governing noncommercial educational broadcast stations and public broadcast stations, and state laws governing community access, including, but not limited to, sections 16-333-31 to 16-333-36, inclusive, of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies; (B) compliance with the terms of the franchise certificate, which apply to community access; and (C) compliance with requirements involving community access contained in any order of the authority which applies to the community antenna television system.\n\n(4) If the authority, on or after June 1, 1988, approves the transfer of a certificate, the franchise term of such transferred certificate shall be the remaining duration of the franchise term originally granted unless the authority grants a different term, the appropriate length of which shall be determined by the authority under this subsection. A certificate may be renewed for an additional term, the appropriate length of which shall be determined by the authority under this subsection, if the authority finds that the holder of the certificate has complied with the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 USC 546.\n\n(5) The authority shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, establishing procedures and standards for the renewal of certificates issued to community antenna television companies. Such regulations shall, without limitation, (A) incorporate the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 USC 546, (B) require the authority to consult with the advisory council for the franchise area served by the certificate holder before making a decision concerning the renewal of the certificate, (C) require any holder of a certificate which is not renewed by the authority to continue to operate the franchise for one year after the end of its term or until a successor is chosen and ready to assume control of the franchise, whichever is sooner, (D) establish standards for the content of notices sent to cable subscribers concerning public hearings for franchise renewal proceedings which standards shall include, without limitation, the requirements specified in subdivision (6) of this subsection, (E) establish standards to ensure that the costs and expenses of a municipality constructing, purchasing or operating a community antenna television company are accurately attributed to such company, and (F) establish quality standards for the instructional and educational channels. The authority shall adopt regulations pursuant to this subdivision in conjunction with the Commission for Educational Technology.\n\n(6) Any community antenna television company which applies to the authority for the renewal of a franchise shall: (A) Make available for public inspection a copy of the company's proposal for renewal at the town hall, each public library and the primary senior center, as determined by the chief executive official of each municipality of its franchise area and at the company's primary customer service center and community access facility, and (B) notify each subscriber of any public hearing for a franchise renewal, which notices shall be mailed by first class mail to each subscriber not less than fourteen days in advance of any public hearing and shall state in plain language the time, place, date, address and subject matter of the hearing, and in boldface print shall state that public participation is encouraged. The notice shall also provide information concerning the locations where the company's proposal for renewal may be reviewed, and shall not contain any billing, promotional or extraneous information.\n\n(7) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, if at any time after the grant of an initial or renewal term of a franchise, the community antenna television company and the third-party nonprofit community access provider reach an agreement that the community antenna television company will provide a capital contribution to such provider in a mutually agreeable amount solely for the purpose of the upgrade or replacement of capital equipment, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall grant a two-year extension of such franchise term, provided the community antenna television company commits to not pass through said capital contribution in subscriber rates or community access fees. In a franchise area with more than one community access provider, an agreement shall be deemed to be reached when two-thirds or more of the community access providers within that franchise independently reach agreement with the community antenna television company. Only those community access providers reaching agreement shall receive the funding mutually agreed upon pursuant to this subdivision. Such extension shall not be a contested case proceeding and shall be applicable to no more than one time per franchise term.\n\n(e) No certificate issued by the authority under this section for the construction or operation of a community antenna television system shall be construed to authorize the provision of noncable communications service. For the purposes of section 16-247c, noncable communications service shall not be deemed to be service which is provided by a community antenna television company pursuant to a special charter or pursuant to a certificate of public convenience or necessity issued pursuant to this section. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect service which is both authorized and preempted pursuant to federal law.\n\n(f) Each applicant for a certificate shall finance the reasonable costs of a community needs assessment, conducted by an independent consultant and developed jointly by the authority, the Office of Consumer Counsel, the local advisory council and the applicant, which assessment shall analyze a community's future cable-related needs and, if applicable, shall provide the authority with assistance in analyzing an operator's past performance, as defined in subsection (d) of this section. The authority shall supervise the assessment and provide the independent consultant with the date upon which the assessment shall be completed and filed with the authority. Such community needs assessment shall be conducted in lieu of the requirement in subdivision (12) of subsection (c) of section 16-333-39 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies. In its final decision on the application for a certificate, the authority shall state the reasons for not implementing any key recommendations made in any such needs assessment. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a franchise area which is subject to effective competition, as defined in 47 USC 543, as from time to time amended, at the time the application is received by the authority.\n\n(g) Each certificate of public convenience and necessity for a franchise issued pursuant to this section shall be nonexclusive, and each such certificate issued for a franchise in any area of the state where an existing franchise is currently operating shall not contain more favorable terms or conditions than those imposed on the existing franchise.

      "text": "(a) As used in this section, “multichannel video programming distributor” means a multichannel video programming distributor, as defined in 47 CFR 76.1300, as from time to time amended, and includes an owner of an open video system, as defined in 47 CFR 76.1500, as from time to time amended.\n\n(b) Each company or organization selected pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, in consultation with the franchise's advisory council, shall provide facilities, equipment, and technical and managerial support to enable the production of meaningful community access programming within its franchise area. Each company shall include all its community access channels in its basic service package. Each company or organization shall annually review its rules, regulations, policies and procedures governing the provision of community access programming. Such review shall include a period for public comment, a public meeting and consultation with the franchise's advisory council.\n\n(c) If a community-based nonprofit organization in a franchise area desires to assume responsibility for community access operations, it shall, upon timely petition to the authority, be granted intervenor status in a franchise proceeding held pursuant to this section. The authority shall assign this responsibility to the most qualified community-based nonprofit organization or the company based on the following criteria: (1) The recommendations of the advisory council and of the municipalities in the franchise area; (2) a review of the organization's or the company's performance in providing community access programming; (3) the operating plan submitted by the organization and the company for providing community access programming; (4) the experience in community access programming of the organization; (5) the organization's and the company's proposed budget, including expenses for salaries, consultants, attorneys, and other professionals; (6) the quality and quantity of the programming to be created, promoted or facilitated by the organization or the company; (7) a review of the organization's procedures to ensure compliance with federal and state law, including the regulations of Connecticut state agencies; and (8) any other criteria determined to be relevant by the authority. If the authority selects an organization to provide community access operations, the company shall provide financial and technical support to the organization in an amount to be determined by the authority. On petition of the Office of Consumer Counsel or the franchise's advisory council or on its own motion, the authority shall hold a hearing, with notice, on the ability of the organization to continue its responsibility for community access operations. In its decision following such a hearing, the authority may reassign the responsibility for community access operations to another organization or the company in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(d) Each company or organization shall conduct outreach programs and promote its community access services. Such outreach and promotion may include, but not be limited to (1) broadcasting cross-channel video announcements, (2) distributing information throughout the franchise area and not solely to its subscribers, (3) including community access information in its regular marketing publications, (4) broadcasting character-generated text messages or video announcements on barker or access channels, (5) making speaking engagements, (6) holding open receptions at its community access facilities, and (7) in multitown franchise areas, encouraging the formation and development of local community access studios operated by volunteers or nonprofit operating groups.\n\n(e) Each company or organization shall adopt for its community access programming a scheduling policy which encourages programming diversity. Said scheduling policy shall include (1) limiting a program, except instructional access and governmental access programming, to thirteen weeks in any one time slot when a producer of another program requests the same time slot, (2) procedures for resolving program scheduling conflicts, and (3) other measures which the company or organization deems appropriate. A company or organization may consider the availability of a substantially similar time slot when making community access programming scheduling decisions.\n\n(f) In the case of any initial, transfer or renewal franchise proceeding held on or after October 1, 1990, the authority may, on its own initiative, in the first six months of the second, fifth, eighth and eleventh years of the franchise term, review and evaluate the company's or the organization's provision of community access programming. The authority shall conduct such review or evaluation in any such proceeding held on or after October 1, 1990, if the Consumer Counsel or any interested party petitions the authority for such a review during the first six months of the review year. During any such review year, if an organization desires to provide community access operations it shall petition the authority and the authority shall follow the procedures and standards described in subsection (c) of this section in determining whether to assign to the organization the responsibility to provide such operations. No community access programming produced using the facilities or staff of an organization or company providing community access operations shall be utilized for commercial purposes without express prior written agreement between the producer of such programming and the organization or company providing community access operations the facilities or staff of which were used in the production of the programming. Such an agreement may include, without limitation, a provision regarding the producer and the company or organization sharing any profit realized from such programming so utilized. An organization providing community access operations shall consult with the company in the franchise area prior to making such an agreement.\n\n(g) No organization or company providing community access operations shall exercise editorial control over such programming, except as to programming that is obscene and except as otherwise allowed by applicable state and federal law. This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit such organization or company from limiting the hours during which adult programs may be aired. Such organization or company may consult with the advisory council in determining what constitutes an adult program for purposes of this subsection.\n\n(h) Upon the request of the Office of Consumer Counsel or the franchise's advisory council, and for good cause shown the authority shall require an organization responsible for community access operations to have an independent audit conducted at the expense of the organization. For purposes of this subsection, “good cause” may include, but not be limited to, the failure or refusal of such organization (1) to account for and reimburse the community access programming budget for its commercial use of community access programming facilities, equipment or staff, or for the allocation of such facilities, equipment or staff to functions not directly related to the community access operations of the franchise, (2) to carry over unexpended community access programming budget accounts at the end of each fiscal year, (3) to properly maintain community access programming facilities or equipment in good repair, or (4) to plan for the replacement of community access programming equipment made obsolete by technological advances. In response to any such request, the authority shall state, in writing, the reasons for its determination.\n\n(i) Each company and nonprofit organization providing community access operations shall report annually to the authority on or before February fifteenth. The authority shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to specify the information which shall be required in such report. Such information shall be necessary for the authority to carry out the provisions of this section.\n\n(j) The advisory council shall review all community access programming of a company or organization within the franchise area which programming has been the subject of a complaint.\n\n(k) The authority shall establish the amount that the company or organization responsible for community access operations shall receive for such operations from subscribers and from multichannel video programming distributors. The amount shall be five dollars per subscriber per year, adjusted annually by a percentage reflecting the increase or decrease of the consumer price index for the preceding calendar year, provided the authority may increase or decrease the amount by not more than forty per cent of said amount for the subscribers and all multichannel video programming distributors within a franchise area after considering (1) the criteria set forth in subsection (c) of this section, (2) the level of public interest in community access operations in the franchise area, (3) the level of community need for educational access programming, (4) the level and breadth of participation in community access operations, (5) the adequacy of existing facilities, equipment and training programs to meet the current and future needs of the franchise area, and (6) any other factors determined to be relevant by the authority. Prior to increasing or decreasing said amount, the authority shall give notice and opportunity for a hearing to the company or multichannel video programming distributor and, where applicable, the organization responsible for community access programming. The amount shall be assessed once each year for each end user premises connected to an open video system, irrespective of the number of multichannel video programming distributors providing programming over the open video system. When the authority issues, transfers or renews a certificate of public convenience and necessity to operate a community antenna television system, the authority shall include in the franchise agreement the amount that the company or organization responsible for community access operations shall receive for such operations from subscribers. The authority shall conduct a proceeding to establish the amount that the company or organization responsible for community access operations shall receive for such operations from multichannel video programming distributors and the method of payment of said amount. The authority shall adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 to implement the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(l) An organization assigned responsibility for community access operations which organization ceases to provide such operations shall transfer its assets to the successor organization assigned such responsibility or, if no successor organization is assigned such responsibility, to another nonprofit organization within the franchise area selected by the authority.\n\n(m) On petition or its own motion, the authority shall determine whether a franchise area is subject to effective competition, as defined in 47 USC 543, as from time to time amended. Upon a determination that a franchise area is subject to effective competition, the provisions of this section shall apply to multichannel video programming distributors operating in the franchise area, provided (1) where multichannel video programming distributors provide programming over a single open video system, the provisions of this section shall apply jointly and not separately to all such distributors providing programming on the same open video system, and (2) the provisions of subsection (k) of this section shall apply to multichannel video programming distributors whether or not such distributors operate in a franchise area subject to such effective competition.\n\n(n) No community antenna television company or nonprofit organization providing community access operations shall refuse to engage in good faith negotiation regarding interconnection of such operations with other community antenna television companies serving the same area. No school or facility owned or leased by a municipal government that possesses community access operations equipment shall unreasonably deny interconnection with or the use of such equipment to any such company or nonprofit organization. At the request of such a company or nonprofit organization providing community access operations, the authority may facilitate the negotiation between such company or organization and any other community antenna television company regarding interconnection of community access operations.\n\n(o) Each company or organization shall consult with its advisory council in the formation of a community access programming policy, the adoption of the community access programming budget and the allocation of capital equipment and community access programming resources.\n\n(P.A. 87-580, S. 3, 4; P.A. 95-150, S. 2; P.A. 96-201; P.A. 98-121, S. 4; P.A. 07-253, S. 39–41; P.A. 13-5, S. 21.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 95-150 replaced previous provision re moratorium on transfer of certificates for community antenna television systems prior to June 1, 1988, with new Subsecs.
