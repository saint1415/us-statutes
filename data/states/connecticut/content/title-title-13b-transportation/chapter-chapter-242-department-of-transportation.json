A temporary lease shall be effective only until a final decision is made by the Attorney General, the secretary and the Properties Review Board. Leases of land of the state shall be for periods determined by the commissioner with the approval of the State Properties Review Board and may provide for the construction of buildings on the land.

In connection with the purchase or taking by the commissioner of any such property owned by any person other than a municipality, the determination by the commissioner and the Commissioner of Administrative Services that the purchase or taking is necessary shall be conclusive. The taking shall be in the manner prescribed in section 48-12 for the taking of land for state institutions.
