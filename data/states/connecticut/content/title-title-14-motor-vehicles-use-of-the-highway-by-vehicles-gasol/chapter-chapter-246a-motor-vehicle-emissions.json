      "text": "(a)(1) No person shall fail to maintain in good working order or remove, dismantle or otherwise cause to be inoperative any equipment or feature constituting an operational element of the air pollution control system or mechanism of a motor vehicle required by regulations of the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection to be maintained or on the vehicle. Any such failure to maintain in good working order or removal, dismantling or causing of inoperability shall subject the owner thereof to revocation of registration for such vehicle by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles unless all parts and equipment constituting elements of air pollution control have been made operable and in good working order within sixty days of notice by said commissioner of such violation. Any such failure shall be considered a failure to comply with the periodic inspection requirements established under subsection (c) of this section. As used in this section, “motor vehicle” has the same meaning as provided in section 14-1.\n\n(2) The Commissioner of Motor Vehicles shall not revoke the registration of a motor vehicle pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection if such vehicle is subject to any consent decree approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on October 25, 2016, in settlement of Case Number 15-MD-2672-CRB (JSC) entitled “In Re: Volkswagen ‘Clean Diesel' Marketing, Sales Practices, and Products Liability Litigation”.\n\n(b) (1) The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall consult with the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles and furnish the commissioner with technical information, including testing techniques, standards and instructions for emission control features and equipment. The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall furnish the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles with emission standards for all motor vehicles subject to the inspection and maintenance requirements. Such standards shall be consistent with provisions of federal law, if any, relating to control of emissions from the vehicles concerned or any regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection which implement the low-emission vehicle and clean fuels regulations adopted by the state of California, as amended. Such standards shall be periodically reviewed by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection and revised, if necessary, to achieve the objectives of the vehicle emission inspection program.\n\n(2) During the performance of an emissions inspection, an independent contractor retained by the state in accordance with the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, or a licensed dealer or repairer authorized to perform inspections in accordance with the provisions of subsection (f) of this section, shall determine whether the motor vehicle being inspected is subject to an open recall by checking information provided by the manufacturer of the motor vehicle or other known and readily available sources, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. If the motor vehicle is subject to one or more open recalls, the independent contractor, dealer or repairer shall provide the owner of the motor vehicle with written notice of each such open recall at the time of inspection. The notice shall include a description of each open recall and a statement that a motor vehicle dealer approved by the manufacturer of the motor vehicle may repair or modify the motor vehicle at no cost to the owner, except as provided in 49 USC 30120, as amended from time to time. Nothing in this subdivision shall alter the liability under common law of any motor vehicle manufacturer or motor vehicle dealer approved by the manufacturer to repair or modify a motor vehicle subject to an open recall. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 22a-6a, an independent contractor, licensed dealer or repairer and any employee of such independent contractor or licensed dealer or repairer shall not be liable to any person for any act or omission related to the provision of a written notice regarding an open recall required pursuant to this subdivision.\n\n(c) The commissioner shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to implement the provisions of this section. Such regulations shall include provision for a periodic inspection of air pollution control equipment and compliance with or waiver of exhaust emission standards or compliance with or waiver of on-board diagnostic standards or other standards defined by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection and approved by the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, compliance with or waiver of, air pollution control system integrity standards defined by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection and compliance with or waiver of purge system standards defined by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection. Such regulations may provide for an inspection procedure using an on-board diagnostic information system for all 1996 model year and newer motor vehicles. Such regulations shall apply to all motor vehicles registered or which will be registered in this state, and to all motor vehicles sold by a dealer licensed in this state as required by subsection (n) of this section, except: (1) Vehicles having a gross weight of more than ten thousand pounds; (2) vehicles powered by electricity; (3) bicycles with motors attached; (4) motorcycles; (5) vehicles operating with a temporary registration; (6) vehicles manufactured twenty-five or more years ago; (7) new vehicles at the time of initial registration; (8) vehicles registered but not designed primarily for highway use; (9) farm vehicles, as defined in subsection (q) of section 14-49; (10) diesel-powered type II school buses; (11) a vehicle operated by a licensed dealer or repairer either to or from a location of the purchase or sale of such vehicle or for the purpose of obtaining an official emissions or safety inspection; (12) vehicles that have met the inspection requirements of section 14-103a and are registered by the commissioner as composite vehicles; (13) electric bicycles, as defined in section 14-1; or (14) electric foot scooters, as defined in section 14-1. On and after July 1, 2002, such regulations shall exempt from the periodic inspection requirement any vehicle four or less model years of age, beginning with model year 2003 and the previous three model years, provided that such exemption shall lapse upon a finding by the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency or by the Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation that such exemption causes the state to violate applicable federal environmental or transportation planning requirements. Notwithstanding any provisions of this subsection, the commissioner may require an initial emissions inspection and compliance or waiver prior to registration of a new motor vehicle. If the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection finds that it is necessary to inspect motor vehicles which are exempt under subdivision (1) or (4) of this subsection, or motor vehicles that are four or less model years of age in order to achieve compliance with federal law concerning emission reduction requirements, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to require the inspection of motorcycles, designated motor vehicles having a gross weight of more than ten thousand pounds or motor vehicles four or less model years of age.\n\n(d) (1) No motor vehicle subject to the inspection requirements of this section shall be operated upon the highways of this state unless such vehicle has been presented for inspection in accordance with a schedule for inspection and compliance as established by the commissioner. The commissioner shall grant waivers from compliance with standards for vehicles which fail any required inspection and require an unreasonable cost of repair to bring the vehicle into compliance. The commissioner may determine compliance of a vehicle that has failed an emissions retest by means of a complete physical and functional diagnosis and inspection of the vehicle, in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR Part 51.360, showing that no additional emissions-related repairs are needed. An extension of time, not to exceed the period of inspection frequency, may be granted to obtain needed repairs on a vehicle in the case of economic hardship of the owner. Only one such extension may be granted for any vehicle.\n\n(2) On and after July 1, 2022, until July 1, 2024, inclusive, the commissioner shall grant an extension of time for a vehicle which fails any required inspection to obtain needed repairs, provided any motor vehicle dealer or repairer licensed under the provisions of section 14-52, certifies, in writing, that the part needed to fix a problem associated with the vehicle's engine is delayed due to market conditions. Any extension of time granted pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision shall be valid for a period of one hundred eighty days from the date of the certification provided by such dealer or repairer.\n\n(3) The commissioner may design a sticker to be affixed to the windshield of each vehicle which shall bear the date of expiration of the assigned inspection period on both sides. The commissioner may also design a sticker to be affixed to the windshield of each vehicle that is exempt from the requirements of this chapter, which sticker shall bear the date, if any, on which such vehicle is no longer exempt and is required to be presented for inspection. As used in this section, “unreasonable cost of repair” means cost of repair in excess of the amounts required to be expended by Title 40, Part 51.360 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as amended.\n\n(e) In order to provide for emissions inspection facilities, the commissioner may enter into a negotiated inspection agreement or agreements, notwithstanding chapters 50, 58, 59 and 60, with an independent contractor or contractors, to provide for the leasing, construction, equipping, maintenance or operation of a system of official emissions inspection stations in such numbers and locations as may be required to provide vehicle owners reasonably convenient access to inspection facilities. The commissioner may employ such system and the services of such contractor or contractors to conduct safety inspections as provided by section 14-16a, subsection (g) of section 14-12 and section 14-103a. Such contractor or contractors, with the approval of the commissioner, may operate inspection stations at suitable locations owned or operated by other persons, firms or corporations, including retail business establishments with adequate facilities to accommodate and to perform inspections on motor vehicles. The commissioner is prohibited from entering into an inspection agreement with any independent contractor who: (1) Is engaged in the business of maintaining or repairing vehicles in this state, except that the independent contractor shall not be precluded from maintaining or repairing any vehicle owned or operated by the independent contractor; or (2) does not have the capability, resources or technical and management skill to adequately conduct, equip, operate and maintain a sufficient number of official emissions inspection stations. All persons employed by the independent contractor in the performance of an inspection agreement are deemed to be employees of the independent contractor and not of this state. The inspection agreement or agreements authorized by this section shall be subject to other provisions as follows: (A) Minimum requirements for staff, equipment, management and hours and place of operation of official emissions inspection stations including such additional testing facilities as may be established and operated in accordance with subsection (g) of this section; (B) reports and documentation concerning the operation of official emissions inspection stations and additional testing facilities as the commissioner may require; (C) surveillance privileges for the commissioner to ensure compliance with standards, procedures, rules, regulations and laws; and (D) any other provision deemed necessary by the commissioner for the administration of the inspection agreement. Nothing in the inspection agreement shall require the state to purchase any asset or assume any liability if such agreement is not renewed.\n\n(f) (1) The commissioner may authorize and appoint any motor vehicle dealer or repairer that is licensed in accordance with the provisions of subpart (D) of part III of chapter 246 and that has the qualifications established by the commissioner to conduct emissions inspections in a designated area of its licensed premises and to report the results thereof to the Department of Motor Vehicles, provided such licensee signs a statement that such licensee understands the provisions of this section and regulations adopted under authority of this section, understands the necessity to comply with administrative and technical directives and advisories that the commissioner issues and understands that any failure by such licensee to comply with this section, the regulations or the directives or advisories constitutes grounds for the commissioner to suspend or revoke the authority for such licensee to conduct inspections.\n\n(2) Each such licensee shall conduct an emissions inspection of any registered motor vehicle requiring such an inspection at any time during its normal and posted hours of operation or, at the discretion of the commissioner, at a predetermined or appointed time, when such motor vehicle is presented for inspection. No such licensee shall charge any fee for the inspection except the fee authorized by subsection (k) of this section. The results of each emissions inspection performed in accordance with this subsection shall be evidenced by a written vehicle inspection report, containing such information and certification by the inspecting licensee as the commissioner shall prescribe. The licensee shall furnish a copy of such inspection report to the operator of the motor vehicle at the time of completion of the inspection.\n\n(3) No such licensee may be appointed by the commissioner nor may any such licensee conduct any inspection unless the licensee has in its employ one or more certified emissions inspectors and repair technicians. Such inspectors and technicians shall conduct all inspections and related emissions repair work and shall meet the training and certification requirements in 40 CFR Part 51.367 and of the regulations adopted by the commissioner in accordance with this subsection.\n\n(4) The commissioner may suspend or revoke the authority to conduct emissions inspections by any such licensee that is authorized to conduct emissions inspections if the licensee fails to comply with the provisions of this section, regulations adopted under authority of this section, or administrative or technical directives or advisories that the commissioner issues.\n\n(5) The commissioner shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to establish the qualifications for such licensees to be authorized and appointed to conduct emissions inspections, and to establish standards and procedures for such inspections, reporting requirements by such licensees and training and certification requirements for inspectors and repair technicians.\n\n(g) The independent contractor or contractors retained by the state in accordance with the provisions of subsection (e) of this section may conduct emissions inspections at one or more facilities owned or operated by a motor vehicle dealer or dealers, licensed in accordance with section 14-52. No such inspection facility located on the premises of a licensed dealer shall be operated without the prior approval of the commissioner. The operation of each such facility shall be subject to such procedures and requirements, to be followed by the contractor and the licensee, as may be prescribed by the terms and conditions of the contract entered into in accordance with the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, and in regulations as may be adopted by the commissioner in accordance with chapter 54. The state shall not be a party to, or assume or incur any liability of any kind under, any agreement entered into between the independent contractor and any dealer in furtherance of the provisions of this subsection. The contract or contracts entered into by the state in accordance with the provisions of subsection (e) of this section shall provide for indemnification of the state with respect to the operation of any such inspection facility located at a motor vehicle dealership, in the same manner and to the same extent as the operation of an official emissions inspection station.\n\n(h) In order to provide for management and oversight of emissions inspection facilities established in accordance with subsection (e) of this section and to establish and maintain necessary electronic data capture and reporting systems for such facilities and for licensed dealers and repairers who may be authorized to perform inspections in accordance with the provisions of subsection (f) of this section, the commissioner may enter into a negotiated personal service agreement or agreements, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 55a, with any qualified person, firm or corporation. The responsibilities of any such contractor retained by the commissioner shall include, but need not be limited to, the following: (1) Review and analysis of data from all official emissions inspections performed, and provision to the commissioner of recommendations to improve the quality and integrity of such data, (2) provision of program information and standards to inspection facilities and locations, (3) provision to the commissioner of regular reports, assessments and recommendations to maintain or improve the effectiveness, efficiency, quality and integrity of such inspection operations, and (4) identification of measures to enhance public convenience, and compliance with the inspection requirements. No such contractor retained in accordance with the provisions of this subsection may be licensed as, or have any financial interest in any firm engaged in the business of selling or repairing motor vehicles, or may be a provider of emissions inspection equipment or facilities to the state.\n\n(i) The commissioner may license an owner or operator of a fleet of motor vehicles which are subject to emissions inspection pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or section 14-164i, to establish a fleet emissions inspection station, provided that the fleet owner or operator conforms with regulations for fleet emissions inspection stations adopted by the commissioner which shall specify the classes or other characteristics of vehicles eligible for inspection at such stations.\n\n(j) The commissioner may establish a program for the on-road testing of motor vehicles subject to this chapter. The program shall test not less than one-half of one per cent of the subject fleet state-wide or twenty thousand vehicles, whichever is less, per inspection cycle under conditions of highway operation in order to provide information concerning the emission performance of such in-use vehicles. Testing may be performed by means of remote sensing devices, or roadside pullovers followed by tailpipe emissions testing using a suitable, portable device and recording system. Owners of vehicles that have previously been through scheduled periodic inspection and passed, and are found by on-road testing to be high emitters, in accordance with the standards established under subsection (b) of this section and the regulations adopted under subsection (c) of this section, may be notified that their vehicles are required to pass an out-of-cycle follow-up inspection at an inspection station. Notification may be made by mailing in the case of remote sensing on-road testing or through immediate notification if roadside pullovers are used. The commissioner may use the services of the independent contractor or contractors to implement the on-road testing program. If a method of roadside pullovers is used in the program, such method shall be employed with due regard to traffic safety considerations and performed with the assistance of inspectors of the Department of Motor Vehicles or members of state or municipal police forces.\n\n(k) (1) The commissioner, with approval of the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, shall establish, and from time to time modify, the inspection fees, not to exceed twenty dollars for each biennial inspection or reinspection required pursuant to this chapter for inspections performed at official emissions inspection stations. Such fees shall be paid in a manner prescribed by the commissioner. If the costs to the state of the emissions inspection program, including administrative costs and payments to any independent contractor, exceed the income from such fees, such excess costs shall be borne by the state. Any person whose vehicle has been inspected at an official emissions inspection station shall, if such vehicle is found not to comply with any required standards, have the vehicle repaired and have the right within sixty consecutive calendar days to return such vehicle to the same official emissions inspection station for one reinspection without charge, provided, where the sixtieth day falls on a Sunday, legal holiday or a day on which the commissioner has established that special circumstances or conditions exist that have caused emissions inspection to be impracticable, such person may return such vehicle for reinspection on the next day. The commissioner shall assess a late fee of twenty dollars against the owner of a motor vehicle that has not presented such motor vehicle for an emissions inspection within thirty days following the expiration date of the assigned inspection period, or that has not presented such motor vehicle for a reinspection within sixty days following a test failure, or both. The commissioner may waive such late fee when it is proven to the commissioner's satisfaction that the failure to have the vehicle inspected within thirty days of the assigned inspection period or during the sixty-day reinspection period was due to exigent circumstances. If ownership of the motor vehicle has been transferred, the new owner shall have such motor vehicle inspected within thirty days of the registration of such motor vehicle. The commissioner may specify a longer period for all new owners to achieve compliance after a transfer of ownership if circumstances require closure or limited operations of the Department of Motor Vehicles or emissions inspection stations. After the expiration of such thirty-day period, or the period specified by the commissioner, the commissioner shall require the payment of the late fee specified in this subdivision. If the thirtieth day falls on a Sunday, legal holiday or a day on which the commissioner has established that special circumstances or conditions exist that have caused emissions inspection to be impracticable, such vehicle may be inspected on the next day and no late fee shall be assessed.\n\n(2) If the commissioner authorizes a licensed dealer or repairer to conduct emissions inspections of 1996 model year and newer vehicles required by this chapter, the commissioner may authorize such licensee to charge a fee, not to exceed twenty dollars for each biennial inspection or reinspection.\n\n(3) Upon the registration of each new motor vehicle subject to the inspection requirements of this chapter, or of each motor vehicle that is four or less model years of age that has not been registered previously in this state, the commissioner may issue a sticker indicating the exempt status of such motor vehicle and the date on which the motor vehicle is scheduled to be presented for inspection. Any such sticker that may be issued shall be displayed on the motor vehicle in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. On and after July 1, 2002, the commissioner shall charge a fee of forty dollars in addition to any other fees required for such registration. All receipts from the payment of such fee shall be deposited in the Special Transportation Fund.\n\n(l) The commissioner may acquire in the name of the state by purchase, lease, gift, devise or otherwise any special equipment, tools, materials or facilities needed to adequately administer, investigate or enforce the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(m) A person shall not in any manner represent any place to be an official emissions inspection station unless such station has been established and is operated in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(n) No motor vehicle dealer licensed under section 14-52 shall sell any motor vehicle unless such motor vehicle (1) is in compliance with subsections (c) and (d) of this section and the regulations adopted by the commissioner, and (2) has passed an emissions inspection conducted in accordance with said subsections and regulations. No person, firm or corporation shall operate or allow to be operated any motor vehicle that has not been inspected and found to be in compliance with the provisions of subsections (c), (d) and (i) of this section and the regulations adopted by the commissioner. Operation in violation of said subsections or the regulations adopted by the commissioner shall be an infraction for each violation, except that the fine for a first violation shall be fifty dollars. The commissioner may deny the issuance of registration to the owner of a motor vehicle, or the renewal of registration to any such owner, or suspend or revoke any registration that has been issued, if such motor vehicle is not in compliance with the inspection requirements of this chapter, or such owner has failed to pay any fee required by the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(1969, P.A. 758, S. 25; 1971, P.A. 872, S. 30; P.A. 75-577, S. 57, 126; P.A. 78-335, S. 2, 6; P.A. 79-238, S. 2, 4; P.A. 80-458, S. 2, 4; P.A. 83-561, S. 3–5; P.A. 84-11, S. 1, 2; P.A. 85-484, S. 2–4; P.A. 90-299, S. 3; P.A. 91-123, S. 2, 3; 91-142, S. 2; June Sp.
