Each delivery of gasoline in a quantity of fifty gallons or more and each delivery of kerosene, fuel oil or similar substance in a quantity of five gallons or more shall be the complete contents of a vehicle tank or it shall be through a meter. Each such tank or meter shall be sealed by a sealer of weights and measures before being used. The term “vehicle tank”, as used in this section, means a container, which may or may not be subdivided into two or more compartments, mounted upon a wagon or motor truck and used for the delivery of such fluids. The term “compartment” means the entire tank whenever the tank is not subdivided; otherwise it means any one of those subdivided portions of the tank which are designed to hold such fluids. Each delivery through a meter shall be delivered through a meter equipped with a numeral reset counter, a register with a zero start or an accumulative ticket printer, which meters shall print an accurate record of all deliveries in gallons and tenths. Such ticket printer shall print the gallonage reading of the meter before and after delivery is made and each ticket shall be locked in the meter between readings to prevent fraud. Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, each delivery shall be accompanied by a delivery ticket and a duplicate thereof, on which shall be distinctly expressed in ink or other indelible substance, in gallons, or gallons and tenths when so required, the quantity of such fluid so delivered, with the name of the seller and the name of the purchaser of such fluid.\n\n(2) A seller may provide an electronic version of a delivery ticket instead of a delivery ticket expressed in ink or other indelible substance, if the seller or agent of such seller and the purchaser of a fluid, described in subdivision (1) of this subsection, agree to such electronic delivery, in writing. The seller shall retain a record of each electronic delivery ticket for not less than twelve months.\n\n(3) One of such delivery or electronic delivery tickets shall be surrendered, upon demand, to the sealer of weights and measures, for inspection, and such ticket or, when the sealer desires to retain the original ticket or electronic ticket, a measure slip issued by the seller or his or her agent, shall be delivered to the purchaser or purchaser's agent or representative at the time of the delivery of such fluid. If the purchaser or purchaser's agent takes such fluid from the place of purchase, a delivery ticket showing the actual number of gallons, or gallons and tenths, delivered shall be given to the purchaser or purchaser's agent at the time of delivery. In the case of an electronic delivery ticket, the seller or agent of such seller shall transmit the electronic delivery ticket to the purchaser or purchaser's agent not more than two business days after such delivery. Delivery tickets shall bear the name or identification number of the seller's driver and shall be sequentially numbered. Copies of delivery tickets shall be retained by the seller for one year and shall be available for inspection during normal business hours. No seller, or agent of such seller, shall possess a delivery ticket which has been printed with, or an electronic delivery ticket which contains, a record of a delivery which has not occurred. The method of determining the number of gallons of any such fluid delivered shall be by measuring the same in measures that have been tested and sealed by a sealer of weights and measures.\n\n(b) No person, firm or corporation shall sell at retail fuel oil or propane gas to be used for residential heating unless all of the purchaser's costs associated with such fuel oil or propane gas, including, but not limited to, unit price and any delivery surcharge, are disclosed to the purchaser, in writing, at the time the purchaser enters into a purchase contract with the seller or at the time of renewal of such contract. Such disclosures shall be made by the seller when the purchaser places an order for such fuel oil or propane gas if there is no contract between the seller and purchaser.\n\n(c) The provisions of this section shall not apply to barge, railroad tank car, drum or slow flow meter delivery.\n\n(d) The provisions of this section requiring meters to print tenths of a gallon shall not apply to bulk plant deliveries to a reseller, or bulk delivery of gasoline to service stations for resale.

On all of these deliveries the meters shall print an accurate record in gallons.\n\n(e) Any person who, by himself or by his agent or employee, or as the employee or agent of another, violates any provision of this section shall be subject to the penalties provided in chapter 750, concerning weights and measures, or chapter 296, concerning operation of fuel supply businesses, as applicable.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 2546; 1959, P.A. 565; 1961, P.A. 100; 1963, P.A. 104; 1967, P.A. 341, S. 1; P.A. 85-250; June 30 Sp.

      "text": "(a) As used in subsection (b) of this section: (1) “Surcharge” means any charge by a retail dealer to any person for the pumping or sale of gasoline or other product intended for use in the propelling of motor vehicles using combustion type engines which exceeds the amount of the posted retail price displayed on such price signs as may be required by law; and (2) “tie-in-sale” means any sale by a retail dealer of any petroleum product, except gasoline, or of any other product or merchandise or of any service which is made a condition for the purchase of gasoline.\n\n(b) Any retail dealer that adds a surcharge to the price of gasoline or other product intended for use in the propelling of motor vehicles using combustion type engines sold by him at retail, or requires a tie-in-sale as a condition of such sale, shall be subject to the penalties provided in section 14-331. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit any charge for financing in accordance with sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive.\n\n(c) (1) During the period commencing on July 1, 1998, and ending on October 1, 1998, upon the reduction in the tax required by section 12-458, that is effective July 1, 1998, and during the period commencing on July 1, 2000, and ending November 1, 2000, upon the reduction in the tax required by said section 12-458, that is effective July 1, 2000, each retail dealer shall, in accordance with subdivision (2) of this subsection, reduce the per-gallon price of gasoline or other product intended for use in the propelling of motor vehicles using combustion type engines sold by such retail dealer at retail in an amount equal to the amount of the reduction in such tax that is imposed on each gallon of such gasoline or other product. Such retail dealer shall maintain any such price reduction in effect for a period of not less than one hundred twenty days after such tax reduction.\n\n(2) The price reduction required by subdivision (1) of this subsection shall take effect not later than (A) two days following the effective date of the applicable tax reduction, or (B) the close of business on the business day on which the retail dealer has completed the sale of an amount of such gasoline or other product equal to the total number of gallons of such gasoline or other product in the inventory of the retail dealer at midnight on the effective date of such tax reduction, whichever is later.\n\n(3) Any retail dealer that violates this subsection shall be subject to the penalties set forth in section 14-331. A violation of this subsection shall be deemed an unfair or deceptive trade practice under subsection (a) of section 42-110b.\n\n(4) The following shall be affirmative defenses to any action or administrative proceeding brought against a retail dealer under section 14-331 or chapter 735a for an alleged violation of this subsection: (A) An increase in the wholesale price of such gasoline or other product that occurs after any such tax reduction; (B) an increase in any other tax imposed on such gasoline or other product that occurs after any such tax reduction; or (C) any other bona fide business cost increase incurred by a retail dealer and upon which the retail dealer relied in making the decision to forego the implementation or continuation of any such price reduction in whole or in part.\n\n(P.A. 74-53, S. 1, 3; P.A. 98-128, S. 5, 10; P.A. 00-170, S. 14, 42.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 98-128 added Subsec. (c) to establish specific requirements for the period July 1, 1998, to October 1, 1998 re reduction in per-gallon price of gasoline and amended Subsec.
