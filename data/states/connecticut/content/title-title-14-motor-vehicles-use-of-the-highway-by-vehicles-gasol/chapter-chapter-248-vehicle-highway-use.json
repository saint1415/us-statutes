Negligence as a prerequisite for finding statute was violated. 117 C. 616. Cited. 119 C. 314. Where complaint had no allegation of reckless driving, court properly omitted reading portion of statute referring to it. 123 C. 177. Operating recklessly is operating without regard for safety of others. Id., 212. If speed in passing vehicle was not such as to endanger any of its occupants, it did not constitute reckless driving. 124 C. 270. Where jury was cautioned that plaintiff was limited to negligence specified in complaint, it was not prejudicial to read inapplicable portion of statute. 125 C. 512.

Evidence is sufficient to prove defendant operated motor vehicle recklessly or at such a rate of speed as to endanger the life of another when state proves, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant ignored posted warning signs, drove well in excess of the posted speed limit and operated vehicle in such a reckless manner as to endanger the lives of the passengers. 51 CA 463.\n\nOperating recklessly within the meaning of section requires a conscious choice of action either with knowledge of the serious danger to others involved in it or with knowledge of facts which would disclose this danger to a reasonable man; there must be something more than a failure to use reasonable care, something more than gross negligence. 22 CS 391. Neither speed nor driving under the influence of liquor would alone be sufficient for a conviction for reckless driving, but such circumstances in conjunction with other circumstances can be taken into consideration in determining whether defendant showed a reckless disregard of consequences.

Guilt might be established under second sentence of statute by evidence which would prove only that life was endangered. Id., 26, 27. Where only evidence relative to defendant's operational conduct is an estimate of his speed at a point 600 feet before accident occurred, evidence held insufficient to warrant conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., 28. Cited. Id., 294, 295. Presumption raised by Sec. 14-107 that proof of registration number of motor vehicle shall be prima facie evidence that owner was operator thereof is not violative of due process since there is a rational and reasonable connection between the facts proved and the ultimate fact presumed.

      "text": "(a)Operation while under the influence or while having an elevated blood alcohol content. Definitions.No person shall operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both. A person commits the offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both if such person operates a motor vehicle (1) while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both, or (2) while such person has an elevated blood alcohol content. For the purposes of this section, “elevated blood alcohol content” means a ratio of alcohol in the blood of such person that is eight-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight, except that if such person is operating a commercial motor vehicle, “elevated blood alcohol content” means a ratio of alcohol in the blood of such person that is four-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight, and “motor vehicle” includes a snowmobile and all-terrain vehicle, as those terms are defined in section 14-379. For purposes of this section, section 14-227b and section 14-227c, (A) “advanced roadside impaired driving enforcement” means a program developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration with the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Technical Advisory Panel, which focuses on impaired driving enforcement education for police officers, or any successor to such program; (B) “drug influence evaluation” means an evaluation developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the International Association of Chiefs of Police that is conducted by a drug recognition expert to determine the level of a person's impairment from the use of drugs and the drug category causing such impairment; (C) “drug recognition expert” means a person certified by the International Association of Chiefs of Police as having met all requirements of the International Drug Evaluation and Classification Program; and (D) “nontestimonial portion of a drug influence evaluation” means a drug influence evaluation conducted by a drug recognition expert that does not include a verbal interview with the subject.\n\n(b)Admissibility of chemical test.Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, in any criminal prosecution for violation of subsection (a) of this section, evidence respecting the amount of alcohol or drug in the defendant's blood or urine at the time of the alleged offense, as shown by a chemical test of the defendant's breath, blood or urine, shall be admissible and competent provided: (1) The defendant was afforded a reasonable opportunity to telephone an attorney prior to the performance of the test and consented to the taking of the test upon which such analysis is made; (2) a true copy of the report of the test result was mailed to or personally delivered to the defendant within twenty-four hours or by the end of the next regular business day, after such result was known, whichever is later; (3) the test was performed by or at the direction of a police officer according to methods and with equipment approved by the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection and was performed in accordance with the regulations adopted under subsection (d) of this section; (4) the device used for such test was checked for accuracy in accordance with the regulations adopted under subsection (d) of this section; (5) an additional chemical test of the same type was performed at least ten minutes after the initial test was performed or, if requested by the police officer for reasonable cause, an additional chemical test of a different type was performed, including a test to detect the presence of a drug or drugs other than or in addition to alcohol, provided the results of the initial test shall not be inadmissible under this subsection if reasonable efforts were made to have such additional test performed in accordance with the conditions set forth in this subsection and (A) such additional test was not performed or was not performed within a reasonable time, or (B) the results of such additional test are not admissible for failure to meet a condition set forth in this subsection; and (6) evidence is presented that the test was commenced within two hours of operation. In any prosecution under this section it shall be a rebuttable presumption that the results of such chemical test establish the ratio of alcohol in the blood of the defendant at the time of the alleged offense, except that if the results of the additional test indicate that the ratio of alcohol in the blood of such defendant is ten-hundredths of one per cent or less of alcohol, by weight, and is higher than the results of the first test, evidence shall be presented that demonstrates that the test results and the analysis thereof accurately indicate the blood alcohol content at the time of the alleged offense.\n\n(c)Evidence of blood alcohol content.In any prosecution for a violation of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of this section, reliable evidence respecting the amount of alcohol in the defendant's blood or urine at the time of the alleged offense, as shown by a chemical analysis of the defendant's blood, breath or urine, otherwise admissible under subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of this section, shall be admissible only at the request of the defendant.\n\n(d)Testing of blood, breath and urine.The Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection shall ascertain the reliability of each method and type of device offered for chemical testing of blood, of breath and of urine and certify those methods and types which the commissioner finds suitable for use in testing of blood, breath and urine, respectively, in this state. The Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, governing the conduct of chemical tests, the operation and use of chemical test devices, the training and certification of operators of such devices and the drawing or obtaining of blood, breath or urine samples as the commissioner finds necessary to protect the health and safety of persons who submit to chemical tests and to insure reasonable accuracy in testing results. Such regulations shall not require recertification of a police officer solely because such officer terminates such officer's employment with the law enforcement agency for which certification was originally issued and commences employment with another such agency.\n\n(e)Evidence of refusal to submit to test or evaluation.(1) In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) of this section, evidence that the defendant refused to submit to a blood, breath or urine test or the nontestimonial portion of a drug influence evaluation requested in accordance with section 14-227b shall be admissible provided the requirements of subsection (b) of said section have been satisfied. If a case involving a violation of subsection (a) of this section is tried to a jury, the court shall instruct the jury as to any inference that may or may not be drawn from the defendant's refusal to submit to such a test or evaluation.\n\n(2) In any prosecution for a violation of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of this section in which it is alleged that the defendant's operation of a motor vehicle was impaired, in whole or in part, by consumption of cannabis, as defined in section 21a-420, the court may take judicial notice that the ingestion of cannabis (A) can impair a person's ability to operate a motor vehicle; (B) can cause impairment of motor function, reaction time, tracking ability, cognitive attention, decision-making, judgment, perception, peripheral vision, impulse control or memory; and (C) does not enhance a person's ability to safely operate a motor vehicle.\n\n(f)Reduction, nolle or dismissal prohibited.If a person is charged with a violation of the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the charge may not be reduced, nolled or dismissed unless the prosecuting authority states in open court such prosecutor's reasons for the reduction, nolle or dismissal.\n\n(g)Penalties for operation while under the influence.Any person who violates any provision of subsection (a) of this section shall: (1) For conviction of a first violation, (A) be fined not less than five hundred dollars or more than one thousand dollars, and (B) be (i) imprisoned not more than six months, forty-eight consecutive hours of which may not be suspended or reduced in any manner, or (ii) imprisoned not more than six months, with the execution of such sentence of imprisonment suspended entirely and a period of probation imposed requiring as a condition of such probation that such person perform one hundred hours of community service, as defined in section 14-227e, and (C) have such person's motor vehicle operator's license or nonresident operating privilege suspended for forty-five days and, as a condition for the restoration of such license, be required to install an ignition interlock device on each motor vehicle owned or operated by such person and, upon such restoration, be prohibited for the one-year period following such restoration from operating a motor vehicle unless such motor vehicle is equipped with a functioning, approved ignition interlock device, as defined in section 14-227j; (2) for conviction of a second violation within ten years after a prior conviction for the same offense, (A) be fined not less than one thousand dollars or more than four thousand dollars, (B) be imprisoned not more than two years, one hundred twenty consecutive days of which may not be suspended or reduced in any manner, and sentenced to a period of probation requiring as a condition of such probation that such person: (i) Perform one hundred hours of community service, as defined in section 14-227e, (ii) submit to an assessment through the Court Support Services Division of the Judicial Branch of the degree of such person's alcohol or drug abuse, and (iii) undergo a treatment program if so ordered, and (C) have such person's motor vehicle operator's license or nonresident operating privilege suspended for forty-five days and, as a condition for the restoration of such license, be required to install an ignition interlock device on each motor vehicle owned or operated by such person and, upon such restoration, be prohibited for the three-year period following such restoration from operating a motor vehicle unless such motor vehicle is equipped with a functioning, approved ignition interlock device, as defined in section 14-227j, except that for the first year of such three-year period, such person's operation of a motor vehicle shall be limited to such person's transportation to or from work or school, an alcohol or drug abuse treatment program, an ignition interlock device service center or an appointment with a probation officer; and (3) for conviction of a third and subsequent violation within ten years after a prior conviction for the same offense, (A) be fined not less than two thousand dollars or more than eight thousand dollars, (B) be imprisoned not more than three years, one year of which may not be suspended or reduced in any manner, and sentenced to a period of probation requiring as a condition of such probation that such person: (i) Perform one hundred hours of community service, as defined in section 14-227e, (ii) submit to an assessment through the Court Support Services Division of the Judicial Branch of the degree of such person's alcohol or drug abuse, and (iii) undergo a treatment program if so ordered, and (C) have such person's motor vehicle operator's license or nonresident operating privilege permanently revoked upon such third offense, except that if such person's revocation is reversed or reduced pursuant to subsection (i) of section 14-111, such person shall be prohibited from operating a motor vehicle unless such motor vehicle is equipped with a functioning, approved ignition interlock device, as defined in section 14-227j, for the time period prescribed in subdivision (2) of subsection (i) of section 14-111. For purposes of the imposition of penalties for a second or third and subsequent offense pursuant to this subsection, a conviction under the provisions of subsection (a) of this section in effect on October 1, 1981, or as amended thereafter, a conviction under the provisions of either subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of this section, a conviction under the provisions of section 14-227m, a conviction under the provisions of subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of section 14-227n, a conviction under the provisions of section 53a-56b or 53a-60d or a conviction in any other state of any offense the essential elements of which are determined by the court to be substantially the same as subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of this section, section 14-227m, subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of section 14-227n or section 53a-56b or 53a-60d, shall constitute a prior conviction for the same offense.\n\n(h)Suspension of operator's license or nonresident operating privilege.(1) Each court shall report each conviction under subsection (a) of this section to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, in accordance with the provisions of section 14-141. The commissioner shall suspend the motor vehicle operator's license or nonresident operating privilege of the person reported as convicted for the period of time required by subsection (g) of this section. The commissioner shall determine the period of time required by subsection (g) of this section based on the number of convictions such person has had within the specified time period according to such person's driving history record, notwithstanding the sentence imposed by the court for such conviction. (2) The motor vehicle operator's license or nonresident operating privilege of a person found guilty under subsection (a) of this section who, at the time of the offense, was operating a motor vehicle in accordance with a special operator's permit issued pursuant to section 14-37a shall be suspended by the commissioner for twice the period of time set forth in subsection (g) of this section. (3) If an appeal of any conviction under subsection (a) of this section is taken, the suspension of the motor vehicle operator's license or nonresident operating privilege by the commissioner, in accordance with this subsection, shall be stayed during the pendency of such appeal.\n\n(i)Ignition interlock device.(1) The Commissioner of Motor Vehicles shall permit a person whose license has been suspended in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (C) of subdivision (1) or subparagraph (C) of subdivision (2) of subsection (g) of this section to operate a motor vehicle if (A) such person has served either the suspension required under said subparagraph (C) or the suspension required under subsection (i) of section 14-227b, and (B) such person has installed an approved ignition interlock device in each motor vehicle owned or to be operated by such person, and verifies to the commissioner, in such manner as the commissioner prescribes, that such device has been installed.

Court rejected defendant's claim that statute is void for vagueness because an ordinary person has no ascertainable method for measuring his or her own blood alcohol level. 48 CA 635. Because defendant was charged with violation of both Subdivs. (1) and (2) of Subsec. (a), intoxilyzer results are admissible without defendant's request and are necessary to prove a violation of Subsec. (a)(2) pursuant to Subsec. (c). 51 CA 4. To establish probable cause, there must be a temporal nexus between the operation of a motor vehicle and the driver's being under the influence of liquor or drugs. 54 CA 127. Detention at roadside sobriety checkpoint did not constitute unreasonable seizure or violate defendant's due process rights. 56 CA 252. Pursuant to Sec. 54-193(b), charged violations of section were subject to a 1-year limitations period because they were not punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year. 61 CA 90. There was substantial evidence that police had probable cause to believe that plaintiff had violated section where plaintiff had slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, smelled of alcohol, admitted he had been drinking beer and police found empty beer bottles in automobile; administration of field sobriety tests and subsequent results are not required by statute and are not dispositive in finding probable cause to arrest for driving while intoxicated. 62 CA 571. Nothing in section prohibits evidence of consciousness of guilt based on defendant's refusal to take a breath test being considered in prosecution for assault in the second degree with a motor vehicle under Sec. 53a-60d. 63 CA 433. Arresting officer properly permitted to offer expert testimony on defendant's intoxication. 68 CA 119. To convict defendant of operating motor vehicle while under the influence of drugs pursuant to section, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant operated his motor vehicle on a public highway while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs or both. 79 CA 657. Section, as applied to defendant, does not violate ex post facto clause because it did not result in a second punishment for previous convictions, but rather enhanced current conviction on the basis of defendant's status as repeat offender; section does not violate such clause given that defendant was effectively put on notice of changes to statute, and therefore he is precluded from relying on previous 5-year look back period to prove that state's burden of proof was reduced or that he was deprived of a defense. 80 CA 589. Because all the evidence submitted to court was consistent with court's finding that defendant had been operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, court had sufficient evidence to convict defendant of that offense. 93 CA 200. Starting car using a remote starter not considered first act to put vehicle in motion if person does not have the keys with him or her in the vehicle or if the whereabouts of the keys is unknown. 101 CA 709. Informant's report of erratic driver exhibited sufficient indicia of reliability to justify “Terry” stop of driver for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor, even though the police officer neither observed the errant driver nor knew informant's name. 103 CA 646. Defendant was ineligible for pretrial alcohol education program pursuant to Sec. 54-56g(f) because she was the holder of a commercial driver's license at the time she was charged with violating section. 110 CA 836. Legislature intended blood alcohol content evidence to be based solely on chemical testing and its admissibility to be contingent on the satisfaction of strict statutory criteria, e.g., the performance of multiple chemical tests administered by qualified law enforcement personnel within two hours of defendant's operation of the vehicle; permitting evidence in this behavioral prosecution case of a blood alcohol content derived from a subjective interpretation of defendant's performance on standard field sobriety tests, without using any of the approved methods and procedures, does great violence to the intent of this section. 177 CA 651.\n\nWhere sample of blood was taken from defendant when he was unconscious in a hospital and could not consent, the results of the test of his blood are not admissible in evidence since such taking was in violation of his constitutional rights and was not authorized by this section or Sec. 14-227b. 26 CS 40. The word “test” refers to the chemical analysis of a sample of blood and not to a series of samples from different individuals. 32 CS 611. Cited. 33 CS 501; Id., 697; 34 CS 514.

Defendant's act of inserting key into ignition, regardless of whether key was turned, constituted operation of a motor vehicle. 279 C. 546. Under 2005 revision, a person operates a vehicle when he uses a remote starter to start the engine and then sits in the driver's seat, thus taking the first act in a sequence of steps necessary to set in motion the motive power of a vehicle equipped with a remote starter. 291 C. 49.\n\nCited. 11 CA 185; Id., 644; 15 CA 58. State not required to prove that defendant intended to move vehicle in order to prove operation under statute. 22 CA 88. Intent to move a vehicle not an element of operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence in violation of section. 24 CA 467.

Proof of operation on public highway is question of fact and defendant Commissioner of Motor Vehicles made reasonable factual finding of such operation in case in which plaintiff was found seated in the driver's seat with seat belt on in his car on the shoulder of an interstate highway and the engine of the car was running. 48 CA 552. A person operates a motor vehicle when in the vehicle he intentionally does any act or makes use of any mechanical or electrical agency which alone or in sequence will set in motion the motive power of the vehicle. 50 CA 34. Defendant who was found unconscious behind wheel of car while engine was running could be deemed to have operated the vehicle for purposes of sustaining a conviction under section. 51 CA 782. Where defendant was found intoxicated, in the vehicle with the engine running and in a position to control the vehicle's movement, conviction under section was upheld. 60 CA 551. Evidence that defendant failed field sobriety tests and testimony of state toxicologist was sufficient to sustain conviction under section. 71 CA 497. It is inconceivable that legislature's broad umbrella of protection would insulate intoxicated persons from drunk driving laws pursuant to Subsec. because the parking area did not have zoning approval for 10 or more spaces; thus, a 9 space parking lot that regularly accommodates and is used by 10 or more cars satisfies requirements of statute. 76 CA 716. For purposes of finding violation under Subdiv. (1), the state of being under the influence of intoxicating liquor is not a fact on which the state is required to present expert testimony. 84 CA 519. A conviction under Subdiv. (1) is not inconsistent with an acquittal under Subdiv. (2). 98 CA 847. Defendant's action of inserting key into vehicle ignition is an act which alone or in sequence set in motion the vehicle's motive power and constituted operation of a motor vehicle within the meaning of Subsec. 102 CA 241. Trial court properly allowed defendant's statements as to his alcohol consumption and the results of field sobriety tests; police officer did not lack a reasonable, articulable suspicion to continue his investigation. 110 CA 41. Statute does not require the state to prove that defendant driver actually had difficulty driving the motor vehicle because of intoxicating liquor or drugs. 111 CA 315. Defendant's conviction for a violation of both Subdivs. (1) and (2) violated his right to be free of double jeopardy because they provide for different methods of proof of the same offense. Id., 466. Definition of “motor vehicle” in Sec. 14-212 applies and includes a moped. 112 CA 190. Court properly rejected defense allegation that proof of intoxication was caused solely by involuntary exposure to kerosene fumes in vehicle. 118 CA 556. Blood serum test results using a weight of alcohol to volume of blood ratio rather than a weight of alcohol to weight of blood ratio was sufficient to establish elevated blood alcohol content as defined in Subsec. 159 CA 137.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\nCited. 208 C. 812.\n\nCourt declined “to formulate or adopt a behavioral definition of driving while impaired”. 14 CA 216. Cited. 15 CA 58. Chemical analysis evidence of alcohol level not required to be reported as a percentage of weight and can be reported by volume and equipment that performed test must be approved by Department of Public Safety but is not required to satisfy criteria of regulations. 99 CA 563. State is required to establish as foundation for admissibility of chemical analysis evidence that test was performed with equipment approved by Department of Public Safety; it does not require that device satisfy criteria set forth in regulations. 106 CA 189. When evidence of amount of alcohol or drug in a defendant's blood or urine is excluded under section, then evidence of ratio, dependent upon amount, should also be excluded. 164 CA 406.\n\nSubdiv. (5) contains condition precedent to introduction of evidence concerning amount of alcohol in defendant's system as shown by chemical analysis of breath, i.e. that he be afforded additional chemical test. 34 CS 679. Requirements of this Subsec. apply only to prosecutions for violations of Subsec. (a), not to prosecutions under Sec. 53a-58a. 35 CS 511.\n\nSubdiv. (1): Defendant did not lack legal capacity to consent to the test merely because he was under a Probate Court conservatorship of his person and estate. 3 Conn. Cir. Ct. 47. Subdiv. (4): Defendant's claim that syringe used by physician to extract blood sample was a device used for the test and therefore had to be checked for accuracy had no merit. Id., 48. Subdiv. (4): Device referred to in Subdiv. is analysis equipment and not equipment used to collect blood sample. 5 Conn. Cir. Ct. 326.\n\nSubsec. (c):\n\nCited. 180 C. 252.\n\nRebuttable presumption as a permissive inference discussed. 41 CA 874. “Rebuttable presumption” under statute defined as a “permissive inference”. 48 CA 391. Based on the stipulated facts and inferences thereon, trial court reasonably concluded that the urine tests were commenced within 2 hours of operation as required by section. 51 CA 790. Although jury instructions used rebuttable presumption language of statute, such instructions were harmless since court also instructed jury re reasonable inferences and provided examples. 71 CA 179.\n\nSubsec. (d):\n\nDoes not proscribe admission of evidence that fails to satisfy regulatory requirements. 263 C. 390.\n\nUse of alcohol testing device measuring weight of alcohol per volume of breath rather than weight of alcohol per weight of blood as required by regulation did not require preclusion of test results, because Subsec. permits testing other than blood testing and does not require that testing device comply with regulatory requirements. 105 CA 59.\n\nSubsec. (e):\n\nCourt's instruction that jury “may make any reasonable inference” was permissible with respect to defendant's refusal to submit to a Breathalyzer test. 84 CA 519. Where trial court repeatedly explained to jury that consciousness of guilt was a permissive inference that it could draw only if it determined that defendant had refused to submit to breath test, court's instruction was well within parameters of section; defendant had no constitutional right to counsel when asked to submit to a breath test, and evidence of defendant's refusal to submit to test was properly admitted despite defendant's request to speak to counsel at time of proposed breath test. 118 CA 654.\n\nSubsec. (f):\n\nNot unconstitutionally vague under U.S. Constitution as applied to defendant. 41 CA 7. Jury was not misled when trial judge's instructions identified a permissive inference and substantially complied with statutory language; applicability of possible negative inference not limited to violation of Subsec. (a)(1). 63 CA 433.\n\nSubsec. (g):\n\nTrial court has clear duty under Subsec. to adjudicate second part of two part information in all cases in which information filed. 271 C. 115. Is constitutional and does not violate defendant's right to have a jury decide questions of fact as the question of whether New York's and Connecticut's drunk driving statutes are substantially similar is a question of law properly left to the court. 276 C. 503. The term “substantially the same” does not require the essential elements of the out of state statute to be the same in substance, but rather requires the basic and necessary parts of the crime in the out of state statute to be the same to a considerable degree. 346 C. 238.\n\nImposition of enhanced penalties for third time offense under Subsec. requires only third violation of Subsec. (a), and does not require previous conviction as second time offender. 90 CA 177. Enhanced penalties apply to a subsequent conviction only if the earlier conviction occurred before date of the conduct underlying subsequent violation. 118 CA 725. Statute does not require that prior convictions take place at separate times to trigger imposition of enhanced penalties; defendant's claim of improper conviction as third time offender rather than second time offender because her two prior convictions were entered on the same day was unavailing. 140 CA 347. Subdiv. (3): Certified records of prior convictions that indicated defendant's name, date of birth, operator's license number and address were sufficient evidence of prior convictions for purposes of Subdiv. 146 CA 701. Court case abstract without the case disposition and fingerprint card is, as a matter of law, insufficient evidence of prior conviction for defendant to be charged as a third time offender. 156 CA 792. Legislature clearly has instructed that one must look to the current revision of Subsec. (a)(1) or (a)(2) to determine if the prior conviction in any other state is substantially the same under for purposes of this Subsec. 204 CA 1.\n\nSubsec. (h):\n\nSubdiv. (3): Enhanced penalties apply to third conviction when only one of two prior convictions occurred within 5 years of the present conviction. 210 C. 573. Cited. 234 C. 918. Subdiv. (3) imposes enhanced penalties on those whose third violation of Sec. 14-227a(a) occurs within the 5-year period, regardless of when that conviction occurs; judgment of Appellate Court in 38 CA 8 reversed. 236 C. 18.\n\nPerson sentenced to mandatory minimum sentence not entitled to “good time credit” or “employment credit”. 17 CA 827. Administrative suspension of driver's license by Department of Motor Vehicles and prosecution by the court of underlying offense of driving while intoxicated does not violate separation of powers provision of state constitution. 51 CA 4. Statute providing for imposition of enhanced penalties when a person is convicted of a third offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor within ten years of prior conviction of the same offense does not require that the third conviction be within 10 years of all prior convictions. 70 CA 565.\n\nSubsec. (j):\n\nRequirement of a search warrant does not eliminate consent as a means of securing test results. 65 CA 634.\n\nSubsec. (k):\n\nMedical record was properly admitted as evidence re results of blood alcohol test; absence of specific admissibility standards in regulations indicates that commissioner, having been specifically authorized by legislature, determined no specific rules or procedures were necessary for samples collected and analyzed for medical diagnostic testing. 138 CA 420.\n\nSubsec. (l):\n\nCited. 42 CA 589. Does not govern admissibility of blood alcohol tests taken at out-of-state hospitals and is permissive in nature. 57 CA 484. Court satisfied that hospital's internal policy of having registered nurse draw blood from patients who are admitted and fact that emergency room was staffed with two registered nurses show that requirements of Subsec. have been met. 61 CA 90.",

As used in this section, “motor vehicle” includes a snowmobile and all-terrain vehicle, as such terms are defined in section 14-379.\n\n(b) (1) A police officer who has placed a person under arrest for a violation of section 14-227a, 14-227m or subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of section 14-227n may request that such person submit to a blood, breath or urine test at the option of the police officer, a drug influence evaluation conducted by a drug recognition expert, or both, after such person has been (A) apprised of such person's constitutional rights; (B) afforded a reasonable opportunity to telephone an attorney prior to the performance of such test or evaluation; (C) informed that evidence of any refusal to submit to such test or evaluation shall be admissible in accordance with subsection (e) of section 14-227a and may be used against such person in any criminal prosecution, except that refusal to submit to the testimonial portions of a drug influence evaluation shall not be considered evidence of refusal of such evaluation for purposes of any criminal prosecution; and (D) informed that such person's license or operating privilege may be suspended in accordance with the provisions of this section if (i) such person refuses to submit to such test or the nontestimonial portion of a drug influence evaluation, (ii) such person submits to such test and the results of such test indicate that such person has an elevated blood alcohol content, or (iii) the officer concludes, through investigation, that such person was operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, or both.\n\n(2) If the person refuses to submit to any test or drug influence evaluation, the test or evaluation shall not be given, except if the person refuses or is unable to submit to a blood test, the police officer shall designate another test to be taken. If a person submits to a breath test and the police officer, for reasonable cause, requests an additional chemical test of a different type to detect the presence of a drug or drugs other than or in addition to alcohol, the officer may administer such test, except that if such person refuses or is unable to submit to a blood test, the officer shall designate a urine test to be taken. The police officer shall make a notation upon the records of the law enforcement unit, as defined in section 7-294a, that such officer informed the person that such person's license or operating privilege may be suspended if (A) such person refused to submit to such test or nontestimonial portion of a drug influence evaluation; (B) such person submitted to such test and the results of such test indicated that such person had an elevated blood alcohol content; or (C) the officer concludes, through investigation, that such person was operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, or both.\n\n(c) If the person arrested refuses to submit to such test or nontestimonial portion of a drug influence evaluation or submits to such test, commenced within two hours of the time of operation, and the results of such test indicate that such person has an elevated blood alcohol content, the police officer, acting on behalf of the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, shall immediately revoke and take possession of the motor vehicle operator's license or, if such person is not licensed or is a nonresident, suspend the operating privilege of such person, for a twenty-four-hour period. The police officer shall prepare a report of the incident and shall mail or otherwise transmit in accordance with this subsection the report and a copy of the results of any chemical test to the Department of Motor Vehicles within six business days. The report shall contain such information as prescribed by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles and shall be subscribed and sworn to under penalty of false statement as provided in section 53a-157b by the arresting officer. If the person arrested refused to submit to such test or evaluation, the report shall be endorsed by a third person who witnessed such refusal. The report shall set forth the grounds for the officer's belief that there was probable cause to arrest such person for a violation of section 14-227a or 14-227m or subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of section 14-227n and shall state that such person had refused to submit to such test or evaluation when requested by such police officer to do so or that such person submitted to such test, commenced within two hours of the time of operation, and the results of such test indicated that such person had an elevated blood alcohol content. A drug influence evaluation need not be commenced within two hours of the time of operation. The Commissioner of Motor Vehicles may accept a police report under this subsection that is prepared and transmitted as an electronic record, including electronic signature or signatures, subject to such security procedures as the commissioner may specify and in accordance with the provisions of sections 1-266 to 1-286, inclusive. In any hearing conducted pursuant to the provisions of subsection (g) of this section, it shall not be a ground for objection to the admissibility of a police report that it is an electronic record prepared by electronic means.\n\n(d) If a police officer who has placed a person under arrest for a violation of section 14-227a or 14-227m or subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of section 14-227n does not request that such person submit to a blood, breath or urine test under subsection (b) of this section, or obtains results from a test administered under subsection (b) of this section that indicate that the person does not have an elevated blood alcohol content, such officer shall:\n\n(1) Advise such person that such person's license or operating privilege may be suspended in accordance with the provisions of this section if such police officer concludes, through investigation, that such person was operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, or both; and\n\n(2) Submit a report to the commissioner in accordance with the procedure set forth in subsection (c) of this section and, if such report contains the results of a blood, breath or urine test that does not show an elevated blood alcohol content, such report shall conform to the requirements in subsection (c) of this section for reports that contain results showing an elevated blood alcohol content. In any report submitted under this subdivision, the officer shall document (A) the basis for the officer's belief that there was probable cause to arrest such person for a violation of section 14-227a or 14-227m or subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of section 14-227n, and (B) whether the officer concluded, through investigation, that the person was operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, or both. With such report, the officer may submit other supporting documentation indicating the person's intoxication by liquor or any drug, or both. If the officer concludes, through investigation, that the person was operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, or both, the officer shall immediately revoke and take possession of the motor vehicle operator's license or, if such person is not licensed or is a nonresident, suspend the operating privilege of such person for a twenty-four-hour period.\n\n(e) (1) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, upon receipt of a report submitted under subsection (c) or (d) of this section, the commissioner may suspend any operator's license or operating privilege of such person effective as of a date certain, which date certain shall be not later than thirty days from the later of the date such person received (A) notice of such person's arrest by the police officer, or (B) the results of a blood or urine test or a drug influence evaluation.

The commissioner shall send a suspension notice to such person informing such person that such person's operator's license or operating privilege is suspended as of a date certain and that such person is entitled to a hearing prior to the effective date of the suspension and may schedule such hearing by contacting the Department of Motor Vehicles not later than seven days after the date of mailing of such suspension notice.\n\n(2) Upon receipt of a report that (A) the person's arrest involved an accident resulting in a fatality, or (B) the person has previously had such person's operator's license or operating privilege suspended under the provisions of section 14-227a, 14-227m or 14-227n during the ten-year period preceding the present arrest, the commissioner may suspend any operator's license or operating privilege of such person effective as of the date specified in a notice of such suspension to such person. A person whose operator's license or operating privilege has been suspended in accordance with this subdivision shall automatically be entitled to a hearing before the commissioner, to be held in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54. The commissioner shall send a suspension notice to such person informing such person that such person's operator's license or operating privilege is suspended as of the date specified in such suspension notice, and that such person is entitled to a hearing and may schedule such hearing by contacting the Department of Motor Vehicles not later than seven days after the date of mailing of such suspension notice. Any suspension issued under this subdivision shall remain in effect until such suspension is affirmed under subsection (f) of this section or such operator's license or operating privilege is reinstated in accordance with subsection (h) of this section.\n\n(f) If such person does not contact the department to schedule a hearing, the commissioner shall affirm the suspension contained in the suspension notice for the appropriate period specified in subsection (i) of this section.\n\n(g) (1) If such person contacts the department to schedule a hearing, the department shall assign a date, time and place for the hearing, which date shall be prior to the effective date of the suspension, except that, with respect to a person whose operator's license or operating privilege is suspended in accordance with subdivision (2) of subsection (e) of this section, such hearing shall be scheduled not later than thirty days after such person contacts the department. At the request of such person, the hearing officer or the department and upon a showing of good cause, the commissioner may grant one or more continuances.\n\n(2) A hearing based on a report submitted under subsection (c) of this section shall be limited to a determination of the following issues: (A) Did the police officer have probable cause to arrest the person for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, or both; (B) was such person placed under arrest; (C) did such person (i) refuse to submit to such test or nontestimonial portion of a drug influence evaluation, or (ii) submit to such test, commenced within two hours of the time of operation, and the results of such test indicated that such person had an elevated blood alcohol content; and (D) was such person operating the motor vehicle.\n\n(3) A hearing based on a report submitted under subsection (d) of this section shall be limited to a determination of the following issues: (A) Did the police officer have probable cause to arrest the person for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, or both; (B) was such person placed under arrest; (C) was such person operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, or both; and (D) was such person operating the motor vehicle.\n\n(4) In a hearing under this subsection, the results of the test, if administered, shall be sufficient to indicate the ratio of alcohol in the blood of such person at the time of operation, provided such test was commenced within two hours of the time of operation. The fees of any witness summoned to appear at a hearing under this subsection shall be the same as provided by the general statutes for witnesses in criminal cases.

(i)(1)(B) to provide for a suspension period of 120 days, “if such person submitted to a test or analysis and the results of such test or analysis indicated that the ratio of alcohol in the blood of such person was 0.16% or more of alcohol, by weight”, redesignating former Subpara. (B) as Subpara. (C), to revised Subsec. (i)(2) by replacing provision that specified a uniform suspension period of one year with provisions of Subparas. (A), (B) and (C) specifying a suspension period of 9 months if the person submitted to a test or analysis and had an elevated blood alcohol content, 10 months if the person submitted to a test or analysis and had a blood alcohol ratio of 0.16% or more of alcohol, by weight, and one year if the person refused to submit to a test or analysis, respectively, and revised Subsec.

(c) to eliminate requirement that police officer issue a temporary operator's license or nonresident operating privilege and to eliminate requirement that police officer mail to Department of Motor Vehicles a copy of completed temporary license form and any operator's license taken into possession, effective July 1, 2002; May 9 Sp. Sess. P.A. 02-1 amended Subsecs. (b), (c), (g) and (j) to eliminate references to operating a motor vehicle while the person's ability is impaired by the consumption of intoxicating liquor, amended Subsec. (n) to reduce ratio of alcohol in blood from 0.10% to 0.08% or more of alcohol in definition of “elevated blood alcohol content”, eliminate from such definition former Subdiv. (2) providing “if such person has been convicted of a violation of subsection (a) of section 14-227a, a ratio of alcohol in the blood of such person that is 0.07% or more of alcohol, by weight” and redesignate existing Subdiv. (3) as Subdiv. (2), and made technical changes in Subsecs. (b), (j) and (k), effective July 1, 2002; P.A. 03-278 made technical changes in Subsecs.

(k) to replace authorized suspension of “a period of up to ninety days, or, if such person has previously had such person's operator's license or nonresident operating privilege suspended under this section for a period of up to one year” with “the appropriate period specified in subsection (i) or (j) of this section”, effective January 25, 2008; P.A. 08-32 amended Subsec. (j) to add exception to period of suspension for first offense of persons 16 or 17 years of age, of 1 year for elevated blood alcohol content or 18 months for refusal to submit to test, effective August 1, 2008; P.A. 09-187 amended Subsec.

Question of whether police have a reasonable and articulable suspicion to justify investigative stop is outside scope of the 4 issues to be considered at a license suspension hearing conducted pursuant to statute. 252 C. 38. Defendant's being found intoxicated and asleep with key inserted in the ignition in the on position is sufficient evidence of operation of a motor vehicle. 281 C. 604. Suspension of driver's license is not a criminal conviction, therefore continued criminal prosecution under Sec. 14-227a did not violate defendant's federal and state constitutional rights against double jeopardy; neither definition of “conviction” under Sec. 14-1 nor administrative suspension under section forecloses future proceedings against defendant for the same offense. 290 C. 634.\n\nCited. 9 CA 686; 12 CA 427; 14 CA 212; 15 CA 58; 22 CA 142; 26 CA 101; Id., 805; 27 CA 346; 28 CA 733; Id., 911; 29 CA 576; Id., 582; 30 CA 36; Id., 108; 31 CA 350; Id., 797; 33 CA 501; 34 CA 189; Id., 201; Id., 557; Id., 655; 36 CA 710; 43 CA 636; 44 CA 702; 45 CA 225; Id., 577. Finding that plaintiff refused to submit to breath analysis valid where plaintiff had provided sufficient breath for previous test and was warned his failure to blow would constitute a refusal. 47 CA 509. Without legislative action to enlarge the scope of a license suspension hearing beyond the 4 issues specified in Subsec. (f), noncompliance with Subsec. (b) is irrelevant in such a proceeding. Id., 839. Court rejected defendant's claim that statute is void for vagueness because an ordinary person has no ascertainable method for measuring his or her own blood alcohol level. 48 CA 635. Where arrested person refuses to take breath test, statute requires presence of 3 persons: the arresting officer, person charged and a third party witness who may or may not be the same person who took the arresting officer's oath. 54 CA 62. Analysis provided for under section assumes a test for which results are obtained. 60 CA 455. Plaintiff was not operating motor vehicle within section's meaning because, at the time the officer approached, plaintiff was not doing any act, manipulating any machinery or making use of any mechanical or electrical agency that alone or in sequence would set in motion the vehicle's motive power. 92 CA 365. Determination that plaintiff refused to submit to a chemical alcohol test was supported by evidence that within 2 hours of operation of the motor vehicle, police officer asked plaintiff 3 times whether he would submit to testing and plaintiff did not consent but, rather, conditioned his decision to submit, and section does not permit an operator to rescind a refusal to submit to a chemical analysis of his or her blood, breath or urine. 156 CA 516. The extent of the errors and discrepancies in A-44 form far surpassed mere scrivener's errors and undermined the exhibit's reliability as a whole such that admitting such form as an exhibit in hearing under section was an abuse of discretion. 164 CA 616; judgment reversed, see 330 C. 651.\n\nPrior to statute, refusal of accused, while in custody, to submit samples of body fluids, unaccompanied by words or acts in the nature of admissions by conduct, was held inadmissible. 22 CS 321. Where sample of blood was taken from defendant when he was unconscious in a hospital and could not give his consent, such taking was in violation of his constitutional rights and was not authorized by section. 26 CS 41. Cited. 37 CS 767; 38 CS 675; Id., 689; 39 CS 285. At time of arrest, statute did not afford a statutory right to consult with counsel. 40 CS 512. Cited. 41 CS 437; 42 CS 1; Id., 306; Id., 599; Id., 602. In hearing on motor vehicle license suspension, failure of police to indicate on form use of certified analytical device not required by statute. 45 CS 489.\n\nCited. 3 Conn. Cir. Ct. 46; Id., 347. Competent evidence of any nature, in addition to a breath or blood test, may be relied on to prove insobriety. Id., 478, 479. Finding of operation must be made by the trier of the facts; state not empowered to request finding of operation after jury has been discharged and verdict has been accepted; circuit court's finding that defendant was operator of motor vehicle is a final judgment for purposes of Sec. 51-265. 4 Conn. Cir. Ct. 34, 46. Applies only to cases involved with driving under the influence of alcohol and not drugs; any test for drugs has no need for compliance with the relationship of time and arrest. 6 Conn. Cir. Ct. 303.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\nCited. 12 CA 338; 17 CA 250; 28 CA 708; 41 CA 7. Driver did not have fifth amendment right to consult with counsel before deciding whether to take breath test and failure of statute to require police officer to inform driver that his Miranda rights did not extend to taking a breath test did not deprive him of due process under fourteenth amendment. 53 CA 391.\n\nFailure to warn completely as required by statute renders suspension of license contrary to law. 40 CS 505. Reference to actual suspension period not required in warning to be given to operator. Id., 512.\n\nSubsec. (c):\n\nWritten report required by section may be admissible at administrative suspension hearing even if officer originating report was not currently certified to administer breath analysis tests. 229 C. 31. Incident report that was completed and mailed by arresting officer after three-day statutory deadline was inadmissible in license suspension hearing absent officer testimony; court erred in determining that statutory requirement was directory rather than mandatory. 348 C. 778.\n\nReport of refusal to take breath test properly admitted into evidence in administrative proceeding where plaintiff, arresting officer and testing officer were present during testing and arresting officer swore to report form in capacity as arresting officer and as witness to the refusal; court properly determined there was substantial evidence to support commissioner's finding of refusal by conduct where plaintiff failed to comply with officer's repeated instructions as to how test should be performed, improperly blew into Intoxilyzer and subsequently refused to blow into Intoxilyzer again. 61 CA 213. Refusal to take breath test can occur through conduct as well as expressed refusal. 70 CA 76. Watching refusal to submit to test via closed circuit television does not constitute “witnessing such refusal”. 101 CA 674. The time requirement in Subsec. for police officer to mail report and test results within three business days is a matter of convenience rather than a matter of substance and, therefore, is directory. 210 CA 109.\n\nSubsec. (d):\n\nBefore suspending a license, commissioner is not required to find that subject understood consequences of refusal to submit to chemical testing. 200 C. 1. License suspension hearing must be limited to the 4 issues set forth. 204 C. 507. Scope of administrative hearing clearly limited. Id., 521.\n\nSubsec. (f):\n\nLegislature created a “rebuttable presumption” that test results can be used in place of direct evidence. 48 CA 391. Re probable cause for traffic stop, an investigatory stop is authorized if the police officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the person has committed or is about to commit a crime. 49 CA 481.\n\nSubsec. (g):\n\nProbable cause not needed to make a lawful stop of a motor vehicle; investigative stops discussed. 47 CA 111. Trial court's findings relative to administrative hearing issues reviewed and affirmed. Id., 451. A hearing officer, after concluding that chemical alcohol tests are unreliable, may not reach an independent determination on basis of other evidence presented as to whether a person operated a motor vehicle with an elevated blood alcohol level, since such a determination is outside the narrow scope of the license suspension hearing. 117 CA 832. The alleged right to speak with an attorney before submitting to chemical testing of breath is not relevant to the 4 issues enumerated in Subsec. that are to be considered by the hearing officer in a license suspension hearing. 142 CA 361. Plaintiff had significant private interest in the use and enjoyment of his operator's license but risk of erroneous deprivation from the proper application of the presumption in Subsec. (g) is low; presumption that test results “shall be sufficient” to indicate operator's blood alcohol content at time of operation is not mandatory and permits, but does not require, hearing officer to infer blood alcohol content at the time of operation from the test results alone without the need for additional evidence; presumption may be overcome if hearing officer determines that test results are unreliable; plaintiff did not demonstrate that statute facially violated right to procedural due process in license suspension hearing. 210 CA 515.\n\nSubsec. (h):\n\nAdministrative suspension of driver's license by Department of Motor Vehicles and prosecution by the court of underlying offense of driving while intoxicated does not violate separation of powers provision of state constitution. 51 CA 4. Delivery by bulk certified mail of commissioner's decisions is sufficient notice. 62 CA 796.\n\nSubsec. (i):\n\nSubdiv. (1): Suspension of motor vehicle operator's license pursuant to Subdiv. does not continue until operator has installed ignition interlock device, but, rather, is strictly limited to forty-five days specified in statute. 344 C. 435.\n\nSubdiv. (1) does not contemplate an interim period between suspension and restoration, whereby an individual whose license or operating privilege has been suspended thereunder could operate a motor vehicle while escaping the responsibility of installing an ignition interlock device and avoiding exposure to criminal liability under Sec. 14-215(c). 201 CA 164; judgment reversed in part, see 344 C. 435.\n\nSubsec. (j):\n\nRe plaintiff's claim that hearing officer should only have considered plaintiff's medical report re inadvisability to take Breathalyzer test, hearing officer's consideration of other evidence was proper in this case. 62 CA 604. Subsec. does not require either that an operator suffer or be alleged to have suffered a physical injury before his blood can be taken at a hospital, and adoption of such a requirement would be inconsistent with the purpose underlying the 2009 amendment to Subsec. and render Subsec. inoperative. 192 CA 587.\n\nSubsec. (o):\n\nAppellate Court's implicit determination in 99 CA 563 that the Intoxilyzer's method of measuring blood alcohol content–extrapolating weight-by-weight measurement from weight-by-volume measurement–complies with the “by weight” directive in Sec. 14-227a(a), also applies to the same directive in this Subsec. 51 CS 452.",

Such blood samples shall be examined for the presence and concentration of alcohol and any drug by the Division of Scientific Services within the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection or by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, or by any forensic toxicology laboratory pursuant to an agreement with the office. Nothing in this subsection or section 19a-406 shall be construed as requiring such medical examiner to perform an autopsy in connection with obtaining such blood samples.\n\n(b) If any surviving operator whose motor vehicle is involved in an accident resulting in the serious physical injury, as defined in section 53a-3, or death of another person, and (1) a police officer has probable cause to believe that such operator operated such motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, or both, or (2) such operator has been charged with a motor vehicle violation in connection with such accident and a police officer has a reasonable and articulable suspicion that such operator operated such motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, or both:\n\n(A) A blood, breath or urine sample shall be obtained from such surviving operator. The test shall be performed by or at the direction of a police officer according to methods and with equipment approved by the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection and shall be performed by a person certified or recertified for such purpose by said department or recertified by persons certified as instructors by the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection. The equipment used for such test shall be checked for accuracy by a person certified by the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection immediately before and after such test is performed. If a blood test is performed, it shall be on a blood sample taken by a person licensed to practice medicine and surgery in this state, a qualified laboratory technician, a registered nurse, a physician assistant or a phlebotomist.

The commissioner may, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing held in accordance with chapter 54 and section 14-227b, suspend the motor vehicle operator's license or operating privilege of such person and require such person to install and maintain an ignition interlock device as provided for in subsection (i) of section 14-227b. Such hearing shall be limited to a determination of the following issues: (1) Was the person operating the motor vehicle; (2) was the person's sample obtained in accordance with, or drug influence evaluation conducted pursuant to, the provisions of subsection (b) of this section; and (3) was the examined sample found to have an elevated blood alcohol content, as defined in section 14-227b or was the person operating the motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, or both.\n\n(d) In any motor vehicle accident resulting in the death of a person, the law enforcement unit, as defined in section 7-294a, responding to the accident shall assign an officer trained in advanced roadside impaired driving enforcement to respond, if such an officer is available.\n\n(1971, P.A. 328; P.A. 75-308, S. 2; P.A. 76-245; P.A. 77-614, S. 323, 610; P.A. 79-47, S. 4; P.A. 80-142, S. 1; 80-190, S. 3; P.A. 93-381, S. 9, 39; P.A. 95-257, S. 12, 21, 58; 95-314, S. 6; P.A. 99-218, S. 5, 16; P.A. 00-196, S. 11; May 9 Sp.

(4) does not include a safe driving provision, it provides immunity to drivers of emergency vehicles from criminal liability for violating statutes governing direction of movement or turning in specific directions. 60 CA 647.\n\nSubsec. (d):\n\nProvisions require officers to exercise judgment in determining whether to pursue a fleeing motorist and therefore the duty imposed is discretionary and the phrase “due regard”, rather than mandating a particular response to specific conditions, imposes a general duty on officers to exercise their judgment and discretion in a reasonable manner. 336 C. 1.\n\nSubsec.
