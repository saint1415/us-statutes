Such approval shall be based on necessity for, location of and type of such signal light and shall be applied for on a form supplied by the Office of the State Traffic Administration and shall be submitted to said office by the traffic authority having jurisdiction. Approval of any such signal light may be revoked by the Office of the State Traffic Administration at any time if said office deems such revocation to be in the interest of public safety, and thereupon such signal lights shall be removed by the traffic authority having jurisdiction.\n\n(b) When traffic at an intersection is alternately directed to proceed and to stop by the use of signals exhibiting colored lights or lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian-control signals carrying word legends or symbols. Such lights or arrows shall apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians and shall indicate the following:\n\n(1) Circular green alone: Vehicular traffic facing a green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign or marking at such place prohibits either such turn or straight through movement, except that such traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and vehicles within a crosswalk or the intersection at the time such signal was exhibited; pedestrians facing the green signal, except when directed by separate pedestrian-control signals, may proceed across the highway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.\n\n(2) Yellow: Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter, when vehicular traffic shall stop before entering the intersection unless so close to the intersection that a stop cannot be made in safety; pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, except when directed by separate pedestrian-control signals, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.\n\n(3) Red alone: Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and remain standing until the next indication is shown; provided, on or after July 1, 1979, vehicular traffic traveling in the travel lane nearest the right hand curb or other defined edge of the roadway, unless a sign approved by the Office of the State Traffic Administration has been erected in the appropriate place prohibiting this movement, may cautiously enter the intersection to make a right turn onto a two-way street or onto another one-way street on which all the traffic is moving to such vehicle's right after such vehicle has stopped as required in this subdivision and yielded the right-of-way to pedestrians within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. Pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone, except when directed by separate pedestrian-control signals, shall not enter the roadway.\n\n(4) Green arrow: Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time, but such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians within a crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully within the intersection.\n\n(5) Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “Walk” or “Don't Walk” or the image of a walking person symbolizing “Walk” or an upraised hand symbolizing “Don't Walk” are in place, such signals shall indicate as follows: “Walk” or walking person symbol: Pedestrians facing such signals may proceed across the roadway in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles; “Don't Walk” or upraised hand symbol: No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while the flashing “Don't Walk” or flashing upraised hand symbol signal is showing.\n\n(c) When an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic sign or signal, it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:\n\n(1) Flashing red: When a red lens is illuminated by rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection, or at a limit line when marked or, if none, then before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.\n\n(2) When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles facing such signal may proceed through the intersection or past such signal only with caution.\n\n(d) Lenses of the following colors only shall be used and shall be arranged vertically in the signal face or, when necessary, horizontally, and shall conform to the following positions: When arranged vertically, red shall be located at the top, yellow shall be located directly below red and the remaining indications below the yellow in the following order: Flashing yellow, circular green, vertical arrow, left-turn arrow and right-turn arrow, as needed; when arranged horizontally, red shall be located at the left, yellow shall be located directly to the right of red and the remaining indications to the right of yellow in the following order: Flashing yellow, left-turn arrow, circular green, vertical arrow and right-turn arrow, as needed.\n\n(e) When lane-direction-control signals are placed over the individual lanes of a street or highway, vehicular traffic may travel in any lane over which a green arrow signal is shown, but shall not enter or travel in any lane over which a red X signal is shown.\n\n(f) If a traffic control signal, approved by the Office of the State Traffic Administration, is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 2518; 1967, P.A. 428; P.A. 75-297; P.A. 78-309, S. 1; P.A. 12-132, S. 29; P.A. 23-135, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: 1967 act restated provisions of Subsecs.

At any intersection where traffic is controlled by other traffic control signals or by police officers, pedestrians shall not cross the highway against a red or “Stop” signal and shall not cross at any place not a marked or unmarked crosswalk. A pedestrian started or starting across the highway or on any such crosswalk shall have the right-of-way over all vehicles, including those making turns, until such pedestrian has reached the opposite curb or safety zone.\n\n(c) Except as provided in subsection (c) of section 14-300c, at any crosswalk marked as provided in subsection (a) of this section or any unmarked crosswalk, provided such crosswalks are not controlled by police officers or traffic control signals, each operator of a vehicle shall grant the right-of-way, and slow or stop such vehicle if necessary to so grant the right-of-way, to any pedestrian crossing the roadway within such crosswalk. For the purposes of this subsection, a pedestrian is “crossing the roadway within such crosswalk” when the pedestrian (1) is within any portion of the crosswalk, (2) steps to the curb at the entrance to the crosswalk and indicates his or her intent to cross the roadway by raising his or her hand and arm toward oncoming traffic, or (3) indicates his or her intent to cross the roadway by moving any part of his or her body or an extension thereof, including, but not limited to, a wheelchair, cane, walking stick, crutch, bicycle, electric bicycle, stroller, carriage, cart or leashed or harnessed dog, into the crosswalk at the entrance to the crosswalk. No operator of a vehicle approaching from the rear shall overtake and pass any vehicle, the operator of which has stopped at any crosswalk marked as provided in subsection (a) of this section or any unmarked crosswalk to permit a pedestrian to cross the roadway.

Any such ordinance shall specify the following: (1) That a photo noise violation monitoring device shall be operated by a photo noise violation monitoring device operator; (2) that the owner of a motor vehicle commits a violation of the ordinance if the person operating such motor vehicle on a highway or other location causes such motor vehicle to emit a sound of eighty decibels or more and such sound is not caused by a horn described in subsection (e) of section 14-80; (3) the owner of a motor vehicle identified by a photo noise violation monitoring device as violating the ordinance shall (A) for a first violation, receive a written warning, (B) for a second violation, be fined one hundred dollars, and (C) for a third or subsequent violation, be fined two hundred fifty dollars; (4) payment of a fine and any associated processing fee, not to exceed fifteen dollars, may be made by electronic means; (5) a sworn member of a law enforcement unit or a municipal employee shall review and approve the recorded images before a citation is mailed to the owner of such motor vehicle; and (6) the defenses available to the owner of a motor vehicle allegedly committing a violation of such ordinance, which shall include, but need not be limited to, the defenses listed in subsection (g) of this section. Any municipality that adopts an ordinance under this section shall also adopt a citation hearing procedure pursuant to section 7-152c. Any funds received by a municipality from fines imposed pursuant to such ordinance may be used to pay the costs associated with the use of photo noise violation monitoring devices in the municipality.\n\n(b) The municipality may enter into agreements with vendors for the installation, operation or maintenance, or any combination thereof, of a photo noise violation monitoring device. If a vendor installs, operates or maintains a photo noise violation monitoring device, the vendor's fee shall not be contingent on the number of citations issued or fines paid pursuant to an ordinance adopted under this section.\n\n(c) (1) The municipality shall make efforts to randomize the locations of any photo noise violation monitoring devices throughout such municipality.\n\n(2) A photo noise violation monitoring device shall, to the extent possible, be installed in a manner to only record images of the number plate of a motor vehicle, and shall not, to the extent possible, record images of the occupants of such motor vehicle or of any other persons or vehicles in the vicinity at the time the images are recorded.\n\n(d) A photo noise violation monitoring device operator shall complete training offered by the manufacturer of such device or the manufacturer's representative regarding procedures for operating such device. The manufacturer or manufacturer's representative shall issue a signed certificate to the photo noise violation monitoring device operator upon such operator's completion of the training. Such signed certificate shall be admitted as evidence in any hearing conducted pursuant to section 7-152c.\n\n(e) The municipality shall ensure each photo noise violation monitoring device used by such municipality undergoes an annual calibration check performed at a calibration laboratory. The calibration laboratory shall issue a signed certificate of calibration after the annual calibration check. Such signed certificate of calibration shall be kept on file and admitted as evidence in any hearing conducted pursuant to section 7-152c.\n\n(f) (1) Whenever a photo noise violation monitoring device detects and produces recorded images of a motor vehicle allegedly committing a violation of an ordinance adopted under this section, a sworn member of a law enforcement unit or a municipal employee shall review the recorded images provided by such device. If, after such review, such member or employee determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a violation of the ordinance has occurred, such member or employee may issue a citation to the owner of the motor vehicle. The citation shall include the following: (A) The name and address of the owner of the motor vehicle; (B) the number plate of the motor vehicle; (C) the violation charged; (D) the location of the photo noise violation monitoring device and the date and time of the violation; (E) a copy of or information on how to view, through electronic means, the recorded images of the violation; (F) a statement or electronically generated affirmation by the member or employee who reviewed the recorded images and determined that the motor vehicle violated the ordinance; (G) verification that the photo noise violation monitoring device was operating correctly at the time of the alleged violation and the date of the most recent calibration check performed pursuant to subsection (e) of this section; (H) the amount of the fine imposed and how to pay such fine; and (I) the right to contest the violation and request a hearing pursuant to section 7-152c.\n\n(2) (A) In the case of an alleged violation involving a motor vehicle registered in the state, the citation shall be mailed to the address of the owner that is in the records of the Department of Motor Vehicles not later than thirty days after the identity of the owner is ascertained, provided a citation shall be invalid unless mailed to the owner not later than sixty days after the date of the alleged violation. (B) In the case of an alleged violation involving a motor vehicle registered in another jurisdiction, the citation shall be mailed to the address of the owner that is in the records of the official in the other jurisdiction issuing such registration not later than thirty days after the identity of the owner is ascertained, provided a citation shall be invalid unless mailed to the owner not later than sixty days after the date of the alleged violation.\n\n(3) The citation shall be sent by first class mail. A manual or automated record of mailing prepared by the municipality shall be prima facie evidence of mailing and shall be admissible in any hearing conducted pursuant to section 7-152c, as to the facts contained in the citation.\n\n(g) The following defenses shall be available to the owner of a motor vehicle who is alleged to have committed a violation of such ordinance adopted under this section: (1) The operator was driving an emergency vehicle, as defined in section 14-283, and making use of an audible warning signal device, including, but not limited to, a siren, whistle or bell which meets the requirements of subsection (f) of section 14-80; (2) the violation took place during a period of time in which the motor vehicle had been reported as being stolen to a law enforcement unit and had not been recovered prior to the time of the violation; (3) the photo noise violation monitoring device was not in compliance with the calibration check required pursuant to subsection (e) of this section; (4) the violation took place because the muffler in the motor vehicle was not in good working condition and the owner of the motor vehicle presents proof at a hearing conducted pursuant to section 7-152c that such muffler was replaced or repaired not later than fourteen days from the date of the violation; or (5) the owner of the motor vehicle presents proof at a hearing conducted pursuant to section 7-152c that the owner submitted the motor vehicle for inspection at a facility designated by the Department of Motor Vehicles and such vehicle was found to not emit a sound of eighty decibels or more when in operation.\n\n(P.A. 24-151, S. 133.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 24-151 effective July 1, 2024.",

No local building official shall issue a certificate of occupancy to any such person, firm, corporation or agency for such development until the conditions of the certificate issued by the office under this section have been satisfied. If the Office of the State Traffic Administration determines that any person, firm, corporation or agency has (1) started building, expanding, establishing or operating such a development without first obtaining a certificate from said office, or (2) has failed to comply with the conditions of such a certificate, it shall order the person, firm, corporation or agency to (A) cease constructing, expanding, establishing or operating the development, or (B) to comply with the conditions of the certificate within a reasonable period of time.
