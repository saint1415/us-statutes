The commissioner shall not issue registration for such motor vehicle or snowmobile for the next registration period if, according to the commissioner's records, it is then owned by the person against whom such tax has been assessed or by any person to whom such vehicle has not been transferred by bona fide sale. Unless notice has been received by the commissioner under the provisions of section 14-33a, no such registration shall be issued until the commissioner receives notification that the tax obligation has been legally discharged; nor shall the commissioner register any other motor vehicle, snowmobile, all-terrain vehicle or vessel in the name of such person, except that the commissioner may continue to register other vehicles owned by a leasing or rental firm licensed pursuant to section 14-15, and may issue such registration to any private owner of three or more paratransit vehicles in direct proportion to the percentage of total tax due on such vehicles which has been paid and notice of payment on which has been received. The Commissioner of Motor Vehicles may immediately suspend or cancel all motor vehicle, snowmobile, all-terrain vehicle or vessel registrations issued in the name of any person (A) who has been reported as delinquent and whose registration was renewed through an error or through the production of false evidence that the delinquent tax on any motor vehicle or snowmobile had been paid, or (B) who has been reported by a tax collector as having paid a property tax on a motor vehicle or snowmobile with a check which was dishonored by a bank and such tax remains unpaid. Any person aggrieved by any action of the commissioner under this section may appeal therefrom in the manner provided in section 14-134. For the purposes of this subsection, “paratransit vehicle” means a motor bus, taxicab or motor vehicle in livery service operated under a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the Department of Transportation or by a transit district and which is on call or demand or used for the transportation of passengers for hire.\n\n(2) For assessment years commencing on or after October 1, 2024, if any property tax, or any installment thereof, laid by any city, town, borough or other taxing district upon a motor vehicle remains unpaid, regardless of whether such motor vehicle is classified on the grand list as a registered motor vehicle or personal property pursuant to section 12-41, the tax collector of such city, town, borough or other taxing district shall notify the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles of such delinquency in accordance with subsection (e) of this section and guidelines and procedures established by the commissioner. The commissioner shall not issue registration for such motor vehicle for the next registration period if, according to the commissioner's records, it is then owned by the person against whom such tax has been assessed or by any person to whom such vehicle has not been transferred by bona fide sale. Unless notice has been received by the commissioner under the provisions of section 14-33a, no such registration shall be issued until the commissioner receives notification that the tax obligation has been legally discharged; nor shall the commissioner register any other motor vehicle, snowmobile, all-terrain vehicle or vessel in the name of such person, except that the commissioner may continue to register other vehicles owned by a leasing or rental firm licensed pursuant to section 14-15, and may issue such registration to any private owner of three or more paratransit vehicles in direct proportion to the percentage of total tax due on such vehicles which has been paid and notice of payment on which has been received. The Commissioner of Motor Vehicles may immediately suspend or cancel all motor vehicle, snowmobile, all-terrain vehicle or vessel registrations issued in the name of any person (A) who has been reported as delinquent and whose registration was renewed through an error or through the production of false evidence that the delinquent tax on any motor vehicle had been paid, or (B) who has been reported by a tax collector as having paid a property tax on a motor vehicle with a check which was dishonored by a bank and such tax remains unpaid.\n\n(b) (1) For assessment years commencing prior to October 1, 2024, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, in consultation with the Treasurer and the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, may enter into an agreement with the tax collector of any city, town, borough or other taxing district whereby the commissioner shall collect any property tax or any installment thereof on a registered motor vehicle which remains unpaid from any person against whom such tax has been assessed who makes application for registration for such motor vehicle.\n\n(2) For assessment years commencing on and after October 1, 2024, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, in consultation with the Treasurer and the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, may enter into an agreement with the tax collector of any city, town, borough or other taxing district whereby the commissioner shall collect any property tax or any installment thereof on any motor vehicle which remains unpaid from any person against whom such tax has been assessed who makes application for registration for such motor vehicle.\n\n(3) Any agreement entered into pursuant to subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection shall include a procedure for the remission of taxes collected to the city, town, borough or other taxing district, on a regular basis, and may provide that a fee be paid by the city, town, borough or other taxing district to the commissioner to cover any costs associated with the administration of the agreement. In the event an agreement is in effect, the commissioner shall immediately issue a registration for a motor vehicle owned by a person against whom such tax has been assessed upon receipt of payment of such tax and a service fee of two dollars, in addition to the fee prescribed for the renewal of the registration.\n\n(c) On and after March 1, 1989, any municipality may participate in a program administered by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles to facilitate the payment of fines for parking violations. If any such municipality elects to participate in such program, it shall provide for a notice of violation to be served personally upon the operator of a motor vehicle who is present at the time of service. If the operator is not present, the notice shall be served upon the owner of the motor vehicle by affixing notice to said vehicle in a conspicuous place, or, in the case of the city of Hartford Parking Authority, by regular or certified mail to the registered owner of the vehicle, which shall have the same effect as if the notice of violation was personally served on the owner or operator of the vehicle. In the case of any motor vehicle that is leased or rented by the owner, not more than thirty days after the initial notice of a parking violation for which a fine remains unpaid at such time, a second notice of violation shall be mailed to the address of record of the owner leasing or renting the motor vehicle to such operator. No fines or penalties shall accrue to the owner of such rented or leased vehicle for the violation for a period of sixty days after the second notice is mailed. Upon receipt of such notification, the owner of such rented or leased vehicle may notify the municipality as to whom the lessee was at the time of such issuance of the notice of violation, the lessee's address, motor vehicle operator's license number and state of issuance, and the municipality shall issue such notice of violation to such lessee. A participating municipality shall notify the commissioner of every owner of a registered motor vehicle who has unpaid fines for more than five parking violations committed within such municipality on and after March 1, 1989. Upon receipt of such notification, the commissioner shall not issue or renew the motor vehicle registration of such person until he receives notification from such municipality that the delinquent fines have been paid.\n\n(d) The provisions of subsection (c) of this section shall not apply to any person, firm or corporation engaged in the business of leasing or renting motor vehicles without drivers in this state with respect to any motor vehicle which is leased or rented. The commissioner shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to implement the provisions of subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(e) The tax collector of a city, town, borough or other district shall, at least once during each calendar month, notify the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles of any outstanding delinquent property tax payment or installment thereof for a registered motor vehicle or snowmobile. If a tax collector fails to provide such notice to the commissioner, the commissioner shall not be required to deny the issuance of a registration, pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, to the person against whom such tax has been assessed by said city or town, or by a borough or other taxing district located therein.\n\n(f) Any city, town, borough or other taxing district that notifies the commissioner of (1) a delinquency in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, or (2) an owner of a registered motor vehicle who has unpaid fines for more than five parking violations in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, may participate in a program to issue temporary registrations for passenger motor vehicles on behalf of the commissioner to persons whose registrations have been denied, and who subsequently make full payment to the city, town, borough or other taxing district for the amounts owed under said subsections. A participating city, town, borough or other taxing district shall issue such temporary registrations in accordance with subsection (i) of section 14-12 and shall retain the fees authorized in subsection (n) of section 14-49 for such registrations. The commissioner may adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 to carry out the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 2375; 1959, P.A. 455; 1961, P.A. 233, S. 6; 1967, P.A. 48; 448, S. 2; 1969, P.A. 752, S. 15; P.A. 78-348, S. 1, 6; P.A. 79-566; 79-610, S. 9, 20; 79-631, S. 20, 111; P.A. 80-372, S. 2; P.A. 88-346, S. 1, 2; P.A. 93-341, S. 8; P.A. 95-260, S. 8, 24; P.A. 96-167, S. 4; P.A. 03-264, S. 5; June 30 Sp.

If any such applicant has held a license from a state, territory or possession of the United States where a similar examination is required, the commissioner may waive part or all of the examination. If any such applicant is (A) a veteran who applies not later than two years after the date of discharge from the military and who, prior to such discharge, held a military operator's license for motor vehicles of the same class as that for which such applicant has applied, or (B) a member of the armed forces or the National Guard who currently holds a military operator's license for motor vehicles of the same class as that for which such applicant has applied, the commissioner shall waive all of the examination, except in the case of a commercial motor vehicle license, the commissioner shall waive the driving skills test for such applicant and may, in such commissioner's discretion, waive the knowledge test for such application, provided such applicant meets the conditions set forth in 49 CFR 383.77, as amended from time to time.

A license, containing such limitation as the commissioner deems advisable, may be issued or renewed in any case, but nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the commissioner from refusing a license, either limited or unlimited, to any person or suspending a license of a person whom the commissioner determines to be incapable of safely operating a motor vehicle. Consistent with budgetary allotments, each motor vehicle operator's license issued to or renewed by a person who is deaf or hard of hearing shall, upon the request of such person, indicate such impairment.

Before issuing a motor vehicle operator's license in accordance with this section or section 14-44c, the commissioner shall request information from the National Driver Registry and the Commercial Driver License Information System, in accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR section 383.73. Each driving history record shall contain a notation of the date on which such inquiry was made.\n\n(i) Penalties. (1) Any person who violates any provision of this section shall, for a first offense, be deemed to have committed an infraction and be fined not less than seventy-five dollars or more than ninety dollars and, for any subsequent offense, shall be fined not less than two hundred fifty dollars or more than three hundred fifty dollars or be imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both.\n\n(2) In addition to the penalty prescribed under subdivision (1) of this subsection, any person who violates any provision of this section who (A) has, prior to the commission of the present violation, committed a violation of this section or subsection (a) of section 14-215, shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or sentenced to perform not more than one hundred hours of community service, or (B) has, prior to the commission of the present violation, committed two or more violations of this section or subsection (a) of section 14-215, or any combination thereof, shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one year, and, in the absence of any mitigating circumstances as determined by the court, ninety days of the sentence imposed may not be suspended or reduced in any manner.\n\n(j) Regulations.

The license fee for each such license, payable to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, shall be as follows: (1) New motor vehicle dealer, seven hundred dollars; (2) used motor vehicle dealer, five hundred sixty dollars; and (3) repairer, three hundred forty dollars. Each such license shall be renewed biennially according to renewal schedules established by the commissioner to effect staggered renewal of all such licenses. If the adoption of a staggered system results in the expiration of any license more or less than one year from its issuance, the commissioner may charge a prorated amount for such license fee. Not less than forty-five days prior to the date of expiration of each such license, the commissioner shall send or transmit to each licensee, in a manner determined by the commissioner, an application for renewal. Any licensee which has not filed the application for renewal accompanied by the prescribed fee prior to the date of expiration of its license shall cease to engage in business. An application for renewal filed with the commissioner after the date of expiration shall be accompanied by a late fee of one hundred dollars. The commissioner shall not renew any license under this subsection which has expired for more than forty-five days.\n\n(b) (1) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, each applicant for a repairer's license shall furnish a surety bond in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars.\n\n(2) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, each applicant for a new car dealer's or a used car dealer's license shall furnish a surety bond in the amount of sixty thousand dollars.\n\n(3) Each applicant for a leasing or rental license issued pursuant to section 14-15, who is engaged in the leasing or renting of motor vehicles for periods of thirty days or more, shall furnish a surety bond in the amount of fifteen thousand dollars.\n\n(4) Each such bond required under subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, of this subsection shall be conditioned upon the applicant or licensee complying with the provisions of any state or federal law or regulation relating to the conduct of such business and provided as indemnity for any loss sustained by any customer by reason of any acts of the licensee constituting grounds for suspension or revocation of the license or such licensee going out of business. Each surety bond shall be executed in the name of the state of Connecticut for the benefit of any aggrieved customer, but the penalty of the bond shall not be invoked except upon order of the commissioner after a hearing held before said commissioner in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54. For purposes of this subdivision, “customer” does not include (A) any person, firm or corporation that finances a licensed dealer's motor vehicle inventory, or (B) any licensed dealer, in such person's capacity as a dealer, who buys motor vehicles from, or sells motor vehicles to, another licensed dealer.\n\n(5) The commissioner shall assess an administrative fee of two hundred dollars against any licensee for failing to provide proof of bond renewal or replacement on or before the date of the expiration of the existing bond. Such fee shall be in addition to the license suspension or revocation penalties and the civil penalties to which the licensee is subject pursuant to section 14-64.\n\n(c) The commissioner may request information from any applicant for a repairer's license or used car dealer's license concerning the financial status and ability of such applicant to comply with the requirements of this subpart and the regulations adopted thereunder. The commissioner shall review such information to determine if the applicant has sufficient financial resources to conduct the business in a manner consistent with the reasonable security and protection of its customers in regard to the duties and responsibilities imposed by the provisions of this subpart and the regulations adopted thereunder. The commissioner may refuse to issue a license if the applicant fails to provide any such information requested or, if, after review by the commissioner, the commissioner is not satisfied as to such applicant's financial status. The commissioner may, in any case deemed appropriate, grant a license on condition that the applicant post a surety bond, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, in an amount prescribed by the commissioner that is greater than the minimum amount required by the applicable provisions of said subsection (b). Any applicant aggrieved by any decision of the commissioner made pursuant to this subsection shall be afforded an opportunity for hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54. The commissioner may adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 to carry out the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(d) Any person, firm or corporation engaging in the business of the buying, selling, offering for sale or brokerage of any motor vehicle or of the repairing of any motor vehicle without a license shall be guilty of a class B misdemeanor.\n\n(e) The Commissioner of Motor Vehicles shall transmit to the Commissioner of Revenue Services and the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection a summary of any complaint that the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles receives alleging that a person, firm or corporation is engaging in the business of the buying, selling, offering for sale or brokerage of any motor vehicle or of the repairing of any motor vehicle without a license.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 2392; 1953, S. 1308d; 1961, P.A. 581, S. 10; 1967, P.A. 384; P.A. 75-577, S. 25, 126; P.A. 77-305; 77-376, S. 1, 3; P.A. 81-172, S. 4; P.A. 83-489, S. 8, 17; P.A. 84-254, S. 37, 62; 84-391, S. 5, 8; 84-508; 84-528, S. 1; P.A. 85-613, S. 29, 154; P.A. 86-58; June Sp.

Any dealer may make a written request to the commissioner for an exemption from filing such applications electronically due to a hardship, including, but not limited to, a lack of access to a device capable of communicating electronically. The commissioner may enter into an agreement with one or more nonprofit associations or organizations representing the interests of motor vehicle dealers to file such applications electronically on behalf of such dealer.

The commissioner shall notify such operator, in writing, of such requirement. A fee of not more than eighty-five dollars shall be charged for the retraining program. The commissioner, after notice and opportunity for hearing, may suspend the motor vehicle operator's license of any such operator who fails to attend or successfully complete the program until the operator successfully completes the program. The hearing shall be limited to any claim of impossibility of the operator to attend the retraining program, or to a determination of mistake or misidentification.\n\n(b) The retraining program shall be taught by a designee of the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles or by an instructor approved by the commissioner and shall (1) review principles of motor vehicle operation, (2) develop alternative attitudes for those attitudes contributing to aggressive driving behavior, and (3) emphasize the need to practice safe driving behavior. The retraining program shall be offered by the Department of Motor Vehicles or by any other organization certified by the commissioner to conduct such program in person in a congregate setting, through distance learning or through a combination of both in-person and distance learning, provided such distance learning has interactive components such as mandatory interactions, participation or testing. Any drivers' school, as defined in section 14-68, that meets the licensure requirements of part IV of this chapter shall be eligible to seek certification to offer the motor vehicle operator's retraining program. The commissioner shall determine the number of program providers necessary to serve the needs of the public. Each organization or drivers' school seeking certification or recertification to conduct such retraining program shall submit an application to the department in such form as the commissioner shall require and an application fee of three hundred fifty dollars. Each such applicant shall: (A) Be registered to do business in this state and continuously maintain good standing with the office of the Secretary of the State; (B) file and continuously maintain a surety bond in the amount of fifty thousand dollars. Such bond shall be conditioned upon compliance with the provisions of any state or federal law or regulation concerning the conduct of an operator retraining program and provided as indemnity for any loss or expense sustained by either the state or any person by reason of any acts or omissions of the program provider. Such bond shall be executed in the name of the State of Connecticut for the benefit of any aggrieved party, but the penalty of the bond shall not be invoked except upon order of the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles after a hearing held before the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54; (C) have a permanent place of business in this state where all operator retraining program records shall be maintained and accessible to the commissioner during normal business hours; (D) submit for approval by the commissioner a detailed curriculum and lesson plan, including any changes to such curriculum and lesson plan, which shall be used in each operator retraining class; and (E) electronically transmit information concerning enrollment and class completion to the commissioner at such times and in such form as the commissioner shall prescribe. Prior to the certification of an applicant, the commissioner shall investigate the applicant's character, driving history and criminal history. If the applicant is a business entity, such investigation shall include the principals and officers of such entity. The applicant shall submit to the commissioner any information pertaining to current or past criminal or civil actions. The certification of a program provider by the commissioner shall not be transferable and shall be valid for a two-year period. Recertification of a provider shall be at the discretion of the commissioner and in such form and manner determined by the commissioner.\n\n(c) Any person who is required to attend an operator retraining program shall have such requirement and the completion date of such requirement posted on such person's driving history record maintained by the commissioner. The date of class completion shall remain on such person's driving history record until such person has attained thirty-six consecutive months without any additional moving violations or suspension violations specified in subsection (a) of this section being posted to such person's driving history record. Until the completion of such thirty-six consecutive months, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles shall suspend such person's operator's license or operating privilege for: (1) Thirty days upon a first conviction for any specified moving violation or suspension violation; (2) sixty days upon a second conviction of any specified moving violation or suspension violation; and (3) ninety days for a third or subsequent conviction of a specified moving violation or suspension violation.\n\n(d) The commissioner shall adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 to implement the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section.\n\n(P.A. 93-181, S. 1, 4; P.A. 95-221, S. 3, 4; P.A. 98-182, S. 12, 22; May 9 Sp.

      "text": "(a)When commissioner shall require.To entitle any person to receive or retain a motor vehicle operator's license or a certificate of registration of any motor vehicle when, in the opinion of the commissioner, such person has a record on file with the commissioner which is sufficient, in the opinion of the commissioner, to require evidence of financial responsibility for the reasonable protection of other persons, the commissioner shall require from such person proof of financial responsibility to satisfy any claim for damages by reason of personal injury to, or the death of, any one person, of twenty-five thousand dollars, or by reason of personal injury to, or the death of, more than one person on account of any accident, of at least fifty thousand dollars, and for damage to property of at least twenty-five thousand dollars. When the commissioner requires proof of financial responsibility from an operator or owner of any motor vehicle, he may require proof in the amounts herein specified for each vehicle operated or owned by such person. If any person fails to furnish such proof, the commissioner shall, until such proof is furnished, suspend or revoke the license of such person to operate a motor vehicle or refuse to return any license which has been suspended or revoked in accordance with the provisions of section 14-111 or suspend or revoke the registration of any such motor vehicle or vehicles or refuse thereafter to register any motor vehicle owned by such person or refuse to register any motor vehicle transferred by such person if it does not appear to the commissioner's satisfaction that such transfer is a bona fide sale, or, if such person is not a resident of this state, withdraw from such person the privilege of operating any motor vehicle in this state and the privilege of operation within this state of any motor vehicle owned by such person. Prior to such suspension, revocation or withdrawal, notice thereof shall be given by the commissioner by a notice forwarded by bulk certified mail to the address of such person as shown by the records of the commissioner. No appeal taken from the judgment of any court shall act as a stay to any action of the commissioner authorized by the provisions of this section.\n\n(b)Certificate of insurance; bond; collateral.Such proof of financial responsibility shall be furnished as is satisfactory to the commissioner and may be evidence of the insuring of the named insured or resident relative of the named insured against loss on account of legal liability of the named insured or resident relative of the named insured for injury to or the death of persons and damage to property in the respective amounts provided by this section in the form of a certificate signed by any person authorized in writing by an officer of any company authorized to issue such insurance in this state or any agent of such company licensed under the provisions of section 38a-769, showing that a policy of insurance in such amounts, noncancellable except after ten days' written notice to the commissioner, has been issued to the person furnishing such proof and no insurance company or insurance agent shall refuse to make such filing of evidence of insurance during the time such insurance company has a valid policy in force covering the named insured or resident relative of the named insured and such company may charge a fee not to exceed ten dollars for such filing; or such proof may be the bond of a surety company or a bond with individual surety owning real estate, which bond shall be conditioned for the payment of such amounts and shall not be cancellable except after ten days' written notice to the commissioner. Such bond shall constitute a lien in favor of the state upon the real estate of any surety, which lien shall exist in favor of any holder of a judgment on account of damage caused by the operation of such person's motor vehicle, upon the filing of notice to that effect by the commissioner in the town clerk's office in the town where such real estate is located. Such proof of financial responsibility may also be evidence presented to the commissioner of a deposit by such person with the State Treasurer of a sum of money or collateral, the amount of which money or collateral shall be determined by and shall be satisfactory to the commissioner. The State Treasurer shall accept any such deposit and issue a receipt therefor, and, if such deposit is a sum of money, the state shall pay interest thereon if so directed by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management at a rate not greater than the amount received by the state. The Treasurer may deposit any money so received in any incorporated savings bank located in this state. Whenever any agent of an insurance company certifies to evidence of the insuring of any person, from whom proof of financial responsibility has been required, by the company for which such agent is authorized to solicit, negotiate or effect contracts of insurance, such company shall notify the commissioner of the cancellation or termination of the policy referred to in such certificate at least ten days before the effective date of such cancellation or termination, provided such notice shall not be required if such policy is renewed by such company, and provided a policy subsequently procured and referred to in a certificate filed with the commissioner shall, on the effective date of such policy, terminate the policy referred to in any certificate previously filed with respect to any motor vehicles designated in both certificates or, in case of an operator's policy, with respect to any operator designated in both certificates. Additional evidence of financial responsibility shall, upon request by the commissioner, be furnished to the commissioner.\n\n(c)Satisfaction of execution. Notice of suit.Such bond, money or collateral shall be held by the commissioner or Treasurer, as the case may be, to satisfy any execution issued against such person in any cause arising out of damage caused by the operation of any motor vehicle owned or operated by such person. Money or collateral so deposited shall not be subject to attachment or execution unless such attachment or execution arises out of an action for damages, including personal injury or death, as a result of the operation of any motor vehicle. Any person who furnishes proof of financial responsibility by a deposit of money or collateral shall, upon the service of any writ or summons arising out of any action for damages including personal injury or death caused by the operation of any motor vehicle, give written notice of such service to the commissioner, who shall require that additional evidence of financial responsibility be furnished to satisfy any judgment in any other action. If a judgment rendered against the principal on a surety or real estate bond is not satisfied within thirty days after its rendition, the judgment creditor may, for the judgment creditor's own use and benefit and at the judgment creditor's sole expense, bring an action in the name of the state against the company or person executing such bond. A reasonable sum, not exceeding ten dollars, shall be charged for such investigation of the title of any surety's real estate or of collateral so deposited and of the value of the same and for the filing fee to be paid to the town clerk.\n\n(d)Abstract of operator's record.Repealed by P.A. 73-549, S. 2, 4.\n\n(e)Information to be furnished injured person.The commissioner shall furnish any person who may have been injured in person or property by any motor vehicle, upon written request, with such information as has been furnished to the commissioner as evidence of the financial responsibility of any operator or owner of any motor vehicle.\n\n(f)Penalty for failure to return registration and number plates.Any operator or any registrant whose operator's license or certificate of registration has been suspended as herein provided or whose policy of liability insurance or surety bond has been cancelled or who fails to furnish additional evidence of financial responsibility upon request of the commissioner, shall immediately return to the commissioner such operator's certificate of registration and the number plate or plates issued thereunder. Failure to return such certificate and such number plate or plates shall be an infraction.\n\n(g)Cancellation of bond. Return of collateral.The commissioner may cancel such bond or return such evidence of financial responsibility or the Treasurer may, with the consent of the commissioner, return such money or collateral to the person furnishing the same, provided one year shall have elapsed from the date of the suspension of such license during which period such person has not, in the opinion of the commissioner, violated any provision of the motor vehicle laws referred to in subsection (a) of this section. The commissioner may direct the return of any money or collateral to the person who furnished the same upon the acceptance and substitution of other evidence of financial responsibility or at any time after one year from the expiration of any registration or license issued to such person.\n\n(h)Forging evidence of financial responsibility.Any person who forges or, without authority, signs any evidence of financial responsibility required by the commissioner in the administration of this section shall be guilty of a class D misdemeanor.\n\n(i)Removal of financial responsibility requirement.Any person from whom proof of financial responsibility has been required may, at the end of twelve months, apply to the commissioner for removal of such requirements in a manner as determined by the commissioner. The commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative may make such further investigation as may be deemed necessary and, upon being satisfied that such applicant is entitled to such elimination of financial requirements, may eliminate the same.\n\n(j)When commissioner may require proof of financial responsibility.To entitle any person to receive or retain a motor vehicle operator's license or a certificate of registration of any motor vehicle when, in the opinion of the commissioner, such person has committed larceny of a motor vehicle, the value of which exceeds ten thousand dollars, or violated any of the provisions of the following-named sections and subsections: Section 14-44, section 14-80h or 14-80i, sections 14-110, 14-147, 14-217, 14-219, sections 14-228, 14-275 to 14-281, inclusive, or any similar provision of the laws of any other state or any territory, or who has been convicted of, or has forfeited any bond taken for appearance for, or has received a suspended judgment or sentence for, a violation of any of said provisions, or a violation of any of the provisions of sections 14-230 to 14-247, inclusive, and 38a-371, within a twelve-month period following a violation of any of said sections, the commissioner may require from such person proof of financial responsibility to satisfy any claim for damages by reason of personal injury to, or the death of, any one person, of twenty-five thousand dollars, or by reason of personal injury to, or the death of, more than one person on account of any accident, of at least fifty thousand dollars, and for damage to property of at least twenty-five thousand dollars. When the commissioner requires proof of financial responsibility from an operator or owner of any motor vehicle, he may require proof in the amounts herein specified for each vehicle operated or owned by such person. If any person fails to furnish such proof, the commissioner shall, until such proof is furnished, suspend or revoke the license of such person to operate a motor vehicle or refuse to return any license which has been suspended or revoked in accordance with the provisions of section 14-111 or suspend or revoke the registration of any such motor vehicle or vehicles or refuse thereafter to register any motor vehicle owned by such person or refuse to register any motor vehicle transferred by such person if it does not appear to the commissioner's satisfaction that such transfer is a bona fide sale, or, if such person is not a resident of this state, withdraw from such person the privilege of operating any motor vehicle in this state and the privilege of operation within this state of any motor vehicle owned by such person. Prior to such suspension, revocation or withdrawal, notice thereof shall be given by the commissioner by a notice forwarded by bulk certified mail to the address of such person as shown by the records of the commissioner. No appeal taken from the judgment of any court shall act as a stay to any action of the commissioner authorized by the provisions of this section.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 2457; 1949, 1951, S. 1347d; 1951, 1953, S. 1348d; 1951, S. 1349d; 1957, P.A. 612, S. 4; 1959, P.A. 353; 629; February, 1965, P.A. 574, S. 18; 1967, P.A. 213, S. 1; 1969, P.A. 322; 490, S. 1; 1971, P.A. 386; 487, S. 2; 790; 871, S. 87; 1972, P.A. 273, S. 32; P.A. 73-139, S. 1, 2; 73-549, S. 2, 4; P.A. 74-338, S. 54, 94; P.A. 75-306, S. 1, 2; 75-577, S. 63, 126; P.A. 77-358, S. 1, 2; 77-614, S. 19, 610; P.A. 80-466, S. 19–21, 25; P.A. 81-172, S. 9, 10; 81-472, S. 21, 22, 159; P.A. 82-472, S. 42, 43, 183; P.A. 83-98, S. 1, 2, 4; 83-244; P.A. 84-429, S. 63; P.A. 88-27, S. 3; P.A. 92-12, S. 110; P.A. 96-180, S. 150, 166; P.A. 04-199, S. 1; P.A. 12-80, S. 64; June Sp.

At any public auction held pursuant to this subsection, such owner or keeper may set a minimum bid equal to the amount of such owner's or keeper's charges and obligations with respect to the tow and storage of the motor vehicle. If no such bid is made, such owner or keeper may sell or dispose of such vehicle.\n\n(h) The notice of intent to sell described in subsection (g) of this section shall include the make, model and vehicle identification number of such motor vehicle, the date such motor vehicle was left with the owner or keeper of the garage for storage and by whom and the registration number thereof if any number plates are on such motor vehicle, and shall be placed on file by the commissioner and subject to public inspection. The notice of intent to sell shall be accompanied by a statement to the owner and known lienholder of such motor vehicle indicating the date, time and place of the sale of such motor vehicle, and the manner of the sale, as specified in subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (g) of this section. Such owner or keeper shall give such notice and accompanying statement to such motor vehicle owner and lienholder by certified mail, return receipt requested. Such statement shall indicate that any proceeds in excess of such owner's or keeper's charges and obligations may be claimed by the owner of such motor vehicle within one year from the date of such sale. The fee for filing such notice of intent and accompanying statement shall be ten dollars. Any sale under the provisions of this section shall be void, unless such owner or keeper provides the notice required by this section.\n\n(i) At the time of a sale conducted under subsection (g) of this section, such owner or keeper shall provide the purchaser of such motor vehicle with the affidavit of compliance issued by the commissioner.
