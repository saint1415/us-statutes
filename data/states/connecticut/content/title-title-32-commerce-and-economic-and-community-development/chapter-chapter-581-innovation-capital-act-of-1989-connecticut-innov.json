It is further found and declared that Connecticut ranks very high among the states on a per capita basis in the amount of prime defense contracts awarded; that the economies of many areas in the state and the employment opportunities offered by many businesses in the state are heavily defense-dependent and would suffer severe adverse impacts in the event of prime defense contract cutbacks; that there exists a great and growing need for assistance to and encouragement of defense-dependent businesses and other businesses and enterprises in finding solutions for the problems related to defense conversion and in executing new technologies which will maintain employment and tax revenues in the event of prime defense contract cutbacks; that assistance and encouragement of defense-dependent businesses and other businesses and enterprises in finding solutions for the problems related to defense conversion and in executing new technologies which will maintain employment and tax revenues in the event of prime defense contract cutbacks is an important function of the state; that the availability of financial assistance is an important inducement to defense-dependent businesses and to other businesses and enterprises to remain or locate in this state and to develop non-defense-related capacities or expand their existing non-defense-related capacities; that there exists in this state a serious shortage of seed venture capital to promote the development and exploitation of non-defense-related invention and products; that this shortage has resulted and will result in a serious decrease in job opportunities in the event of prime defense contract cutbacks; and, further, that providing state financial assistance for the development of products, innovation and invention for defense conversion by defense-dependent businesses and other businesses and enterprises in this state will assist in the creation of new products and industry in this state, reducing the dependency of the businesses in this state on defense contracts, and resulting in the maintenance of employment and public revenues in the event of prime defense contract cutbacks; and therefore the necessity in the public interest and for the public benefit and good for the provisions of this chapter is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.\n\n(1972, P.A. 248, S. 2; P.A. 80-267, S. 1; P.A. 89-245, S. 7.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 80-267 added provision re state economy's dependence upon prime defense contracts; P.A. 89-245 added findings re the creation of new technology-based business, the need for existing business and industry to innovate, the need to build partnerships to foster a greater entrepreneurial climate, the importance of attracting funds and providing financial assistance for research into new products and processes, the need for a uniform state science and technology policy, the need for a centralized clearinghouse, the need to provide services to advance the adoption and utilization of technology and improve the quality of products and services and the need to promote academic discipline essential to technology development and application, and made certain technical changes.\n\nCited. 167 C. 111.",

Pending disbursement as financial assistance to eligible recipients, moneys in or received for the fund may be deposited with and invested by any institution as may be designated by the administrator at its sole discretion and paid as the administrator shall direct. The administrator may make payments from such deposit accounts for use in accordance with the provisions of this section. Earnings attributable to such investments shall be credited to the fund and shall become part of the assets of the fund. Any balance remaining in the fund at the end of any fiscal year shall be carried forward in the fund for the fiscal year next succeeding.\n\n(b) Any amount received by the administrator as repayment of loan principal or any other recovery of the original amount of financial assistance provided from the Connecticut Bioscience Innovation Fund to an eligible recipient shall be deposited and held for the use and benefit of the fund. Any income, earnings or return on investment in excess of such original amount and any repayment of interest received by the administrator shall be deemed unrestricted funds of the corporation as described in subsection (b) of section 32-41a.\n\n(c) The Connecticut Bioscience Innovation Fund shall not be deemed an account within the General Fund and shall be used exclusively for the purposes provided in this section.\n\n(d) The Connecticut Bioscience Innovation Fund shall be used (1) to provide financial assistance to eligible recipients as may be approved by the advisory committee pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, (2) to provide financial assistance to eligible institutions as defined in section 32-41jj and pursuant to the requirements of sections 32-41jj to 32-41mm, inclusive, (3) for the repayment of state bonds in such amounts as may be required by the State Bond Commission, and (4) to pay or reimburse the administrator for administrative costs pursuant to subsection (j) of this section.
