Such evaluation shall consider, among other factors, any change in the percentage of residents within such census tract who have incomes below the federal poverty level, and whether the actions taken pursuant to such grant during the initial grant period: (1) May reasonably result in a future reduction in the percentage of residents within such census tract who have incomes below the federal poverty level, (2) have resulted in a reduction in child poverty within such census tract, (3) may reasonably result in a future reduction in child poverty within such census tract, or (4) may reasonably decrease the likelihood that children who are currently living within such census tract will have incomes below the federal poverty level after they reach adulthood. Upon a determination by the commissioner that reasonable progress has been made, the municipality shall be eligible for subsequent grants under this section, provided at the conclusion of each subsequent grant period of three years, each applicant municipality shall be subject to an evaluation and determination under this subsection prior to being eligible to apply for a subsequent grant. An application for a subsequent grant and the awarding of a subsequent grant shall be in accordance with the provisions of subsections (c) to (e), inclusive, of this section.\n\n(g) Not later than August 1, 2024, and annually thereafter until August 1, 2029, the commissioner shall submit a report, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a, to the General Assembly, that includes the municipalities that submitted applications and that were awarded grants under this section in the prior fiscal year, a description of each purpose and eligible project a municipality awarded a grant under this section is seeking to accomplish or undertaking, a progress report, if applicable, for each such purpose or eligible project and any other information the commissioner deems relevant.\n\n(P.A. 23-205, S. 101.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 23-205 effective July 1, 2023.",

      "text": "(a) It is hereby declared that there exists concentrated poverty in the state that exacts a critical toll on poor and nonpoor residents of communities that house areas of concentrated poverty, which create lifelong and persistent disadvantages across generations by lowering the quality of educational and employment opportunities, limiting health care access and diminishing health outcomes, increasing exposure to crime, reducing available choices for affordable and properly maintained housing and imposing obstacles to wealth-building and economic mobility. It is further declared that the development and implementation of the ten-year plan under this section to eradicate concentrated poverty in the state are necessary and for the public benefit, as a matter of legislative determination.\n\n(b) There is established an Office of Neighborhood Investment and Community Engagement within the Department of Economic and Community Development. Said office shall carry out the provisions of this section, overseeing the implementation of the ten-year plan developed pursuant to this subsection, monitoring the state's progress in reducing concentrated poverty in the state and serving as the facilitator to coordinate communication between the various parties and disseminate information in a timely and efficient manner.\n\n(c) (1) There is established a pilot program to implement the provisions of the ten-year plan developed pursuant to this section for participating concentrated poverty census tracts. Any concentrated poverty census tract or group of tracts (A) that is located in any of the four municipalities with the greatest number of concentrated poverty census tracts, and (B) for which community members have established a community development corporation pursuant to the provisions of section 32-7s to assist the municipality in which such census tract or group of tracts is located in carrying out the municipality's responsibilities under this section and the ten-year plan developed for such census tract or group of tracts, shall be eligible to apply to participate in the program. Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, any municipality in which a concentrated poverty census tract or group of tracts is located and for which a community development corporation has been established as described under subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, or any such community development corporation, may apply to participate in the program. The Commissioner of Economic and Community Development shall issue a request for proposals for participation in the pilot program and select the applicant with the highest score. As used in this section, “concentrated poverty census tract” means a census tract identified as a high poverty-low opportunity census tract, as of January 1, 2024, by the Office of Policy and Management pursuant to section 32-7x of the 2024 supplement to the general statutes.\n\n(2) (A) The Office of Neighborhood Investment and Community Engagement shall develop a plan for the pilot participating concentrated poverty census tract or group of tracts, as applicable, to eradicate, over ten years, the levels of concentrated poverty in the service area of the community development corporation, evidenced by a reduction, to twenty per cent or lower, in the percentage of households who reside in such concentrated poverty census tract or group of tracts and have incomes below the federal poverty level, as well as sustained improvements in community infrastructure and other underlying conditions that serve to prolong concentrated poverty and economic inertia in such census tract or group of tracts. In developing such plan, said office shall consult with the Office of Community Economic Development Assistance established under section 32-7s, the Office of Workforce Strategy established under section 4-124w, the Office of Early Childhood, the Department of Education, the Office of Policy and Management, the applicable community development corporations serving the participating concentrated poverty census tract or group of tracts and the applicable municipal chief elected officials and any other public or private entity the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development deems relevant or necessary to achieving the purposes of this subsection.\n\n(B) The ten-year plan shall include, but need not be limited to, (i) measurable steps to be taken for its implementation, the target date by which each such step is to be completed and the state or municipal official or state or municipal agency, department or division responsible for each such step, (ii) minimum state-wide averages for educational metrics, including, but not limited to, kindergarten-readiness, grade level reading and mathematics and college-readiness or career-readiness, to be used as benchmarks for improvements in such concentrated poverty census tract or group of tracts, as applicable, and (iii) the list of possible projects determined pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection.\n\n(C) On or before June 1, 2025, the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development shall inform the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to finance, revenue and bonding, in writing, of the progress made to date in the development of the ten-year plan. Not later than January 1, 2026, said commissioner shall submit such plan to the General Assembly, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a, and the Office of Neighborhood Investment and Community Engagement shall immediately commence overseeing the implementation of such plan.\n\n(3) The Office of Neighborhood Investment and Community Engagement shall, jointly with the chief elected official of each applicable municipality and the community development corporation established to assist such municipality, develop a list of possible projects that will be included in the ten-year plan for the participating concentrated poverty census tract or group of tracts, as applicable, located in such municipality. Said office, official and corporation shall (A) determine the types of projects they deem to be the most appropriate and effective for such census tract or group of tracts to eradicate concentrated poverty within such census tract or group of tracts, including, but not limited to, capital projects, workforce development programs, housing development, community and neighborhood improvements and education initiatives to assist and support residents in meeting and surpassing the educational metrics described in subparagraph (B)(ii) of subdivision (2) of this subsection, and (B) take into account the criteria for projects eligible for grants under sections 32-7s, 32-7x and 32-285a.\n\n(4) Not later than February 1, 2027, and annually thereafter, the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development shall submit a report to the General Assembly, the Office of Workforce Strategy, the Office of Early Childhood and the Office of Policy and Management, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a, that summarizes the progress being made by the Office of Neighborhood Investment and Community Engagement in implementing the ten-year plan, the status of any projects pending or undertaken for the participating concentrated poverty census tract or group of tracts and any other information the commissioner or the Office of Neighborhood Investment and Community Engagement deems relevant or necessary.\n\n(5) (A) Commencing with the calendar year 2027, not later than March first of said year and annually thereafter for the next two years, the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to finance, revenue and bonding shall hold an informational forum for the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development to present the contents of the submitted report and for other state officials, municipal officials, representatives of community development corporations serving participating concentrated poverty census tracts or groups of tracts and other interested parties to provide oral and written comments on the submitted report and the pilot program.\n\n(B) Commencing with the calendar year 2030, said committee shall hold such informational forum every two years.\n\n(d) On and after the date the ten-year plan is submitted to the General Assembly pursuant to subparagraph (C) of subdivision (2) of subsection (c) of this section, each state agency shall give priority to projects included in such ten-year plan with respect to any grants or funding programs such agency awards or administers and for which such projects may be eligible.\n\n(e) Not later than January 1, 2029, the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development shall submit a recommendation to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to finance, revenue and bonding of (1) whether the pilot program should be expanded to all concentrated poverty census tracts or groups of tracts in the state for which a community development corporation has been established as described under subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of subsection (c) of this section, and (2) any additional or alternative criteria to be considered for expansion of the pilot program to other economically disadvantaged census tracts that do not fall within the definition of a concentrated poverty census tract. If the commissioner recommends expansion under subdivision (1) of this subsection, the commissioner and the Office of Neighborhood Investment and Community Engagement shall immediately undertake such expansion.\n\n(f) On and after July 1, 2027, if any state or municipal official responsible for carrying out a requirement or responsibility under the provisions of this section or a ten-year plan fails to do so in a timely manner, any community development corporation established as described under subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of subsection (c) of this section that was (1) selected pursuant to the request for proposals under subdivision (1) of subsection (c) of this section, (2) can demonstrate good faith efforts to effectuate the ten-year plan, and (3) is aggrieved by such failure may bring an action against such official in the superior court for the judicial district in which such census tract or group of tracts is located for a writ of mandamus to compel such official to carry out such requirement or responsibility.\n\n(P.A. 24-151, S. 118.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 24-151 effective June 6, 2024.",

Any municipality which, at any time subsequent to July 1, 1978, has met such thresholds but which at any time thereafter fails to meet such thresholds, according to said department, shall be deemed to be a distressed municipality for a period of five years subsequent to the date of the determination that such municipality fails to meet such thresholds, except that any municipality with a population that was more than one hundred thousand as of the most recent United States census at the time of such determination shall be deemed to be a distressed municipality for a period of ten years subsequent to the date of such determination. Any distressed municipality that fails to meet the distress thresholds may elect to terminate its designation as a distressed municipality, by vote of its legislative body, not later than September 1, 1985, or not later than three months after receiving notification from the commissioner that it no longer meets such thresholds, whichever is later. In the event a distressed municipality elects to terminate its designation, the municipality shall notify the commissioner and the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management in writing within thirty days. In the event that the commissioner determines that amendatory federal legislation or administrative regulation has materially changed the distress thresholds thereby established, “distressed municipality” means any municipality in the state which meets comparable thresholds of distress which are then applicable in the areas of high unemployment and poverty, aging housing stock and low or declining rates of growth in job creation, population and per capita income as established by the commissioner, consistent with the purposes of subdivisions (59) and (60) of section 12-81 and sections 12-217e, 32-9p to 32-9s, inclusive, and 32-23p, in regulations adopted in accordance with chapter 54. For purposes of sections 32-9p to 32-9s, inclusive, “distressed municipality” also means any municipality adversely impacted by a major plant closing, relocation or layoff, provided the eligibility of a municipality shall not exceed two years from the date of such closing, relocation or layoff. The Commissioner of Economic and Community Development shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, which define what constitutes a “major plant closing, relocation or layoff” for purposes of sections 32-9p to 32-9s, inclusive. “Distressed municipality” also means the portion of any municipality which is eligible for designation as an enterprise zone pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of section 32-70.\n\n(c) “Eligibility certificate” means a certificate issued by the department pursuant to section 32-9r evidencing its determination that a facility for which an application for assistance has been submitted qualifies as a manufacturing facility and is eligible for assistance under section 12-217e and subdivisions (59) and (60) of section 12-81.\n\n(d) “Manufacturing facility” means any plant, building, other real property improvement, or part thereof, (1) which (A) is constructed or substantially renovated or expanded on or after July 1, 1978, in a distressed municipality, a targeted investment community as defined in section 32-222, an enterprise zone designated pursuant to section 32-70 or an airport development zone established pursuant to section 32-75d, or (B) is acquired on or after July 1, 1978, in a distressed municipality, a targeted investment community as defined in section 32-222, an enterprise zone designated pursuant to said section 32-70 or an airport development zone established pursuant to section 32-75d, by a business organization which is unrelated to and unaffiliated with the seller, after having been idle for at least one year prior to its acquisition and regardless of its previous use; (2) which is to be used for the manufacturing, processing or assembling of raw materials, parts or manufactured products, for research and development facilities directly related to manufacturing, for the significant servicing, overhauling or rebuilding of machinery and equipment for industrial use, or, except as provided in this subsection, for warehousing and distribution or, (A) if located in an enterprise zone designated pursuant to said section 32-70, which is to be used by an establishment, an auxiliary or an operating unit of an establishment, which is an economic base business as defined in subsection (d) of section 32-222 or has a North American Industrial Classification code of 114111 through 114210, 311111 through 339999, 482111 through 484230, 488310, 488320, 488991, 493120, 493130, 493190, 511210, 512110, 512120, 512191, 522210, 522293, 522294, 522298, 522310, 522320, 522390, 523110, 523120, 523130, 523140, 523210, 523910, 524113, 524114, 524126, 524127, 524128, 524130, 524292, 541711, 541712, 551111, 551112, 551114, 561422, 611310, 611410, 611420, 611430, 611513, 611519, 611710 or 624410 or any business that is part of an economic cluster, as defined in subsection (e) of section 32-222, or any establishment or auxiliary or operating unit thereof, as defined in the North American Industrial Classification System Manual, or (B) if located in an enterprise zone designated pursuant to said section 32-70, which is to be used by an establishment primarily engaged in supplying goods or services in the fields of computer hardware or software, computer networking, telecommunications or communications, or (C) if located in a municipality with an entertainment district designated under section 32-76 or established under section 2 of public act 93-311*, is to be used in the production of entertainment products, including multimedia products, or as part of the airing, display or provision of live entertainment for stage or broadcast, including support services such as set manufacturers, scenery makers, sound and video equipment providers and manufacturers, stage and screen writers, providers of capital for the entertainment industry and agents for talent, writers, producers and music properties and technological infrastructure support including, but not limited to, fiber optics, necessary to support multimedia and other entertainment formats, except entertainment provided by or shown at a gambling or gaming facility or a facility whose primary business is the sale or serving of alcoholic beverages, or (D) if located in an airport development zone established pursuant to section 32-75d, (i) which, for the Bradley Airport development zone, is to be used for the warehousing or motor freight distribution of goods transported by aircraft to or from an airport located in such zone, or (ii) in the opinion of the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development, may be dependent upon or directly related to such airport and which, except as provided in this subparagraph, is to be used for any other business service, excluding any service provided by an organization that has a North American Industrial Classification code of 237130, 441110 to 454390, inclusive, 532111, 532112 or 812930; and (3) for which the department has issued an eligibility certificate in accordance with section 32-9r. In the case of facilities which are acquired, the department may waive the requirement of one year of idleness if it determines that, absent qualification as a manufacturing facility under subdivisions (59) and (60) of section 12-81, and sections 12-217e, 32-9p to 32-9s, inclusive, and 32-23p, there is a high likelihood that the facility will remain idle for one year. In the case of facilities located in an enterprise zone designated pursuant to said section 32-70, (A) the idleness requirement in subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, for business organizations which over the six months preceding such acquisition have had an average total employment of between six and nineteen employees, inclusive, shall be reduced to a minimum of six months, and (B) the idleness requirement shall not apply to business organizations with an average total employment of five or fewer employees, provided no more than one eligibility certificate shall be issued under this subparagraph for the same facility within a three-year period. Of those facilities which are for warehousing and distribution, only those which are newly constructed or which represent an expansion of an existing facility qualify as manufacturing facilities. In the event that only a portion of a plant is acquired, constructed, renovated or expanded, only the portion acquired, constructed, renovated or expanded constitutes the manufacturing facility. A manufacturing facility which is leased may for the purposes of subdivisions (59) and (60) of section 12-81 and sections 12-217e, 32-9p to 32-9s, inclusive, and 32-23p, be treated in the same manner as a facility which is acquired if the provisions of the lease serve to further the purposes of subdivisions (59) and (60) of section 12-81 and sections 12-217e, 32-9p to 32-9s, inclusive, and 32-23p and demonstrate a substantial, long-term commitment by the occupant to use the manufacturing facility, including a contract for lease for an initial minimum term of five years with provisions for the extension of the lease at the request of the lessee for an aggregate term which shall not be less than ten years, or the right of the lessee to purchase the facility at any time after the initial five-year term, or both. For a facility located in an enterprise zone designated pursuant to said section 32-70, and occupied by a business organization with an average total employment of ten or fewer employees over the six-month period preceding acquisition, such contract for lease may be for an initial minimum term of three years with provisions for the extension of the lease at the request of the lessee for an aggregate term which shall not be less than six years, or the right of the lessee to purchase the facility at any time after the initial three-year term, or both, and may also include the right for the lessee to relocate to other space within the same enterprise zone, provided such space is under the same ownership or control as the originally leased space or if such space is not under such same ownership or control as the originally leased space, permission to relocate is granted by the lessor of such originally leased space, and such relocation shall not extend the duration of benefits granted under the original eligibility certificate. Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, a manufacturing facility does not include any plant, building, other real property improvement or part thereof used or usable for such purposes which existed before July 1, 1978.\n\n(e) “Service facility” means a manufacturing facility described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subdivision (2) of subsection (d) of this section, provided such facility is located outside of an enterprise zone in a targeted investment community.\n\n(f) “Capital reserve fund bond”, “commissioner”, “department”, “industrial project” and “insurance fund” have the meanings provided in section 32-23d.\n\n(g) “Municipality” means any town, city or borough in the state.\n\n(P.A. 78-357, S. 2, 16; P.A. 79-492, S. 1, 4; 79-508, S. 4, 5; P.A. 81-109, S. 1, 3; 81-333, S. 1, 3; P.A. 83-246; 83-451, S. 3, 4; P.A. 85-578, S. 1, 5; P.A. 86-153, S. 2, 5; 86-258, S. 2, 8; P.A. 89-235, S. 3, 5; P.A. 90-270, S. 17, 38; P.A. 93-311, S. 3, 8; P.A. 94-247, S. 2, 8; P.A. 95-250, S. 1; P.A. 96-211, S. 1, 5, 6; 96-222, S. 23; 96-239, S. 10, 17; June Sp.

      "text": "(a) Any person may apply to the department for a determination as to whether the facility described in an application qualifies as a manufacturing facility or service facility. Applications for eligibility certificates are to be made on the forms and in the manner prescribed by the department. In evaluating each application the department may require the submission of all books, records, documents, drawings, specifications, certifications and other evidentiary items which it deems appropriate. No eligibility certificate shall be issued after March 1, 1991, for a manufacturing facility located in a distressed municipality which does not qualify as a targeted investment community unless the department has issued to the applicant a commitment letter for such facility prior to March 1, 1991. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, an eligibility certificate may be issued by the department after March 1, 1991, for a qualified manufacturing facility acquired, constructed or substantially renovated in a distressed municipality provided the commissioner determines that such acquisition, construction or substantial renovation was initiated prior to March 1, 1991, and was legitimately induced by the prospect of assistance under section 12-217e and subdivisions (59) and (60) of section 12-81, respectively. The department may issue an eligibility certificate for a qualified manufacturing facility or a qualified service facility located in a targeted investment community upon determination by the commissioner (A) that the acquisition, construction or substantial renovation relating to the qualified manufacturing facility or qualified service facility in such community was induced by the prospect of assistance under subdivisions (59) and (60) of section 12-81; and (B) the applicant demonstrates an economic need or there is an economic benefit to the state. The department shall issue an eligibility certificate for a qualified manufacturing facility located in an airport development zone established pursuant to section 32-75d, and may issue an eligibility certificate for a facility described in subparagraph (D) of subdivision (2) of subsection (d) of section 32-9p, upon determination by the department (i) that the acquisition, construction or substantial renovation relating to the qualified manufacturing facility or facility described in said subparagraph (D) in the airport development zone was induced by the prospect of assistance under subdivisions (59) and (60) of section 12-81; (ii) the applicant demonstrates an economic need and there is an economic benefit to the state without causing an economic detriment to or conflict with an existing zone; and (iii) that the applicant serves an airport-related function or relies substantially on airport services. The department shall issue an eligibility certificate if the commissioner determines (1) that the manufacturing facility is located in an enterprise zone designated pursuant to section 32-70 and is a qualified manufacturing facility, or (2) that the facility is a plant, building, other real property improvement, or part thereof, which is located in a municipality with an entertainment district designated under section 32-76 or established under section 2 of public act 93-311*, and which qualifies as a “manufacturing facility” under subsection (d) of section 32-9p in that it is to be used in the production of entertainment products, including multimedia products, or as part of the airing, display or provision of live entertainment for stage or broadcast, including support services such as set manufacturers, scenery makers, sound and video equipment providers and manufacturers, stage and screen writers, providers of capital for the entertainment industry and agents for talent, writers, producers and music properties and technological infrastructure support including, but not limited to, fiber optics, necessary to support multimedia and other entertainment formats, except entertainment provided by or shown at a gambling or gaming facility or a facility whose primary business is the sale or serving of alcoholic beverages.\n\n(b) The department shall reach a determination as to the eligibility of a facility within a reasonable time period, but may postpone the determination to the extent required to verify to its satisfaction that there is a high likelihood that any proposed facility will actually be constructed, expanded, substantially renovated or acquired. Prior to July 1, 2018, upon a favorable finding, the department shall issue to the applicant a certificate to the effect that the facility concerned is a manufacturing facility or a service facility and is eligible for assistance under section 12-217e and subdivisions (59) and (60) of section 12-81. On and after July 1, 2018, upon a favorable finding, the department shall issue to the applicant a certificate to the effect that the facility concerned is a manufacturing facility or a service facility and is eligible for assistance under subdivisions (59) and (60) of section 12-81.\n\n(c) Except as specified in subsection (d) of this section, upon an unfavorable determination the department shall issue a notice to the applicant to the effect that the facility concerned has been determined not to be a manufacturing facility or a service facility, together with a statement in reasonable detail as to the reasons for the unfavorable determination. Any aggrieved applicant shall be afforded an opportunity for a public hearing on the matter within thirty days following issuance of the notice. The department shall reconsider the application based upon the information presented at the public hearing and reaffirm or change its earlier determination within ten days of the hearing.\n\n(d) Upon an unfavorable determination regarding an application concerning an airport development zone, the department shall issue a notice to the applicant to the effect that the facility concerned has been determined not to be a manufacturing facility or a service facility, together with a statement in reasonable detail as to the reasons for the unfavorable determination. Any aggrieved applicant shall be afforded an opportunity for a public hearing on the matter within thirty days following issuance of the notice. The department shall reconsider the application based upon the information presented at the public hearing and reaffirm or change its earlier determination within ten days of the hearing.\n\n(e) The decision of the department rendered pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) of this section to issue an eligibility certificate or to deny an application for the issuance of an eligibility certificate either upon the expiration of thirty days without a public hearing following an initial unfavorable determination or upon any reconsideration of the application pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) of this section is conclusive and final as to the matters thereby decided, and chapter 54 shall not apply to the administrative determinations authorized to be made by this section.\n\n(f) Any person who claims a benefit under section 12-217e or subdivisions (59) and (60) of section 12-81 shall notify the department of any change in fact or circumstance which may bear upon the continued qualification as a manufacturing facility or a service facility for which an eligibility certificate has been issued. Upon receipt of such information or upon independent investigation, the department may revoke the eligibility certificate in the manner provided in subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(g) The commissioner shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to carry out the provisions of this section. Such regulations shall provide that establishments in the category of business support services, as defined in subsection (b) of section 32-222, or manufacturing facilities, as defined in subsection (d) of section 32-9p, may be eligible for a certificate if they are located in an enterprise zone.\n\n(P.A. 78-357, S. 6, 16; P.A. 81-109, S. 2, 3; P.A. 90-270, S. 21, 38; P.A. 91-354, S. 1; P.A. 95-334, S. 11, 13; P.A. 96-239, S. 13, 17; P.A. 00-174, S. 49, 83; June Sp.

The commissioner shall impose a fee for such application as the commissioner deems appropriate.\n\n(f) (1) The commissioner shall determine whether the project in which the proposed investment is to be made is an eligible urban reinvestment project or an eligible industrial site investment project, whether the project is economically viable only with use of the urban and industrial site reinvestment program, the effects of the project on the municipality where the investment will be made, and whether the project would provide a net benefit to economic development and employment opportunities in the state and whether the project will conform to the state plan of conservation and development.

The commissioner shall give priority to applications for projects located in federally designated opportunity zones. If the commissioner rejects an application, the commissioner shall specifically identify the defects in the application and specifically explain the reasons for the rejection. The commissioner shall render a decision on an application not later than ninety days from its receipt.

The sum of all tax credits granted pursuant to the provisions of this section shall not exceed one hundred million dollars with respect to a single eligible urban reinvestment project or a single eligible industrial site investment project approved by the commissioner. The sum of all tax credits granted pursuant to the provisions of this section shall not exceed nine hundred fifty million dollars.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, any applicant may, at the time of application, apply to the commissioner for a credit that exceeds the limitations established by this subsection. The commissioner shall evaluate the benefits of such application and make recommendations to the General Assembly relating to changes in the general statutes which would be necessary to effect such application if the commissioner determines that the proposal would be of economic benefit to the state.\n\n(j) The credits allowed by this section may be claimed by a taxpayer who has made an investment (1) directly only if such investment has a total asset value, either alone or in conjunction with other taxpayer investments in an eligible project, of not less than five million dollars or, in the case of an investment in an eligible project for the preservation of an historic facility and redevelopment of the facility for mixed uses that includes at least four housing units, a total asset value of not less than two million dollars; (2) through a fund managed by a fund manager registered under this section only if such fund: (A) Has a total asset value of not less than sixty million dollars for the income year for which the initial credit is taken; and (B) has not less than three investors who are not related persons with respect to each other or to any person in which any investment is made other than through the fund at the date the investment is made; or (3) through a community development entity or a contractually bound community development entity.\n\n(k) The commissioner shall, upon request, provide a copy of the eligibility certificate issued under subsection (h) of this section to the Commissioner of Revenue Services.\n\n(l) The tax credit allowed by this section, when made through a fund, shall only be available for investments in funds that are not open to additional investments or investors beyond the amount subscribed at the formation of the fund.\n\n(m) (1) The Commissioner of Revenue Services may treat one or more corporations that are properly included in a combined corporation business tax return under section 12-223a as one taxpayer in determining whether the appropriate requirements under this section are met. Where corporations are treated as one taxpayer for purposes of this subsection, then the credit shall be allowed only against the amount of the combined tax for all corporations properly included in a combined return that, under the provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection, is attributable to the corporations treated as one taxpayer.\n\n(2) The amount of the combined tax for all corporations properly included in a combined corporation business tax return that is attributable to the corporations that are treated as one taxpayer under the provisions of this subsection shall be in the same ratio to such combined tax that the net income apportioned to this state of each corporation treated as one taxpayer bears to the net income apportioned to this state, in the aggregate, of all corporations included in such combined return. Solely for the purposes of computing such ratio, any net loss apportioned to this state by a corporation treated as one taxpayer or by a corporation included in such combined return shall be disregarded.\n\n(n) Any taxpayer allowed a credit under this section may assign such credit to another taxpayer or taxpayers, provided such other taxpayer or taxpayers may claim such credit only with respect to a taxable year for which the assigning taxpayer would have been eligible to claim such credit and such other taxpayer or taxpayers may not further assign such credit. The taxpayer or taxpayers allowed such credit, the fund manager, the community development entity or contractually bound community development entity shall file with the Commissioner of Revenue Services information requested by the commissioner regarding such assignments, including, but not limited to, the current holders of credits as of the end of the preceding calendar year.\n\n(o) No taxpayer shall be eligible for a credit under (1) this section, and (2) section 12-217e or 38a-88a, for the same investment. No two taxpayers shall be eligible for any tax credit with respect to the same investment or the same project costs.\n\n(p) Any credit not used in the income year for which it was allowed may be carried forward for the five immediately succeeding income years until the full credit has been allowed.\n\n(q) (1) Any tax credits approved under this section that would constitute in excess of twenty million dollars in total for a single investment shall be submitted by the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to finance, revenue and bonding prior to the issuance of a certificate of eligibility for such investment. Said committee shall have thirty days from the date such project is submitted to convene a meeting to recommend approval or disapproval of such investment. If such submittal is withdrawn, altered, amended or otherwise changed, and resubmitted, said committee shall have thirty days from the date of such resubmittal to convene a meeting to recommend approval or disapproval of such investment. If said committee does not act on a submittal or resubmittal, as the case may be, within that time, the investment shall be deemed to be approved by said committee.\n\n(2) While the General Assembly is in session, the House of Representatives or the Senate, or both, may meet not later than thirty days following the date said committee makes a recommendation pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection. If such submission is not disapproved by the House of Representatives or the Senate, or both, within such time, the commissioner may issue such certificate.\n\n(3) While the General Assembly is not in regular session, the House of Representatives or the Senate, or both, may meet not later than thirty days following the date said committee makes a recommendation pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection. If such submission is not disapproved by the House of Representatives, the Senate, or both, within such time, the commissioner may issue such certificate.\n\n(r) Not later than July first in each year that credits allowed by this section are claimed by a taxpayer with respect to an approved investment, the commissioner may retain such persons as said commissioner may deem appropriate to conduct a study to estimate the state revenue that is being and will be generated by the eligible project in which such investment is made. Such economic impact study shall determine whether the state revenue actually generated by such eligible project is equal to the estimate of state revenue made at the time the investment in such eligible project was approved. If the sum of all state revenue actually generated by such eligible project is less than the amount of the total sum of tax credits claimed with respect to the approved investment in such project on the date of such analysis, the commissioner may determine from the person retained pursuant to this subsection the applicable recapture amount and may revoke the certificate of eligibility issued under subsection (h) of this section. The commissioner may require the taxpayer, the fund manager, community development entity or contractually bound community development entity that made such approved investment to reimburse the commissioner for all or any part of the cost of any economic impact study performed under this subsection.\n\n(s) (1) Any taxpayer which has claimed credits allowed by this section related to an investment concerning which the commissioner has revoked the certificate of eligibility issued under subsection (h) of this section, shall be required to recapture such taxpayer's pro rata share of the recapture amount as determined under the provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection and no subsequent credit shall be allowed unless such certificate of eligibility is reinstated under the provisions of subdivision (3) of this subsection.\n\n(2) If the taxpayer is required under the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection to recapture its pro rata share of the recapture amount during (A) the first year such credit was claimed, then ninety per cent of such share shall be recaptured on the tax return required to be filed for such year, (B) the second of such years, then sixty-five per cent of such share shall be recaptured on the tax return required to be filed for such year, (C) the third of such years, then fifty per cent of such share shall be recaptured on the tax return required to be filed for such year, (D) the fourth of such years, then thirty per cent of such share shall be recaptured on the tax return required to be filed for such year, (E) the fifth of such years, then twenty per cent of such share shall be recaptured on the tax return required to be filed for such year, and (F) the sixth or subsequent of such years, then ten per cent of such share shall be recaptured on the tax return required to be filed for such year. The Commissioner of Revenue Services may recapture such share from the taxpayer who has claimed such credits. If the commissioner is unable to recapture all or part of such share from such taxpayer, the commissioner may seek to recapture such share from any taxpayer who has assigned credits in an amount at least equal to such share to another taxpayer. If the commissioner is unable to recapture all or part of such share from any such taxpayer, the commissioner may recapture such share from any fund through which the investment was made.\n\n(3) If the commissioner has revoked the certificate of eligibility issued under subsection (h) of this section, such certificate of eligibility shall be reinstated by the commissioner if, upon a request made by the taxpayer, fund manager or community development entity who made such approved investment, an economic impact study conducted pursuant to subsection (r) of this section shall determine that the sum of all state revenue actually generated by the project in which such investment was made is greater than the amount of the total sum of tax credits claimed on the date of such analysis, provided no such request shall be made pursuant to this subsection during the calendar year in which such certificate was revoked. For the purpose of determining whether such certificate shall be reinstated, the commissioner shall, upon receipt of a request made under this subsection, obtain one such economic impact study per calendar year and may obtain additional such economic impact studies as the commissioner deems appropriate.\n\n(t) Notwithstanding subsections (r) and (s) of this section, for a contractually bound community development entity, credit recapture for credits allowed by this section shall be governed by the terms of its allocation agreement with the community development financial institutions fund or, where such agreement is silent, by Section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations promulgated by the United States Treasury pursuant to said section.\n\n(P.A. 00-170, S. 38, 42; June Sp.
