The mortgagee or lender shall be entitled to receive the benefit of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon: (1) Any sale of the mortgaged property by court order in foreclosure or a sale with the consent of the corporation by the mortgagor or subsequent owner of the property or by the mortgagee after foreclosure or acquisition by deed in lieu of foreclosure, or a sale with the consent of the corporation pursuant to default proceedings under article 9 of title 42a, provided all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others arising from the mortgage, foreclosure, default proceedings or any deficiency judgment shall be assigned to the corporation without recourse, excepting such claims as may have been released with the consent of the corporation and claims relating to contracts of insurance insuring only a portion of the mortgage payments required by the mortgage; (2) the expiration of six months after the mortgagee has taken title to the mortgaged property under judgment of strict foreclosure, foreclosure or other judicial sale, or a deed in lieu of foreclosure or default proceedings under article 9 of title 42a, if during such period the mortgagee has made a bona fide attempt to sell such property, and, if and to the extent required by the corporation, upon the conveyance of the property to the corporation and the assignment without recourse to the corporation of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others arising out of the mortgage, foreclosure, default proceedings or deficiency judgment; (3) the entering of a judgment against the borrower and the realization upon any assets of the borrower available to satisfy such judgment, provided all remaining claims of the lender against the borrower shall be assigned to the corporation; or (4) when the corporation determines it imprudent to have proceedings under (1), (2) and (3) above, the acceptance by the corporation of a conveyance of title to the property to the corporation or the acceptance of an assignment of the mortgage without recourse to the corporation in accordance with written procedures of the corporation in effect at the time the mortgage was insured or the assignment to the corporation of any remaining claims. The corporation may prescribe by written procedures or in a contract of insurance or in the advance commitment to insure variations to the applicability of subdivision (1), (2), (3) or (4) of this subsection because such contract or advance commitment insures only a part and not all of the payments required by a mortgage or loan. Such variations may include, but shall not be limited to, the assignment or conveyance of an interest in any claim of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or borrower, the property or the mortgage which is proportionate to the amount of the insurance provided under the contract or advance commitment. Upon the occurrence of either (1), (2), (3) or (4) hereof, the obligation of the mortgagee to pay premium charges for insurance shall cease, and the corporation shall, within thirty days thereafter, pay to the mortgagee or lender ninety-eight per cent or less than ninety-eight per cent if such lesser amount is provided for in the contract of insurance prepared pursuant to the procedures in effect at the time of issuance of the contract of insurance of the sum of (A) the then unpaid principal balance of the insured indebtedness, (B) all unpaid interest accruing with respect to the insured indebtedness at the rate approved by the corporation to the date of conveyance or assignment to the corporation, as the case may be, (C) the amount of all payments made by the mortgagee or lender for which it has not been reimbursed for taxes, insurance, assessments and insurance premiums, and (D) such other necessary fees, costs or expenses of the mortgagee or lender as may be approved by the corporation.\n\n(b) Upon request of the mortgagee, the corporation may at any time, under such equitable terms and conditions as it may prescribe, consent to the release of the mortgagor from his liability under the mortgage or consent to the release of parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage.\n\n(c) When vacancies in an economic development project are deemed by the corporation to prejudice mortgage payments insured by the corporation, the corporation may grant to the mortgagor or borrower permission to lease or rent the mortgaged property to a tenant for any use, such lease or rental to be temporary in nature and subject to such conditions as the corporation may prescribe.\n\n(d) Upon the ultimate disposition of property acquired by the corporation under this section and of the claims assigned therewith, the net amount realized by the corporation shall be computed, taking into account all expenses incurred by the corporation in handling, dealing with and disposing of such property and in collecting such claims. If the net amount so realized exceeds the amount paid to the mortgagee or lender and the expenses of the corporation, such excess shall be retained by the corporation and added to the fund created under section 32-14 but, if the net amount realized is less than the amount paid to the mortgagee and the expenses of the corporation, the mortgagor or borrower shall remain liable therefor as upon a deficiency judgment.\n\n(e) No claim for the benefit of the insurance provided in this chapter shall be accepted by the corporation except within one year after any sale or acquisition of title of the mortgaged property described in subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of this section or the entry of any judgment against the borrower as described in subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(f) Any contract of insurance made by the corporation under the authorization of this chapter shall provide that claims payable under such contract shall first be paid from any amounts readily available in the Mortgage and Loan Insurance Fund, established under section 32-14, before any amounts available from the bond authorization contained in section 32-22 are utilized for claim payment. The faith and credit of the state is hereby pledged, pursuant to such bond authorization and in accordance with section 3-20, to provide to the insurance fund moneys as and when necessary to make timely payments of all amounts required to be paid under the terms of any insurance contract executed by the corporation pursuant to this chapter, but not in excess of the amount of bonds so authorized by the State Bond Commission for such purpose less the amounts paid by the state for deposit to such insurance fund. The obligation of the corporation to make payments under any such insurance contract shall be limited solely to such sources and shall not constitute a debt or liability of the corporation or the state. Any insurance contract and any rule or regulation of the corporation implementing the insurance program may contain such other terms, provisions or conditions as the corporation deems necessary or appropriate, including, but not limited to, the payment of insurance premiums, the giving of notice, claim procedures, the sources for payment of claims, the priority of competing claims for payment, the release or termination of loan security and borrower liability, the timing of payment, the maintenance and disposition of projects and the use of amounts received during periods of loan delinquency or upon default, and any other provisions concerning the rights of insured parties or conditions of the payment of insurance claims.\n\n(1963, P.A. 601, S. 6; February, 1965, P.A. 494, S. 9; 1972, P.A. 195, S. 22; P.A. 73-599, S. 29; P.A. 88-265, S. 5, 36; P.A. 91-161, S. 2, 9; P.A. 93-360, S. 4, 19; June 12 Sp.

All such bonds issued by the corporation, secured by a special capital reserve fund within the meaning of subsection (b) of section 32-23j, shall be general obligations of the corporation payable out of any revenues or other receipts, funds, or moneys of the corporation, subject only to any agreements with the holders of particular notes or bonds pledging any particular revenues, receipts, funds or moneys, provided the corporation may issue general obligation bonds of the corporation without the security of a special capital reserve fund. Any other such bonds or notes not issued in anticipation of the issuance of bonds referred to in the preceding sentence shall be special obligations of the corporation payable solely out of any revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys of the corporation pledged therefor. All such notes and such bonds may be executed and delivered in such manner and at such times, may be in such form and denominations and of such tenor and maturity or maturities, may be in bearer or registered form, as to principal and interest or as to principal alone, may be payable at such time or times not exceeding forty years from the date thereof, may be payable at such place or places whether within or without the state, may bear interest at such rate or rates payable at such time or times and at such place or places and evidenced in such manner, and may contain such provisions not inconsistent with said chapters and sections, as shall be provided in the resolution of the corporation authorizing the issuance of the bonds and notes.\n\n(b) Issuance by the corporation of one or more series of bonds or notes for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds or notes in connection with the same project or any other projects, but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds or notes may be issued shall recognize and protect any prior pledge or mortgage made for any prior issue of bonds or notes unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is reserved to issue subsequent bonds on a parity with such prior issue.\n\n(c) Subject to the approval of the Treasurer of the state or his deputy appointed pursuant to section 3-12, any bonds or notes of the corporation may be sold at such price or prices, at public or private sale, in such manner and from time to time as may be determined by the corporation, and the corporation may pay all expenses, premiums and commissions which it may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the issuance and sale thereof; and any moneys of the corporation, including proceeds from the sale of any bonds and notes, and revenues, receipts and income from any of its projects, may be invested and reinvested in such obligations, securities and other investments, including time deposits or certificates of deposit, or deposited or redeposited in such bank or banks as shall be provided in the resolution or resolutions authorizing the issuance of the bonds and notes.\n\n(d) The corporation is authorized to provide for the issuance of its bonds for the purpose of refunding any bonds of the corporation then outstanding, including the payment of any redemption premium thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue to the earliest or subsequent date of redemption, purchase or maturity of such bonds, and, if deemed advisable by the corporation, for the additional purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of constructing and acquiring additions, improvements, extensions or enlargements of a project or any portion thereof. The proceeds of any such bonds issued for the purpose of refunding outstanding bonds may, in the discretion of the corporation, be applied to the purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption of such outstanding bonds either on their earliest or any subsequent redemption date, and may, pending such application, be placed in escrow to be applied to such purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption on such date as may be determined by the corporation.\n\n(e) Whether or not the bonds or notes are of such form and character as to be negotiable instruments under article eight of title 42a, the bonds or notes shall be and are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all the purposes of article eight of said title 42a, subject only to the provisions of the bonds or notes for registration.\n\n(f) The principal of and interest on bonds or notes issued by the corporation may be secured by a pledge of any revenues and receipts of the corporation derived from any project and may be additionally secured by a mortgage or deed of trust covering all or any part of a project, including any additions, improvements, extensions to or enlargements of any projects thereafter made. Such bonds or notes may also be secured by a pledge or assignment of a loan agreement, conditional sale agreement or agreement of sale or by an assignment of the lease of any project for the construction and acquisition of which said bonds or notes are issued and by an assignment of the revenues and receipts derived by the corporation from such project. The payments of principal and interest on such bonds or notes may be additionally secured by a pledge of any other property, revenues, moneys, or funds available to the corporation for such purpose. The resolution authorizing the issuance of any such bonds or notes and any such mortgage or deed of trust or lease or loan agreement, conditional sale agreement or agreement of sale or credit agreement may contain agreements and provisions respecting the establishment of reserves to secure such bonds or notes, the maintenance and insurance of the projects covered thereby, the fixing and collection of rents for any portion thereof leased by the corporation to others or the sums to be paid under any conditional sale agreement or agreement of sale entered into by the corporation with others, the creation and maintenance of special funds from such revenues and the rights and remedies available in the event of default, the vesting in a trustee or trustees of such property, rights, powers and duties in trust as the corporation may determine, which may include any or all of the rights, powers and duties of any trustee appointed by the holders of any bonds and notes and limiting or abrogating the right of the holders of any bonds and notes of the corporation to appoint a trustee under this chapter, chapter 578 and subsection (a) of section 10-409, or limiting the rights, powers and duties of such trustee; provision for a trust agreement by and between the corporation and a corporate trust which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state, which agreement may provide for the pledging or assigning of any revenues or assets or income from assets to which or in which the corporation has any rights or interest, and may further provide for such other rights and remedies exercisable by the trustee as may be proper for the protection of the holders of any bonds or notes and not otherwise in violation of law, and such agreement may provide for the restriction of the rights of any individual holder of bonds or notes of the corporation and may contain any further provisions which are reasonable to delineate further the respective rights, duties, safeguards, responsibilities and liabilities of the corporation; persons and collective holders of bonds or notes of the corporation and the trustee; and covenants to do or refrain from doing such acts and things as may be necessary or convenient or desirable in order to better secure any bonds or notes of the corporation, or which, in the discretion of the corporation, will tend to make any bonds or notes to be issued more marketable notwithstanding that such covenants, acts or things may not be enumerated herein; and any other matters of like or different character, which in any way affect the security or protection of the bonds or notes, all as the corporation shall deem advisable and not in conflict with the provisions hereof. Each pledge, agreement, mortgage and deed of trust made for the benefit or security of any of the bonds or notes of the corporation shall be in effect until the principal of and interest on the bonds or notes for the benefit of which the same were made have been fully paid, or until provision has been made for payment in the manner provided in the resolution or resolutions authorizing their issuance. Any pledge made in respect of such bonds or notes shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; the revenues, money or property so pledged and thereafter received by the corporation shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act; and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the corporation irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution, trust indenture nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded. The resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or notes may provide for the enforcement of any such pledge or security in any lawful manner. The corporation may elect to have the provisions of title 42a, the Connecticut uniform commercial code, apply to any pledge made by or to the corporation to secure its bonds or notes by filing a financing statement with respect to the security interest created by the pledge and, in such case, the financing statement shall be filed as if the debtor were located in this state.\n\n(g) The corporation may provide in any resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds or notes that any project or part thereof or any addition, improvement, extension or enlargement thereof, may be constructed by the corporation or the lessee or any designee of the corporation, and may also provide in such proceedings for the time and manner of and requisites for disbursements to be made for the cost of such construction and disbursements as the corporation shall deem necessary or appropriate.\n\n(h) The corporation may issue notes and bonds in accordance herewith for one or more projects or to provide funds to be used for the purposes of the corporation, without reference to a particular project or projects.\n\n(i) The corporation is further authorized and empowered to issue bonds, notes or other obligations under this section the interest on which may be includable in the gross income of the holder or holders thereof under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding Internal Revenue Code of the United States, as from time to time amended, to the same extent and in the same manner that interest on bills, notes, bonds or other obligations of the United States is includable in the gross income of the holder or holders thereof under any such Internal Revenue Code. Any such bonds, notes or other obligations may be issued only upon a finding by the corporation that such issuance is necessary, is in the public interest, and is in furtherance of the purposes and powers of the corporation. The state hereby consents to such inclusion only for the bonds, notes or other obligations of the corporation so authorized.\n\n(1972, P.A. 195, S. 5; P.A. 73-599, S. 11; P.A. 78-303, S. 110–112, 136; P.A. 81-384, S. 6, 7, 13; P.A. 82-434, S. 2, 6; P.A. 84-512, S. 21–23, 30; P.A. 89-211, S. 34; P.A. 01-132, S. 169; 01-179, S. 11, 12; P.A. 03-62, S. 26; June 12 Sp.

      "text": "(a) A Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund is created. In order to stimulate and encourage the growth and development of the state economy through the private enterprise of small contractors, the state, acting by the Department of Economic and Community Development, may provide working capital loans or provide lines of credit to small contractors from the Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund. For the purposes of this section, “small contractor” means contractors, subcontractors, minority business enterprises, manufacturers or service companies who have been doing business and have maintained their principal office and place of business in the state for a period of at least one year prior to the date of their application for assistance under this section, whose gross revenues in their most recently completed fiscal year did not exceed one million five hundred thousand dollars and which are considered small in accordance with such size standards as shall be established by regulations adopted by the department. In establishing such standards, the department shall consider the number of employees of the concern, provided any maximum number of employees which a small contractor may have under such definition shall vary from business to business to the extent necessary to reflect different characteristics of such business and to take proper account of other relevant factors. Not less than twenty-five per cent of the working capital loans and lines of credit provided under this section shall be made available to minority business enterprises. The department shall charge and collect interest on each such working capital loan or line of credit at a rate to be determined in accordance with subsection (t) of section 3-20. In no event shall the total amount of such working capital loans or lines of credit provided to any single small contractor in any period of twelve consecutive months exceed two hundred thousand dollars. Payments made by small contractors on all working capital loans and lines of credit paid to the Treasurer for deposit in the Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund shall be transferred to the Connecticut Growth Fund established under section 32-23v. The department shall promulgate rules and regulations in accordance with chapter 54 to carry out the provisions of this section. Such rules and regulations shall establish size standards for different types of small contractors, loan procedures, repayment terms, security requirements, default and remedy provisions and such other terms and conditions as the department shall deem appropriate.\n\n(b) Each such loan or extension of credit shall be authorized by Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated or, if the corporation so determines, by a committee of the corporation consisting of the chairman and either one other member of the corporation or its chief executive officer, as specified in the determination of the corporation. Any administrative expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of this section, to the extent not paid by the corporation or from moneys appropriated to the department, shall be paid from the Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund. Payments from the Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund to small contractors or to pay such administrative expenses shall be made by the Treasurer upon certification by the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development that the payment is authorized under the provisions of this section, under the applicable rules and regulations of the department, and, if made to a small contractor, under the terms and conditions established by the corporation or the duly appointed committee thereof in authorizing the making of the loan or the extension of credit.\n\n(c) The State Bond Commission may authorize the issuance of bonds of the state in one or more series in accordance with section 3-20 and in a principal amount necessary to carry out the purposes of this section, but not in excess of an aggregate amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars, provided said commission may not authorize the issuance of any bonds under the provisions of this section in excess of one million five hundred thousand dollars on or after June 2, 1986. All of said bonds shall be payable at such place or places as may be determined by the Treasurer pursuant to section 3-19 and shall bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times, not exceeding five years from their respective dates, bear interest at such rate or different or varying rates and payable at such time or times, be in such denominations, be in such form with or without interest coupons attached, carry such registration and transfer privileges, be payable in such medium of payment and be subject to such terms of redemption with or without premium as, irrespective of the provisions of said section 3-20, may be provided by the authorization of the State Bond Commission or fixed in accordance therewith. The proceeds of the sale of such bonds, together with premium and interest on sale, if any, shall be deposited in the Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund created by this section. Such bonds shall be general obligations of the state and the full faith and credit of the state of Connecticut are pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on such bonds as the same become due. Accordingly, and as part of the contract of the state with the holders of such bonds, appropriation of all amounts necessary for punctual payment of such principal and interest is hereby made, and the Treasurer shall pay such principal and interest as the same become due. Net earnings on investments or reinvestments of proceeds, accrued interest and premiums on the issuance of such bonds, after payment therefrom of expenses incurred by the Treasurer or State Bond Commission in connection with their issuance, shall become part of the Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund.\n\n(P.A. 77-370, S. 4, 13; 77-614, S. 284, 587, 610; P.A. 78-115, S. 1–3; 78-303, S. 85, 136; P.A. 79-471, S. 1, 2; P.A. 82-44, S. 1, 3; 82-358, S. 5, 10; 82-369, S. 13, 28; P.A. 83-580, S. 5, 8; P.A. 86-107, S. 9, 19; P.A. 87-416, S. 18, 24; P.A. 88-265, S. 34, 36; P.A. 95-250, S. 1; P.A. 96-211, S. 1, 5, 6; June 12 Sp.

No financial assistance, nor any commitment to provide financial assistance, shall be provided or entered into by the corporation pursuant to sections 32-23gg to 32-23ll, inclusive, which would cause the aggregate amount of all such financial assistance and commitments then outstanding to exceed the sum of the amounts available in the applicable subfund of the Connecticut Works Fund plus the amount of any unpaid grants authorized to be made by the Department of Economic and Community Development to the corporation for deposit in the applicable subfund of the Connecticut Works Fund which remain available for purposes of such subfund pursuant to the bond authorization in section 32-23ll, provided the amount of financial assistance in the form of any guarantee or contract of insurance shall be measured by the portion of unpaid principal which is insured or guaranteed by the corporation.
