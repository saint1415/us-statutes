The provisions of this subsection with respect to submission of a development plan to and approval by the commissioner and with respect to a finding that the plan was prepared giving due consideration to the state plan of conservation and development and state-wide planning program objectives of the state or its agencies shall not apply to a project for which no financial assistance has been given and no application for financial assistance is to be made under section 32-223. Any plan that has been prepared under chapters 130, 132 or 588a may be submitted by the implementing agency to the legislative body of the municipality and to the commissioner in lieu of a plan initiated and prepared in accordance with this section, provided all other requirements of sections 32-220 to 32-234, inclusive, for obtaining the approval of the commissioner of the development plan are satisfied. Any action taken in connection with the preparation and adoption of such plan shall be deemed effective to the extent such action satisfies the requirements of said sections.\n\n(c) (1) No plan shall be adopted unless the planning commission of the municipality finds that the plan is in accord with the plan of development, if any, for the municipality and the regional council of governments organized under section 4-124j for the region within which such municipality is located finds that such plan is in accord with the plan of development, if any, for such region. If the regional council of governments fails to make a finding concerning the plan within thirty-five days of receipt thereof, by such council, it shall be presumed that such council does not disapprove of the plan. The implementing agency shall hold at least one public hearing on the plan and shall cause notice of the time, place, and subject of any public hearing to be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality not less than one week nor more than three weeks prior to the date of such public hearing. At least thirty-five days prior to the public hearing, the implementing agency shall post the plan on the Internet web site of the implementing agency, if any. Upon adoption of the plan the implementing agency shall submit the plan to the legislative body of the municipality for approval or disapproval. Any approval by the implementing agency and legislative body of the municipality made under this section shall specifically provide for approval of any findings contained therein. After approval of the plan by the legislative body of the municipality, the plan shall be submitted to the commissioner for his approval. If the commissioner requires a substantial modification of the plan as a condition of approval, the plan shall be subject to a public hearing and approval by the implementing agency and the legislative body of the municipality in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(2) The plan shall be effective for a period of ten years after the date of approval and may be amended in accordance with this section. The legislative body shall review the plan at least once every ten years after the initial approval, and shall reapprove the plan or an amended plan at least once every ten years after the initial approval in accordance with this section in order for the plan or amended plan to remain in effect. With respect to a development plan for a project that is funded in whole or in part by federal funds, the provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to the extent that such provisions are prohibited by federal law.\n\n(d) The implementing agency shall cause notice of the initial approval of the plan to be published in a newspaper having general circulation in the municipality.\n\n(e) A development plan may be modified at any time by the implementing agency, provided, if modified after the lease or sale of real property in the project area, the lessees or purchasers of such real property or their successor or successors in interest affected by the proposed modification shall consent to such modification. If the proposed modification will substantially alter the development plan as previously approved, the modification shall be subject to the approval of the local legislative body of the municipality and the commissioner in the same manner as approval of the development plan. The municipality may, by vote of its legislative body, abandon the development plan and convey such real property within the boundaries of the project area free of any restriction, obligation or procedure imposed by the plan subject to all other local and state laws, ordinances or regulations, including, but not limited to, any offer of sale required under subsection (i) of this section, if after three years from the date of approval of the plan the implementing agency has not transferred by sale or lease all or any part of the real property acquired in the project area to any person in accordance with the development plan and no grant of financial assistance under sections 32-220 to 32-234, inclusive, has been given for such project other than for activities related to the planning of the project pursuant to section 32-222.\n\n(f) The implementing agencies of two or more municipalities may, after approval by each legislative body thereof, jointly initiate a development project if the project area is to be located in one or more of such municipalities. Such implementing agencies, after approval by the commissioner of the development plan for the project if any state aid is to be requested under section 32-223, may enter into and amend subject to the approval of the commissioner, an agreement to jointly carry out the development plan. Such agreement may include provisions for furnishing municipal services to the project and sharing costs of and revenues from the project, including property tax and rental receipts. The development plan shall include a proposed form of the agreement to be entered into by the municipalities. Each municipality which is a party to an agreement may make appropriations and levy taxes in accordance with the provisions of the general statutes and may issue bonds in accordance with section 32-227 to further its obligations under the agreement.\n\n(g) As used in this subsection, “public service facility” includes any sewer, pipe, main conduit, cable, wire, pole, tower, building or utility appliance owned or operated by an electric distribution, gas, telephone or water company. Whenever an implementing agency determines that the closing of any street or public right-of-way is provided for in a development plan adopted and approved in accordance with sections 32-220 to 32-234, inclusive, or where the carrying out of such a development plan, including the construction of new improvements, requires the temporary or permanent readjustment, relocation or removal of a public service facility from a street or public right-of-way, the implementing agency shall issue an appropriate order to the company owning or operating such facility. Such company shall permanently or temporarily readjust, relocate or remove the public service facility promptly in accordance with such order, provided an equitable share of the cost of such readjustment, relocation or removal, including the cost of installing and constructing a facility of equal capacity in a new location, shall be borne by the implementing agency. Such equitable share shall be fifty per cent of such cost after the deduction hereinafter provided. In establishing the equitable share of the cost to be borne by the implementing agency, there shall be deducted from the cost of the readjusted, relocated or removed facilities a sum based on a consideration of the value of materials salvaged from existing installations, the cost of the original installation, the life expectancy of the original facility and the unexpired term of such life use. The books and records of the company shall be made available for inspection by the implementing agency to determine the equitable share of the cost of such readjustment, relocation or removal. When any facility is removed from a street or public right-of-way to a private right-of-way, the implementing agency shall not pay for such private right-of-way. If the implementing agency and the company owning or operating such facility cannot agree upon the share of the cost to be borne by the implementing agency, such agency or the company may apply to the superior court for the judicial district within which the street or public right-of-way is situated, or, if the court is not in session, to any judge thereof, for a determination of the cost to be borne by the implementing agency. The court or the judge, after causing notice of the pendency of such application to be given to the other party, shall appoint a state referee to make such determination. The referee, having given at least ten days' notice to the interested parties of the time and place of the hearing, shall hear both parties, take such testimony as he may deem material and thereupon determine the amount of the cost to be borne by the implementing agency. The referee shall immediately report the amount to the court. If the report is accepted by the court, such determination shall, subject to right of appeal as in civil actions, be conclusive upon such parties.\n\n(h) After approval of the development plan pursuant to sections 32-220 to 32-234, inclusive, the implementing agency may by purchase, lease, exchange or gift acquire or rent real property necessary or appropriate for the project as identified in the development plan and real property and interests therein for rights-of-way and other easements to and from the project area.\n\n(i) (1) The implementing agency may, with the approval of the legislative body of the municipality, and in the name of the municipality, condemn in accordance with section 8-128 to 8-133, inclusive, any real property necessary or appropriate for the project as identified in the development plan, including real property and interests in land for rights-of-way and other easements to and from the project area, except that no real property may be condemned pursuant to this subsection for the primary purpose of increasing local tax revenue.\n\n(2) The implementing agency shall conduct a public hearing on any proposed acquisition of real property by condemnation pursuant to this subsection. The implementing agency shall cause notice of the time, place and subject of the hearing to be published in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the municipality not more than ten days before the date set for the hearing. Not less than ten days before the date of the hearing, the implementing agency shall send, by first class mail, notice of the time, place and subject of the hearing to the owners of record of the real property and to all owners of real property within one hundred feet of the real property to be acquired by condemnation.\n\n(3) (A) No parcel of real property may be acquired by condemnation under this section except by approval by vote of at least two-thirds of the members of the legislative body of the municipality, or, in the case of a municipality for which the legislative body is a town meeting or a representative town meeting, the board of selectmen. Such approval shall be by (i) separate vote on each parcel of real property to be acquired, or (ii) a vote on one or more groups of such parcels, provided each parcel to be acquired is identified for the purposes of a vote on a group of such parcels under this subparagraph. The legislative body or the board of selectmen, as the case may be, shall not approve the use of condemnation by the implementing agency unless the legislative body or board of selectmen has (I) considered the benefits to the public and any private entity that will result from the municipal development project and determined that the public benefits outweigh any private benefits, (II) determined that the current use of the real property cannot be feasibly integrated into the overall development plan, and (III) determined that the acquisition of the real property by condemnation is reasonably necessary to successfully achieve the objectives of the development plan.\n\n(B) The municipality shall cause notice of any approved acquisition by condemnation under this subdivision to be published in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the municipality not more than ten days after such approval.\n\n(C) (i) The implementing agency shall acquire any property identified in the plan as property to be acquired by condemnation by a date that is five years after the date the first property is acquired by condemnation under the plan unless the implementing agency approves an extension of the time for acquisition, except that no property may be acquired by condemnation under the plan more than ten years after the first property is acquired by condemnation under the plan.\n\n(ii) With respect to a development plan for a project that is funded in whole or in part by federal funds, the provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply to the extent that such provisions are prohibited by federal law.\n\n(4) The owner-occupant of property acquired by condemnation under this section may file an application in the superior court for the judicial district in which the municipality is located to enjoin the acquisition of such property. The court may issue such injunction if the court finds that the implementing agency or municipality failed to comply with the requirements of this section. The filing of an application to enjoin the acquisition of property by condemnation, in a court of competent jurisdiction, shall toll the five-year period or ten-year period set forth in subparagraph (C) of subdivision (3) of this subsection with respect to such property until the date a final judgment is entered in any such action, or any appeal thereof, whichever date is later.\n\n(j) (1) With respect to real property acquired by condemnation pursuant to this section on or after June 25, 2007, if the municipality does not use the real property for the purpose for which it was acquired or for some other public use and seeks to sell the property, the municipality shall first offer the real property for sale pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection to the person from whom the real property was acquired, or heirs of the person designated pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection, if any, for a price not to exceed the lesser of (A) the amount paid by the implementing agency to acquire the property, or (B) the fair market value of the property at the time of any sale under this subsection. After the municipality provides notice pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection, the municipality may not sell such property to a third party unless the municipality has permitted the person or named heirs six months during which to exercise the right to purchase the property, and an additional six months to finalize the purchase if the person or named heirs provide the municipality with notice of intent to purchase the property within the initial six-month period.\n\n(2) For the purposes of any offer of sale pursuant to this subsection, the municipality shall provide a form to any person whose property is acquired by condemnation pursuant to this section to permit such person to provide an address for notice of sale to be sent, or to provide the name and address of an agent to receive such notice. Such form shall be designed to permit the person to designate heirs of the person who shall be eligible to purchase such property pursuant to this subsection. The person or agent shall update information in the form in writing. If the person or agent does not provide or update the information in the form in a manner that permits the municipality to send notice of sale pursuant to this subsection, no such notice shall be required.\n\n(3) With respect to a development plan for a project that is funded in whole or in part by federal funds, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the extent that such provisions are prohibited by federal law.\n\n(P.A. 90-270, S. 5, 38; P.A. 07-141, S. 3; P.A. 13-247, S. 309; P.A. 14-134, S. 37.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 07-141 amended Subsec.

Any bonds payable and secured as provided in this subsection shall be authorized by, and the appropriation of the proceeds thereof approved by and subject to, a resolution adopted by the legislative body of the municipality, notwithstanding the provisions of any other statute, local law or charter governing the authorization and issuance of bonds and the appropriation of the proceeds thereof generally by the municipality. No such resolution shall be adopted until after a public hearing has been held upon such authorization. Notice of such hearing shall be published not less than five days prior to such hearing in a newspaper having a general circulation in the municipality. Any such bonds of a municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated shall be issued and sold in such manner; bear interest at such rate or rates, including variable rates; provide for the payment of interest on such dates, whether before or at maturity; be issued at, above or below par; mature at such time or times not exceeding thirty years from their date; have such rank or priority; be payable in such medium of payment; be issued in such form, including, without limitation, registered or book-entry form; carry such registration and transfer privileges and be made subject to purchase or redemption before maturity at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions, including the condition that such bonds be subject to purchase or redemption on the demand of the owner thereof; and contain such other terms and particulars as the legislative body of the municipality or the officers delegated such authority by the legislative body of the municipality shall determine. Any such bonds of Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated shall be issued and sold in the manner and subject to the general terms and provisions of law applicable to issuance of bonds by Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, except that the provisions of subsection (b) of section 32-23j shall not apply. The proceedings under which bonds are authorized to be issued may, subject to the provisions of indenture or to any other depository agreement, provide for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. Any pledge made by the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated for bonds issued as provided in this subsection shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made, and any revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated shall be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, irrespective of whether such parties have notice of such lien. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded. All expenses incurred in carrying out such financing may be treated as project costs. Such bonds shall not be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of the municipality, provided, if such bonds are made payable, in whole or in part, from funds contracted to be advanced by the municipality, the aggregate amount of such funds not yet appropriated to such purpose shall be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of the municipality. As used in this section, “bonds” means any bonds, including refunding bonds, notes, temporary notes, interim certificates, debentures or other obligations. Temporary notes issued in accordance with this subsection in anticipation of the receipt of the proceeds of bond issues may be issued for a period of not more than five years, and notes issued for a shorter period of time may be renewed by the issue of other notes, provided the period from the date of the original notes to the maturity of the last notes issued in renewal thereof shall not exceed five years. For purposes of this section, references to Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated shall include any subsidiary of Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated established pursuant to subsection (l) of section 32-11a.*\n\n(b) For the purpose of carrying out or administering a municipal or business development project, a municipality or its implementing agency may accept grants, advances, loans or other financial assistance from the federal government, the state or other source and may do any and all things necessary or desirable to secure such financial aid. To assist any project located in the area in which it is authorized to act, any public body, including the state, or any city, town, borough, authority, district, subdivision or agency of the state, may, upon such terms as it determines, furnish service or facilities, provide property, lend or contribute funds, and take any other action of a character which it is authorized to perform for other purposes. To obtain funds for the temporary and definitive financing of any project, a municipality or implementing agency may, in addition to other action authorized under this act or other law, issue its general obligation bonds, notes, temporary notes or other obligations secured by a pledge of the municipality's full faith and credit. Such bonds, notes, temporary notes and other obligations shall be authorized in accordance with the requirements for the authorization of such obligations generally by the municipality and the authorization, issuance and sale thereof shall be subject to the limitations contained in the general statutes, including provisions on the limitation of the aggregate indebtedness of the municipality. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 7-264, 7-378 and 7-378a, and any other public or special act or charter or bond ordinance or bond resolution which limits the issuance or renewal of temporary notes issued in anticipation of the receipt of the proceeds of bond issues to a period of time of less than five years from the date of the original notes or requires a reduction in the principal amount of such notes or renewal notes prior to the fifth anniversary of the date of the original notes, such temporary notes may be issued for a period of not more than five years, and notes issued for a shorter period of time may be renewed by the issue of other notes, provided the period from the date of the original notes to the maturity of the last notes issued in renewal thereof shall not exceed five years.\n\n(c) Any development plan authorized under sections 32-220 to 32-234, inclusive, or any proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds under said sections may contain a provision that taxes, if any, identified in such plan or such authorizing proceedings and levied upon taxable real or personal property, or both, in a project each year or payments in lieu of such taxes authorized pursuant to chapter 114, or both, by or for the benefit of any one or more municipalities, districts or other public taxing agencies, as the case may be, shall be divided as follows: (1) In each fiscal year that portion of the taxes or payments in lieu of taxes, or both, which would be produced by applying the then current tax rate of each of the taxing agencies to the total sum of the assessed value of the taxable property in the project on the effective date of such adoption or the date of such authorizing proceedings, as the case may be, or on any date between such two dates which is identified in such proceedings, shall be allocated to and when collected shall be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies in the same manner as taxes by or for said taxing agencies on all other property are paid; and (2) that portion of the assessed taxes or the payments in lieu of taxes, or both, each fiscal year in excess of the amount referred to in subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be allocated to and when collected shall be paid into a special fund of the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated to be used in each fiscal year, first to pay the principal of and interest due in such fiscal year on loans, moneys advanced to, or indebtedness, whether funded, refunded, assumed, or otherwise, incurred by such municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated to finance or refinance in whole or in part, such project, and then, at the option of the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, to purchase bonds issued for the project which has generated the tax increments or payments in lieu of taxes and then, at the option of the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, to reimburse the provider of or reimbursement party with respect to any guarantee, letter of credit, policy of bond insurance, funds deposited in a debt service reserve fund, funds deposited as capitalized interest or other credit enhancement device used to secure payment of debt service on any bonds, notes or other indebtedness issued pursuant to this section to finance or refinance such project, to the extent of any payments of debt service made therefrom. Unless and until the total assessed valuation of the taxable property in a project exceeds the total assessed value of the taxable property in such project as shown by the last assessment list referred to in subdivision (1) of this subsection, all of the taxes levied and collected and all of the payments in lieu of taxes due and collected upon the taxable property in such project shall be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies. When such loans, advances, and indebtedness, if any, and interest thereof, and such debt service reimbursement to the provider of or reimbursement party with respect to such credit enhancement, have been paid in full, all moneys thereafter received from taxes or payments in lieu of taxes, or both, upon the taxable property in such development project shall be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies in the same manner as taxes on all other property are paid.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) of this section and any other public or special act or charter or bond ordinance or bond resolution which limits the renewal of temporary notes issued pursuant to said subsections in anticipation of the receipt of the proceeds of bond issues to five years from the date of the original notes, any municipality may renew temporary notes in accordance with the provisions of this section for an additional period of not more than four years from the end of such five-year period.
