The moneys held in or credited to any special capital reserve fund established under this section, except as hereinafter provided, shall be used solely for the payment of the principal of and interest on, when due, whether at maturity or by mandatory sinking fund installments, on bonds of the authority secured by such capital reserve fund as the same become due, the purchase of such bonds of the authority, the payment of any redemption premium required to be paid when such bonds are redeemed prior to maturity; provided the authority shall have power to provide that moneys in any such fund shall not be withdrawn therefrom at any time in such amount as would reduce the amount of such funds to less than the maximum amount of principal and interest becoming due by reasons of maturity or a required sinking fund installment in the then current or any succeeding calendar year on the bonds of the authority then outstanding or the maximum amount permitted to be deposited in such fund by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, to permit the interest on said bonds to be excluded from gross income for federal tax purposes and secured by such special capital reserve fund, such amount being herein referred to as the “required minimum capital reserve”, except for the purpose of paying such principal of, redemption premium and interest on such bonds of the authority secured by such special capital reserve becoming due and for the payment of which other moneys of the authority are not available. The authority may provide that it shall not issue bonds secured by a special capital reserve fund at any time if the required minimum capital reserve on the bonds outstanding and the bonds then to be issued and secured by the same special capital reserve fund at the time of issuance, unless the authority, at the time of the issuance of such bonds, shall deposit in such special capital reserve fund from the proceeds of the bonds so to be issued, or otherwise, an amount which, together with the amount then in such special capital reserve fund, will be not less than the required minimum capital reserve.

For the purpose of evaluation of any such special capital reserve fund, obligations acquired as an investment for any such fund shall be valued at market. Nothing contained in this section shall preclude the authority from establishing and creating other debt service reserve funds in connection with the issuance of bonds or notes of the authority which are not special capital reserve funds. Subject to any agreement or agreements with holders of outstanding notes and bonds of the authority, any amount or amounts allotted and paid to the authority pursuant to this section shall be repaid to the state from moneys of the authority at such time as such moneys are not required for any other of its corporate purposes and in any event shall be repaid to the state on the date one year after all bonds and notes of the authority theretofore issued on the date or dates such amount or amounts are allotted and paid to the authority or thereafter issued, together with interest on such bonds and notes, with interest on any unpaid installments of interest and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding by or on behalf of the holders thereof, are fully met and discharged.

As used in this section, the term commissioner shall mean commissioners if more than one commissioner has jurisdiction over the subject matter and their designee, if any. No agency, commission, council, committee, panel or other body whatsoever other than such commissioner shall have jurisdiction over or cognizance of any licenses, permits, approvals or administrative actions concerning any project and no notice of any tentative determination or any final determination regarding any such license, permit, approval or administrative action and no notice of any such license, permit, approval or administrative action shall be required except as expressly provided pursuant to this subsection. For purposes of this section a downtown higher education center project and a riverfront infrastructure development and improvement project shall be treated as if each is a state facility and accordingly, no ordinance, law or regulation promulgated by or any authority granted to any municipality or any other political subdivision of the state shall apply to such authority project.\n\n(c) All applications, supporting documentation and other records submitted to the commissioner and pertaining to any application for any license, permit, approval or other administrative action, together with all records of the proceedings of the commissioner relating to any license, permit, approval or administrative action shall be a public record and shall be made, maintained and disclosed in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act, as defined in section 1-200.\n\n(d) All applications for licenses, permits, approvals and other administrative action required by any applicable provision of the general statutes shall be submitted to the commissioner as provided in subsection (b) of this subsection. The commissioner shall adopt a master process to consider multiple licenses, permits, approvals and administrative actions to the extent practicable. Each license or permit shall be issued, approval shall be granted and administrative action shall be taken not later than ten business days after the date of submission of any application for such license, permit, approval or administrative action to the commissioner. Each application for a license or permit shall be deemed to have been issued, approval shall be deemed to have been granted and administrative action shall be deemed to have been taken as requested unless such application has been denied, or conditionally issued prior to the close of business on the tenth business day after either the date of submission of such application, or a hearing is held on such application pursuant to this section.\n\n(e) (1) Any hearing regarding all or any part of any project, provided for by this section, shall be conducted by the particular commissioner having jurisdiction over the applicable license, permit, approval or other administrative action. Legal notice of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper having general circulation in an area which includes the municipality in which the particular part of such project is proposed to be built or is being built not more than ten nor less than five days in advance of such hearing.\n\n(2) In rendering any decision in connection with any project, provided for by this section, the commissioner shall weigh all competent material and substantial evidence presented by the applicant and the public in accordance with the applicable statute. The commissioner shall issue written findings and determinations upon which the commissioner's decision is based. Such findings and determinations shall consist of evidence presented including such matters as the commissioner deems appropriate, provided such matters, to the extent applicable to the particular permit, shall include the nature of any major adverse health and environmental impact of any project. The commissioner may reverse or modify any order or action at any time on the commissioner's own motion. The procedure for such reversal or modification shall be the same as the procedure for the original proceeding.\n\n(3) Any administrative action taken by any commissioner in connection with any project, provided for by this section, may be appealed by an aggrieved party to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183. Such appeal shall be brought within ten days of the date of mailing to the parties to the proceeding of a notice of such order, decision or action by certified mail, return receipt requested, and the appellant shall serve a copy of the appeal on each party listed in the final decision at the address shown in such decision. Failure to make such service within such ten days on parties other than the commissioner who rendered the final decision may not, in the discretion of the court, deprive the court of jurisdiction over such appeal. Within ten days after the service of such appeal, or within such further time as may be allowed by the court, the commissioner who rendered such decision shall cause any portion of the record that had not been transcribed to be transcribed and shall cause either the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding appealed from to be transmitted to the reviewing court. Such record shall include the commissioner's findings of fact and conclusions of law, separately stated. If more than one commissioner has jurisdiction over the matter, such commissioners shall issue joint findings of fact and conclusions of law. Such appeal shall state the reasons upon which it is predicated and, notwithstanding any provisions of the general statutes, shall not stay the development of any project. The commissioner who rendered such decision shall appear as the respondent. Such appeals to the superior court shall each be a privileged matter and shall be heard as soon after the return date as practicable. A court shall render its decision not later than twenty-one days after the date that the entire record, with the transcript, is filed with the court by the commissioner who rendered the decision.\n\n(4) The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the commissioner as to the weight of the evidence presented on a question of fact. The court shall affirm the decision of the commissioner unless the court finds that substantial rights of the party appealing such decision have been materially prejudiced because the findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions of the commissioner are in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions, in excess of the statutory authority of the commissioner, made upon unlawful procedure, affected by an error of law, clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record, or arbitrary, capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\n\n(5) If the court finds material prejudice, it may sustain the appeal. Upon sustaining an appeal, the court may render a judgment which modifies the decision of the commissioner, orders particular action by the commissioner or orders the commissioner to take such action as may be necessary to effect a particular action and the commissioner may issue a permit consistent with such judgment.\n\n(6) An applicant may file an amended application and the commissioner may consider an amended application for an order, permit or other administrative action following court action.\n\n(P.A. 88-230, S. 1, 12; P.A. 90-98, S. 1, 2; P.A. 93-142, S. 4, 7, 8; P.A. 95-220, S. 4–6; P.A. 98-179, S. 18, 30; P.A. 99-241, S. 23, 66; P.A. 00-230, S. 13; P.A. 11-51, S. 90; P.A. 13-247, S. 200.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 98-179 effective June 1, 1998 (Revisor's note: P.A. 88-230, 90-98, 93-142 and 95-220 authorized substitution of “judicial district of Hartford” for “judicial district of Hartford-New Britain” in public and special acts of the 1998 regular and special sessions of the General Assembly, effective September 1, 1998; in Subsec.
