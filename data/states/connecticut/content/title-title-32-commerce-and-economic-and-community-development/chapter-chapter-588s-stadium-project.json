None of said bonds shall be authorized except upon a finding by the State Bond Commission that there has been filed with it a request for such authorization, which is signed by the secretary stating such terms and conditions as said commission, in its discretion, may require. Such bonds issued pursuant to section 32-382 shall be general obligations of the state and the full faith and credit of the state of Connecticut are pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on such bonds, including temporary or interim notes, as the same become due, and accordingly and as part of the contract of the state with the holders of such bonds, appropriation of all amounts necessary for punctual payment of such principal and interest is hereby made including with respect to interest on temporary or interim notes and principal thereof to the extent not funded with renewals thereof or bonds, and the Treasurer shall pay such principal and interest as the same become due.\n\n(b) For the purposes of sections 32-380 to 32-409, inclusive, “state moneys” means the proceeds of the sale of bonds authorized pursuant to said sections, or of temporary or interim notes issued in anticipation of the moneys to be derived from the sale of such bonds. Such request filed as provided in sections 32-380 to 32-409, inclusive, for an authorization of bonds shall identify the project for which the proceeds of the sale of such bonds are to be used and expended and, if applicable, shall include the recommendation of the secretary as to the extent to which federal, private or other moneys then available or thereafter to be made available for costs in connection with such project should be added to the state moneys available or becoming available hereunder for such project. If the request includes a recommendation that some amount of such federal, private or other moneys should be added to such state moneys, then, if and to the extent directed by the State Bond Commission at the time of authorization of such bonds, said amount of such federal, private or other moneys then available or thereafter to be made available for costs in connection with such project may be added to any state moneys available or becoming available hereunder for such project and be used for such project as if constituting such state moneys, and any other federal, private or other moneys then available or thereafter to be made available for costs in connection with such project, if and to the extent from time to time directed by the State Bond Commission, upon receipt shall, in conformity with applicable federal and state law, be used for the purposes for which such other moneys are received in accordance with the proceedings of the State Bond Commission, and otherwise by the Treasurer to meet principal of outstanding bonds issued pursuant to sections 32-380 to 32-409, inclusive, or to meet the principal of temporary or interim notes issued in anticipation of the money to be derived from the sale of bonds theretofore authorized pursuant to said sections for the purpose of financing such costs, either by purchase or redemption and cancellation of such bonds or notes or by payment thereof at maturity. Whenever any of the federal, private or other moneys so received with respect to such project are used to meet principal of such temporary or interim notes or whenever principal on any such temporary or interim notes is retired by application of revenue receipts of the state, the amount of bonds theretofore authorized in anticipation of which such temporary or interim notes were issued, and the aggregate amount of bonds which may be authorized pursuant to this section, shall each be reduced by the amount of the principal so met or retired. Pending use of the federal, private or other moneys so received to meet principal as hereinabove directed, the amount thereof may be invested by, or at the direction of, the Treasurer in bonds or obligations of, or guaranteed by, the state or the United States or agencies or instrumentalities of the United States, or in accordance with the provisions of section 3-20, and shall be deemed to be part of the debt retirement funds of the state, and net earnings on such investments shall be used in the same manner as the said moneys so invested.\n\n(c) Any balance of proceeds of the sale of said bonds authorized by sections 32-380 to 32-409, inclusive, in excess of the aggregate costs of the project so authorized shall be used to meet interest and principal amounts as the same become due on said bonds authorized.\n\n(d) Net earnings on investment of proceeds, accrued interest and premiums on the issuance of any of such bonds authorized by sections 32-380 to 32-409, inclusive, after payment of expenses incurred by the Treasurer or State Bond Commission in connection with their issuance, if any, shall be used to meet interest and principal amounts as the same become due on said bonds authorized.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3-20, expenditures may be made for preliminary costs authorized, notwithstanding the fact that funds have been committed or expended prior to the authorization of such project by the State Bond Commission.\n\n(Sept.
