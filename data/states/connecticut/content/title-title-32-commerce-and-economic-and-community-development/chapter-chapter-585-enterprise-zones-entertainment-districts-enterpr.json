      "text": "(a) Any municipality that was a distressed municipality under the provisions of subsection (b) of section 32-9p on February 1, 1986, may, with the approval of the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development, designate an area of such municipality as an enterprise zone. Any such area shall consist of one or two contiguous United States census tracts, contiguous portions of such census tracts or a portion of an individual census tract, as determined in accordance with the most recent United States census and, if such area is covered by zoning, a portion of it shall be zoned to allow commercial or industrial activity. The census tracts within which such designated area is located shall also meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) Twenty-five per cent or more of the persons within the individual census tracts shall have income below the poverty level, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution; (2) twenty-five per cent or more of the families within the individual census tracts shall receive public assistance or welfare income, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution; or (3) the unemployment rate of the individual census tracts shall be at least two hundred per cent of the state's average, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution. In calculating any such percentage for one or two contiguous census tracts, contiguous portions of census tracts or a portion of an individual census tract, the commissioner shall round up to the nearest whole percentage number. If a census tract qualifies under the eligibility criteria for designation as an enterprise zone and if the commissioner determines that a census tract which is contiguous to such tract has significant job creation potential, the commissioner may include such contiguous census tract, or a portion thereof, in the enterprise zone in lieu of a second qualified census tract if such contiguous census tract meets at least one of the following reduced criteria: (A) Fifteen per cent or more of the persons within the census tract shall have income below the poverty level, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution; (B) fifteen per cent or more of the families within the census tract shall receive public assistance or welfare income, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution; or (C) the unemployment rate of the census tract shall be at least one hundred fifty per cent of the state's average, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution. If a census tract boundary line is the center line of a street, the commissioner may include within the enterprise zone that portion of the property fronting on such street which is outside of but adjacent to the census tract. The depth of such property so included in the enterprise zone shall be determined by the commissioner at the time of the designation of the zone. If a census tract boundary line is located along a railroad right-of-way, railroad property or natural stream of water, the commissioner may include within the enterprise zone any private properties under common ownership which are traversed by the railroad right-of-way, railroad property or natural stream of water. Any private properties so affected shall be included in the enterprise zone at the time of the designation of the zone except, in the case of an enterprise zone designated prior to October 1, 1983, the commissioner may include within the zone any such property if the municipality in which the zone is located requests the commissioner to include such property not later than sixty days after October 1, 1983. If more than twenty-five per cent of the project area of a development project under chapter 132 is located in an area eligible for designation as an enterprise zone and the project plan for such development project is approved by the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development in accordance with section 8-191, the commissioner may include the entire project area of such development project area in an enterprise zone. If more than twenty-five per cent of the project area of a municipal development project under chapter 588l is located in an area eligible for designation as an enterprise zone and the development plan for such project is approved by the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development in accordance with section 32-224, the commissioner may include the entire project area of such project in an enterprise zone. If more than fifty per cent of an approved redevelopment area under chapter 130 is located in an area eligible for designation as an enterprise zone, the commissioner may include the entire redevelopment area in an enterprise zone. The commissioner may also include in the area designated as an enterprise zone (i) any facility, as defined in section 32-9p, which is located outside of but contiguous to a census tract included in the zone, (ii) any private properties which are (I) under common ownership, (II) located outside of a census tract included in the zone and (III) contiguous to a railroad right-of-way which is the boundary of such a census tract, or (iii) any private properties which are located outside of a census tract included in the zone, but between the zone and a railroad right-of-way, where other segments of such railroad right-of-way serve as boundaries for the zone. The commissioner may, at any time after the designation of an area as an enterprise zone, include in such zone any area contiguous to such zone which, at the time of the designation of such zone, was eligible to be included in such zone but was not so included. The commissioner may, at any time after the designation of an area as an enterprise zone, include in such zone any property which is located within one hundred fifty feet of a stream, the center line of which is the boundary of a census tract included in such zone, and which property contains an existing building or facility, having an area equal to or greater than one hundred thousand square feet, that is or was formerly used for manufacturing purposes but is underutilized or vacant at the time the property is included in such zone. If the commissioner determines that the necessary data is not available from the most recent United States census, the commissioner may use such data as the commissioner deems appropriate. The commissioner shall include in the designation of the enterprise zone in the city of Meriden the entire parcel of land bordered by Cook Avenue, Hanover Street, Perkins Street Square, and South Colony Street.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, (1) any municipality which has an enterprise zone may with the approval of the commissioner, expand such enterprise zone by designating for inclusion in such zone one or more additional census tracts or contiguous portions of such census tract or tracts, provided such census tract or tracts are located in the municipality, are contiguous to the enterprise zone and meet the reduced criteria for contiguous census tracts in subsection (a) of this section, (2) any municipality which is contiguous to an enterprise zone which is located in another municipality may, with the approval of the commissioner, designate as an enterprise zone one or more census tracts or contiguous portions of such census tract or tracts, which are located in the municipality making such designation, provided such census tract or tracts meet the reduced criteria for contiguous census tracts in subsection (a) of this section and are contiguous to the enterprise zone located in the other municipality. When approving such an expanded or new zone under this subsection, the commissioner shall consider the development rationale, proposed local effort and job creation potential of such expanded or new zone as demonstrated by the municipality and (3) any municipality which is contiguous to an enterprise zone which is located in another municipality may, with the approval of the commissioner and the legislative body of the municipality containing the enterprise zone, designate as an enterprise zone one or more census tracts or portions of such census tract or tracts that are contiguous to the enterprise zone in the other municipality, provided no municipality which designates an enterprise zone in this manner shall be considered to be a targeted investment community, as defined in section 32-222, or an enterprise zone community.\n\n(c) (1) On or before September 30, 1993, the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development shall approve the designation of ten areas as enterprise zones, not more than four of which shall be in municipalities with a population greater than eighty thousand and not more than six of which shall be in municipalities with a population of less than eighty thousand.\n\n(2) (A) On or after October 1, 1993, the commissioner shall approve the designation of two areas as enterprise zones. Each such area shall be in a municipality with a population of less than eighty thousand, in which there are one or more base or plant closures. Such municipalities shall be in different counties. If the commissioner approves the designation of an area of a municipality as an enterprise zone because of a plant closure in the municipality and there is a closure of another plant in any other municipality in the state by the same business, the commissioner shall also designate an area in such other municipality as an enterprise zone. If any such designated area includes a portion of a census tract in which any such base or plant is located, the census tracts in such area shall not be required to meet the eligibility criteria set forth under subsection (a) of this section for enterprise zone designation. If any such area is located elsewhere in the municipality, the census tracts in such area shall meet such eligibility criteria. As used in this subparagraph, (i) “base” means any United States or state of Connecticut military base or facility located in whole or in part within the state; (ii) “plant” means any manufacturing business or economic base business, as defined in section 32-222; and (iii) “closure” means any reduction or transfer in military personnel or civilian employment at one or more bases or plants in a municipality, which occurred between July 1, 1989, and July 1, 1993, or is scheduled to occur between July 1, 1993, and July 1, 1996, and exceeds two thousand persons. Such employment figures shall be certified by the Labor Department.\n\n(B) On or after October 1, 1993, the commissioner shall approve the designation of three other areas as enterprise zones, one of which shall be in a municipality with a population greater than eighty thousand and two of which shall be in municipalities with a population of less than eighty thousand. The census tracts in such areas shall meet the eligibility criteria set forth under subsection (a) of this section for enterprise zone designation. The commissioner shall approve the designation of enterprise zones under this subparagraph for those municipalities which he or she determines to have experienced the largest increases in poverty from October 1, 1989, to October 1, 1993, inclusive, based on a weighted average of the unemployment rate, caseload under the temporary family assistance program and per capita income of less than ninety per cent of the state average between 1985 and 1989. In making his determination, the commissioner may also consider the vacancy rates for commercial and industrial facilities in a municipality and a municipality's program for the implementation of an effective enterprise zone program. To the extent appropriate, the commissioner shall use the Regional Economic Models, Inc. (REMI) system in making the calculations for such determination.\n\n(C) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, municipalities that were not distressed municipalities under the provisions of subsection (b) of section 32-9p on February 1, 1986, shall be eligible to designate areas as enterprise zones under subparagraph (A) or (B) of this subdivision.\n\n(3) On or after July 1, 2014, the commissioner shall approve the designation of two areas as enterprise zones as follows: (A) One area shall be in a municipality with a population of not more than fifty thousand, as enumerated in the 2010 federal decennial census, and in which is located a United States Postal Service processing center that at any point in time employed one thousand or more persons, except that such area shall only be designated as an enterprise zone for a term of five years from the date any portion of the area is transferred, provided such transfer occurs on or after July 1, 2014, and (B) one area shall be in a municipality with a population of not less than seven thousand eight hundred and not more than seven thousand nine hundred, as enumerated in the 2010 federal decennial census, and having a total area of not more than 12.2 square miles. Each such enterprise zone area shall consist of two contiguous United States census tracts, contiguous portions of such census tracts or all or a portion of an individual census tract, as determined in accordance with the most recent federal decennial census and, if such area is covered by zoning, a portion of such area shall be zoned to allow commercial or industrial activity. The census tracts in each such enterprise zone area shall not be required to meet the eligibility criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, municipalities that were not distressed municipalities under the provisions of subsection (b) of section 32-9p on February 1, 1986, shall be eligible to designate areas as enterprise zones under this subdivision.\n\n(4) (A) The commissioner shall not approve the designation of more than one enterprise zone in any municipality. The commissioner shall adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 concerning such additional qualifications for an area to become an enterprise zone as he or she deems necessary.\n\n(B) The commissioner may remove the designation of any area he or she has approved as an enterprise zone if such area no longer meets the criteria for designation as such an area set forth in this section or in regulations adopted pursuant to this section, except that no such designation shall be removed (i) less than ten years from the original date of approval of such zone, or (ii) if the number of residents in such area with income below the poverty level, as determined by the most recent United States census, has not been reduced by at least seventy-five per cent from the original date of approval of such zone.\n\n(C) The commissioner may designate any additional area as an enterprise zone if that area is designated as an enterprise zone, empowerment zone or enterprise community pursuant to any federal legislation.\n\n(d) Each municipality seeking the approval of the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development for the designation of an area of the municipality as an enterprise zone shall file with the commissioner a preliminary application. Not later than sixty days after receipt of such a preliminary application, the commissioner shall indicate to the municipality, in writing, any recommendations for improving the municipality's application. Not later than sixty days after receipt of the commissioner's written response, the municipality shall file a final application with the commissioner.\n\n(e) The Department of Economic and Community Development shall compile information on activities and programs which are conducted in enterprise zones approved by the commissioner before and after July 1, 1986, and shall serve as a resource center for the dissemination of such information upon request.\n\n(P.A. 81-445, S. 1, 11; P.A. 82-435, S. 1, 8; P.A. 83-381, S. 1; P.A. 84-144, S. 1, 2; P.A. 86-258, S. 1, 8; P.A. 88-323, S. 1, 2; P.A. 91-354, S. 2; P.A. 93-331, S. 1; P.A. 94-175, S. 30, 32; 94-241, S. 2, 4; 94-247, S. 7, 8; May Sp.

Pending preparation of the definitive bonds, the energy improvement district board may issue interim receipts or certificates that shall be exchanged for such definitive bonds.\n\n(c) Any resolution or resolutions authorizing any revenue bonds or any issue of revenue bonds may contain provisions, which shall be part of the contract with the holders of the revenue bonds to be authorized, as to: (1) Pledging all or any part of the revenues of a project or any revenue-producing contract or contracts made by the energy improvement district board with any individual, partnership, corporation or association or other body, public or private, to secure the payment of the revenue bonds or of any particular issue of revenue bonds, subject to such agreements with bondholders as may then exist; (2) the rentals, fees and other charges to be charged, the amounts to be raised in each year thereby and the use and disposition of the revenues; (3) the setting aside of reserves or sinking funds or other funds or accounts as the board may establish and the regulation and disposition thereof, including requirements that any such funds and accounts be held separate from or not be commingled with other funds of the board; (4) limitations on the right of the board or its agent to restrict and regulate the use of the project; (5) limitations on the purpose to which the proceeds of sale of any issue of revenue bonds then or thereafter to be issued may be applied and pledging such proceeds to secure the payment of the revenue bonds or any issue of the revenue bonds; (6) limitations on the issuance of additional bonds, the terms upon which additional bonds may be issued and secured and the refunding of outstanding bonds; (7) the procedure, if any, by which the terms of any contract with bondholders may be amended or abrogated, the amount of bonds the holders of which must consent thereto and the manner in which such consent may be given; (8) limitations on the amount of moneys derived from the project to be expended for operating, administrative or other expenses of the board; (9) defining the acts or omissions to act that shall constitute a default in the duties of the board to holders of its obligations and providing the rights and remedies of such holders in the event of a default; (10) the mortgaging of a project and the site thereof for the purpose of securing the bondholder; and (11) provisions for the execution of reimbursement agreements or similar agreements in connection with credit facilities, including, but not limited to, letters of credit or policies of bond insurance, remarketing agreements and agreements for the purpose of moderating interest rate fluctuations.\n\n(d) If any member whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature appears on any bonds or coupons ceases to be such member before delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if he had remained in office until such delivery. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 32-80a to 32-80c, inclusive, or any recitals in any bonds issued pursuant to subsections (a) to (h), inclusive, of this section, all such bonds shall be deemed to be negotiable instruments under the provisions of the general statutes.\n\n(e) Unless otherwise provided by the ordinance creating the energy improvement district board, the board may issue bonds pursuant to subsections (a) to (h), inclusive, of this section, without obtaining the consent of the state or of any political subdivision thereof and without any other proceedings or conditions specifically required by sections 32-80a to 32-80c, inclusive.\n\n(f) An energy improvement district board may, within available funds, purchase its bonds or notes. The energy improvement district board may hold, pledge, cancel or resell such bonds, subject to and in accordance with agreements with bondholders.\n\n(g) An energy improvement district board shall cause a copy of any bond resolutions adopted by it to be filed for public inspection in its office and in the office of the clerk of each participating municipality and may thereupon cause to be published at least once, in a newspaper published or circulating in each participating municipality, a notice stating the fact and date of such adoption and the places where such bond resolution has been so filed for public inspection and the date of the first publication of such notice and also stating that any action or proceeding of any kind or nature in any court questioning the validity or proper authorization of bonds provided for by the bond resolution, or the validity of any covenants, agreements or contracts provided for by the bond resolution, shall be commenced not later than twenty days after the first publication of such notice. If any such notice is published and if no action or proceeding questions the validity or proper authorization of bonds provided for by the bond resolution referred to in such notice or the validity of any covenants, agreements or contracts provided for by the bond resolution is commenced or instituted not later than twenty days after the first publication of said notice, then all residents and taxpayers and owners of property in each participating municipality and all other persons shall be forever barred and foreclosed from instituting or commencing any action or proceeding in any court or from pleading any defense to any action or proceeding questioning the validity or proper authorization of such bonds or the validity of such covenants, agreements or contracts, and said bonds, covenants, agreements and contracts shall be conclusively deemed to be valid and binding obligations in accordance with their terms and tenor.\n\n(h) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, (1) the state shall not have any liability or responsibility with regard to any obligation issued by the board, and (2) no political subdivision of the state shall have any liability or responsibility with regard to any obligation issued by the board except as expressly provided by sections 32-80a to 32-80c, inclusive.\n\n(i) An energy improvement district board may secure any bonds issued pursuant to subsection (b) of section 32-80a by a trust indenture by way of conveyance, deed of trust or mortgage of any project or any other property of the board, whether or not financed in whole or in part from the proceeds of such bonds, or by a trust agreement by and between the board and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state or by both such conveyance, deed of trust or mortgage and indenture or trust agreement. Such trust indenture or agreement may pledge or assign any or all fees, rents and other charges to be received or proceeds of any contract or contracts pledged, and may convey or mortgage any property of the board. Such trust indenture or agreement may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the right and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including provisions that have been specifically authorized to be included in any resolution or resolutions of the board authorizing the issue of bonds. Any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the state may act as depository of the proceeds of such bonds or of revenues or other moneys and may furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the board. Such trust indenture may set forth rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition, such trust indenture or agreement may contain such other provisions as the board may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust indenture or agreement may be treated as part of the cost of a project.\n\n(j) An energy improvement district board may fix, revise, charge and collect rates, rents, fees and charges for the use of and for the services furnished or to be furnished by each project and to contract with any person, partnership, association or corporation, or other body, public or private, in respect thereof. Such rates, rents, fees and charges shall be fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate of rates, rents, fees and charges from such project so as to provide funds sufficient with other revenues, if any, to (1) pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the project and each and every portion thereof, to the extent that the payment of such cost has not otherwise been adequately provided for, (2) pay the principal and interest of outstanding revenue bonds of the board issued in respect of such project as the same shall become due and payable, and (3) create and maintain reserves required or provided for in any resolution authorizing, or trust agreement securing, such revenue bonds of the board. Such rates, rents, fees and charges shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any department, commission, board, body, bureau or agency of this state other than the board. A sufficient amount of the revenues derived in respect of a project, except such part of such revenues as may be necessary to pay the cost of maintenance, repair and operation and to provide reserves and for renewals, replacements, extensions, enlargements and improvements as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of any revenue bonds of the board or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or trust agreement in a sinking or other similar fund which is hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such revenue bonds as the same shall become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; the rates, rents, fees and charges and other revenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the board shall immediately be subject to the lien of any such pledge, without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the board, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any trust indenture or agreement by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the board. The use and disposition of moneys to the credit of such sinking or other similar fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or of such trust agreement. Except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or such trust indenture or agreement, such sinking or other similar fund shall be a fund for all revenue bonds issued to finance a project of such board without distinction or priority of one over another.\n\n(k) All moneys received by the board pursuant to sections 32-80a to 32-80c, inclusive, whether as proceeds from the sale of bonds or as revenues, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided pursuant to this subsection and subsection (j) of this section.\n\n(l) Any holder of bonds, notes, certificates or other evidences of borrowing issued pursuant to subsection (b) of section 32-80a or of any of the coupons appertaining thereto and the trustee under any trust indenture or agreement, except to the extent the right may be restricted by such trust indenture or agreement, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, injunction, mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the provisions of the general statutes or granted by sections 32-80a to 32-80c, inclusive, or under such trust indenture or agreement or the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes or certificates, and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by said sections or by such trust indenture or agreement or solution to be performed by the energy improvement district board or by any officer or agent thereof, including the fixing, charging and collection of fees, rents and other charges.\n\n(P.A. 07-242, S. 24–27.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 07-242 effective June 4, 2007.",

      "text": "(a) An energy improvement district board, in the exercise of its powers granted pursuant to sections 32-80a to 32-80c, inclusive, shall be for the benefit of the inhabitants of the state, for the increase of their commerce and for the promotion of their safety, health, welfare, convenience and prosperity, and as the operation and maintenance of any project which the board is authorized to undertake constitute the performance of an essential governmental function, no board shall be required to pay any taxes or assessments upon any project acquired and constructed by it under the provisions of said sections. The bonds, notes, certificates or other evidences of debt issued pursuant to subsections (a) to (h), inclusive, of section 32-80b, their transfer and the income therefrom, including any profit made on the sale thereof, shall at all times be free and exempt from taxation, except for estate or succession taxes, by the state and by any political subdivision thereof, but the interest on such bonds, notes, certificates or other evidences of debt shall be included in the computation of any excise or franchise tax.\n\n(b) Bonds issued by an energy improvement district board pursuant to subsection (b) of section 32-80a shall be securities in which all public officers and public bodies of the state and its political subdivisions, all insurance companies, trust companies, banking associations, investment companies and executors, administrators, trustees and other fiduciaries may properly and legally invest funds, including capital in their control or belonging to them. Such bonds shall be securities that may properly and legally be deposited with and received by any state or municipal officer or any agency or political subdivision of the state for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds or obligations is now or may hereafter be authorized by law.\n\n(c) A municipality may, by ordinance, and any other governmental unit may, without any referendum or public or competitive bidding, and any person may sell, lease, lend, grant or convey to an energy improvement district board or permit a board to use, maintain or operate as part of any distributed resource facility any real or personal property that may be necessary or useful and convenient for the purposes of the board and accepted by the board. Any such sale, lease, loan, grant, conveyance or permit may be made or given with or without consideration and for a specified or an unlimited period and under any agreement and on any terms and conditions that may be approved by such municipality, governmental unit or person and that may be agreed to by the board in conformity with its contract with the holders of any bonds. Subject to any such contracts with the holders of bonds, the board may enter into and perform any and all agreements with respect to property so purchased, leased, borrowed, received or accepted by it, including agreements for the assumption of principal or interest or both of indebtedness of such municipality, governmental unit or person or of any mortgage or lien existing with respect to such property or for the operation and maintenance of such property as part of any energy improvement district distributed resources facility.\n\n(d) A municipality, governmental unit or person may enter into and perform any lease or other agreement with any energy improvement district board for the lease or other agreement with any municipality, governmental unit or person of all or any part of any energy improvement district distributed resource facility or facilities. Any such lease or other agreement may provide for the payment to the board by such municipality, governmental unit or person, annually or otherwise, of such sum or sums of money, computed at fixed amount or by any formula or in any other manner, as may be so fixed or computed. Any such lease or other agreement may be made and entered into for a term beginning currently or at some future or contingent date and with or without consideration and for a specified or unlimited time and on any terms and conditions which may be approved by such municipality, governmental unit or person and which may be agreed to by the board in conformity with its contract with the holders of any bonds, and shall be valid and binding on such municipality, governmental unit or person whether or not an appropriation is made thereby prior to authorization or execution of such lease or other agreement. Such municipality, governmental unit or person shall do all acts and things necessary, convenient or desirable to carry out and perform any such lease or other agreement entered into by it and to provide for the payment or discharge of any obligation thereunder in the same manner as other obligations of such municipality, governmental unit or person.\n\n(e) For the purpose of aiding an energy improvement district board, a municipality, by ordinance or by resolution of its legislative body, shall have power from time to time and for such period and upon such terms, with or without consideration, as may be provided by such resolution or ordinance and accepted by the board, (1) to appropriate moneys for the purposes of the board, and to loan or donate such money to the board in such installments and upon such terms as may be agreed upon with the board, (2) to covenant and agree with the board to pay to or on the order of the board annually or at shorter intervals as a subsidy for the promotion of its purposes not more than such sums of money as may be stated in such resolution or ordinance or computed in accordance therewith, (3) upon authorization by it in accordance with law of the performance of any act or thing which it is empowered by law to authorize and perform and after appropriation of the moneys, if any, necessary for such performance, to covenant and agree with the board to do and perform such act or thing and as to the time, manner and other details of its doing and performance, and (4) to appropriate money for all or any part of the cost of acquisition or construction of such facility, and, in accordance with the limitations and any exceptions thereto and in accordance with procedure prescribed by law, to incur indebtedness, borrow money and issue its negotiable bonds for the purpose of financing such distributed resource facility and appropriation, and to pay the proceeds of such bonds to the board.\n\n(f) For the purpose of aiding an energy improvement district board in the planning, undertaking, acquisition, construction or operation of any distributed resource facility, a participating municipality may, pursuant to resolution adopted by its legislative body in the manner provided for adoption of a resolution authorizing bonds of such municipality and with or without consideration and upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed to by and between the municipality and the board, unconditionally guarantee the punctual payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds of the board and pledge the full faith and credit of the municipality to the payment thereof. Any guarantee of bonds of the board made pursuant to this subsection shall be evidenced by endorsement thereof on such bonds, executed in the name of the municipality and on its behalf by such officer thereof as may be designated in the resolution authorizing such guaranty, and such municipality shall thereupon and thereafter be obligated to pay the principal of and interest on said bonds in the same manner and to the same extent as in the case of bonds issued by it. As part of the guarantee of the municipality for payment of principal and interest on the bonds, the municipality may pledge to and agree with the owners of bonds issued under this chapter and with those persons who may enter into contracts with the municipality or the board or any successor agency pursuant to the provisions of this chapter that it will not limit or alter the rights thereby vested in the bond owners, the board or any contracting party until such bonds, together with the interest thereon, are fully met and discharged and such contracts are fully performed on the part of the municipality or the board, provided nothing in this subsection shall preclude such limitation or alteration if and when adequate provisions shall be made by law for the protection of the owners of such bonds of the municipality or the board or those entering into such contracts with the municipality or the board. The board is authorized to include this pledge and undertaking for the municipality in such bonds or contracts. To the extent provided in such agreement or agreements, the obligations of the municipality thereunder shall be obligatory upon the municipality and the inhabitants and property thereof, and thereafter the municipality shall appropriate in each year during the term of such agreement, and there shall be available on or before the date when the same are payable, an amount of money that, together with other revenue available for such purpose, shall be sufficient to pay such principal and interest guaranteed by it and payable thereunder in that year, and there shall be included in the tax levy for each such year in an amount that, together with other revenues available for such purpose, shall be sufficient to meet such appropriation. Any such agreement shall be valid, binding and enforceable against the municipality if approved by action of the legislative body of such municipality. Any such guaranty of bonds of the board may be made, and any resolution authorizing such guaranty may be adopted, notwithstanding any statutory debt or other limitations, but the principal amount of bonds so guaranteed shall, after their issuance, be included in the gross debt of such municipality for the purpose of determining the indebtedness of such municipality under subsection (b) of section 7-374. The principal amount of bonds so guaranteed and included in gross debt shall be deducted and is declared to be and to constitute a deduction from such gross debt under and for all the purposes of subsection (b) of said section 7-374, (1) from and after the time of issuance of said bonds until the end of the fiscal year beginning next after the completion of acquisition and construction of the distributed resource facility to be financed from the proceeds of such bonds, and (2) during any subsequent fiscal year if the revenues of the board in the preceding fiscal year are sufficient to pay its expenses of operation and maintenance in such year and all amounts payable in such year on account of the principal and interest on all such guaranteed bonds, all bonds of the municipality issued as provided in this subsection and all bonds of the energy improvement district board issued under subsection (b) of section 32-80a.\n\n(g) Any energy improvement district board may pledge or assign any lease or other agreement, and any instruments making or evidencing the same to secure its bonds and thereafter may not modify such leases, agreements or instruments except as provided by the terms of such lease, agreement or instrument.\n\n(h) All property of an energy improvement district board shall be exempt from levy and sale by virtue of an execution and no execution or other judicial process shall issue against the same nor shall any judgment against the board be a charge or lien upon its property, provided nothing in this subsection shall apply to or limit the rights of the holder of any bonds to pursue any remedy for the enforcement of any pledge or lien given by the board on its facility revenues or other moneys.\n\n(i) An energy improvement district board and the municipality in which any property of the board is located may enter into agreements with respect to the payment by the board to such municipality of annual sums of money in lieu of taxes on such property in such amount as may be agreed upon between the board and the municipality. The board may make, and the municipality may accept, such payments and apply them in the manner in which taxes may be applied in such municipality, provided no such annual payment with respect to any parcel of such property shall exceed the amount of taxes paid thereon for the taxable year immediately prior to the time of its acquisition by the board.\n\n(P.A. 07-242, S. 28–36; June Sp.
