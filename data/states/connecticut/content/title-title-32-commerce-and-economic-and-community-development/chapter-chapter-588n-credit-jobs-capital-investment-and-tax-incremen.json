      "text": "(a) There is created within the corporation the Connecticut Works Guarantee Fund. The corporation may issue or make advance commitments to issue guarantees of loans and guarantees of other investments. No guarantee or commitment to issue a guarantee shall be provided or entered into by the corporation pursuant to this section which would cause the aggregate amount of all such guarantees and commitments then outstanding to exceed four times the sum of the amounts available in the fund plus the amount of any unpaid grants authorized to be made by the Department of Economic and Community Development to the corporation for deposit in the fund which remain available for purposes of the fund pursuant to the bond authorization in section 32-262, provided the amount of any guarantee shall be measured by the portion of unpaid loan principal, or its equivalent in the case of other investments, which is guaranteed by the corporation and shall exclude for purposes of such limitation the amount of any such guarantee to the extent that the liability of the corporation with respect thereto has been reinsured or otherwise assumed by an eligible financial institution with a long-term credit rating equal to or higher than that of the state. The purposes of such program shall be: (1) To encourage the growth and retention of manufacturing firms and other businesses in the state that are unable to obtain financing under reasonable terms and conditions due to the contraction in liquidity in the banking system; (2) to stimulate the growth and retention of jobs, the development of all geographic regions of the state and the increase in state and municipal tax revenue; and (3) to address concerns with the availability of financing which has been discontinued subsequent to a merger, takeover or liquidation of a financial institution by a federal financial regulatory institution. The corporation shall utilize the authority provided by this section to achieve the maximum creation or retention of jobs, especially high quality, skilled jobs, with the funds available. There shall be deposited in the fund all guarantee fees and all proceeds of collateral and other recoveries with respect to payments made under guarantees and any and all other moneys or assets, other than payments on guarantees issued hereunder, received by the corporation in return for any guarantee provided or offered, whether pursuant to any applicable contract or agreement entered into by the corporation under subsection (i) of this section or otherwise. Amounts in the fund shall be used in accordance with this section to satisfy any valid guarantee claim payable therefrom and may be used for any other purpose determined by the corporation to be in furtherance of any guarantee or any contract or agreement with an eligible financial institution entered into pursuant to this section or determined by the corporation to be necessary or appropriate to protect the interests of the corporation or the fund, including, without limitation, protecting the interests of the corporation in any project during any period of loan delinquency or upon loan default. Any administrative expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of this section, to the extent not paid by the corporation, shall be paid from the fund. Each payment from the fund for such administrative expenses shall be made by the corporation upon certification by the chairperson of the corporation that the payment is authorized under the provisions of this section, under the applicable rules and regulations of the corporation. Any amounts in the fund not currently needed to meet the obligations of the fund and the expenses of the corporation may be invested in obligations designated by the corporation, and all income from such investments shall become part of the fund.\n\n(b) The corporation may issue to eligible financial institutions, upon such terms and conditions as the corporation may determine, guarantees of loans and guarantees of other investments the proceeds of which will be used for a business purpose whose economic impact will be in this state.\n\n(c) The corporation shall determine which financial institutions are eligible to participate in the guarantee program consistent with any applicable principles set forth in the participation guidelines for the loan guarantee program of the Connecticut Works Fund. The corporation shall encourage the participation of financial institutions of all sizes from all regions of the state.\n\n(d) (1) The corporation may issue guarantees of loans and other investments, consistent with any applicable principles set forth in the eligibility guidelines for the loan guarantee program of the Connecticut Works Fund, for any project used for manufacturing, industrial, research, product warehousing, distribution or other purposes which will create or retain jobs, maintain or diversify industry, including new or emerging technologies, or maintain or increase the tax base. The corporation also may issue guarantees of loans and guarantees of other investments for other purposes if the corporation determines that such loans or other investments will materially contribute to employment in the state by creating high quality jobs, encouraging exportation beyond the state of goods and services, developing new products or services, creating or supporting a secondary market for business loans made within the state or otherwise supporting, contributing to or enhancing activities important to employment levels in the state. The corporation may issue loan guarantees to women-owned businesses and minority business enterprises. As used in this section, “women-owned business” means any business of which fifty-one per cent or more of the capital stock, if any, or assets are owned by a woman who is active in the daily affairs of the business and has the power to direct the management and policies of the business, and “minority business enterprise” has the same meaning as provided in section 4a-60g.\n\n(2) The corporation shall not issue guarantees authorized under this section to guarantee loans for commercial real estate development projects or for passive real estate ownership. The corporation may issue guarantees for projects in which the borrower intends to purchase commercial real estate for use in its principal business operations.\n\n(3) No guarantee shall be issued pursuant to this section for the financing or refinancing of any project unless the corporation determines that the project is otherwise unable to obtain financing in satisfactory amounts or under reasonable terms or conditions or unless the corporation determines that the borrower is unable to start, continue to operate, expand, maintain operations or relocate to this state without such guarantee.\n\n(4) No guarantee shall be issued pursuant to this section for the financing or refinancing of any project which the corporation determines may be financed commercially, upon reasonable terms and conditions, without such a guarantee, and which an eligible financial institution nonetheless has attempted to shift into this program. The corporation shall determine whether a project has been inappropriately diverted into this program consistent with the credit availability principles set forth in any applicable guidelines for the loan guarantee program of the Connecticut Works Fund. The corporation may require the participating institution to submit its loan criteria and such other information as may be appropriate, and in reviewing projects that involve the refinancing of existing loans, may require submission of the classification assigned to that loan by examiners for any federal financial regulatory institution.\n\n(e) (1) The corporation shall maximize the leveraging capability of guarantees under this section to the extent feasible. The amount guaranteed shall not exceed forty per cent of the principal amount of any particular loan or other investment, and the total guarantee amounts for all outstanding loans or other investments guaranteed by the corporation under this section shall not exceed thirty per cent of the total principal amount of all such loans and investments, except that in the case of a loan guarantee extended in participation with the United States Small Business Administration, the amount guaranteed may be up to fifty per cent of the total principal amount of loans to a borrower, and such loan guarantee may be disregarded for purposes of determining compliance with such overall thirty per cent guarantee limitation, provided at least an equal percentage of the total principal amount of the loans to such borrower is guaranteed by the United States Small Business Administration for at least the same term and otherwise on substantially the same basis as the loan guarantee extended by the corporation. The term of any guarantee issued under this section shall not exceed twenty-five years.\n\n(2) No more than ten million dollars of guarantees shall be issued for a single project. No more than ten million dollars of guarantees shall be issued with respect to loans and other investments to any one person or to any entity owned by, controlled by or under common control with such person.\n\n(3) No loan guarantee shall be issued to an eligible financial institution for any loan or other investment to any executive officer or director of such institution, or to any shareholder owning more than five per cent of the outstanding stock of such institution, or any executive officer of any other eligible financial institution or any director or shareholder owning more than five per cent of the outstanding stock of any such institution, or a member of the immediate family of such an executive officer, director or shareholder or to any company or entity controlled by any such persons.\n\n(f) The corporation shall consider all proposals for guarantees submitted by eligible financial institutions consistent with the due diligence principles set forth in any applicable loan presentation guidelines and underwriting considerations for the loan guarantee program of the Connecticut Works Fund. The corporation shall review and periodically update its due diligence principles as appropriate.\n\n(g) To carry out the purposes of this section, the corporation shall have the powers set forth in section 32-23e, provided no provision of section 32-23e shall be construed to limit any power specifically granted to the corporation under this chapter and no provision of this chapter shall be construed to limit any power specifically granted to the corporation under section 32-23e.\n\n(h) The corporation is authorized from time to time to enter into guarantee agreements, reimbursement agreements, participation agreements, collateral sharing agreements, servicing agreements, and any other agreements or contracts with borrowers or recipients of other investments and with eligible financial institutions with respect to the fund and any loan or other investment guarantee thereunder. Any such agreement or contract, and any procedure of the corporation, may contain terms, provisions or conditions necessary or desirable in connection with the program subject to the requirements established by this section, including without limitation, terms, provisions and conditions relating to loan documentation, review and approval procedures, origination and servicing rights and responsibilities, default conditions, procedures and obligations, the payment of guarantee fees, the giving of notice, claim procedures, the sources of payment for claims, the priority of competing claims for payment, the release or termination of loan security and borrower liability, the timing of payment, the maintenance and disposition of projects and the use of amounts received during periods of loan delinquency or upon default, and any other provisions concerning the rights of guaranteed parties or conditions to the payment of guarantees. Any fees for guarantees issued under the provisions of this section may be determined on such basis, be payable by such person, in such amounts and at such times as the corporation shall determine, and the amount of the fees need not be uniform among the various guarantees. The agreements or contracts may be executed on an individual, group or master contract basis with eligible financial institutions.\n\n(i) Any guarantee made by the corporation under the authorization of this section shall provide that claims payable under such guarantee shall first be paid from any amounts readily available in the fund before any amounts available from the bond authorization contained in section 32-262 are utilized for claim payment. The faith and credit of the state is hereby pledged, pursuant to said bond authorization and in accordance with section 3-20, to provide to the fund moneys as and when necessary to make timely payments of all amounts required to be paid under the terms of any guarantee executed by the corporation pursuant to this section, but not in excess of the amount of bonds so authorized by the State Bond Commission for such purpose less the amounts paid by the state for deposit to such fund. The obligation of the corporation to make payments under any such guarantee shall be limited solely to such sources and shall not constitute a debt or liability of the corporation or the state.\n\n(j) Any guarantee executed by the corporation under this section shall be conclusive evidence of eligibility for such guarantee, and the validity of any guarantee so executed or of a commitment to guarantee shall be incontestable in the hands of an eligible financial institution holding such guarantee or commitment from the date of execution and delivery thereof, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such eligible financial institution and, as to commitments to guarantee, noncompliance with the commitment or corporation rules or regulations in force at the time of issuance of the commitment.\n\n(k) As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings unless the context indicates another meaning and intent:\n\n(1) “Corporation” means Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated created under subsection (a) of section 32-35;\n\n(2) “Eligible financial institution” has the same meaning as provided in subsection (e) of section 32-23d;\n\n(3) “Loans” means loans, notes, bonds and all other forms of debt financing or extensions of credit, secured or unsecured, including loans for working capital purposes;\n\n(4) “Other investments” means (A) any and all forms of equity financing made by the corporation or an eligible financial institution, (B) any participation or other interest in such equity financing, however evidenced, or (C) any pool or portfolio of, or position in, loans, such equity financing or any combination thereof;\n\n(5) “Person” has the same meaning as provided in subsection (s) of section 32-23d; and\n\n(6) “State” means the state of Connecticut.\n\n(P.A. 92-236, S. 2, 48; P.A. 93-360, S. 10, 19; 93-382, S. 14, 69; 93-393, S. 1, 2; P.A. 95-250, S. 1; 95-334, S. 2, 13; P.A. 96-211, S. 1, 5, 6; P.A. 98-246, S. 3, 4; June Sp.

      "text": "(a)(1) There is hereby established a tax incremental financing program, under which the incremental hotel taxes collected under subparagraph (H) of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 12-407, which are generated by a project approved by the corporation under this section may be used to pay the debt service on bonds issued by the corporation to help finance, on a self-sustaining basis, significant economic projects and encourage their location in the state.\n\n(2) The incremental sales taxes collected under chapter 219, other than the sales tax referenced in subdivision (1) of this subsection, and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes collected under chapter 225 which are generated by a project may, subject to approval pursuant to this section by the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to the Department of Economic and Community Development and finance, revenue and bonding, and the corporation, be used to pay the debt service on bonds issued by the corporation to help finance, on a self-sustaining basis, significant economic projects and encourage their location in the state.\n\n(b) As used in this section: (1) “Corporation” means Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated; and (2) “eligible project” means a large-scale economic development project (A) that may add a substantial amount of new economic activity and employment in the municipality in which it is to be located and surrounding areas, and may generate significant additional tax revenues in the state; (B) for which use of the tax incremental financing mechanism may be necessary to attract the project to locate in the state; (C) which is economically viable and self-sustaining, taking into account the application of the proceeds of the bonds to be issued under the tax incremental financing program; (D) for which the direct and indirect economic benefits to the state and the municipality in which it will be located outweigh the costs of the project; and (E) which is consistent with the strategic development priorities of the state.\n\n(c) Any person, firm or corporation wishing to participate in the tax incremental financing program, or any municipality wishing to obtain tax incremental financing to support a project within its boundaries, may apply to the corporation in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. The application shall contain such information as the corporation may require, which may include information concerning the type of business proposed to be established and its location, the number of jobs to be created or retained and their average wage rates, feasibility studies or business plans for the project and other information necessary to demonstrate its financial viability, the amounts and types of bonds proposed to be issued for the project and the proposed use of the proceeds, information about other sources of financing available to support repayment of the bonds proposed to be issued, including property tax increments to be made available by the municipality, a geographic description of the area surrounding the proposed site of the project and the existing firms doing business in that area, an economic impact assessment of the effects of the project on the municipality, an assessment of the incremental hotel taxes, or, if applicable, the incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes to be generated by the project, an analysis of necessary infrastructure development to support the project and any available sources of financing for such infrastructure and other information which demonstrates that the bonds will be self-sustaining from the incremental taxes collected and any amounts made available by a municipality under subsection (i) of this section, and that the project will provide net benefits to the economy and employment opportunity in the state. The corporation shall impose a fee for such application as it deems appropriate. Any costs incurred by the corporation which are associated with such application and are not covered by such fee shall be paid from funds of the corporation which are not otherwise committed or pledged.\n\n(d) Upon receiving an application for participation in the tax incremental financing program and any supporting information, the chief executive officer of the corporation shall make a preliminary determination as to whether a proposed project may be eligible for participation in the program.\n\n(e) (1) The corporation shall review each application that has been preliminarily determined to be eligible under subsection (d) of this section. In reviewing an application, the corporation shall obtain such additional information as may be necessary to make a final determination as to whether the project is eligible for participation in the program, whether the project is economically viable with use of the tax incremental financing mechanism, the effects of the project on the municipality and whether the project would provide net benefits to economic development and employment opportunity in the state. The corporation may require the project sponsor to submit such additional information as may be necessary to evaluate the application.\n\n(2) The corporation shall retain such financial advisors and other experts as it deems appropriate to conduct an independent financial assessment of the application and supporting information, including, in particular, the amount of the incremental hotel taxes, or, if applicable, the incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes to be generated by the project, whether the project will be economically viable and whether the bonds will be self-sustaining.\n\n(3) The corporation shall prepare a revenue impact assessment that estimates the incremental hotel taxes or, if applicable, the incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes that would be generated by the project, the state and local revenues that would be foregone as a result of the project, all state and local revenues that would be generated by the project and the economic benefits that would likely result from construction of the project, including revenue effects of such economic benefits.\n\n(4) (A) Not later than seventy-two hours before presenting a proposed project to the board of directors of the corporation for final approval, if such project uses incremental hotel taxes, the chief executive officer of the corporation shall give notice of the proposed project and meeting to the president pro tempore and minority leader of the Senate, the speaker and minority leader of the House of Representatives and the chairpersons and ranking members of the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to finance, revenue and bonding and the Department of Economic and Community Development. Such notice shall include such information about the project, the estimated tax increments and the revenue impact assessment, as may be appropriate, consistent with the protection of any confidential financial information provided by the project sponsor. Any such member of the General Assembly may, by notifying the chief executive officer, request that the board of directors of the corporation defer final consideration of the project for thirty days.\n\n(B) If such project uses incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes, the notice required pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this subdivision shall not be required, but the procedure in subdivision (6) of subsection (f) of this section shall be followed after the board of directors of the corporation has given approval to such project.\n\n(f) (1) Upon consideration of the application, the results of the independent financial assessment, the revenue impact assessment and any additional information that the board of directors of the corporation requires concerning a proposed project, such board of directors shall determine whether to approve the project for participation in the tax incremental financing program and, if so, the amount and type of bonds the corporation shall issue to support the approved project, the purposes for which the funds generated by sale of the bonds may be applied and the amount of the incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes that shall be annually allocated to pay principal and interest on the bonds to be issued for the project. The amounts so allocated shall not exceed the estimated amount of incremental taxes to be collected, except that in the case of retail shopping center projects, the amount of incremental sales allocated to calculating incremental sales taxes shall not exceed thirty per cent of gross sales directly associated with the project. From the amount of incremental taxes so allocated by the corporation, the amount required for payment of principal and interest on the bonds issued in accordance with subsection (g) of this section shall be deemed appropriated from the state General Fund, provided, for projects using incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes, an amount shall be deemed appropriated only upon final approval of such projects pursuant to subdivision (6) of this subsection.\n\n(2) The corporation may approve a project only if it concludes that: (A) The project is an eligible project; (B) the incremental hotel taxes or, if applicable, the incremental sales taxes collected under chapter 219 and the incremental admissions, cabaret and dues taxes collected under chapter 225 that are generated by the project, together with other dedicated sources of financing available to pay debt service on the bonds, will be sufficient to pay interest and principal on the bonds as they come due; (C) the project will be economically viable and will contribute significantly to economic development and employment opportunity in the state; and (D) the direct and indirect economic benefits of the project to the state and the municipality in which it shall be located will be greater than the costs to the state and such municipality.\n\n(3) The corporation shall seek to obtain diversification among the types of projects supported under this program and among the geographic regions in the state in which projects are located.\n\n(4) The approval of a project by the corporation may be combined with the exercise of any of its other powers, including but not limited to, the provision of other forms of financial assistance. The proceeds of the bonds may be combined with any other funds available from state or federal programs, or from investments by the private sector, to support the project.\n\n(5) Upon approving a project, the corporation may require the project sponsor to reimburse the corporation for all or any part of the costs of the independent financial assessment conducted in reviewing the application and any other related costs incurred.\n\n(6) For final approval of any proposed project using incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes, the corporation shall submit, in a manner consistent with the protection of any confidential financial information provided by the project sponsor, copies of the application, the independent financial assessment, the revenue impact assessment, and the proposed financial assistance to be offered by the corporation to the proposed project, to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to the Department of Economic and Community Development and finance, revenue and bonding for final approval. Not later than forty-five days after said committees' receipt of such proposed project information, said committees shall advise the corporation of their approval or modifications, if any, to such proposed financial assistance. If said committees do not agree, the committee chairpersons shall appoint a committee on conference which shall be comprised of three members from each joint standing committee. At least one member appointed from each committee shall be a member of the minority party. The report of the committee on conference shall be made to each committee, which shall vote to accept or reject the report. The report of the committee on conference may not be amended. If a joint standing committee rejects the report of the committee on conference, the proposed financial assistance shall be deemed approved. If the joint standing committees accept the report, the committee having cognizance of finance, revenue and bonding shall advise the corporation of their approval or modifications, if any, of such proposed financial assistance, provided, if the committees do not act within forty-five days, the proposed financial assistance shall be deemed approved. Financial assistance by the corporation for the proposed project shall be in accordance with the proposed financial assistance as approved or modified by the committees.\n\n(g) (1) The corporation may issue one or more series of bonds in accordance with the provisions of chapter 579, to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this subsection, payable in whole or in part from the incremental taxes allocated and deemed appropriated from the state General Fund under subsection (f) of this section and any amounts contributed by a municipality under subsection (i) of this section, to finance a project approved under this section or to refund bonds previously issued under this section. The corporation is authorized to make a grant of all or part of the proceeds of such bonds to any person in connection with the acquisition, construction and equipping of an eligible project, including the expense of the state or any municipality, or any instrumentality or agency of the state or any municipality, in connection therewith. Subject to applicable federal tax law, the corporation may issue such bonds, the interest on which is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes, or such bonds, the interest on which is not so excludable. The corporation, when authorizing the issuance of any series of such bonds, shall, in conjunction with the State Treasurer, determine the rate of interest of such bonds, the date or dates of their maturity, the medium of payment, the redemption terms and privileges, whether such bonds shall be sold by negotiated or competitive sale and any and all other terms, covenants and conditions not inconsistent with this section, in connection with the issuance thereof, including but not limited to, the pledging of special capital reserve funds authorized under subsection (b) of section 32-23j.\n\n(2) The issuance of any bonds by the corporation under this section shall be subject to the approval of the State Bond Commission. Upon approving a project, the corporation shall submit the matter to the State Bond Commission for final approval. The State Bond Commission shall not approve any project unless it has received the submission from the corporation at least ten days prior to the meeting at which such project is to be considered. Such submission shall include the information considered by the corporation in approving the project, the independent financial assessment and such other information as the commission deems appropriate. In reaching its decision, the State Bond Commission may consider such information as submitted. After such approval by the Bond Commission, no other approval shall be required for the project.\n\n(h) For such period of time as bonds issued to support an approved project are outstanding, the Treasurer shall make payment of interest and principal on the bonds to the trustee when due, but not exceeding in any fiscal year the amount deemed appropriated pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.\n\n(i) A portion of the proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to this section may be made available to a municipality in which a project is located for the purpose of carrying out or administering a redevelopment plan or other functions authorized under chapter 130 or chapter 132. Such municipality may contribute all or any part of the money specified in subdivision (2) of section 8-134a or subdivision (b) of section 8-192a to the corporation for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds issued by the corporation under this section to support such approved project. In exercising such power, such municipalities shall proceed as provided in said chapter 130 or 132, as the case may be, except that the references therein to bonds and bond anticipation notes shall be deemed to refer to the bonds issued by the corporation under this section.\n\n(j) (1) Not later than July first in each year that bonds issued to support an approved project are outstanding, the corporation shall submit a report to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to the Department of Economic and Community Development and finance, revenue and bonding with respect to the operations, finances and achievement of the economic development objectives of the projects approved under this section. The corporation shall review and evaluate the progress of each project and shall devise and employ techniques for forecasting and measuring relevant indices of accomplishment of its goals of economic development, including, but not limited to, (A) the actual expenditures compared to original estimated costs, (B) whether there have been significant cost increases over original estimates, (C) the number of jobs created, or to be created, by or as a result of the project, (D) the cost or estimated cost, to the corporation, involved in the creation of those jobs, (E) the amount of private capital investment in, or stimulated by, the project, in proportion to the public funds invested in such project, (F) the number of additional businesses created and associated jobs, and (G) any impact on tourism.\n\n(2) Not later than July first in each year that bonds issued to support an approved project are outstanding, the Office of Policy and Management shall retain independent financial experts to conduct an analysis of the financial status of each project approved under this section. The independent financial analysis shall include, but not be limited to, determinations as to whether the incremental hotel taxes or, if applicable, the incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes actually generated by the project are equal to the estimates made at the time the project was approved, whether the project is economically viable and whether the bonds issued are self-sustaining with the incremental taxes actually collected and other financing sources dedicated to repayment of the bonds. The corporation shall require the project sponsor to reimburse the Office of Policy and Management for the costs of such annual analyses. The results of such analyses shall be made available to the president pro tempore of the Senate, the speaker of the House of Representatives, the majority and minority leaders of both houses, and to the chairpersons and ranking members of said committees.\n\n(P.A. 92-236, S. 26, 48; May Sp.
