      "text": "(a) The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection may issue, deny, modify, renew, suspend, revoke or transfer a permit, under such conditions as he may prescribe and upon submission of such information as he may require, for the construction, alteration and operation of solid waste facilities, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the commissioner shall not issue (1) a permit for a solid waste land disposal facility on former railroad property until July 1, 1989, unless the commissioner makes a written determination that such facility is necessary to meet the solid waste disposal needs of the state and will not result in a substantial excess capacity of solid waste land disposal areas or disrupt the orderly transportation of or disposal of solid waste in the area affected by the facility, or (2) an operational permit for a resources recovery facility unless the applicant has submitted a plan pursuant to section 22a-208g for the disposal or recycling of ash residue expected to be generated at the facility in the first five years of operation. In making a decision to grant or deny a permit to construct a solid waste land disposal facility, including a vertical or horizontal landfill expansion, the commissioner shall consider the character of the neighborhood in which such facility is located and may impose requirements for hours and routes of truck traffic, security and fencing and for measures to prevent the blowing of dust and debris and to minimize insects, rodents and odors. In making a decision to grant or deny a permit to construct or operate a new transfer station, the commissioner shall consider whether such transfer station will result in disproportionately high adverse human health or environmental effects. In making a decision to grant or deny a permit to construct an ash residue disposal area, the commissioner shall consider any provision which the applicant shall make for a double liner, a leachate collection or detection system and the cost of transportation and disposal of ash residue at the site under consideration.\n\n(b) Except as provided in section 22a-208cc, no person or municipality shall establish, construct or operate a solid waste facility without a permit issued by the commissioner under this section. An application for such permit shall be submitted on a form prescribed by the commissioner, include such information as the commissioner may require, including, but not limited to, a closure plan for such facility, and be accompanied by a fee prescribed in regulations adopted in accordance with chapter 54. Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes or any regulation adopted pursuant to said statutes, references to a permit to construct or a permit to operate in a regulation adopted pursuant to section 22a-209 shall be deemed to mean a permit as required by this subsection. The applicant shall send a written notification of any application for such permit to the chief elected official of each municipality in which the proposed facility is to be located, within five business days of the date on which any such application is filed.\n\n(c) Upon written notice from the commissioner and in accordance with a schedule specified by the commissioner in such written notice, any person or municipality that owns an unpermitted solid waste disposal area shall (1) submit a closure plan for the commissioner's review and written approval, provide public notice of such proposed plan in a manner prescribed by regulations adopted pursuant to section 22a-133k and close and maintain such area after closure in accordance with the approved closure plan, or (2) remediate such disposal area in accordance with a remediation plan approved by the commissioner or verified by a licensed environmental professional pursuant to section 22a-133x, 22a-133y or 22a-134a or pursuant to an order of the commissioner. A fee of three thousand dollars shall accompany any closure plan submitted pursuant to this subsection. The commissioner may require the owner of a solid waste disposal area to post sufficient performance bond or other security to ensure compliance with the approved closure plan. The commissioner may approve a modification to a closure plan for a solid waste disposal area. A fee of five hundred dollars shall accompany the request for such modification. The commissioner may reduce or waive the fees required by this subsection in cases of financial hardship and may modify such fees in regulations adopted in accordance with chapter 54. The commissioner may require a person or municipality to provide public notice of a proposed modification of a closure plan if the modification involves any activity that would disrupt the solid waste or change the use of the solid waste disposal area. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the commissioner may order a person or municipality that establishes or constructs a solid waste disposal area without first obtaining a permit as required by subsection (b) of this section to remove any solid waste disposed at such area, to remediate any pollution caused by such waste, and to properly dispose of such waste at a lawfully operated solid waste facility.\n\n(d) (1) No person or municipality that holds a permit issued under this section shall alter the design or method of operation of the permitted facility without first obtaining a modified permit. For the purposes of this section and sections 22a-208, 22a-208b, 22a-220a, 22a-225 and 22a-226, “alter” means to change to any substantive degree the design, capacity, volume process or operation of a solid waste facility and includes, but is not limited to, changes in the approved capacity or composition of solid waste disposed of, processed, reduced, stored or recycled at the facility. For purposes of this section, “alter” does not include the addition of not more than seventy-five tons per day of mattresses and items designated by the commissioner for recycling pursuant to section 22a-241b and any regulation adopted pursuant to said section, except storage batteries and waste oil, provided the permitted storage capacity of such solid waste facility is not exceeded. The owner or operator of any such facility shall, not later than thirty days after adding such recyclable items, submit a written notification to the commissioner describing such addition. The commissioner may approve, in writing, a modification of a closure plan for a closed permitted solid waste disposal area without modifying the permit for such area. The commissioner may require a person who, or a municipality that, requests such modification to provide public notice of a proposed modification of a closure plan if the modification involves any activity that would disrupt the solid waste or change the use of the solid waste disposal area. A fee of five hundred dollars shall accompany any request for such modification of a closure plan. The commissioner may reduce or waive such fee in cases of financial hardship and may modify such fee in accordance with regulations adopted in accordance with chapter 54.\n\n(2) Changes in design, processes or operations, including the addition of thermal oxidizers or other air pollution control equipment, made to mitigate, correct or abate odors from a solid waste facility that is owned or operated by the MIRA Dissolution Authority and that contracts with more than fifty municipalities, shall not be considered an alteration requiring a modified permit or minor permit amendment under this chapter. In addition, notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes or regulation adopted pursuant to said statutes, any such change shall not be considered a modification or new stationary source requiring a permit to construct or operate under chapter 446c or under any regulation adopted pursuant to chapter 446c, unless such change is a major modification or a major stationary source requiring a permit under the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Any person making any such change to an odor control system at such a facility shall, not more than thirty days after making such change, submit a written report to the commissioner fully describing the changes made and the reason for such changes for the commissioner's review and comment. Nothing in this subdivision shall affect the commissioner's authority to take any other action to enforce the requirements of this title.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the receipt of not more than seventy-five tons per day of containerized food scrap, food processing residuals and soiled or unrecyclable paper and the storage of not more than one hundred fifty cubic yards of containerized food scrap, food processing residuals and soiled or unrecyclable paper at a facility permitted under this subsection shall not require a modification to any permit issued pursuant to this section. The receipt of such food scraps, food processing residuals and soiled or unrecyclable paper shall occur within a fully enclosed building, and such scraps, materials and paper shall remain containerized, except while being transferred, and shall be managed to control odor, leachate and attraction of vectors. The owner or operator of any such facility shall, not later than thirty days after adding such items for receipt by such facility, submit a written notification to the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection describing such addition.\n\n(e) The commissioner may hold a public hearing prior to approving or denying an application if in his discretion the public interest will be best served thereby, and shall hold a hearing upon receipt of a petition signed by at least twenty-five persons. The commissioner may amend a permit to construct or to operate, without hearing, for minor changes in the facility design, practices or equipment that would not in his judgment significantly change the nature of the facility or its impact on the environment. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the commissioner shall conduct a public hearing on an application for a permit to construct a new solid waste disposal area. Such public hearing shall be commenced in the municipality in which the facility is to be located or a location in close proximity to said municipality. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, if a hearing has been held on and after July 1, 1993, on an application for a permit to construct or alter a solid waste facility, the commissioner shall not hold a hearing on an application for a permit to operate such facility.\n\n(f) The qualifications of the operator or operators of any solid waste facility and any person other than a municipality owning such a facility shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner. The commissioner shall establish requirements for the presence of approved operators at solid waste facilities. The commissioner may develop, offer or sponsor training programs for operators of solid waste facilities and require participation therein.\n\n(g) Whenever the commissioner issues a permit to construct a solid waste facility, he shall cause a certified copy thereof to be filed on the land records in the town wherein the facility will be located.\n\n(h) On and after July 1, 1996, fees required pursuant to this section shall be as prescribed by regulations adopted by the commissioner in accordance with chapter 54. In adopting regulations pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall perform an evaluation of the actual costs necessary to process, review and render a decision on permit applications reflecting the time, resource commitments and expenses to the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. A similar review shall be performed for annual fees sufficient to represent the actual time to perform and review routine inspections, perform general monitoring of activities and perform appropriate follow-up on results of such activities. For both application fees and annual fees, the commissioner shall include a description of methods used to calculate the costs associated with similar categories of activities in order to demonstrate that the fees for activities within any category are equitable.\n\n(i) (1) The commissioner may issue a general permit for a category of activities which require a permit under this section, except for an activity which is already covered by an individual permit, provided the issuance of the permit is not inconsistent with the requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The commissioner's authority to issue a general permit for certain categories of solid waste facilities shall not include the authority to issue a general permit for resources recovery facilities, biomedical waste facilities, solid waste disposal areas or municipal solid waste composting facilities. Any person or municipality conducting an activity for which a general permit has been issued shall not be required to obtain an individual permit under this section, except as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection. The general permit may regulate a category of activities which (A) involve the same or substantially similar types of operations, (B) involve the transfer, storage, processing or disposal of the same types of substances, (C) require the same operating conditions or standards, and (D) require the same or similar monitoring, and which in the opinion of the commissioner are more appropriately controlled under a general permit than under an individual permit. The general permit may require any person or municipality proposing to conduct any activity under the general permit to register such activity with the commissioner before it is covered by the general permit. Registration shall be on a form prescribed by the commissioner.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding any provisions of this section, or any regulations adopted thereunder, or of chapter 54, the following procedures shall apply to the issuance, renewal, modification, revocation or suspension of a general permit. (A) A general permit shall be issued for a term specified by the permit and shall clearly define the activity covered thereby and may include such conditions and requirements as the commissioner deems appropriate, including but not limited to, operation and maintenance requirements, management practices, and reporting requirements; (B) the commissioner shall publish notice of intent to issue a general permit in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the affected area; (C) there shall be a comment period of thirty days following publication of such notice during which interested persons may submit written comments to the commissioner; and (D) the commissioner shall publish notice of the issuance or decision not to issue a general permit in a newspaper having substantial circulation in the affected area. The commissioner may revoke, suspend or modify a general permit in accordance with the notice and comment procedures for issuance of a general permit specified in this subsection. Any person may request that the commissioner issue, modify, suspend or revoke a general permit in accordance with this subsection.\n\n(3) Subsequent to the issuance of a general permit, the commissioner may require a person or municipality whose activity is or may be covered by the general permit to apply for and obtain an individual permit pursuant to subsections (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this section if he determines that an individual permit would better protect the land, air and waters of the state from pollution. The commissioner may require an individual permit under this subdivision in cases including, but not limited to the following: (A) When the owner or operator is not in compliance with the conditions of the general permit; (B) when a change has occurred in the availability of demonstrated technology or practices for the control or abatement of pollution applicable to the activity; (C) when circumstances have changed since the time of the issuance of the general permit so that the activity is no longer appropriately controlled under the general permit, or either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized activity is necessary; or (D) when a relevant change has occurred in the applicability of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. In making the determination to require an individual permit, the commissioner may consider the location, character and size of the activity, and any other relevant factors. The commissioner may require an individual permit under this subdivision only if the affected person or municipality covered by the general permit has been notified in writing that a permit application is required. This notice shall include a brief statement of the reasons for this decision, an application form, a statement setting a time for the person or municipality to file the application, and a statement that on the effective date of the individual permit the general permit as it applies to the individual permittee shall automatically terminate. The commissioner may grant an extension of time upon the request of the applicant. The applicant shall use his best efforts to obtain the individual permit. Any interested person or municipality may petition the commissioner to take action under this subdivision.\n\n(4) The commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to carry out the purposes of this subsection.\n\n(j) The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection may issue an approval for a demonstration project for any activity regulated by the commissioner under this chapter provided the commissioner determines that such demonstration project (1) is necessary to research, develop or promote methods and technologies of solid waste management which are consistent with the goals of the state-wide solid waste management plan; (2) does not pose a significant risk to human health or the environment; and (3) is not inconsistent with the federal Water Pollution Control Act, the federal Rivers and Harbors Act, the federal Clean Air Act or the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. An application for such approval shall be on a form prescribed by the commissioner, be accompanied by a fee of one thousand dollars and shall provide such information as the commissioner deems necessary. Any person applying for such approval shall not commence the project prior to the commissioner's written approval. The commissioner may impose conditions upon such approval as deemed necessary to adequately protect human health and the environment or to ensure project success and such approval shall be valid for a period of not more than two years. The commissioner may renew such approval provided the total period of approval does not exceed five years. The commissioner may order summary suspension of any such approval in accordance with subsection (c) of section 4-182. Notwithstanding the renewal process, any person may seek, or the commissioner may require, that the project obtain a general or individual permit pursuant to this chapter.\n\n(P.A. 85-334, S. 2, 8; 85-613, S. 147, 154; P.A. 86-403, S. 51, 132; P.A. 87-465, S. 2, 3; 87-531, S. 2, 6; 87-556, S. 1, 2; P.A. 89-386, S. 3, 24; P.A. 90-231, S. 8, 28; P.A. 91-251, S. 1, 3, 4; 91-369, S. 14, 15, 36; P.A. 92-162, S. 6, 25; May Sp.

No municipality shall be responsible for any hauling costs resulting from the residue from such recycling facility. The recycling facility shall be responsible to pay tipping fees for returned residue at the uniform rate annually established by the solid waste facility for the appropriate category of recycling residue. Such disposal may be in areas within its own boundaries or arrangements may be made for disposing of these wastes in any other municipality. The safe and sanitary disposal of toxic or hazardous wastes shall be the responsibility of the generator and shall be accomplished in a manner approved by the commissioner. In complying with this section, a municipal authority may, by action of its legislative body, provide for the levying of a charge for the disposal, processing or sale of solid wastes brought to a disposal facility or facilities or to a facility or facilities for the processing or sale of recyclable items designated pursuant to section 22a-241b, or pursuant to a municipal ordinance or other enforceable legal instrument, which facilities shall be provided by said municipal authority, by persons other than those in the employ of the municipality while in the course of such employment.\n\n(b) Each recycling facility shall maintain records necessary to make the determinations required under subsection (a) of this section. Such records shall include, but not be limited to, the amount of solid waste derived from each municipality and the amount of residue apportioned to each municipality.\n\n(c) Any municipality, or its agent, whose solid waste is processed at a recycling facility, or any solid waste facility which accepts residue from a recycling facility may, at any reasonable time, inspect the recycling facility, including any records concerning the amount of solid waste received and residue returned.\n\n(d) If any municipality, regional authority or regional solid waste facility fails to receive proper residue allocation, it may institute and maintain a civil action for injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to require proper residue allocation. The court shall have the power to grant such injunctive relief upon notice and hearing.\n\n(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to abrogate or in any way interfere with any agreement entered into by any municipal authority with another municipality prior to April 9, 1976.\n\n(f) (1) On and after January 1, 1991, each municipality shall, consistent with the requirements of section 22a-241b, make provisions for the separation, collection, processing and marketing of items generated within its boundaries as solid waste and designated for recycling by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (a) of section 22a-241b. It shall be the goal to recycle twenty-five per cent of the solid waste generated in each municipality provided it shall be the goal to reduce the weight of such waste by January 1, 2000, by an additional fifteen per cent by source reduction as determined by reference to the state-wide solid waste management plan established in 1991, or by recycling such additional percentage of waste generated, or both. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to require municipalities to enforce reduction in the quantity of solid waste. On or before January 1, 1991, each municipality shall: (A) Adopt an ordinance or other enforceable legal instrument setting forth measures to assure the compliance of persons within its boundaries with the requirements of subsection (c) of section 22a-241b and to assure compliance of collectors with the requirements of subsection (a) of section 22a-220c, and (B) provide the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection with the name, address and telephone number of a person to receive information and respond to questions regarding recycling from the department on behalf of the municipality. The municipality shall notify the commissioner within thirty days of its designation of a new representative to undertake such responsibilities. A municipality may by ordinance or other enforceable legal instrument provide for and require the separation and recycling of other items in addition to those designated pursuant to subsection (a) of section 22a-241b.\n\n(2) A municipality may, by the adoption of a municipal ordinance or other enforceable legal instrument to which the municipality is a party, identify recyclable solid wastes not described in subdivision (1) of this subsection, including, but not limited to, food scraps, food processing residues, yard waste and other suitable recyclable organic material for diversion to recycling facilities designed for the processing and beneficial use of such wastes. For the purposes of this section and section 22a-220a, “food scraps” or “food processing residues” does not include unused food that is suitable for sale or donation for human or animal consumption.\n\n(g) A municipality may contract with a municipal authority, another municipality, a regional entity, the MIRA Dissolution Authority, a nonprofit organization, a private contractor or any combination thereof for assistance in complying with the requirements of this section.\n\n(h) On or before September 30, 2010, and annually thereafter, each municipality, or its designated regional agent, shall provide a report to the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection describing the measures taken during the preceding year to meet its obligations under this section. The commissioner shall provide each municipality with a form for such report by July 1, 2010. Such form may be amended from time to time. Such report shall include, but not be limited to, (1) a description of the efforts made by the municipality to promote recycling, (2) a description of its efforts to ensure compliance with separation requirements, (3) an identification of the first destinations that received solid waste, including recyclable material generated in the municipality's borders, and (4) the actual or estimated amount of such disposed solid waste and recyclable material that has been delivered to a first destination that is out of state or a Connecticut end user. If such amounts of recyclable material or solid waste are unknown to the municipality, the municipality shall provide the commissioner with the contact information of the collector who transported such recyclable material or municipal solid waste. For the purposes of this subsection, “collector” has the same meaning as in section 22a-220a.\n\n(i) Each municipality shall designate a municipal or regional agent to receive from collectors of solid waste and recyclable items and from operators of resources recovery facilities and solid waste facilities the notices required to be sent to the municipality pursuant to section 22a-220c.\n\n(j) On and after January 1, 1991, the commissioner may issue an order, in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 22a-225, to enforce the requirements of this section and section 22a-241e. If the commissioner determines that a municipality is making insufficient progress in implementing a recycling program he may issue a notice of recycling program deficiency. Thirty days after issuance of said notice the commissioner shall meet with the chief executive officer of the municipality to discuss the deficiency, the municipality's explanations thereof and remedial steps. The municipality at such meeting may cite impediments to the accomplishment of recycling program goals including, but not limited to, the following: The availability of markets; the availability of local processing systems; the availability of regional processing centers; the desirability of alternate utilization techniques; impacts on public health or the environment associated with recycling; or severe economic impact. If the commissioner, after considering such impediments, determines deficiencies still exist which should be remedied, he shall give the municipality further notice and an opportunity to implement remedial steps within ninety days of the receipt of such notice. If after expiration of the ninety-day remedial period, the commissioner determines that the municipal recycling program remains deficient in meeting statutory requirements he may hold a hearing and issue an order. No such order which imposes a duty on the municipality to appropriate funds for the budget of such municipality so as to comply with the order shall be effective earlier than the first fiscal year beginning after five months following the date of issuance of such order.\n\n(1971, P.A. 845, S. 14; P.A. 76-34, S. 1–3; P.A. 79-57, S. 1, 2; 79-605, S. 1, 17; P.A. 82-327, S. 7; P.A. 90-220, S. 2, 11; 90-312, S. 9; P.A. 91-92; 91-293, S. 8, 9; P.A 93-423, S. 1; P.A. 96-163, S. 2; P.A. 10-87, S. 2; P.A. 11-80, S. 1; P.A. 14-94, S. 1, 71; P.A. 23-170, S. 3, 8.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 76-34 added provision authorizing municipality to levy charge for waste disposal by persons other than municipal employees in the course of their employment and added Subsec.

      "text": "(a) The legislative body of a municipality may designate the area where solid waste generated within its boundaries by residential, business, commercial or other establishments shall be disposed. The disposal of such solid waste at any other area is prohibited, except that a municipality may approve, in writing, disposal at another area, either within or outside the boundaries of such municipality, prior to disposal. A municipality may refuse to approve disposal at another area if such disposal would adversely affect its solid waste disposal program. The legislative body of a municipality may also designate where the following items generated within its boundaries from residential properties shall be taken for processing or sale: (1) Cardboard, (2) glass, food and beverage containers, (3) leaves, (4) metal food and beverage containers, (5) newspapers, (6) storage batteries, (7) waste oil, (8) plastic food and beverage containers, (9) food scraps, and (10) food processing residues. The processing or sale of such items at any other area shall be prohibited, except that a municipality may approve, in writing, processing or sale elsewhere, either within or outside the boundaries of such municipality, prior to processing or sale. A municipality may refuse to approve processing or sale elsewhere if such processing or sale would adversely affect its recycling program. For purposes of sections 22a-208e, 22a-208f, 22a-220, this section, sections 22a-220c, 22a-241b, 22a-241e, and subsection (c) of section 22a-241g, residential property means real estate containing one or more dwelling units but shall not include hospitals, motels or hotels.\n\n(b) The legislative body shall give not less than sixty days' notice of its intent to designate a disposal area for solid waste or to designate where the items generated from residential property listed in subsection (a) of this section shall be taken for processing or sale to all collectors hauling solid waste or such items of the municipality. At the conclusion of such period, the legislative body shall cause notice of such designation to appear in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality and shall conduct a public hearing thereon. Prior to designating where the items generated from residential property and listed in subsection (a) of this section shall be taken for sale or processing, the municipality shall consider the private recycling occurring within the municipality, the effects of its proposed designation on such recycling, and the policy set forth in subdivision (4) of section 22a-259.\n\n(c) Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, recyclable material, including but not limited to, glass, metal, paper, corrugated paper or plastic, may be removed or segregated at the source of generation or prior to disposal at the designated area and presegregated recyclable material may be transported directly to facilities which accept and process recyclable material.\n\n(d) (1) Any collector hauling solid waste generated by residential, business, commercial or other establishments, including, but not limited to, recyclables generated within the borders of a municipality, shall register annually in such municipality and disclose: (A) The name and address of the collector and the owner of such collection company; (B) the name of any other municipality in which such collector hauls such solid waste, including recyclables; (C) whether the hauling done by such collector is residential, commercial or other; (D) the types of waste hauled; (E) the anticipated location of any disposal facilities or end users receiving recyclable solid waste; and (F) any additional information that such municipality requires to ensure the health and safety of its residents.\n\n(2) On or before July 31, 2011, any such collector shall report to the municipality (A) the types of solid waste, including recyclables, as listed in subsection (c) of section 22a-208e generated within the borders of a municipality and collected by such collector, (B) the name, location and contact information for the first destination where such solid waste, including recyclables, was delivered by the collector during the previous fiscal year, and (C) the types and actual or estimated amounts of such solid waste, including recyclables, directly delivered to an out-of-state destination or to an end user or manufacturer in the state. Such reports shall be submitted to the municipality annually, on or before July thirty-first, and shall provide the information specified in this subdivision for the prior state fiscal year. Such reports shall be on a form prescribed by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection and shall include any other additional information the commissioner deems necessary.\n\n(e) The door of any private vehicle used to haul solid waste shall be clearly marked with the business name and address of the hauler.\n\n(f) Any collector who dumps more than one cubic foot in volume of solid waste at one time in an area not designated for such disposal by a municipality pursuant to the provisions of this section or who knowingly mixes other solid waste with items designated for recycling pursuant to section 22a-241b, or pursuant to municipal ordinance shall for a first violation be liable for a civil penalty of not more than two thousand five hundred dollars for each violation and not more than ten thousand dollars for a subsequent violation. Any municipality or the Attorney General, at the request of the commissioner, may bring an action under this section.

Any owner or lessor of a solid waste or refuse collection container may post signs on or near such container which indicate the penalties provided for in this section for unauthorized disposal of waste in such container. Any municipal police officer may issue a summons for the commission of an infraction for any violation of this subsection.\n\n(j) If a collector hauls solid waste generated in this state, including recyclables as listed in subsection (c) of section 22a-208e from an entity located in the state other than a facility that has obtained a permit or authorization pursuant to this chapter and delivers such solid waste or recyclables to a destination that is an entity other than a facility that has obtained a permit or authorization pursuant to this chapter, then on or before July 31, 2011, and annually thereafter, such collector shall submit a report regarding such solid waste, including recyclables, to the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection. Such report shall be on a form prescribed by the commissioner and shall provide such information regarding such solid waste as the commissioner deems necessary, including, but not limited to: (1) The types of solid waste, including recyclables, collected, (2) for municipal solid waste, the municipality of origin of such municipal solid waste including recyclables, (3) the amount by weight, volume or other method acceptable to the commissioner of such solid waste, including recyclables delivered to such destination, and (4) the name, address and contact information of the entity receiving such solid waste or recyclables.\n\n(k) If a collector hauls municipal solid waste generated in the state, including recyclables, and delivers such municipal solid waste, including recyclables, to a facility that has obtained a permit or authorization pursuant to this chapter, then, upon delivery, such collector shall identify to the receiving facility for each load of municipal solid waste or recyclables, as applicable: (1) The originating regional facility, (2) the originating municipality if such waste did not pass through a regional facility, or (3) the originating regional facility or state if such waste originated outside of the state. If such municipal solid waste load comes from more than one municipality, the collector shall estimate the amount of waste from each municipality.\n\n(P.A. 83-120; 83-587, S. 94, 96; P.A. 85-334, S. 5, 8; P.A. 87-531, S. 3; P.A. 88-230, S. 1, 12; P.A. 90-98, S. 1, 2; 90-220, S. 3, 11; 90-249, S. 1; P.A. 93-142, S. 4, 7, 8; P.A. 94-200, S. 3, 4; P.A. 95-220, S. 4–6; P.A. 10-87, S. 10–12; P.A. 11-80, S. 1; P.A. 13-285, S. 3; P.A. 23-170, S. 4.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 83-587 changed effective date of P.A. 83-120 from October 1, 1983, to July 1, 1983; P.A. 85-334 amended Subsec.

The commissioner may modify the amount of such registration fee, including by setting a maximum amount for such fee, as necessary, to reflect updated implementation costs. Any producer that sold, offered for sale or distributed less than ten thousand plastic beverage containers or, in the aggregate, less than two hundred pounds of plastic that is not post-consumer recycled plastic, shall not be required to pay the registration fee required by this subdivision.\n\n(3) Each producer shall submit a report to the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, on or before April 1, 2026, and annually thereafter, identifying the brand names of the plastic beverage containers represented in the report as well as the weight, in pounds, of post-consumer recycled plastic, the weight, in pounds, of plastic that is not post-consumer recycled plastic and the percentage of post-consumer recycled plastic in the total weight of all plastic beverage containers the producer sold, offered for sale or distributed for sale in this state in such prior calendar year.

Any such surcharge collected pursuant to this subdivision shall be payable to the municipality in which the arrest was made unless the arrest was made by a conservation officer, special conservation officer or patrolman appointed by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection under authority of section 26-5, in which case such surcharge shall be payable to the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.\n\n(3) When any such material or substances are thrown, blown, scattered or spilled from a vehicle, the operator thereof shall be deemed prima facie to have committed such offense.\n\n(c) No person shall dump, as defined in subdivision (12) of section 22a-248, any material upon any public property in the state or upon private property in this state not owned by such person except when (1) such property is designated by the state or any political subdivision thereof for dumping or such property is a licensed facility for such purpose, and (2) such person is authorized to use such property. It shall not be a defense under this subsection that the dumping occurred with the permission of the property owner. The commissioner or the municipality in which such dumping occurs may, upon complaint or on their own initiative, investigate any violation of this subsection.\n\n(d) No person shall dump, as defined in this subsection, any material upon any public property in the state or upon private property in this state not owned by such person except when (1) such property is designated by the state or any political subdivision thereof for dumping or such property is a licensed facility for such purpose, and (2) such person is authorized to use such property. The commissioner or the municipality in which such dumping occurs may, upon complaint or on their own initiative, investigate any violation of this subsection. It shall not be a defense under this subsection that the dumping occurred with the permission of the property owner. As used in this subsection “dump” means to discard automobiles or automobile parts, large appliances, tires, bulky waste, hazardous waste, as defined in section 22a-115, or any other similar material.\n\n(e) If the commissioner, after investigation, finds that there has been a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, he may issue an order pursuant to section 22a-225 to remove material dumped in violation of said subsection (c) or (d) to a solid waste facility approved by the commissioner.\n\n(f) (1) If the chief elected official of a municipality, after investigation, finds that there has been a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, he may send a notice to the owner of the property where such violation has occurred by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address of record for property tax purposes. Such notice shall include (A) a reference to the statute alleged to have been violated; (B) a short and plain statement of the matter asserted or charged; (C) a demand that such property owner remove any material dumped in violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section to a solid waste facility approved by the commissioner; and (D) a statement that such property owner has the right to a hearing to contest the chief elected official's finding and the date, time and place for the hearing. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not later than ten days after the notice is mailed. The hearing shall be completed within fifteen days after such hearing commences and a decision shall be rendered within ten days of the completion of such hearing.\n\n(2) The chief elected official or his designee shall hold a hearing upon the alleged violation unless such property owner fails to appear at the hearing. If such property owner fails to appear at the hearing or if, after the hearing, the chief elected official or his designee finds that material has been dumped on such owner's property in violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section and such property owner has not removed such material to a solid waste facility approved by the commissioner, the official may order that such property owner within thirty days remove such material to a solid waste facility approved by the commissioner. The official shall send a copy of any order issued pursuant to this subdivision by certified mail, return receipt requested, to such property owner. The person may appeal from an order of the chief elected official of a municipality under this subdivision in accordance with the provisions of section 8-8.\n\n(3) If the owner fails to remove such material within thirty days from the date of the order issued by the chief elected official under subdivision (2) of this subsection, and no appeal of such order has been taken in accordance with section 8-8, the municipality may enter such property and remove such material to a solid waste facility approved by the commissioner.\n\n(4) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any corporation subject to taxation under chapter 210.\n\n(g) No property owner shall be ordered to remove dumped material by the commissioner or the chief elected official of a municipality pursuant to subsection (e) or (f) of this section unless (1) the commissioner or the chief elected official, as the case may be, finds that the property owner has dumped such material, or knowingly allowed another person to dump such material, in violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section or (2) the commissioner or the chief elected official, as the case may be, has determined that there is no reasonable opportunity to compel the responsible party to remove the material or pay the costs of such removal.\n\n(h) Any person who violates subsection (c) or (d) of this section shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than one thousand dollars, nor more than ten thousand dollars for each day such violation continues. The Superior Court, in an action brought by the municipality or by the Attorney General on the request of the commissioner, shall have jurisdiction to issue an order to such person directing the removal of the material to a solid waste facility approved by the commissioner. If the court finds that the violation was wilful, it may impose a civil penalty equivalent to three times the cost of remediation of the violation in addition to other applicable civil penalties. The court may also order that a violator shall pay restitution to a landowner which the court finds has suffered damages as a result of the violation. All such actions shall have precedence in the order of trial as provided in section 52-191. Any such action by the Attorney General shall be brought in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford. Any vehicle used by any person in violation of subsection (d) may be forfeited in accordance with section 22a-250a.\n\n(P.A. 74-262, S. 4, 7; P.A. 78-319, S. 4, 15; P.A. 83-176, S. 2; P.A. 84-546, S. 73, 173; P.A. 85-446, S. 5; 85-613, S. 65, 154; P.A. 87-531, S. 4; P.A. 88-230, S. 1, 12; 88-320, S. 2; P.A. 90-98, S. 1, 2; P.A. 92-249, S. 3; P.A. 93-142, S. 4, 7, 8; P.A. 95-220, S. 4–6; P.A. 01-204, S. 14; June Sp.
