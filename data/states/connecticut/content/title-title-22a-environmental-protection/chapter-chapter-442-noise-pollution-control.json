To that end, the purpose of this chapter is to establish a means for effective coordination of research and activities in noise control, to authorize the establishment of state noise emission standards and the enforcement of such standards, and to provide information to the public respecting noise pollution.\n\n(P.A. 74-328, S. 1, 12.)\n\nLegislature has undertaken to preempt field of legislation re noise pollution control in Sec. 22a-67 et seq. and to require that local efforts aimed at noise pollution control comply with requirements it has enumerated by statute. 76 CA 199.",
