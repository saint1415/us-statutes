Therefore the General Assembly hereby declares that the policy of the state of Connecticut is to conserve, improve and protect its natural resources and environment and to control air, land and water pollution in order to enhance the health, safety and welfare of the people of the state. It shall further be the policy of the state to improve and coordinate the environmental plans, functions, powers and programs of the state, in cooperation with the federal government, regions, local governments, other public and private organizations and concerned individuals, and to manage the basic resources of air, land and water to the end that the state may fulfill its responsibility as trustee of the environment for the present and future generations.\n\n(1971, P.A. 872, S. 1.)\n\nCited. 184 C. 51; 204 C. 38; Id., 212; 212 C. 727; 227 C. 71; Id., 175; 235 C. 448.\n\nCited. 12 CA 47; 41 CA 120.\n\nState's alleged failure to conduct an environmental impact evaluation prior to transfer is not a per se violation of statute that would grant plaintiffs standing under Sec. 22a-16. 51 CS 590.",

for calculating the penalty or penalties to be imposed upon finding after hearing that a violation has occurred or upon a default; and\n\n(4) A statement of the party's right to a hearing.\n\n(d) The person to whom the notice is addressed shall have thirty days from the date of receipt of the notice in which to deliver to the commissioner written application for a hearing. If a hearing is requested then, after a hearing and upon a finding that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may issue a final order assessing a civil penalty under this section which is not greater than the penalty stated in the notice. The commissioner may amend a notice of assessment at any time before such notice becomes final, provided the person to whom the notice is addressed shall have thirty days from the date of receipt of such amendment in which to deliver to the commissioner a written application for a hearing on such amendment, and provided further the commissioner may amend a notice of assessment after a hearing has begun only with the permission of the hearing officer. If such a hearing is not so requested, or if such a request is later withdrawn, then the notice shall, on the first day after the expiration of such twenty-day period or on the first day after the withdrawal of such request for hearing, whichever is later, become a final order of the commissioner and the matters asserted or charged in the notice shall be deemed admitted unless modified by consent order, which shall be a final order.

Such final order shall not be subject to appeal under any other provision of the general statutes. No challenge to any notice of assessment or final order of the commissioner assessing a civil penalty shall be allowed as to any issue which could have been raised by an appeal of an earlier order, notice, permit, denial or other final decision by the commissioner. Any civil penalty authorized by this section shall become due and payable (1) at the time of receipt of a final order in the case of a civil penalty assessed in such order after a hearing, (2) on the first day after the expiration of the period in which a hearing may be requested if no hearing is requested, or (3) on the first day after any withdrawal of a request for hearing.\n\n(f) Any person acting within the terms and conditions of a final order or permit issued to him by the commissioner shall not be subject to a civil penalty, under this section, for such actions.\n\n(g) A civil penalty assessed in a final order of the commissioner under this section may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment of the Superior Court. Such final order shall be served in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested. Any notice of violation or final order against a private corporation shall be served upon at least one of the individuals enumerated in section 52-57. After entry, a transcript of such final order may be filed by the commissioner, without requiring the payment of costs as a condition precedent to such filing, in the office of the clerk of the superior court in any one or more of the following judicial districts: Any judicial district in which the respondent resides, any judicial district in which the respondent has a place of business, any judicial district in which the respondent owns real property and any judicial district in which any real property which is a subject of the proceedings is located; or, if the respondent is not a resident of the state of Connecticut, in the judicial district of Hartford.

All that is required to invoke jurisdiction of Superior Court under section is a colorable claim by “any person” against “any person” of conduct resulting in harm to one or more natural resources of this state and in this case, plaintiff has standing under section but has not alleged factual allegations sufficient to support plaintiff's claims against defendant because section does not expand jurisdiction of the town agency to consider environmental matters not otherwise within its jurisdiction; plaintiff's claim against city based on a statutory duty is within scope of statute; plaintiff also has standing against permit applicant on grounds that its proposed demolition activities will result in unreasonable harm to state's natural resources. 262 C. 480.

Section imposed a standard of care on defendants, the violation of which constituted negligence per se, because plaintiff, who alleged damage to his pond caused by erosion, turbidity and siltation from nonfunctioning erosion and sediment control measures, was within the class of persons protected by section and the alleged injury is of the type section intended to prevent. 122 CA 555. Plaintiff could not prevail on claim that trial court improperly relied on Sec. 26-92 governing wild birds as the standard for determining whether defendant's conduct was an unreasonable impairment because Sec. 26-92 addresses the parakeets by name, identifies when they are exempt from protections, governs the conduct in question and provides the standard by which the court is to judge the evidence. 124 CA 823. Although plaintiff does not facially challenge the validity of permit to run cooling system for nuclear power plant on environmental grounds, that is the essence of her claim, and the court properly concluded that plaintiff did not have standing to pursue her claim under the act. 129 CA 203. The mere allegation that defendant has failed to comply with a certain technical or procedural requirement of a statute imposing environmental standards does not, in and of itself, give rise to a colorable claim of unreasonable pollution under section. 140 CA 155.\n\nCommissioner does not have right to act directly under statute to seek declaratory or equitable relief; he is limited under Inland Wetlands and Water Courses Act to promulgating regulations and appealing decisions of municipal commissions. 35 CS 145. Section is example of a legislative enactment of what has been described as expanding doctrine of “private attorney generals”, who are empowered to institute proceedings to vindicate the public interest; by utilizing this procedure, legislature expanded the number of potential guardians of the public interest in the environment into the millions, instead of relying exclusively on limited resources of a particular agency. 48 CS 594. Plaintiff cannot claim standing under section on the basis that there are now and will be mandatory plans for the development of the property when the complaint sets forth no allegations of proposed or adopted plans for such future development. 51 CS 590.",

(b) to (d) do not apply to proceedings with interventions and do not apply to or enlarge the powers of a trial court hearing an action in which intervenor has raised environmental claims pursuant to Sec. 22a-19, but rather only apply to independent actions brought under Sec. 22a-16. 318 C. 431.\n\nCited. 30 CA 204; 41 CA 89; Id., 120.\n\nCited. 35 CS 145.\n\nSubsec.

For purposes of this section, “reviewing authority” means the board, commission or other decision-making authority in any administrative, licensing or other proceeding or the court in any judicial review.\n\n(b) In any administrative, licensing or other proceeding, the agency shall consider the alleged unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction of the public trust in the air, water or other natural resources of the state and no conduct shall be authorized or approved which does, or is reasonably likely to, have such effect as long as, considering all relevant surrounding circumstances and factors, there is a feasible and prudent alternative consistent with the reasonable requirements of the public health, safety and welfare.\n\n(1971, P.A. 96, S. 6; P.A. 06-196, S. 256; P.A. 13-186, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 06-196 made a technical change in Subsec.

Legislature intended that, under Sec. 8-30g(c), planning and zoning commission bears burden of proving that public interest cannot be protected by reasonable changes to applicant's proposed development and such burden is not inconsistent with section. 256 C. 674. Section, as well as other provisions of Environmental Protection Act, reveals no language that suggests legislature intended to give environmental intervenors under section the right to appeal from administrative matters not otherwise appealable; section does not create an independent right of appeal, but only allows intervention in an appeal otherwise allowed by statute. 266 C. 338. Section's plain and unambiguous language provides town with right to intervene for environmental protection purposes in the judicial review of decisions of its wetlands agency and zoning commission and does not conflict with Secs. 8-1 and 22a-42, which delegate municipal authority to such agencies. 280 C. 405. Intervenors before inland wetlands commission were entitled to appeal to trial court from commission's decision pursuant to Sec. 22a-43; an intervenor can prevail on appeal not only by proving that proposed development likely would cause harm to wetlands, but also by proving an inland wetlands commission's decision was not based on a determination, supported by substantial evidence, that the development complied with governing statutes and regulations and would not cause such harm. 289 C. 12.\n\nCited. 12 CA 47; 13 CA 400; 17 CA 320; 23 CA 188; 26 CA 599; Id., 942; 27 CA 479; 30 CA 204; 32 CA 340; 35 CA 646; judgment reversed, see 235 C. 448; 41 CA 89; Id., 120. Statute does not permit a nonparty to appeal if no party from the underlying proceeding is engaged in an appeal. 57 CA 589. Environmental intervenor abdicated right to approve settlement between plaintiff and defendant by failing to attend hearing and present evidence. 127 CA 634. Plaintiff forfeited right to consent to settlement agreement by failing to raise environmental issues as an intervenor at remand hearing. 133 CA 173. Public hearing on environmental impact evaluation in which the plaintiff sought to intervene was not a “proceeding” under section and department had discretion to reject plaintiff's petition; further, if department had wrongfully denied plaintiff's petition, such action would not constitute a violation of plaintiff's constitutional rights because section does not create a constitutional right of intervention. 203 CA 419.\n\nCited. 35 CS 145; 41 CS 184; 42 CS 57.

Trial court decision striking verified pleading filed by town council as proposed intervenor in matters where zoning commission and inland wetlands and watercourse agency were named defendants reversed; court declines to find exception to citizen intervention provision of Environmental Protection Act, finding no legislative intent that would support a rule barring municipalities from utilizing provisions of Subsec. to intervene in appeals from decisions of their land use agencies. 87 CA 537. Without accurate notice of date the motion to open and modify the stipulated judgment was to be heard, intervenors were deprived of right to file motions to intervene in a pending action; public nature of hearing was not adequate for purposes of section if any person or other legal entity did not have notice that modified judgment was being presented for judicial review. 177 CA 779; judgment affirmed, see 331 C. 701.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\nTrial court properly held that dispositive issue before planning and zoning commission was whether the proposal would cause unreasonable impairment of natural resources so as to require commission to consider alternatives; once commission made no finding of unreasonable impairment of natural resources, it no longer had an obligation to consider alternative plans. 73 CA 647.

Such plan shall identify a time and place where an informal public meeting will be held that is convenient for the residents of the affected environmental justice community. In addition, any such plan shall identify the methods, if any, by which the applicant will publicize the date, time and nature of the informal public meeting in addition to the notice by mail required by subdivision (3) of this subsection and the publication required by subdivision (4) of this subsection. Such methods shall include, but not be limited to, (A) posting a reasonably visible sign on the proposed or existing affecting facility property, printed in English, in accordance with any local regulations and ordinances, (B) posting a reasonably visible sign, printed in all languages spoken by at least fifteen per cent of the population that reside within a one-half of a mile radius of the proposed or existing affecting facility, in accordance with local regulations and ordinances, (C) notifying local and state elected officials, in writing, and (D) posting on electronic media, including, but not limited to, relevant Internet web sites and social media platforms, provided such notice is readily found by searching for the name of the affecting facility on the Internet.

The application of an applicant who fails to receive approval of any required public participation report by the department or council, as applicable, shall be deemed insufficient.\n\n(7) In the event that the Connecticut Siting Council has approved a meaningful public participation plan or public participation report, as applicable, concerning a new or expanded proposed affecting facility, as applicable, and an informal public meeting has been held in accordance with this subsection, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection may waive the requirement that an additional informal public meeting be held in accordance with this subsection.\n\n(8) In addition to any other fee authorized by law, rule or regulation, the department or council, as applicable, may assess each permit, license or certificate applicant a reasonable fee in order to cover the costs associated with the implementation of this section, including all costs to provide technical assistance to permit applicants and environmental justice communities to comply with the provisions of this section.\n\n(c) Any municipality, owner or developer may enter into a community environmental benefit agreement in connection with an affecting facility. For any application filed on or after November 1, 2020, for such an affecting facility that: (1) Requires a certificate under chapter 277a, or (2) constitutes a new or expanded permit, except for a minor modification or improvement of an existing permit for such facility, or siting approval from the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection or the Connecticut Siting Council involving an affecting facility, and that is proposed to be located in an environmental justice community or the proposed expansion of an affecting facility to be located in such a community, the applicant shall enter into such an agreement with the municipality if there are five or more affecting facilities in such municipality at the time such application is filed. The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall not issue a notice of tentative determination regarding a new or modified permit unless the applicant has submitted a copy of the executed agreement with the municipality. Mitigation may include both on-site and off-site improvements, activities and programs, including, but not limited to: Funding for activities such as environmental education, diesel pollution reduction, electric vehicle charging infrastructure construction, establishment of a wellness clinic, ongoing asthma screening, provision of air monitoring performed by a credentialed environmental professional, performance of an ongoing traffic study, watercourse monitoring, construction of biking facilities and multi-use trails, staffing for parks, urban forestry, support for community gardens or any other negotiated benefit to the environment in the environmental justice community. Prior to negotiating the terms of a community environmental benefit agreement, the municipality shall provide a reasonable and public opportunity for residents of the potentially affected environmental justice community to be heard concerning the requirements of or need for, and terms of, such agreement. Any mitigation contained in such an agreement shall have a nexus to the impacts caused by the proposed facility and shall be proportional to such impacts.\n\n(d) The chief elected official or town manager of a municipality shall participate in the negotiations for any such community environmental benefit agreement and shall implement, administer and enforce such an agreement on behalf of the municipality, provided any such agreement negotiated pursuant to this section on and after November 1, 2020, shall be approved by the legislative body of the municipality prior to implementation, administration and enforcement of such agreement. Such chief elected official or town manager shall select a resident of the potentially affected environmental justice community to participate in such negotiations.\n\n(e) The terms of any community environmental benefit agreement negotiated, entered into and approved in accordance with this section on and after November 1, 2020, shall not constitute a separate and distinct basis for a pleading to intervene in any administrative, licensing or other proceeding pursuant to section 22a-19.\n\n(f) The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, as are necessary and proper to carry out the purposes of this section.
