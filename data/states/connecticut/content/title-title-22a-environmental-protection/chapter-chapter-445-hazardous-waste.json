      "text": "The General Assembly finds that improper management of hazardous wastes has contaminated the water, soil and air of the state thereby threatening the health and safety of Connecticut citizens; that the economic benefits to the state from industry are jeopardized if hazardous waste disposal facilities are not available in Connecticut; that the safe management of hazardous wastes, including state involvement, is mandated by the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (42 USC 6901 et seq.) and implementing regulations; that the siting of hazardous waste disposal facilities is in the best interest of Connecticut's citizens and that the public should participate in siting decisions. Therefore the General Assembly declares that it is the policy of the state to initiate final remedial action by the year 2000 at each hazardous waste disposal site listed on July 3, 1989, on the inventory maintained by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection pursuant to section 22a-133c and to assure the siting of hazardous waste disposal facilities so that the health and safety of Connecticut's citizens and the environmental and economic interests of the state are protected. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a process for the siting of hazardous waste facilities that will protect the health and safety of Connecticut citizens and assure responsible economic development and to have that siting process be at least as strict as that required by federal law.\n\n(P.A. 81-369, S. 1, 20; P.A. 89-365, S. 1, 9; P.A. 11-80, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 89-365 required initiation of final remedial action by the year 2000 at sites listed on inventory as of July 3, 1989; pursuant to P.A. 11-80, “Commissioner of Environmental Protection” was changed editorially by the Revisors to “Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection”, effective July 1, 2011.\n\nCited. 207 C. 706; 215 C. 292.",

The council shall file, with its decision, an opinion stating in full the reasons for its decision.\n\n(b) In making its decision, the council shall consider: (1) The impact of the proposed facility on the municipality and affected geographic area in which it is to be located in terms of public health, safety and welfare including but not limited to (A) the risk and impact of accident during transportation of hazardous waste, (B) the risk and impact of fires or explosions from improper storage or disposal methods, (C) consistency of the proposed facility with local and regional land use plans and regulations and the state conservation and development plan in effect at the time the applicant applies to the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection for the environmental licenses, permits, or approvals necessary to construct and operate the facility, and with existing and proposed development in the area, (D) the protection of the public from adverse impacts including but not limited to adverse economic impacts of the facility during its construction and operation and after its operation life, (E) the risk and impact on public and private drinking water supplies; (2) the population density in the area of the proposed facility and its proximity to residential areas; (3) data available under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 concerning permitted and illegal discharges in the geographical area affected by the proposed facility; (4) the proximity of the proposed facility to schools; (5) the availability of other sites; and (6) other criteria consistent with the goal of insuring the maximum safety of the public from potential dangers associated with the siting and the development and management of construction of hazardous waste facilities which may be established by regulation adopted by the permanent members of the council in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of section 22a-116. The permanent members of the council shall adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of said chapter establishing minimum distances between the active parts of the facility and other land uses.\n\n(c) The council shall not grant a certificate unless it finds and determines: (1) A public need and the basis of such need for the facility; (2) the nature of the probable health and environmental impact of the facility including but not limited to those listed in subsection (b) of this section and consideration of the number of persons affected; (3) in the case of a proposed land disposal facility, an explanation of why no other disposal method is more appropriate; (4) every significant single and cumulative adverse effect on and conflict with state policies on (A) the natural environment, (B) the ecological balance, (C) the public health and safety, (D) scenic, historic and recreational values, (E) forests and parks, (F) air and water purity, including impact on present and future sources of water supply; and (5) why such adverse effects or conflicts set forth in subdivision (4) of this subsection are not sufficient for denial of the certificate. Any applicant who withdraws an application submitted under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, this chapter or the regulations adopted pursuant to subsection (c) of section 22a-449 may not reapply for a certificate for two years from the date of such withdrawal or denial.\n\n(d) The council shall not grant a certificate unless the following financial responsibility requirements are met: (1) For the period of facility operation, the applicant shall maintain third party liability insurance for sudden and nonsudden occurrences in an amount fixed by the council in accordance with the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, except that the council may require such insurance in an amount more than that required by said act. Insurance shall be provided by a carrier licensed by the Insurance Commissioner and who evidences at all times the financial resources necessary for licensure. The council may accept other forms of security allowed by the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act which the council deems equivalent to third party insurance if such insurance is not reasonably available. Certification of insurance is to be filed annually by the applicant with the council; (2) for the period of closure, the applicant shall provide, prior to operation, a surety bond or other security acceptable to the council in an amount fixed by the council sufficient to pay for the costs of closure. The amount and form of security shall be fixed by the council in accordance with the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. A trust fund shall be established, in accordance with said act, to be financed by yearly payments by the hazardous waste facility operator. The amount paid into the fund shall be fixed by the council so that at the time of closure the fund shall be sufficient to pay the costs of closure. The surety bond or other security may be reduced each year by the amount paid into the trust fund. Deposits into the trust fund shall be made to the State Treasurer and disbursements from the fund shall be made upon authorization of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection; (3) for the period of postclosure, a trust fund shall be established in accordance with the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to pay the costs of monitoring and maintenance during the postclosure period.

Deposits into the fund shall be made to the State Treasurer and disbursements from the fund shall be made upon authorization of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. In the case of a proposed land disposal facility, the applicant shall further provide for a fund or other security for liability for damage during the postclosure period. Deposits into such fund shall be made to the State Treasurer and disbursements from the fund shall be made upon authorization of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. The amount of the fund or other security and the manner of financing such fund shall be determined by the council based on the type of facility, the location of the facility and the kind of waste processed by such facility so that at the beginning of the postclosure period the fund or security shall be sufficient to cover the anticipated liability for damages. In the case of a proposed nonland disposal facility, the council may require a trust fund or other security for postclosure liability for damages. In determining the amount to be paid into such fund, the council shall consider the provisions of the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-510). To the extent that liability incurred during the postclosure period is to be paid from funds established in accordance with said act, the applicant shall not be required to maintain such fund or other security; (4) the applicant pays the costs, if any, incurred by the state for preparation of an off-site emergency plan for a worst case accident.\n\n(e) A copy of the opinion, decision and order shall be served upon each party and a notice of the issuance of the opinion and order shall be published in such newspapers as will serve substantially to inform the public of the issuance of such.

Such acquisition may include, but not be limited to, condemnation of the property in accordance with the provisions of part I of chapter 835. For purposes of this subsection, the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development shall be exempt from all of the requirements of sections 22a-134 to 22a-134e, inclusive, section 4b-3, and section 4b-21.

Such environmental use restriction may be in the form of an environmental land use restriction, as described in subsection (b) of this section, or a notice of activity and use limitation, as described in subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(b) (1) No owner of land may record an environmental land use restriction on the land records of the municipality in which such land is located unless he simultaneously records documents which demonstrate that each person holding an interest in such land or any part thereof, including without limitation each mortgagee, lessee, lienor and encumbrancer, irrevocably subordinates such interest to the environmental land use restriction, provided the commissioner may waive such requirement if he finds that the interest in such land is so minor as to be unaffected by the environmental land use restriction. The commissioner shall waive the requirement to obtain subordination agreements for any interest in land that, when acted upon, is not capable of creating a condition contrary to any purpose of such environmental land use restriction. An environmental land use restriction shall run with land, shall bind the owner of the land and his successors and assigns, and shall be enforceable notwithstanding lack of privity of estate or contract or benefit to particular land.\n\n(2) Within seven days after executing an environmental land use restriction and receiving thereon the signature of the commissioner or licensed environmental professional, as the case may be, the owner of the land involved therein shall record such restriction and documents required under subdivision (1) of this subsection on the land records of the municipality in which such land is located and shall submit to the commissioner a certificate of title certifying that each interest in such land or any part thereof is irrevocably subordinated to the environmental land use restriction in accordance with subdivision (1) of this subsection.\n\n(3) An owner of land with respect to which an environmental land use restriction applies may be released, wholly or in part, permanently or temporarily, from the limitations of such restriction only with the commissioner's written approval which shall be consistent with the regulations adopted pursuant to section 22a-133q and shall be recorded on the land records of the municipality in which such land is located. The commissioner may waive the requirement to record such release if he finds that the activity which is the subject of such release does not affect the overall purpose for which the environmental land use restriction was implemented, or for a temporary release, the activity is sufficiently limited in scope and duration, and does not alter the size of the area subject to the environmental land use restriction. The commissioner shall not approve any such permanent release unless the owner demonstrates that he has remediated the land, or such portion thereof as would be affected by the release, in accordance with the standards established pursuant to section 22a-133k.\n\n(4) An environmental land use restriction shall survive foreclosure of a mortgage, lien or other encumbrance.\n\n(c) (1) A notice of activity and use limitation may be used and recorded for releases remediated in accordance with the regulations adopted pursuant to sections 22a-133k and 22a-133q for the following purposes:\n\n(A) To achieve compliance with industrial/commercial direct exposure criteria, groundwater volatilization criteria, and soil vapor criteria, as established in regulations adopted pursuant to section 22a-133k, by preventing residential activity and use of the area to be affected through the notice of activity and use limitation, provided such property is zoned for industrial or commercial use, is not used for any residential use, and no holder of an interest in such property, other than such owner, has a right of residential use, as defined in regulations adopted pursuant to section 22a-133k;\n\n(B) To prevent disturbance of polluted soil that exceeds the applicable direct exposure criteria but that is inaccessible soil, in compliance with the provisions of the regulations adopted pursuant to section 22a-133k, provided pollutant concentrations in such inaccessible soil do not exceed ten times the applicable direct exposure criteria;\n\n(C) To prevent disturbance of an engineered control to the extent such engineered control is for the sole remedial purpose of eliminating exposure to polluted soil that exceeds the direct exposure criteria, provided pollutant concentrations in such soil do not exceed ten times the applicable direct exposure criteria;\n\n(D) To prevent demolition of a building or permanent structure that renders polluted soil environmentally isolated, provided: (i) The pollutant concentrations in the environmentally isolated soil do not exceed ten times the applicable direct exposure criteria and the applicable pollutant mobility criteria, or (ii) the total volume of soil that is environmentally isolated that exceeds ten times the applicable direct exposure criteria and the applicable pollutant mobility criteria is less than or equal to ten cubic yards; or\n\n(E) Any other purpose the commissioner may prescribe by regulations adopted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54.\n\n(2) No owner shall record a notice of activity and use limitation on the land records of the municipality in which such land is located unless such owner, not later than sixty days prior to such recordation, provides written notice to each person who holds an interest in such land or any part thereof, including each mortgagee, lessee, lienor and encumbrancer. Such written notice of the proposed notice of activity and use limitation shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall include notice of the existence and location of pollution within such area and the terms of such proposed activity and use limitation. Any such person who holds an interest may waive such sixty-day-notice period in relation to such interest provided such waiver is in writing.\n\n(3) A notice of activity and use limitation recorded pursuant to this subsection shall be implemented and adhered to by the owner and subsequent holders of interests in the property, such owner's successors and assigns, any person who has a license to use such property or to conduct remediation on any portion of such property and, as described in subdivision (6) of this section, any prior holder of an interest in the property who signs such notice of activity and use limitation.\n\n(4) Any notice of activity and use limitation shall be effective when recorded on the land records of the municipality in which such property is located.\n\n(5) (A) Any notice of activity and use limitation document, as described in this subsection, shall be prepared on a form prescribed by the commissioner.\n\n(B) A notice of activity and use limitation decision document, signed by the commissioner or signed and sealed by a licensed environmental professional, shall be referenced in and recorded with any such notice of activity and use limitation, and shall specify:\n\n(i) Why the notice of activity and use limitation is appropriate for achieving and maintaining compliance with the regulations adopted pursuant to section 22a-133k;\n\n(ii) Any activities and uses that are inconsistent with maintaining compliance with such regulations;\n\n(iii) Any activities and uses to be permitted;\n\n(iv) Any obligations and conditions necessary to meet the objectives of the notice of activity and use limitation; and\n\n(v) The nature and extent of pollution in the area that is the basis for the notice of activity and use limitation, including a listing of contaminants and concentrations for such contaminants, and the horizontal and vertical extent of such contaminants.\n\n(6) A notice of activity and use limitation shall not be used in any area where a prior holder of interest in the property has an interest that allows for the conduct of an activity that interferes with the conditions or purposes described in subparagraphs (A) to (E), inclusive, of subdivision (1) of this subsection, except a notice of activity and use limitation may be used in an area where one or more prior holders of an interest in the property have an interest that allows for the conduct of an activity that interferes with the conditions or purposes of such notice if such prior holder of an interest in the property agrees, by signing such notice, to subject such interest to the conditions or purposes described in such notice.\n\n(7) Upon transfer of any interest in or a right to use property, or a portion of property that is subject to a notice of activity and use limitation, the owner of such land, any lessee of such land and any person who has the right to subdivide or sublease such property, shall incorporate such notice in full or by reference into all future deeds, easements, mortgages, leases, licenses, occupancy agreements and any other instrument of transfer provided the failure to incorporate such notice shall not affect the enforceability of any such notice of activity and use limitation.\n\n(8) If a notice of activity and use limitation is extinguished by foreclosure of a mortgage, lien or other encumbrance, the owner of the subject land shall promptly, but not later than one year from the date of such foreclosure, or other schedule if approved in writing by the commissioner, remediate the pollution that was the subject of the notice of activity and use limitation consistent with standards adopted under section 22a-133k. In the event a notice of activity and use limitation is extinguished by such foreclosure, if notice to the commissioner is not otherwise provided as part of the foreclosure proceedings the owner shall, not later than thirty days from the date of such foreclosure, provide written notice to the commissioner by certified mail, return receipt requested, of such foreclosure, the name of the owner, the address of the land, and the identification of the notice of activity and use limitation.\n\n(9) Any owner of a parcel of property that is subject to a notice of activity and use limitation may remediate the pollution on such parcel in accordance with the regulations adopted pursuant to sections 22a-133k and 22a-133q. Such owner, upon completion of such remediation, may terminate the notice of activity and use limitation in accordance with regulations adopted pursuant to section 22a-133q.\n\n(P.A. 94-198, S. 5, 13; P.A. 95-169, S. 2; 95-190, S. 12, 17; P.A. 96-113, S. 9, 17; P.A. 97-218, S. 2; P.A. 11-141, S. 12; P.A. 13-308, S. 33; P.A. 18-85, S. 3, 4.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 94-198 effective June 7, 1994; P.A. 95-169 amended Subsecs.

      "text": "(a) On and after January 1, 1996, any licensed environmental professional licensed by the State Board of Examiners of Environmental Professionals pursuant to section 22a-133v may, pursuant to a voluntary site remediation conducted in accordance with this section, conduct a Phase II environmental site assessment or a Phase III investigation, prepare a Phase III remedial action plan, supervise remediation or submit a final remedial action report to the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection in accordance with the standards provided for remediation in the regulations adopted by the commissioner under section 22a-133k for any real property which has been subject to a spill and which meets the following criteria: (1) Such property is located in an area classified as GB or GC under the standards adopted by the commissioner for classification of groundwater contamination; and (2) such property is not the subject of any order issued by the commissioner regarding such spill, consent order or stipulated judgment regarding such spill. Any such professional employed by a municipality may enter, without liability, upon any property within such municipality for the purpose of performing an environmental site assessment or investigation if the owner of such property is unknown or such property is encumbered by a lien for taxes due to such municipality. Nothing in this subsection shall affect the ability of any person, firm or corporation to provide any of the services enumerated in this subsection in connection with the remediation of contaminated real property other than as provided for a voluntary site remediation conducted pursuant to this section.\n\n(b) Following any Phase II environmental site assessment or a Phase III investigation for any such property, any Phase III remedial action plan prepared for purposes of a voluntary site remediation under this section shall be prepared by a licensed environmental professional in accordance with the standards for such property adopted by the commissioner under section 22a-133k. Prior to commencement of remedial action taken pursuant to such plan, the owner of the property shall submit such plan to the commissioner and shall: (1) Publish notice of the remedial action in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the town where the property is located; (2) notify the director of health of the municipality where the parcel is located; and (3) either (A) erect and maintain for at least thirty days in a legible condition a sign not less than six feet by four feet on the property, which sign shall be clearly visible from the public highway, and shall include the words “ENVIRONMENTAL CLEAN-UP IN PROGRESS AT THIS SITE. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:” and include a telephone number for an office from which any interested person may obtain additional information about the remedial action; or (B) mail notice of the remedial action to each owner of record of property which abuts such property, at the address on the last-completed grand list of the relevant town. The commissioner may review such plan and may advise such owner as to the adequacy of such plan. The remedial action shall be conducted under the supervision of a licensed environmental professional. The commissioner shall expedite the process for issuing any permits required under this title for such action. The final remedial action report shall be submitted by a licensed environmental professional. In preparing such report, the licensed environmental professional shall render an opinion, in accordance with the standard of care provided for in subsection (c) of section 22a-133w, that the action taken to contain, remove or mitigate the spill is in accordance with the remediation standards for such property adopted by the commissioner under section 22a-133k. The owner of the property shall maintain all records relating to such remedial action for a period of not less than ten years and shall make such records available to the commissioner at any time upon his request.\n\n(c) Any final remedial action report submitted to the commissioner for such a property by a licensed environmental professional shall be deemed approved unless, within sixty days of such submittal, the commissioner determines, in his sole discretion, that an audit of such remedial action is necessary to assess whether remedial action beyond that which is indicated in such report is necessary for the protection of human health or the environment. Such an audit shall be conducted within six months of such determination. After completing such audit, the commissioner may disapprove the report provided he shall give his reasons therefor in writing and further provided such owner may appeal such disapproval to the superior court in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183. Prior to approving a final remedial action report, the commissioner may enter into a memorandum of understanding with the owner of such property with regard to any further remedial action or monitoring activities on or at such property which the commissioner deems necessary for the protection of human health or the environment.\n\n(d) Upon the approval of such report, the owner of the property shall execute and record an environmental use restriction in accordance with the provisions of section 22a-133o, unless a licensed environmental professional presents evidence, satisfactory to the commissioner, that the remediation has achieved a standard sufficient to render such a restriction unnecessary and the commissioner issues a written finding that such restriction is not necessary. Approval of a final remedial action report pursuant to this section shall be sufficient to support the filing of a Form II, as defined in section 22a-134.\n\n(e) Nothing in this section shall relieve any person of any obligation to comply with sections 22a-134 to 22a-134e, inclusive.\n\n(P.A. 95-190, S. 2, 17; P.A. 96-113, S. 8, 17; P.A. 97-124, S. 14, 16; P.A. 99-225, S. 3; P.A. 11-80, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 95-190, S. 2 effective June 29, 1995; P.A. 96-113 added Subsec.

No such covenant may be entered into unless such purchaser or owner has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the commissioner that such purchaser or owner (A) did not establish or create a facility or condition at or on such property which reasonably can be expected to create a source of pollution to the waters of the state for purposes of section 22a-432 and has not maintained any such facility or condition at such property for purposes of said section, and such purchaser is not responsible pursuant to any other provision of the general statutes for any pollution or source of pollution on the property; (B) is not affiliated with any person responsible for such pollution or source of pollution through any direct or indirect familial relationship or any contractual, corporate or financial relationship other than that by which such purchaser's interest in such property is to be conveyed or financed; and (C) will redevelop the property for productive use or continue productive use of such property provided the commissioner determines that the covenant not to sue is in the public interest. Upon the request of a successor of an original holder of a covenant issued under this section, the commissioner shall enter into such covenant with such successor if such successor certifies to the satisfaction of the commissioner that such successor complies with subparagraphs (A), (B) and (C) of this subsection. The commissioner may enter into a covenant not to sue with any lending institution to whom a prospective purchaser of contaminated real property conveys a security interest in such property provided such institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the commissioner that such institution did not establish or create a facility or condition at or on such property which reasonably can be expected to create a source of pollution to the waters of the state for purposes of section 22a-432 and has not maintained any such facility or condition at such property for purposes of said section, and such institution is not responsible pursuant to any other provision of the general statutes for any pollution or source of pollution on the property. Any covenant issued to a lending institution under this section shall be effective with respect to any lending institution which is a successor in interest to the original lending institution provided such successor lending institution did not establish or create a facility or condition at or on such property which reasonably can be expected to create a source of pollution to the waters of the state for purposes of section 22a-432 and has not maintained any such facility or condition at such property for purposes of said section, and such institution is not responsible pursuant to any other provision of the general statutes for any pollution or source of pollution on the property.\n\n(b) Any covenant entered into under this section shall release only those claims said commissioner may have which are related to pollution or contamination on or emanating from the property, which contamination resulted from a discharge, spillage, uncontrolled loss, seepage or filtration on such property prior to the effective date of the covenant. Such covenant shall provide that the commissioner will not take any action against the holder of the covenant to require remediation of the parcel or any other action against such holder related to such discharge, spillage, uncontrolled loss, seepage or filtration unless (1) prior to the commissioner's approval of a detailed written plan for remediation pursuant to a brownfields investigation plan and remediation schedule, the commissioner finds that there is substantial noncompliance with such investigation plan and remediation schedule and there has not been a good faith effort to substantially comply therewith, (2) such property is not remediated in accordance with the detailed written plan approved by the commissioner and incorporated by reference in such covenant, (3) prior to completion of remediation in accordance with such plan, the commissioner finds that there is substantial noncompliance with any such plan and there has not been a good faith effort to substantially comply therewith, (4) remediation of the parcel in accordance with any detailed written plan for remediation did not comply with standards adopted by the commissioner pursuant to section 22a-133k which were in effect as of the effective date of either the covenant or the commissioner's approval of the detailed written plan for remediation, whichever is later, (5) if required by the standards adopted by the commissioner pursuant to section 22a-133k, an environmental use restriction has not been recorded in accordance with section 22a-133o or there has been a failure to comply with the provisions of such a restriction, (6) for a property subject to the brownfield plan and remediation schedule, the commissioner does not approve a detailed written plan for remediation, or (7) the prospective buyer or owner fails to pay the fee, including the failure to pay in accordance with any payment schedule pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(c) (1) Any prospective purchaser or owner receiving a covenant not to sue pursuant to this section shall pay to the commissioner a fee equal to three per cent of the value of the property for which the covenant was issued provided such property is appraised as if it were uncontaminated. Such fee shall be deposited into the Special Contaminated Property Remediation and Insurance Fund established under section 22a-133t. No such fee shall be required for a covenant issued to a successor in interest to the original covenant, for a covenant issued in connection with a remediation project conducted under section 22a-133m, or for a municipality or municipal economic development agency or a nonprofit economic development corporation formed to promote the common good, general welfare and economic development of a municipality that is funded, either directly or through in-kind services, in part by a municipality and such corporation's officers and directors.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding any other provision, the commissioner may approve a written payment schedule of the fee set forth in subdivision (1) of subsection (c) of this section, for a prospective purchaser or owner receiving the covenant not to sue and who has a brownfield investigation plan and remediation schedule approved by the commissioner. Any such payment schedule shall be incorporated by reference into the covenant.\n\n(d) A covenant not to sue issued under this section may provide for continued monitoring in accordance with the remediation standards adopted under section 22a-133k, and, if further remediation is necessary based upon the results of such monitoring, that further action will be taken to remediate the property in accordance with such standards.\n\n(e) A covenant not to sue issued under this section shall not preclude the commissioner from taking any appropriate action, including, but not limited to, any action to require remediation of the property, if he determines that the covenant not to sue was based on information provided by the person seeking the covenant which information such person knew, or had reason to know, was false or misleading.\n\n(f) A “brownfield investigation plan and remediation schedule” means a plan and schedule for investigation, and a schedule for remediation, of any abandoned or underutilized site where redevelopment and reuse has not occurred due to the presence of pollution on the soil or groundwater that requires remediation prior to or in conjunction with the restoration, redevelopment and reuse of the property. The commissioner may determine for each property whether the commissioner will oversee the investigation and remediation of the property or whether such oversight will be delegated to a licensed environmental professional. For each property subject to a covenant under this section based on an approved brownfield investigation plan and remediation schedule, the owner or prospective purchaser shall perform all investigation and remediation activities under the direction of a licensed environmental professional, and shall ensure that all documents required to be submitted contain a written approval of a licensed environmental professional, even at properties for which the commissioner has not delegated oversight to a licensed environmental professional. Each investigation plan and remediation schedule shall provide a schedule for activities including, but not limited to, completion of the investigation of the property in accordance with prevailing standards and guidelines, submittal of a complete investigation report, submittal of a detailed written plan for remediation, completion of remediation in accordance with standards adopted by said commissioner pursuant to section 22a-133k, and submittal of a final remedial action report. At a minimum, the detailed written plan for remediation shall be submitted, pursuant to the schedule, for the commissioner's review and, as appropriate, approval. If the commissioner approves the detailed written plan for remediation, the plan shall be considered incorporated by reference into the covenant not to sue. The commissioner may require submittal of other plans and reports for the commissioner's review and approval.\n\n(g) Any prospective purchaser or municipality remediating property pursuant to the abandoned brownfield cleanup program established pursuant to section 32-768 shall qualify for a covenant not to sue from the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection without fee. Such covenant not to sue shall be transferable to subsequent owners provided the property is undergoing remediation or is remediated in accordance with subsection (f) of section 32-768.\n\n(P.A. 96-113, S. 10, 17; P.A. 98-253, S. 4; P.A. 07-233, S. 12; P.A. 10-32, S. 86; P.A. 11-80, S. 1; 11-141, S. 11; P.A. 13-308, S. 18; Sept.

If any portion of an establishment for which a verification or interim verification is submitted pursuant to this subdivision is transferred or conveyed or undergoes a change in ownership before remediation of the entire establishment is complete that would not otherwise be subject to the provisions of sections 22a-134 to 22a-134e, inclusive, and sections 22a-134h and 22a-134i, the certifying party shall provide notice to the commissioner of such transfer, conveyance or change in ownership not later than thirty days after any such transfer, conveyance or change in ownership.\n\n(B) Any certifying party who submits an interim verification for a portion of an establishment on or before December 31, 2014, shall not be required to record any environmental use restriction, in accordance with section 22a-133o, prior to submitting such interim verification, provided such certifying party shall record such environmental use restriction, in accordance with section 22a-133o, on or before September 1, 2015, or a later date as approved, in writing, by the commissioner.

Upon completion of an audit, the commissioner shall send written audit findings to the certifying party and the licensed environmental professional who verified. The three-year time frame for an audit of a final verification of an entire establishment shall apply to such final verifications received by the commissioner after October 1, 2007, and before October 1, 2019.\n\n(B) The commissioner may conduct an audit of any verification or interim verification submitted pursuant to this section, but shall not commence an audit of a final verification of an entire establishment submitted pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection if more than one year has passed since the date of the commissioner's receipt of such final verification unless an exception listed in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision applies. If the commissioner commences an audit of such final verification, the commissioner shall complete such audit not later than three years after the commissioner's receipt of such final verification subject to such audit, unless an exception listed in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision applies. Upon completion of an audit, the commissioner shall send written audit findings to the certifying party and the licensed environmental professional who verified. The one-year time frame for commencing an audit of a final verification of an entire establishment and the three-year time frame for completion of such an audit shall apply to any final verification received by the commissioner on or after October 1, 2019.\n\n(C) The commissioner may request additional information during an audit.

Upon the commissioner's approval of such schedule, such certifying party shall, in accordance with the approved schedule, submit scopes of work, technical plans, technical reports and progress reports to the commissioner for the commissioner's review and written approval. Such certifying party shall perform all actions identified in the approved scopes of work, technical plans, technical reports and progress reports in accordance with the approved schedule. The commissioner may approve in writing any modification proposed in writing by such certifying party to such schedule or investigation and remediation. The commissioner may, at any time, notify such certifying party in writing that the commissioner's review and written approval is not required and that a licensed environmental professional may verify that the remediation has been performed in accordance with the remediation standards.\n\n(2) A certifying party may complete the remediation of a portion of an establishment and request that the commissioner determine that the requirements of this subsection have been satisfied for any such portion of the establishment. If the commissioner determines that any such remediation is complete, the certifying party shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of this subsection for any such portion of an establishment. Any determination by the commissioner that remediation at the entire establishment has been completed may include and rely upon any determination made pursuant to this subdivision that remediation is complete at a portion of an establishment. If any portion of an establishment for which the commissioner determines that remediation is complete pursuant to this subdivision is transferred or conveyed or undergoes a change in ownership before remediation of the entire establishment is complete that would not otherwise be subject to the provisions of sections 22a-134 to 22a-134e, inclusive, and sections 22a-134h and 22a-134i, the certifying party shall provide notice to the commissioner of such transfer, conveyance or change in ownership not later than thirty days after any such transfer, conveyance or change in ownership.\n\n(i) The certifying party to a Form III or Form IV shall (1) publish notice of the remediation, in accordance with the schedule submitted pursuant to this section, in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the area affected by the establishment, (2) notify the director of health of the municipality where the establishment is located of the remediation, and (3) either (A) erect and maintain for at least thirty days in a legible condition a sign not less than six feet by four feet on the establishment, which sign shall be clearly visible from the public highway, and shall include the words “ENVIRONMENTAL CLEAN-UP IN PROGRESS AT THIS SITE. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:” and include a telephone number for an office from which any interested person may obtain additional information about the remediation, or (B) mail notice of the remediation to each owner of record of property which abuts the parcel, at the address for such property on the last-completed grand list of the municipality where the establishment is located.\n\n(j) The commissioner may issue an order to any person who fails to comply with any provision of sections 22a-134 to 22a-134e, inclusive, and sections 22a-134h and 22a-134i, including, but not limited to, any person who fails to file a form, or files an incomplete or incorrect form or to any person who fails to carry out any activities to which that person agreed in a Form III or Form IV. If no form is filed or if an incomplete or incorrect form is filed for a transfer of an establishment, the commissioner may issue an order to the transferor, the transferee, or both, requiring a filing. The commissioner may also request that the Attorney General bring an action in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford to enjoin any person who fails to comply with any provision of sections 22a-134 to 22a-134e, inclusive, and sections 22a-134h and 22a-134i, including, but not limited to, any person who fails to file a form, improperly files a Form I, Form II, Form III or Form IV or the certifying party to a Form III or Form IV to take any actions necessary to prevent or abate any pollution at, or emanating from, the subject establishment. Any person to whom such an order is issued may appeal such order in accordance with the procedures set forth in sections 22a-436 and 22a-437.\n\n(k) Notwithstanding the exemptions provided in section 22a-134a, nothing contained in sections 22a-134 to 22a-134e, inclusive, and sections 22a-134h and 22a-134i shall be construed as creating an innocent landowner defense for purposes of section 22a-452d.\n\n(l) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, no person shall be required to comply with the provisions of sections 22a-134 to 22a-134e, inclusive, and sections 22a-134h and 22a-134i when transferring real property (1) (A) for which a Form I or Form II has been filed for the transfer of the parcel on or after October 1, 1995, or (B) for which parcel a Form III or Form IV has been filed and which has been remediated and such remediation has been approved in writing by the commissioner or has been verified in writing in accordance with this section by a licensed environmental professional that an investigation has been performed in accordance with prevailing standards and guidelines and that the remediation has been performed in accordance with the remediation standards, and (2) at which no activities described in subdivision (3) of section 22a-134 have been conducted since (A) the date of the commissioner's approval of the remediation, (B) the date to which the verification applies, as designated on the form submitted to the commissioner in connection with a Form III or Form IV verification, or (C) the date on which the Form I or Form II was filed.\n\n(m) Failure of the commissioner to notify any party in accordance with the provisions of this section in no way limits the ability of the commissioner to enforce the provisions of sections 22a-134 to 22a-134e, inclusive, and sections 22a-134h and 22a-134i.\n\n(n) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the execution of a Form III or a Form IV shall not require a certifying party to investigate or remediate any release or potential release of pollution at the parcel that occurs after the completion of a Phase II investigation, as defined in the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection's Site Characterization Guidance Document, or from and after the date such Form III or Form IV was filed with the commissioner, whichever is later.\n\n(P.A. 85-568, S. 3; P.A. 87-475, S. 2; 87-589, S. 49, 87; P.A. 88-230, S. 1, 12; P.A. 90-98, S. 1, 2; P.A. 93-142, S. 4, 7, 8; P.A. 95-183, S. 2; 95-220, S. 4–6; P.A. 96-113, S. 2, 6, 17; P.A. 99-225, S. 7, 8; P.A. 01-204, S. 16; June Sp.
