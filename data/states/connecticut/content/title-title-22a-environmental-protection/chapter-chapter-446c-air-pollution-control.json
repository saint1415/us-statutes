Any person heard at the public hearing on any such regulation shall be given written notice of the determination of the commissioner.\n\n(b) The commissioner shall have the power to (1) enter into contracts with technical consultants, including, but not limited to, nonprofit corporations created for the purpose of facilitating the state's implementation of multistate air pollution control programs, for special studies, advice and assistance; to consult with and advise and exchange information with other departments or agencies of the state; and (2) serve on the board of directors of a nonprofit corporation, including, but not limited to, a nonprofit corporation created for the purpose of facilitating the state's implementation of multistate air pollution control programs.\n\n(c) The commissioner shall have the power, in accordance with regulations adopted by him, (1) to require that a person, before undertaking the construction, installation, enlargement or establishment of a new air contaminant source specified in the regulations adopted under subsection (a) of this section, submit to him plans, specifications and such information as he deems reasonably necessary relating to the construction, installation, enlargement, or establishment of such new air contaminant source; (2) to issue a permit approving such plans and specifications and permitting the construction, installation, enlargement or establishment of the new air contaminant source in accordance with such plans, or to issue an order requiring that such plans and specifications be modified as a condition to his approving them and issuing a permit allowing such construction, installation, enlargement or establishment in accordance therewith, or to issue an order rejecting such plans and specifications and prohibiting construction, installation, enlargement or establishment of a new air contaminant source in accordance with the plans and specifications submitted; (3) to require periodic inspection and maintenance of combustion equipment and other sources of air pollution; (4) to require any person to maintain such records relating to air pollution or to the operation of facilities designed to abate air pollution as he deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter and section 14-164c; (5) to require that a person in control of an air contaminant source specified in the regulations adopted under subsection (a), obtain a permit to operate such source if the source (A) is subject to any regulations adopted by the commissioner concerning high risk hazardous air pollutants, (B) burns waste oil, (C) is allowed by the commissioner, pursuant to regulations adopted under subsection (a), to exceed emission limits for sulfur compounds, (D) is issued an order pursuant to section 22a-178, or (E) violates any provision of this chapter, or any regulation, order or permit adopted or issued thereunder; (6) to require that a person in control of an air contaminant source who is not required to obtain a permit pursuant to this subsection register with him and provide such information as he deems necessary to maintain his inventory of air pollution sources and the commissioner may require renewal of such registration at intervals he deems necessary to maintain such inventory; (7) to require a permit for any source regulated under the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, P.L. 101-549; (8) to refuse to issue a permit if the Environmental Protection Agency objects to its issuance in a timely manner under Title V of the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990; and (9) notwithstanding any regulation adopted under this chapter, to require that any source permitted under Title V of the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 shall comply with all applicable standards set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Parts 51, 52, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 68, 70, 72 to 78, inclusive, and 82, as amended from time to time.\n\n(d) The commissioner shall have all incidental powers necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter and section 14-164c.\n\n(e) As used in this subsection, “contiguous” means abutting or adjoining without consideration of the actual or projected existence of roadways, walkways, plazas, parks or other minor intervening features; “indirect source” means any building, structure, facility, installation or combination thereof, that has or leads to associated activity as a result of which any air pollutant is or may be emitted. The commissioner shall not require the submission of plans and specifications under indirect source regulations adopted pursuant to subdivisions (1) and (2) of subsection (c) of this section for proposed construction to be undertaken within a redevelopment area or urban renewal project, as defined in chapter 130, provided (1) the proposed construction is pursuant to a plan for such redevelopment area or urban renewal project adopted pursuant to section 8-127 prior to October 1, 1974, or to a modification of such plan, (2) the proposed construction is part of a contiguous, single purpose or multipurpose development or developments and (3) site clearance or construction had commenced on a portion of the site of such development or developments prior to October 1, 1974, nor shall the commissioner issue any order pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (c) of this section pertaining to the enforcement of indirect source regulations with respect to such proposed construction within such redevelopment areas and urban renewal projects. In the event that the modification of any such plan after October 1, 1974, would result in the proposed construction generating substantially more motor vehicle traffic than would have been generated prior to such modification, the submission of plans and specifications shall be required for such proposed modification. The commissioner shall not require the renewal of an indirect source operating permit issued in accordance with subsection (c) of this section unless such indirect source no longer conforms with plans, specifications or other information submitted to said commissioner in accordance with said subsection (c).\n\n(f) The commissioner shall allow the open burning of brush on residential property, provided the burning is conducted by the resident of the property or the agent of the resident and a permit for such burning is obtained from the local open burning official of the municipality in which the property is located, and the open burning of brush in municipal landfills, transfer stations and municipal recycling centers, provided a permit for such burning is obtained from the fire marshal of the municipality where the facility is located, except that no open burning of brush shall occur (1) when national or state ambient air quality standards may be exceeded; (2) where a hazardous health condition might be created; (3) when the forest fire danger in the area is identified by the commissioner as extreme and where woodland or grass land is within one hundred feet of the proposed burn; (4) where there is an advisory from the commissioner of any air pollution episode; (5) where prohibited by an ordinance of the municipality; and (6) in the case of a municipal landfill, when such landfill is within an area designated as a hot spot on the open burning map prepared by the commissioner. A permit for the burning of brush at any municipal landfill, municipal transfer station or municipal recycling center shall be issued no more than six times in any calendar year. The proposed permit to burn brush at any municipal landfill, municipal transfer station or municipal recycling center shall be submitted to the commissioner by the fire marshal, with the approval of the chief elected official of the municipality in which the municipal landfill, municipal transfer station or municipal recycling center is located. The commissioner shall approve or disapprove the fire marshal's proposed permitting of burning of brush at a municipal landfill, municipal transfer station or municipal recycling center within a reasonable time of the filing of such application. The burning of leaves, demolition waste or other solid waste deposited in such landfill shall be prohibited. The burning of nonprocessed wood for campfires and bonfires is not prohibited if the burning is conducted so as not to create a nuisance and in accordance with any restrictions imposed on such burning. Nothing in this subsection or in any regulation adopted pursuant to this subsection shall affect the power of any municipality to regulate or ban the open burning of brush within its boundaries for any purpose. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, fire breaks for the purpose of controlling forest fires and controlled fires in saltwater marshes to forestall uncontrolled fires are not prohibited. Open burning may be engaged in for any of the following purposes if the open burning official with jurisdiction over the area where the burning will occur issues an open burning permit: Fire-training exercises; eradication or control of insect infestations or disease; agricultural purposes; clearing vegetative debris following a natural disaster; and vegetative management or enhancement of wildlife habitat or ecological sustainability on municipal property or on any privately owned property permanently dedicated as open space. Open burning for such purposes on state property may be engaged in with the written approval of the commissioner. Local burning officials nominated for the purposes of this subsection shall be nominated only by the chief executive officer of the municipality in which the official will serve and shall be certified by the commissioner. The chief executive officer may revoke the nomination. The commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, governing open burning and may authorize or prohibit open burning consistent with this section. The regulations may require the payment of an application fee and inspection fee and may establish a certification procedure for local burning officials.\n\n(g) The commissioner shall require, by regulations adopted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, the payment of a permit application fee sufficient to cover the reasonable costs of reviewing and acting upon an application for, and monitoring compliance with the terms and conditions of, any state or federal permit, license, order, certificate or approval required pursuant to this section. Any person obtaining a permit, pursuant to said regulations, for the construction or operation of a source of air pollution or for modification to an existing source of air pollution shall submit a permit fee of twice the amount of the fee established by regulations in effect on July 1, 1990. The commissioner shall require the payment of a permit application fee of two hundred dollars.\n\n(h) The commissioner may require, by regulations adopted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, payment of a fee by the owner or operator of a source of air pollution, sufficient to cover the reasonable cost of a visual test of an air pollution control device through the use of a dust compound in the detection of leaks in such device, or the monitoring of such test, provided such fee may not exceed the average cost to the department for the conduct or monitoring of such tests plus ten per cent of such average cost. Except as specified in section 22a-27u, all payments received by the commissioner pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited in the General Fund and credited to the appropriations of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection in accordance with the provisions of section 4-86.\n\n(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (g) and (h) of this section, no municipality shall be required to pay more than fifty per cent of any fee established by the commissioner pursuant to said subsections.\n\n(j) Fees or increased fees prescribed by this section shall not be applicable to residential property.\n\n(k) (1) The commissioner may issue a general permit with respect to a category of new or existing stationary air pollution sources, except with respect to a source which is already covered by an individual permit, provided the general permit is not inconsistent with the federal Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, 42 USC, Sections 7401 et seq., and as it may be further amended from time to time. Any person conducting an activity for which a general permit has been issued shall not be required to obtain an individual permit under this section, except as provided in subdivision (5) of this subsection. The general permit may regulate a category of sources which, whether or not requiring a permit under the federal Clean Air Act, (A) involve the same or substantially similar types of operations or substances, (B) require the same types of pollution control equipment or other operating conditions, standards or limitations, and (C) require the same or similar monitoring, and which, in the opinion of the commissioner, are more appropriately controlled under a general permit than under an individual permit. The general permit may require that any person proposing to conduct any activity under the general permit register such activity, including obtaining approval from the commissioner, before the general permit becomes effective as to such activity, and may include such other conditions as the commissioner deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, management practices and verification and reporting requirements. Any such reports shall be made available to the public by the commissioner. The commissioner shall grant an application for approval under a general permit without repeating the notice and comment procedures provided under subdivision (2) of this subsection, and such a grant shall not be subject to judicial review under subdivision (4) of this subsection. Registrations and applications for approval under the general permit shall be submitted on forms prescribed by the commissioner; application forms concerning activities regulated under the federal Clean Air Act shall require that the applicant provide such information as may be required by that act. The commissioner shall prepare, and annually amend, a list of holders of general permits under this section, which list shall be made available to the public.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding any other procedures in this chapter, any regulations adopted thereunder, and chapter 54, the commissioner may issue a general permit in accordance with the following procedures: (A) The commissioner shall publish in a newspaper, having a substantial circulation in the affected area or areas, notice of (i) intent to issue a general permit, (ii) the right to inspect the proposed general permit, (iii) the opportunity to submit written comments thereon, and (iv) the right to a public hearing if, within the comment period, the commissioner receives a petition signed by at least twenty-five persons provided the notice shall state that the right to a public hearing may be exercised upon request of any person if the permit regulates an activity which is subject to provisions of the federal Clean Air Act; (B) the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and any states affected by the general permit shall be given notice as may be required by the federal Clean Air Act; (C) the commissioner shall allow a comment period of thirty days following publication of notice under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision during which interested persons may submit written comments concerning the permit to the commissioner; (D) the commissioner shall not issue the general permit until after the comment period and the public hearing, if one is held; (E) the commissioner shall publish notice of any general permit issued in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the affected area or areas; and (F) summary suspension may be ordered in accordance with subsection (c) of section 4-182. Any person may request that the commissioner issue, modify, revoke or suspend a general permit in accordance with this subsection.\n\n(3) Any general permit under this subsection shall be issued for a fixed term. A general permit covering an activity regulated under the federal Clean Air Act shall be issued for a term of no more than five years. A general permit covering an activity regulated under the federal Clean Air Act shall contain such additional conditions as may be required by that act.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter and chapter 54, with respect to a general permit concerning activities regulated under the federal Clean Air Act, any person who submitted timely comments thereon may appeal the issuance of such permit to the superior court in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183. Such appeal shall have precedence in the order of trial as provided in section 52-192.\n\n(5) Subsequent to the issuance of a general permit, the commissioner may require a person whose activity is or may be covered by the general permit to apply for and obtain an individual permit pursuant to this chapter if he determines that an individual permit would better protect the land, air and waters of the state from pollution. The commissioner may require an individual permit under this subdivision in cases including, but not limited to, the following: (A) The permittee is not in compliance with the conditions of the general permit; (B) a change has occurred in the availability of demonstrated technology or practices for the control or abatement of pollution applicable to the permitted activity; (C) circumstances have changed since the time the general permit was issued so that the permitted activity is no longer appropriately controlled under the general permit, or a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the permitted activity is necessary; or (D) a relevant change has occurred in the applicability of the federal Clean Air Act. In making the determination to require an individual permit, the commissioner may consider the location, character and size of the source and any other relevant factors. The commissioner may require an individual permit under this subdivision only if the person whose activity is covered by the general permit has been notified in writing that an individual permit is required. The notice shall include a brief statement of the reasons for requiring an individual permit, an application form, a statement setting a time for the person to file the application and a statement that the general permit as it applies to such person shall automatically terminate on the effective date of the individual permit. Such person shall forthwith apply for, and use best efforts to obtain, the individual permit. Any person may petition the commissioner to take action under this subdivision.\n\n(6) The commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to carry out the purposes of this subsection.\n\n(l) In any proceeding on an application for a permit which is required under 42 USC 7661a, the applicant, and any other person entitled under said section to obtain judicial review of the commissioner's final action on such application may appeal such action in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183.\n\n(m) The commissioner shall not issue a permit for an asphalt batch plant or continuous mix facility under the provisions of this section until July 1, 2004, unless the commissioner determines that the issuance of the permit will result in an improvement of environmental performance of an existing asphalt batch plant or continuous mix plant. The provisions of this section shall apply to any application pending on May 5, 1998. Nothing in this section shall apply to applications for upgrading, replacing, consolidating or otherwise altering the physical plant of an existing facility provided such upgrade, replacement, consolidation or alteration results in an improvement of environmental performance or in reduced total emissions of air pollutants.\n\n(1967, P.A. 754, S. 4; 1969, P.A. 758, S. 4; 1971, P.A. 872, S. 17; P.A. 75-453, S. 1, 2; P.A. 76-232, S. 1, 3; P.A. 77-252; 77-604, S. 16, 84; P.A. 79-177; P.A. 81-127, S. 1, 2; 81-385, S. 1, 2; P.A. 83-159, S. 2, 3; 83-555, S. 2; 83-587, S. 74, 96; P.A. 84-5, S. 1, 2; 84-120, S. 1; 84-546, S. 133, 173; P.A. 85-515, S. 2; 85-571, S. 15; P.A. 87-165; P.A. 88-122; P.A. 90-231, S. 1, 28; 90-247, S. 1; P.A. 91-183; 91-369, S. 13, 36; P.A. 92-162, S. 5, 25; P.A. 93-428, S. 17, 19, 39; P.A. 95-165, S. 1; 95-218, S. 12; P.A. 96-64; P.A. 97-124, S. 4, 16; P.A. 98-112, S. 1, 2; P.A. 99-225, S. 2; P.A. 00-1, S. 1, 2; June Sp.
