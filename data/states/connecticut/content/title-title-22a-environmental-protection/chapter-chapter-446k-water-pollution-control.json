Any person who initiated, created or originated a discharge prior to May 1, 1967, and any municipality which initiated, created or originated a discharge prior to April 10, 1973, for which a permit has not been issued pursuant to this section, shall submit an application for a permit for such discharge on or before July 1, 1987. Application for a permit shall be on a form prescribed by the commissioner, shall include such information as the commissioner may require and shall be accompanied by a fee of twenty-five per cent more than the amount established in regulations in effect on July 1, 1990. On and after July 1, 1991, such fees shall be as prescribed by regulations adopted by the commissioner in accordance with chapter 54. The commissioner shall not issue or renew a permit unless such issuance or renewal is consistent with the provisions of the federal Clean Water Act (33 USC 1251 et seq.).\n\n(b) The commissioner, at least thirty days before approving or denying a permit application for a discharge, shall publish once in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the affected area notice of (1) the name of the applicant; (2) the location, volume, frequency and nature of the discharge; (3) the tentative decision on the application, and (4) additional information the commissioner deems necessary to comply with the federal Clean Water Act (33 USC 1251 et seq.). There shall be a comment period following the public notice during which period interested persons and municipalities may submit written comments. After the comment period, the commissioner shall make a final determination either that (A) such discharge would not cause pollution of any of the waters of the state, in which case he shall issue a permit for such discharge, or (B) after giving due regard to any proposed system to treat the discharge, that such discharge would cause pollution of any of the waters of the state, in which case he shall deny the application and notify the applicant of such denial and the reasons therefor, or (C) the proposed system to treat such discharge will protect the waters of the state from pollution, in which case he shall, except as provided pursuant to subsection (j) of this section, require the applicant to submit plans and specifications and such other information as he may require and shall impose such additional conditions as may be required to protect such water, and if the commissioner finds that the proposed system to treat the discharge, as described by the plans and specifications or such other information as may be required by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (j) of this section, will protect the waters of the state from pollution, he shall notify the applicant of his approval and, when such applicant has installed such system, in full compliance with the approval thereof, the commissioner shall issue a permit for such discharge, or (D) the proposed system to treat such discharge, as described by the plans and specifications, will not protect the waters of the state, in which case he shall promptly notify the applicant that its application is denied and the reasons therefor. No permit shall be issued for an alternative on-site sewage treatment system, as defined in the Public Health Code, in a drinking water supply watershed unless the commissioner determines that (i) such system is the only feasible solution to an existing pollution problem and that the proposed system capacity does not exceed the capacity of the failed on-site system, or (ii) such system is for the expansion of an existing municipal or public school project or for new construction of a municipal or public school project on an existing municipal or public school site, in a municipality in which a majority of the land is located within a drinking water supply watershed. The commissioner shall, by regulations adopted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, establish procedures, criteria and standards as appropriate for determining if (I) a discharge would cause pollution to the waters of the state, and (II) a treatment system is adequate to protect the waters of the state from pollution. Such procedures, criteria and standards may include schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, operating and maintenance procedures, management practices and other measures to prevent or reduce pollution of the waters of the state, provided the commissioner in adopting such procedures, criteria and standards shall consider best management practices. The regulations shall specify the circumstances under which procedures, criteria and standards for activities other than treatment will be required. For the purposes of this section, “best management practices” means those practices which reduce the discharge of waste into the waters of the state and which have been determined by the commissioner to be acceptable based on, but not limited to, technical, economic and institutional feasibility. Any applicant, or in the case of a permit issued pursuant to the federal Water Pollution Control Act, any person or municipality, who is aggrieved by a decision of the commissioner where an application has not been given a public hearing shall have the right to a hearing and an appeal therefrom in the same manner as provided in sections 22a-436 and 22a-437. Any applicant, or in the case of a permit issued pursuant to the federal Water Pollution Control Act, any person or municipality, who is aggrieved by a decision of the commissioner where an application has been given a public hearing shall have the right to appeal as provided in section 22a-437. The commissioner may, by regulation, exempt certain categories, types or sizes of discharge from the requirement for notice prior to approving or denying the application if such category, type or size of discharge is not likely to cause substantial pollution. The commissioner may hold a public hearing prior to approving or denying any application if in his discretion the public interest will be best served thereby, and he shall hold a hearing upon receipt of a petition signed by at least twenty-five persons. Notice of such hearing shall be published at least thirty days before the hearing in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the area affected.\n\n(c) The permits issued pursuant to this section shall be for a period not to exceed five years, except that any such permit shall be subject to the provisions of section 22a-431. Such permits: (1) Shall specify the manner, nature and volume of discharge; (2) shall require proper operation and maintenance of any pollution abatement facility required by such permit; (3) may be renewable for periods not to exceed five years each in accordance with procedures and requirements established by the commissioner; and (4) shall be subject to such other requirements and restrictions as the commissioner deems necessary to comply fully with the purposes of this chapter, the federal Water Pollution Control Act and the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. An application for a renewal of a permit which expires after January 1, 1985, shall be filed with the commissioner at least one hundred eighty days before the expiration of such permit. The commissioner, at least thirty days before approving or denying an application for renewal of a permit, shall publish once in a newspaper having substantial circulation in the area affected, notice of (A) the name of the applicant; (B) the location, volume, frequency and nature of the discharge; (C) the tentative decision on the application; and (D) such additional information the commissioner deems necessary to comply with the federal Clean Water Act (33 USC 1251 et seq.). There shall be a comment period following the public notice during which period interested persons and municipalities may submit written comments. After the comment period, the commissioner shall make a final determination that (i) continuance of the existing discharge would not cause pollution of the waters of the state, in which case he shall renew the permit for such discharge, (ii) continuance of the existing system to treat the discharge would protect the waters of the state from pollution, in which case he shall renew a permit for such discharge, (iii) the continuance of the existing system to treat the discharge, even with modifications, would not protect the waters of the state from pollution, in which case he shall promptly notify the applicant that its application is denied and the reasons therefor, or (iv) modification of the existing system or installation of a new system would protect the waters of the state from pollution, in which case he shall renew the permit for such discharge. Such renewed permit may include a schedule for the completion of the modification or installation to allow additional time for compliance with the final effluent limitations in the renewed permit provided (I) continuance of the activity producing the discharge is in the public interest; (II) the interim effluent limitations in the renewed permit are no less stringent than the effluent limitations in the previous permit; and (III) the schedule would not be inconsistent with the federal Water Pollution Control Act. No permit shall be renewed unless the commissioner determines that the treatment system adequately protects the waters of the state from pollution. Any applicant, or in the case of a permit issued pursuant to the federal Water Pollution Control Act, any person or municipality, who is aggrieved by a decision of the commissioner where an application for a renewal has not been given a public hearing shall have the right to a hearing and an appeal therefrom in the same manner as provided in sections 22a-436 and 22a-437. Any applicant, or in the case of a permit issued pursuant to the federal Water Pollution Control Act, any person or municipality, who is aggrieved by a decision of the commissioner where an application for a renewal has been given a public hearing shall have the right to appeal as provided in section 22a-437. Any category, type or size of discharge that is exempt from the requirement of notice pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for the approval or denial of a permit shall be exempt from notice for approval or denial of a renewal of such permit. The commissioner may hold a public hearing prior to approving or denying an application for a renewal if in his discretion the public interest will be best served thereby, and he shall hold a hearing upon receipt of a petition signed by at least twenty-five persons. Notice of such hearing shall be published at least thirty days before the hearing in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the area affected.\n\n(d) If the commissioner finds that any person or municipality has initiated, created or originated or is maintaining any discharge into the waters of the state without a permit as required in subsection (a) of this section, or in violation of such a permit, the commissioner may issue an order to abate pollution which shall include a time schedule for the accomplishment of the necessary steps leading to the abatement of such pollution, or notwithstanding any request for a hearing pursuant to section 22a-436 or the pendency of an appeal therefrom, the commissioner may request the Attorney General to bring an action in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford (1) to enjoin such discharge by such person or municipality until the person or municipality has received a permit from the commissioner or has complied with a permit which the commissioner has issued pursuant to this section, or (2) for injunctive relief to remediate the effects of such discharge. Any such action brought by the Attorney General shall have precedence in the order of trial as provided in section 52-191.\n\n(e) When the commissioner determines that any person or municipality has complied with an order issued pursuant to section 22a-428, 22a-431 or 22a-432, he may issue a permit which shall thereafter be deemed equivalent to a permit issued under subsection (b) of this section, provided a public hearing shall not be required prior to issuing such permit unless required by the federal Water Pollution Control Act and the federal Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\n(f) The commissioner may, by regulation, establish and define categories of discharges, including but not limited to, residential swimming pools, small community sewerage systems, household and small commercial disposal systems and clean water discharges, for which he may delegate authority to any other state agency, water pollution control authority, municipal building official or municipal or district director of health to issue permits or approvals in accordance with this section or to issue orders pursuant to sections 22a-428, 22a-431, 22a-432 and 22a-436. In establishing such categories the commissioner shall consider (1) whether each discharge in such category, because of size and character, is likely to cause significant pollution to the waters of the state; (2) whether knowledge and training concerning disposal systems for each discharge in such category is within the expertise of such agency, authority, official or director; (3) whether the source of each discharge in such category is likely to be within the jurisdiction of such agency, authority, official or director for other matters. The commissioner shall establish, by regulation, minimum requirements for disposal systems for discharges in such categories. Any permit denied or order issued by any such agency, authority, official or director shall be subject to hearing and appeal in the manner provided in sections 22a-436 and 22a-437, provided such agency, authority, official or director has been duly delegated authority by the commissioner pursuant to this subsection. Any permit granted by any such agency, authority, official or director to which the commissioner has delegated authority pursuant to this subsection shall thereafter be deemed equivalent to a permit issued under subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(g) The commissioner shall, by regulation adopted prior to October 1, 1977, establish and define categories of discharges that constitute household and small commercial subsurface sewage disposal systems for which the commissioner shall delegate to the Commissioner of Public Health the authority to issue permits or approvals and to hold public hearings in accordance with this section, on and after said date. Not later than July 1, 2025, the commissioner shall amend such regulations to establish and define categories of discharges that constitute small community sewerage systems and household and small commercial subsurface sewage disposal systems. The Commissioner of Public Health shall, pursuant to section 19a-36, establish minimum requirements for small community sewerage systems and household and small commercial subsurface sewage disposal systems and procedures for the issuance of such permits or approvals by the local director of health or a sanitarian registered pursuant to chapter 395. As used in this subsection, small community sewerage systems and household and small commercial disposal systems shall include those subsurface sewage disposal systems with a capacity of ten thousand gallons per day or less. Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes (1) the regulations adopted by the commissioner pursuant to this subsection that are in effect as of July 1, 2017, shall apply to household and small commercial subsurface sewage disposal systems with a capacity of seven thousand five hundred gallons per day or less, and (2) the regulations adopted by the commissioner pursuant to this subsection that are in effect as of July 1, 2025, shall apply to small community sewerage systems, household systems and small commercial subsurface sewerage disposal systems with a capacity of ten thousand gallons per day or less. Any permit denied by the Commissioner of Public Health, or a director of health or registered sanitarian shall be subject to hearing and appeal in the manner provided in section 19a-229. Any permit granted by the Commissioner of Public Health, or a director of health or registered sanitarian on or after October 1, 1977, shall be deemed equivalent to a permit issued under subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(h) Each person holding a permit to discharge into the waters of the state shall pay an annual fee of twenty-five per cent more than the fee established by regulations in effect on July 1, 1990. The commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to prescribe the amount of the fees required pursuant to this section. Upon the adoption of such regulations, the fees required by this section shall be as prescribed in such regulations.\n\n(i) (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, the commissioner may issue a permit for a discharge to waters of the state from any solid waste disposal area, as defined in section 22a-207, or from any subsurface sewage disposal system for a period not to exceed thirty years, and for any other discharge for a period not to exceed ten years, provided such permit is not inconsistent with the federal Water Pollution Control Act. Any permit issued pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to the provisions of section 22a-431. For the purpose of this subsection, “subsurface sewage disposal system” means a system consisting of a house or collection sewer, a septic tank followed by a leaching system, any necessary pumps or siphons and any groundwater control system on which the operation of the leaching system is dependent.\n\n(2) Permits for the categories of discharge for which ten-year and thirty-year permits may be issued pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection which are in effect on October 1, 1996, shall not expire until five years or twenty-five years, respectively, after the expiration date stated in the permit, provided such extension is not inconsistent with the federal Water Pollution Control Act and further provided no such permit may be valid for a period greater than thirty years and further provided, the commissioner may, no earlier than two hundred seventy days before the expiration date stated in the permit, send notice to the permittee that an application for permit renewal must be submitted not later than one hundred eighty days prior to the expiration date stated in the permit. If a timely and sufficient application for renewal is submitted within such time, the permit shall be continued in accordance with subsection (b) of section 4-182. If a timely and sufficient application is not submitted within such time, the permit shall expire unless such permit is extended pursuant to section 22a-6j. Nothing in this section shall affect the commissioner's authority to take action under this chapter, including but not limited to, issuance of orders under section 22a-431.\n\n(j) (1) The commissioner may exempt persons who or municipalities which apply for permits for the following discharges from the requirement to submit plans and specifications under subsection (b) of this section:\n\n(A) A discharge from a new treatment or disposal system which system is substantially the same as a system that the applicant is operating in compliance with a permit for said system issued by the commissioner;\n\n(B) The discharge is described in a general permit issued by the commissioner pursuant to section 22a-430b;\n\n(C) The discharge is from a system, the purpose of which, as determined by the commissioner, is not to treat any toxic or hazardous substances; or\n\n(D) The discharge is exempt from public notice under subsection (b) of this section and regulations adopted thereunder.\n\n(2) The commissioner shall adopt regulations not later than February 1, 2015, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to establish other categories of discharges which may be exempted from the requirement to submit plans and specifications under subsection (b) of this section. Such regulations may include, but not be limited to, the following: (A) Minimum standards for the design and operation of treatment systems for such discharges; and (B) requirements for submission of information concerning such discharges.\n\n(k) The commissioner shall not deny a permit under this section if the basis for such denial is a determination by the commissioner that the proposed activity for which application has been made is inconsistent with the state plan of conservation and development adopted under part I of chapter 297.\n\n(1967, P.A. 57, S. 9; 1971, P.A. 163; 346, S. 1; 872, S. 85; P.A. 73-38, S. 3, 8; 73-555, S. 8, 10; 73-665, S. 10, 17; P.A. 74-187, S. 2; P.A. 77-285, S. 1, 2; 77-614, S. 323, 587, 610; P.A. 78-154, S. 16; 78-280, S. 6, 127; 78-303, S. 85, 136; P.A. 81-176, S. 1, 2, 5–7; P.A. 82-111, S. 1; P.A. 84-219, S. 2, 4; P.A. 86-239, S. 7, 14; 86-277, S. 2, 4; P.A. 87-261, S. 5; P.A. 88-118, S. 1, 3; 88-230, S. 1, 12; 88-364, S. 84, 123; P.A. 90-98, S. 1, 2; 90-231, S. 9, 28; P.A. 91-263, S. 1, 8; 91-369, S. 17, 36; P.A. 93-142, S. 4, 7, 8; 93-381, S. 9, 39; 93-428, S. 16, 20, 21, 39; P.A. 95-220, S. 4–6; 95-257, S. 12, 21, 58; P.A. 96-145, S. 2; P.A. 98-209, S. 1, 25; P.A. 02-129, S. 1; P.A. 03-123, S. 5; 03-125, S. 1; P.A. 04-151, S. 6; P.A. 05-205, S. 10; P.A. 10-158, S. 6; P.A. 13-209, S. 9; P.A. 17-146, S. 30; P.A. 22-23, S. 12; P.A. 23-207, S. 27.)\n\nHistory: 1971 acts prohibited issuance of permit if discharge would be below the highest standard set pursuant to Subsec.

      "text": "(a)(1) The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection may issue a general permit for a category or categories of discharges regulated pursuant to section 22a-430, except for a discharge covered by an individual permit. The general permit may regulate, within a geographical area: (A) A category of discharges which involve the same or substantially similar types of operations, involve the same type of wastes, require the same effluent limitations, operating conditions or standards, and require the same or similar monitoring and which in the opinion of the commissioner are more appropriately controlled under a general permit; (B) stormwater discharges; or (C) a category of discharges not requiring a permit under the federal Water Pollution Control Act. Any person or municipality conducting an activity covered by a general permit shall not be required to apply for or obtain an individual permit pursuant to section 22a-430, except as provided in subsection (c) of this section. The general permit may require that any person or municipality initiating, creating, originating or maintaining any discharge into the waters of the state under the general permit shall register such discharge with the commissioner before the general permit becomes effective as to such discharge. Registration shall be on a form prescribed by the commissioner.\n\n(2) When issuing a general permit pursuant to this section, the commissioner may require the submission of a certification made by a qualified professional. Any general permit requiring such certification shall specify: (A) The qualifications necessary to define a qualified professional. Such qualifications may include education, training, experience or the attainment of a credential or license that such qualified professional must have obtained. If such qualifications do not require a license, the commissioner shall describe the rationale for such qualifications in a publicly available fact sheet or similar document when proposing the issuance of the applicable general permit pursuant to subsection (b) of this section; (B) the criteria to ensure that a qualified professional is independent and does not have a conflict of interest in making a certification, provided reasonable compensation for services rendered in making a certification shall not be deemed a conflict of interest; (C) the information to be reviewed or inspections to be conducted by such qualified professional as a basis for making a certification; (D) documents that shall be retained in connection with a certification; (E) the standards or requirements for an activity or project that a qualified professional must affirmatively determine have been met; (F) the terms of a statement to be signed by such qualified professional, including any conditions necessary for providing such statement; (G) any other information or condition deemed necessary by the commissioner regarding a certification; and (H) whether the submission of a certification shall be required when the person seeking coverage under the general permit is a governmental entity, including a federal, state or municipal entity. Nothing in this section shall authorize a qualified professional to engage in any profession or occupation requiring a license under any other provision of the general statutes without such license. The commissioner shall not require such certification if such certification would violate the federal Water Pollution Control Act or the federal Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 54, a general permit shall be issued, renewed, modified, revoked or suspended in accordance with the standards and procedures specified for an individual permit, in accordance with section 22a-430 and any regulations adopted thereunder, except that (1) summary suspension may be ordered in accordance with subsection (c) of section 4-182; (2) any proposed or final general permit and notice thereof may address persons or municipalities which are or may be covered by the general permit as a group, describe the facilities which are or may be covered by the general permit in general terms; and (3) upon issuance of a proposed or final general permit, the commissioner shall publish notice thereof in a newspaper of substantial circulation in the affected area. General permits shall be issued for a term specified by the permit and such terms shall be consistent with the federal Water Pollution Control Act and shall be subject to the provisions of section 22a-431. Such permits shall: (A) Describe the category of discharge regulated by the general permit; (B) specify the manner, nature and volume of discharge; (C) require proper operation and maintenance of any pollution abatement facility required by such permit; and (D) be subject to such other requirements and restriction as the commissioner deems necessary to fully comply with the purposes of this chapter, the federal Water Pollution Control Act and the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. Any construction or modification of a pollution abatement facility or disposal system which is undertaken pursuant to and in accordance with a general permit shall not require submission of plans and specifications to or approval by the commissioner, unless required pursuant to the terms of the general permit.\n\n(c) Subsequent to the issuance of a general permit, the commissioner may require a person or municipality initiating, creating, originating or maintaining any discharge which is or may be authorized by a general permit to obtain an individual permit pursuant to section 22a-430 if the commissioner determines that an individual permit would better protect the waters of the state from pollution. The commissioner may require an individual permit under this subsection in cases that include but are not limited to the following: (1) When the discharger is not in compliance with the conditions in the general permit; (2) when a change has occurred in the availability of a demonstrated technology or practice for the control or abatement of pollution applicable to the discharge; (3) when effluent limitations and conditions are promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency or established by the commissioner under section 22a-430 for discharges covered by the general permit; (4) when a water quality management plan containing requirements applicable to such discharges is approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency; (5) when circumstances have changed since the issuance of the general permit so that the discharger is no longer appropriately controlled under the general permit, or a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge is necessary; (6) when the discharge is a significant contributor of pollution, provided the commissioner, in making this determination, may consider the location of the discharge with respect to waters of the state, the size of the discharge, the quantity and nature of the pollution discharged to waters of the state, cumulative impacts of discharges covered by the general permit and other relevant factors; or (7) when the requirements of subsection (a) of this section are not met. The commissioner may require an individual permit under this subsection only if the affected person or municipality has been notified in writing that a permit application is required. The notice shall include a brief statement of the reasons for the commissioner's decision, an application form, a statement setting forth a time for the person or municipality to file the application, and a statement that on the effective date of the individual permit the general permit as it applies to the individual permittee shall automatically terminate. The commissioner may grant additional time upon the request of the applicant. If the affected person or municipality does not submit a complete application for an individual permit within the time frame set forth in the commissioner's notice or as extended by the commissioner in writing, then the general permit as it applies to the affected person or municipality shall automatically terminate. Any interested person or municipality may petition the commissioner to take action under this subsection.\n\n(d) (1) A qualified professional shall ensure that any certification submitted pursuant to this section complies with the general permit that requires such certification. Compliance with a general permit shall include any matter specified in such permit pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section. The commissioner shall accept a certification when submitted with a registration for a general permit, unless (A) the certification is the subject of an audit pursuant to subsection (e) of this subsection; or (B) the commissioner has reason to believe that the certification does not comply with the requirements of the general permit, including any matter specified in the general permit pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(2) Any qualified professional who makes a certification pursuant to this section shall promptly notify, in writing, the commissioner and the person who would obtain or has obtained coverage under the general permit based upon such certification if, during the normal course of a qualified professional's practice, such professional learns, or should have learned, of information that would significantly affect or prevent such professional's decision to have made such certification. Such notification shall be made not later than fifteen days after a qualified professional learns of such information and shall identify the certification and the reasons such qualified professional is submitting notice pursuant to this subdivision.\n\n(e) The commissioner may audit any certification made by a qualified professional pursuant to this section. As part of such audit, the commissioner may request any information the commissioner deems necessary to conduct such audit from either the person who would obtain or has obtained coverage under the general permit based upon such certification or the qualified professional making the certification. In addition, the commissioner may require independent verification of all or any part of a certification made by a qualified professional. Such independent verification shall be performed by a different qualified professional who: (1) Meets the requirements for a qualified professional specified in the general permit; (2) does not have a conflict of interest, provided reasonable compensation for providing independent verification shall not constitute a conflict of interest; (3) did not engage in any activities associated with the development, preparation or review of any information on which the certification is based; and (4) is not under the same employ of the person who developed, prepared or reviewed any of the information on which the certification is based. Such independent verification shall be at the expense of the person who seeks or has obtained coverage under a general permit. If an audit undertaken by the commissioner pursuant to this subsection reveals that a certification was made in violation of any requirement of the general permit, including any matter specified in the general permit pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section, the commissioner may charge, and the person who would obtain or has obtained coverage under the general permit based upon such certification shall pay, for the reasonable costs of conducting such audit.\n\n(f) The commissioner shall have a goal of auditing ten per cent of the certifications submitted with a general permit pursuant to this section. The commissioner shall, not later than January 1, 2014, submit a report, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a, to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to commerce and the environment. Such report shall include (1) the total number of certifications submitted; (2) the number of certifications subject to partial or full audit; (3) the number of certifications found not to be in compliance with the general permit; (4) where necessary, the actions taken to bring about or maintain compliance with the general permit; (5) whether any conclusions can be drawn from the audits regarding levels of compliance of the certification with applicable requirements and, if so, any such conclusions; and (6) any additional recommendations regarding the use of certifications in general permits. Such report may be submitted electronically.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding the acceptance of a certification pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (1) of subsection (e) of this section, if, after acceptance, the commissioner finds that a certification does not comply with the requirements of the general permit, including any matter specified in the general permit pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section, or if the qualified professional that made a certification fails to cooperate or provide information requested by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, the commissioner may (1) deny a registration seeking coverage under a general permit, (2) revoke, suspend or modify any approval issued by the commissioner under a general permit, including the approval of any registration for coverage under a general permit, or (3) require the person who would obtain or has obtained coverage under the general permit based upon such certification to obtain an individual permit, pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.

Part 280.90 et seq. as said regulation was published in the Federal Register of October 26, 1988, for the underground storage tank or underground storage tank system from which the release emanated, whether or not such party is required to comply with said requirements on the date any such cost is incurred, provided if the state is the responsible party, the commissioner may order payment, within available resources, without regard to whether the state was or would have been required to demonstrate financial responsibility under said sections 40 CFR Part 280.90 et seq., (3) after the release, if any, the responsible party incurred a cost, expense or obligation for investigation, cleanup or for claims of a person other than a responsible party resulting from the release, provided any such claim shall be required to be finally adjudicated or settled with the prior written approval of the commissioner before an application for reimbursement or payment is made, (4) the commissioner determines that the cost, expense or other obligation is reasonable and that there are not grounds for recovery specified in subdivision (1) or (3) of subsection (g) of this section, (5) the responsible party notified the commissioner, as soon as practicable, of the release and of any other claim by a person other than a responsible party, resulting from the release, in accordance with the regulations adopted pursuant to section 22a-449e, (6) the responsible party, or, if a person other than a responsible party applies for payment or reimbursement from the program, then such person demonstrates the remediation, including any monitoring to determine the effectiveness of the remediation, for which payment or reimbursement is sought is not more stringent than that required by the remediation standards established pursuant to section 22a-133k, except to the extent the responsible party or such person demonstrates that it has been directed otherwise, in writing, by the commissioner, (7) the responsible party, or, if a person other than a responsible party applies for payment or reimbursement, then such person demonstrates that it does not have insurance, or a contract or other agreement to provide payment or reimbursement for any cost, expense or other obligation incurred in response to a release or suspected release, or if there is any such insurance, contract or other agreement, that any insurance coverage has been denied or is insufficient to cover the costs, expenses or other obligations, paid or incurred or that any contract or other agreement is not able to or is insufficient to cover the costs, expenses or other obligations, paid or incurred, for which payment or reimbursement is sought, (8) the responsible party demonstrates and the commissioner determines that one of the milestones noted in section 22a-449p has been completed, (9) the commissioner determines what, if any, reductions to the amounts sought should be made based upon the compliance evaluations performed pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, and (10) at the time any application or request for payment or reimbursement, including any supplemental application or request, is submitted (A) for applications submitted on or after October 1, 2007, there is no underground storage tank system subject to the financial responsibility demonstration required in subdivision (2) of this subsection dispensing petroleum on the property where the release or suspected release emanated or occurred, and if the application is submitted by the person who owns or operates or who owned or operated the underground storage tank system at the time of the release, such person demonstrates, in addition to all other applicable requirements, that lack of compliance with provisions of the general statutes and regulations governing underground storage tank systems was not a proximate cause of the release or suspected release and that there are not grounds for recovery specified in subdivision (2) of subsection (g) of this section, or (B) for applications submitted prior to October 1, 2007, there is no underground storage tank system dispensing petroleum on the property where the release or suspected release emanated or occurred, and if the application is submitted by the person who owns or operates or who owned or operated the underground storage tank system at the time of the release, such person demonstrates, in addition to all other applicable requirements, that lack of compliance with provisions of the general statutes and regulations governing underground storage tank systems was not a proximate cause of the release or suspected release and that there are not grounds for recovery specified in subdivision (2) of subsection (g) of this section. Subdivision (10) of this subsection shall not apply to any application concerning a release of an underground storage tank system that was reported to the commissioner in September, 2003 where such system was owned or operated by a municipality or other political subdivision of the state at the time of the release and such system was removed on or before April 1, 2005. In acting on an application or a request for payment or reimbursement, the commissioner, using funds from the program, may contract with experts, including, but not limited to, attorneys and medical professionals, to better evaluate and defend against claims and negotiate claims by persons other than responsible parties. If a person other than a responsible party applies to the commissioner claiming to have suffered bodily injury, property damage or damage to natural resources, the commissioner shall order reimbursement or payment from the program if such person demonstrates that subdivisions (1), (2), (6) and (7) of this subsection are satisfied, the commissioner determines that as a result of a release or suspected release such person has suffered bodily injury, property damage or damage to natural resources, that the costs, expenses or other obligations incurred are reasonable and the person submitting such claim demonstrates that it has attempted to or has provided written notice of its claim to the responsible party as required in subsection (a) of this section and that the responsible party has not applied to the commissioner for payment or reimbursement of this claim. On or before June 30, 2005, if the commissioner denied reimbursement or provided for only partial payment or reimbursement from the program regarding a release, pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection, such denial or partial payment or reimbursement shall remain in effect and shall apply to all subsequent applications or requests for payment or reimbursement regarding such release.\n\n(d)Compliance status of underground storage tank systems. Applicability. Evaluation.(1) Except as provided in this subsection, if at the time any application or request for payment or reimbursement is submitted to the commissioner, including any supplemental application or request, there is an underground storage tank system dispensing petroleum on the property where the release or suspected release emanated or occurred, such application or request shall not be deemed complete and shall not be acted upon by the commissioner unless such application or request includes a summary of the compliance status of all the underground storage tank systems on the subject property. Any such summary shall include an evaluation of compliance with the design, construction, installation, notification, general operating, release detecting, system upgrading, abandonment and removal date requirements of the regulations adopted pursuant to sections 22a-449 and 22a-449o and shall be prepared by an independent consultant on a form prescribed by or acceptable to the commissioner. The summary shall be based on an evaluation of said underground storage tank systems performed not more than one hundred eighty days before the commissioner receives an application or a request for reimbursement or payment, except that with respect to any provision of the subject regulations regarding record keeping, periodic monitoring or testing, the summary shall be based on an evaluation of a one-year period terminating within one hundred eighty days prior to the commissioner's receipt of an application or a request for payment or reimbursement. The summary shall also include a full description of all corrective measures that have been taken or that are being taken with regard to any noncompliance identified in the compliance evaluation performed pursuant to this subdivision.\n\n(2) With respect to any initial application or request for payment or reimbursement regarding a release or suspected release the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection shall apply only to applications or requests received on or after January 1, 2006. With respect to any supplemental application or request for payment or reimbursement regarding a release or suspected release, the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection shall apply to each application or request submitted to the commissioner on or after January 1, 2006, regardless of when the initial application or request was submitted, except that submission of a compliance summary shall not be required if at the time a supplemental application or request is submitted, less than one year has passed since the performance of a compliance evaluation submitted with any prior application or request.\n\n(3) The cost of hiring an independent consultant to perform a compliance evaluation, as required by this subsection, shall be eligible for payment or reimbursement up to a maximum of one thousand dollars per compliance evaluation, provided the evaluation is in conformance with the requirements of this subsection and includes all underground storage tank systems on the property where a release or suspected release emanated or occurred. If the schedule adopted by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (b) of section 22a-449e includes an amount for performing a compliance evaluation, upon adoption of any such schedule, the amount eligible for payment or reimbursement for performing a compliance evaluation shall be the amount prescribed in any such schedule.\n\n(4) Nothing in this subsection shall affect the continued applicability of any decision of the commissioner to (A) deny reimbursement or payment, or (B) provide only partial payment or reimbursement regarding all applications or requests for payment or reimbursement. Any such decision shall remain in effect and shall not be subject to reconsideration or reevaluation as a result of this subsection.\n\n(5) Except as provided for in this subdivision, if at the time any application or request for payment or reimbursement, including any supplemental application or request, is submitted, there is no underground storage tank system dispensing petroleum on the property where the release or suspected release emanated or occurred, any such application or request shall be subject to the provisions of subdivision (10) of subsection (c) of this section, even where a prior application or request was subject to the provisions of this subsection.

Authority of commissioner.(1) If the compliance evaluation summary performed pursuant to subsection (d) of this section indicates that any of the violations noted in this subdivision exist with respect to any underground storage tank or underground storage tank system on the property at which a release or suspected release occurred and any such violations have not been fully corrected by the time an application or request for reimbursement is submitted to the commissioner, the commissioner shall reduce any payment or amount to be reimbursed as follows: (A) A one hundred per cent reduction of the payment or amount to be reimbursed for failure to meet the tank or piping construction requirements of section 22a-449o or the regulations adopted pursuant to section 22a-449 or for failure to report the release to the commissioner as required by this section, (B) a seventy-five per cent reduction of the payment or amount to be reimbursed for failure to have properly functioning cathodic protection, spill prevention, overfill prevention, or release detection as required by the regulations adopted pursuant to section 22a-449. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the commissioner may reduce any amount to be paid or reimbursed based on any other violation of the provisions of the general statutes or regulations of Connecticut state agencies regarding ownership or operation of an underground storage tank system.\n\n(2) Nothing in this subsection and no determination by the commissioner of any issue of fact or law pursuant to this subsection shall affect the authority of the commissioner under any other statute or regulations, including, but not limited to, taking any enforcement action based upon the violations identified in any compliance evaluation performed pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(f)Payment or reimbursement for work, services, material.(1) For all work or services performed or materials provided before October 1, 2004, the commissioner shall not order payment or reimbursement for any cost paid or incurred, unless when seeking payment or reimbursement, the application is received by the commissioner on or before April 1, 2005.\n\n(2) For purposes of this subsection, work or services shall be deemed rendered or performed on the date such work is rendered or performed and a material shall be deemed provided on the date a material is made available for use.\n\n(3) After June 30, 2005, the commissioner shall not order payment or reimbursement for any cost, expense or other obligation, paid or incurred, unless the application or request for payment or reimbursement is received by the commissioner not later than one year after the completion of all or substantially all of the work or activities necessary to prepare the plan or report required by the milestones set forth in section 22a-449p.\n\n(g)Civil actions.The Attorney General, upon the request of the commissioner, may institute an action in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford to recover the amounts specified in this section from any person who owns or operates an underground storage tank system at the time a release emanates or occurs from such system or any person who owns the real property on which a release emanates or occurs, provided such person owned the real property at or any time after the release emanates or occurs until the time that a final remediation action report is submitted by a licensed environmental professional or approved by the commissioner pursuant to subdivision (7) of section 22a-449p, if: (1) Prior to the occurrence of the release, the underground storage tank or underground storage tank system from which the release emanated was required by regulations adopted under section 22a-449 to be the subject of an Underground Storage Facility Notification Form, or EPHM-6 but the person who owns or operates or who owned or operated such tank or tank system knowingly and intentionally failed to submit such notification form to the commissioner; (2) the release results from a reckless, wilful, wanton or intentional act or omission of such person or a negligent act or omission of such person that constitutes noncompliance with the general statutes or regulations governing the installation, operation and maintenance of underground storage tanks; or (3) the release occurs from an underground storage tank or system which is not in compliance with a final order issued by the commissioner pursuant to this chapter or a final judgment issued by a court concerning noncompliance with a requirement of this chapter; or (4) payment has been made, including payment to the commissioner pursuant to subsection (i) of this section, to a person other than a person against whom an action may be brought pursuant to this subsection. All costs to the state relating to actions to recover such payments, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, shall initially be paid within available resources. In any recovery the commissioner is entitled to recover from such person (A) all payments made under the program with respect to a release or suspected release, (B) all payments made by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (i) of this section with respect to a release or suspected release, (C) interest on such payments at a rate of ten per cent per year from the date such payments were made, and (D) all costs of the state relating to actions to recover such payments, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees. All actions brought pursuant to this section shall have precedence in the order of trial, as provided in section 52-191. If the Attorney General has filed an action against a person seeking recovery of the amounts specified in this subsection or if the commissioner sends a person a demand letter regarding costs incurred by the state pursuant to section 22a-451, any such person against whom an action has been brought or who receives a demand letter shall not submit an application or request for payment or reimbursement to the commissioner seeking payment or reimbursement of any such amount sought by the Attorney General or by the commissioner.

A copy of the decision shall be sent to the person seeking payment or reimbursement by certified mail, return receipt requested. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the commissioner may, not later than twenty days after the date of issuance of such decision, request a hearing before the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54. After such hearing, the commissioner shall consider the information submitted and affirm or modify the decision on the application. A copy of the affirmed or modified decision shall be sent to all parties to the hearing by certified mail, return receipt requested. For applications submitted before, on or after June 15, 2012, once the commissioner renders a decision regarding an application or request for payment or reimbursement and no hearing has been requested pursuant to this subsection regarding any such decision, the costs, expenses or other obligations addressed by any such decision shall not be resubmitted in any other application or request.\n\n(i)Use of available resources for clean-up.Whenever the commissioner determines that as a result of a release or a suspected release, a clean-up is necessary, including, but not limited to, actions to prevent or abate pollution or a potential source of pollution and to provide potable drinking water, the commissioner may undertake such actions using not more than one million dollars, within available resources, for each release or suspected release from an underground storage tank or an underground storage tank system for which the responsible party is the state or for which a responsible party was or would have been required to demonstrate financial responsibility under 40 CFR Part 280.90 et seq., as said regulation was published in the Federal Register of October 26, 1988.\n\n(j)Percentage payments.(1) If through an initial application or request for payment or reimbursement received by the commissioner before June 1, 2005, the commissioner has determined that a person has paid or incurred costs, expenses or other obligations that are eligible for payment or reimbursement, with respect to any supplemental application or request for payment or reimbursement the following shall apply. The commissioner may identify a category of activities, costs, expenses, or other obligations that are less than one hundred thousand dollars for which, in lieu of full payment, the commissioner may approve a percentage of the costs, expenses or other obligations paid or incurred. When implementing this subsection, the commissioner shall consider the amounts previously paid from the program and any other information the commissioner deems relevant. Any such percentage shall be not more than, but may be less than, ninety per cent of the average amount, as determined by the commissioner, previously paid from the program for any activity, cost, expense or obligation. The commissioner may, using the procedures specified in this subdivision, modify any percentage previously approved pursuant to this subdivision.\n\n(2) A person with a supplemental application or request for payment or reimbursement may agree to accept the percentage payment approved by the commissioner. Any such acceptance shall be in writing, signed by the person seeking payment or reimbursement and shall acknowledge that the person is agreeing to accept less than the full amount sought by such person for the costs, expenses or other obligations covered by such acceptance. If the commissioner has prescribed forms, any such acceptance shall be made using the forms prescribed by the commissioner. Once a completed written acceptance is received, the commissioner shall, not later than ninety days after receiving such acceptance, determine whether to order payment or reimbursement from the program.\n\n(3) Any amount paid or reimbursed under this section shall be considered full payment for any such activity, expense or other obligation and a person shall not seek any additional reimbursement for any such activity, expense or other obligation. The categories or activities for which the commissioner recommends payment of a percentage pursuant to this section may constitute all or a portion of the amounts sought in a supplemental application or supplemental request for payment or reimbursement.\n\n(k)Notification to commissioner.Notification to the commissioner pursuant to regulations adopted pursuant to section 22a-449 shall constitute compliance with any regulation adopted pursuant to section 22a-449e regarding notification to the commissioner of a release.\n\n(P.A. 88-230, S. 1, 12; P.A. 89-373, S. 7, 10; P.A. 90-98, S. 1, 2; 90-181, S. 3; P.A. 91-254, S. 4, 7; P.A. 93-142, S. 4, 7, 8; P.A. 94-28, S. 2, 3; P.A. 95-220, S. 4–6; P.A. 96-180, S. 81, 166; P.A. 04-244, S. 3; June Sp.

If, after the contractor's initial estimate, the contractor subsequently determines that such cost will exceed five thousand dollars, the contractor shall upon that determination notify the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. The department may assess the spill and confirm that the remediation proposed by the contractor is appropriate and necessary, or may authorize an environmental professional licensed under section 22a-133v to assess the spill and make such confirmation. Any such remediation shall be subject to approval by the department, except that the department may authorize an environmental professional licensed under section 22a-133v to make a recommendation regarding such approval. If a registered contractor estimates that the remediation of such spill is likely to cost more than ten thousand dollars, the commissioner or any agent of the commissioner or an environmental professional licensed under said section 22a-133v contracted by the department shall inspect the site and confirm that such remediation is reasonable. The costs of such an inspection shall be eligible for payment within available resources.\n\n(c) (1) In order to receive reimbursement of eligible costs for services commenced after July 1, 1999, and prior to July 1, 2001, a registered contractor shall on or before December 1, 2001, submit to the commissioner for a disbursement from available resources, all reasonable costs for work commenced prior to July 1, 2001, pursuant to a contract with the owner or the state for the remediation of a residential underground heating oil storage tank system for the purpose of providing payment for the costs of such remediation. An owner of a residential underground heating oil storage tank system shall not be responsible to the registered contractor or any subcontractor of the registered contractor for any costs that are eligible for payment from the residential underground heating oil storage tank system clean-up program over five hundred dollars. The registered contractor or any subcontractor shall not bill the owner for any costs eligible for payment from said program over five hundred dollars unless the contractor or subcontractor enters into a separate written contract with the owner, on a form prescribed by the commissioner, authorizing the contractor or subcontractor to bill the owner more than five hundred dollars and such separate contract gives the owner the right to cancel such contract up to three days after entering into it. Such owner shall provide to the commissioner a statement confirming the registered contractor has been engaged by such owner to remove or to replace such residential underground heating oil storage tank system and perform the remediation and shall execute an instrument which provides for payment to the program of any amounts realized by the owner, after any costs of litigation or attorney's fees have been paid, from a judgment or settlement regarding any claim for the costs of such remediation made against an insurance policy or any party. In any service contract entered into between a registered contractor and an owner for the remediation of a residential underground heating oil storage tank system, the registered contractor shall clearly identify all costs, including markup costs, that are not or may not be eligible for payment under said program.\n\n(2) The registered contractor shall submit documentation, satisfactory to the commissioner, of any costs associated with such remediation. The commissioner may deny remediation costs of the registered contractor that the commissioner determines are unreasonable based on the guidelines established pursuant to subsection (b) of section 22a-449d on and after the date the commissioner establishes such guidelines, and may deny remediation costs (A) in excess of five thousand dollars if the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection was not notified in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, and (B) in excess of ten thousand dollars if the site was not inspected in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section. The commissioner shall deny any such costs in excess of fifty thousand dollars unless the commissioner determines such additional costs are warranted to protect public health and the environment. If a registered contractor fails to submit to the commissioner documentation of costs associated with such remediation that may be eligible for payment from the residential underground heating oil storage tank system clean-up program or if the registered contractor submits documentation of such costs but the commissioner denies payment of such costs, the registered contractor shall be liable for such costs and shall have no cause of action against the owner of the underground petroleum storage tank.\n\n(3) A copy of the commissioner's decision shall be sent to the registered contractor by certified mail, return receipt requested. Any contractor aggrieved by a decision of the commissioner may, not more than twenty days after the date the decision was issued, request a hearing before the commissioner in accordance with chapter 54. After such hearing, the commissioner shall consider the information submitted and affirm or modify the decision on the reimbursement. A copy of the affirmed or modified decision shall be sent to any contractor by certified mail, return receipt requested.\n\n(d) The commissioner shall not accept applications pursuant to this section on or after December 1, 2001, for the reimbursement of eligible costs for services completed prior to July 1, 2001, except that, notwithstanding subsection (c) of this section, prior to July 1, 2004, the commissioner may accept applications for reimbursement from and make payments to any owner who demonstrates that the owner paid for eligible costs for services provided to the owner prior to July 1, 2001, and either (1) the registered contractor filed an application for reimbursement between December 1, 2001, and January 1, 2003, or (2) the owner, prior to May 1, 2003, filed a complaint with the commissioner regarding the failure of the registered contractor to file a timely application.\n\n(P.A. 99-269, S. 3, 6; P.A. 00-201, S. 6, 8; June Sp.

If at any time there is an amount remaining in one such category and if in such category there are no pending applications or applications for which payment or reimbursement has been ordered by the commissioner but has not been made, or if such category is for payment or reimbursement to mid-size station or large station applicants and the most recent reverse auction under subsection (c) of this section results in no payment to any such applicant or there is an amount remaining after taking into account all potential payments that could be made to any such applicants in said category, then such amount shall be redistributed for payment or reimbursement in the following order of priority: (i) First to municipal applicants and other applicants, (ii) if after redistribution pursuant to subclause (i) of this subdivision there is an amount remaining, then to small station applicants, (iii) if after redistribution pursuant to subclauses (i) and (ii) of this subdivision there is an amount remaining, then to mid-size station applicants, and (iv) if after redistribution pursuant to subclauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this subdivision there is an amount remaining, then to large station applicants.\n\n(2) The commissioner shall determine whether an applicant is a municipal applicant, small, mid-size or large station applicant or other applicant. Such determination shall be based on the applicant's status at the time the commissioner received the applicant's first application for payment or reimbursement. In making such determination, the commissioner shall include all affiliates of an applicant and shall consider any underground storage tank system owned, operated, leased or used by an applicant on the property of another to be an interest in a parcel of real property. The commissioner shall make one such determination per applicant. Such determination shall apply to all applications submitted by such applicant before, on or after June 15, 2012, including, but not limited to, applications for which payment or reimbursement has been ordered by the commissioner but has not been made. In the case of assignees under subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 22a-449c, for assignments made prior to July 1, 2012, the commissioner shall determine the assignee to be an other applicant and for assignments made on or after July 1, 2012, the assignee shall assume the status of the assignor. Each applicant shall submit information regarding whether it is a municipal applicant, small, mid-size or large station applicant or other applicant to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the commissioner, and shall provide any additional information the commissioner deems necessary to make such determination. The commissioner shall not order payment or reimbursement to an applicant until the commissioner makes the determination required under this subdivision for such applicant.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 22a-449a to 22a-449i, inclusive, payment or reimbursement to municipal applicants, small station applicants and other applicants shall be in accordance with this subsection and shall follow the order of priority set forth in this subsection. The provisions of this subsection shall apply to all applications submitted by such applicants before, on or after June 15, 2012, including, but not limited to, applications for which payment or reimbursement has been ordered by the commissioner but has not been made. Priority shall be given to those applications for which the commissioner has ordered payment or reimbursement beginning from the earliest date payment or reimbursement was ordered. If payment or reimbursement was ordered on the same day, priority shall be given to those applications that were received by the commissioner earliest. If there are insufficient funds to satisfy payment and reimbursement of municipal applicants, small station applicants and other applicants, the prioritization established pursuant to this subsection shall carry over to the subsequent fiscal quarter, and if necessary, from year to year.\n\n(c) (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 22a-449a to 22a-449i, inclusive, and any regulations adopted pursuant to section 22a-449e, payment or reimbursement to mid-size station applicants and large station applicants under the program shall be in accordance with this subsection and shall follow the order of priority set forth in this subsection.\n\n(2) The provisions of this subsection shall create a reverse auction system, and shall apply to all applications submitted by mid-size or large station applicants before, on or after June 15, 2012, including, but not limited to, applications for which payment or reimbursement has been ordered by the commissioner but has not been made. For purposes of this section, a payment election at or below the amount specified in subparagraph (A) or (B) of this subdivision shall be called the “reduced payment election”.\n\n(A) In the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2012, no payment shall be made to mid-size station applicants in excess of thirty-five cents on each dollar the commissioner orders to be paid or reimbursed under the program. In the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2013, and each fiscal year thereafter, such amount shall increase by ten cents on each dollar per fiscal year and in such years no payment or reimbursement shall be made in excess of the amount in effect for such fiscal year. After such amount reaches one dollar, it shall no longer increase. In addition, if a mid-size station applicant agrees, in writing, not to submit any applications seeking payment or reimbursement under the program on or after October 1, 2012, such applicant shall receive an additional ten cents on each dollar that would be paid to such applicant pursuant to this subdivision, provided such additional ten cents shall not be counted when determining such mid-sized station applicant's priority for payment pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection and shall not result in an applicant receiving more than one dollar on each dollar the commissioner orders to be paid or reimbursed under the program.\n\n(B) In the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2012, no payment shall be made to large station applicants in excess of twenty cents on each dollar the commissioner orders to be paid or reimbursed under the program. In the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2013, and each fiscal year thereafter, such amount shall increase by five cents per fiscal year and in such years no payment or reimbursement shall be made in excess of the amount in effect for such fiscal year. After such amount reaches one dollar, it shall no longer increase.\n\n(3) (A) Each mid-size station applicant and large station applicant shall submit a payment election to the commissioner. Such payment election shall indicate what, if any, reduced payment election the applicant accepts. Such payment election shall be submitted, on a form prescribed by the commissioner, between July first and August first, or such additional time periods prescribed by the commissioner, annually, unless:\n\n(i) Such applicant is submitting an application for the first time, in which case such applicant shall submit a payment election with such application; or\n\n(ii) Such applicant has submitted a reduced payment election, in which case, a subsequent payment election shall not be required, but may be submitted if an applicant agrees to accept a lower reduced payment election than was made in the previously submitted payment election.\n\n(B) An applicant's payment election, including a reduced payment election, shall apply to, and shall be the same for, all applications submitted by such applicant before, on or after June 15, 2012, including, but not limited to, applications for which payment or reimbursement has been ordered by the commissioner but has not been made. An applicant's payment election shall remain in effect regardless of when the commissioner orders payment or reimbursement for an application or when payment for an application is made. An applicant's payment election shall be final and shall not be modified unless an applicant subsequently agrees to a lower reduced payment election pursuant to subparagraph (A)(ii) of this subdivision.\n\n(C) An applicant's acceptance of payment or reimbursement in the amounts specified in such applicant's reduced payment election shall be considered final and full payment of all applications covered by such election and with the acceptance of such payment or reimbursement, an applicant agrees that it shall not seek any additional payment or reimbursement of any kind in any administrative or judicial proceeding for any cost, expense or other obligation associated with any such applications.\n\n(4) Among mid-size station applicants or among large station applicants, priority for payment or reimbursement shall be given to those applicants who, through the payment election process set forth in subdivision (3) of this subsection, agree to accept the greatest reduction in the amount ordered for payment or reimbursement by the commissioner under the program, provided such payment shall not exceed the amount set forth in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subdivision (2) of this subsection, as applicable. In the case where the reduced payment election is equal among two or more mid-size station applicants or among two or more large station applicants, priority shall be given to those applications for which the commissioner ordered payment or reimbursement, beginning from the earliest date payment or reimbursement was ordered. In the case where such reduced payment election is equal among applicants and the commissioner ordered payment or reimbursement on the same day, priority shall be given to those applications that were received by the commissioner earliest. Any mid-size or large station applicant that chooses not to make the reduced payment election shall receive payment when the amount specified in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subdivision (2) of this subsection, as applicable, reaches one dollar and there are no mid-size and large station applicants with applications for which the commissioner has ordered payment or reimbursement, and who made the reduced payment election, remaining to be paid. Among mid-size station applicants who choose not to make the reduced payment election or among large station applicants who choose not to make the reduced payment election, priority with respect to the issuance of payment or reimbursement shall be given to those applications for which the commissioner has ordered payment or reimbursement, beginning from the earliest date payment or reimbursement was ordered. If there are insufficient funds to satisfy payment and reimbursement of mid-size and large station applicants, the prioritization established pursuant to this subsection shall carry over to the subsequent fiscal quarter, and if necessary, from year to year, provided such prioritization may change based upon a subsequent reduced payment election submitted pursuant to subparagraph (A)(ii) of subdivision (3) of this subsection.\n\n(June 12 Sp.

A person claiming immunity under this subsection must establish that he is an innocent landowner by a preponderance of the evidence. In determining whether a person is an innocent landowner, a court may take into account any specialized knowledge or experience of the person, the relationship of the consideration paid for the interest in the real estate to the value of such interest if the real estate were not polluted, commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the real estate, the obviousness of the presence or likely presence of the spill or discharge and the ability to detect such spill or discharge by appropriate inspection.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section: (1) Any amount paid by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection pursuant to subsection (b) of section 22a-451 to contain, remove or mitigate the effects of the spill or discharge shall be a lien against the real estate, as provided by section 22a-452a, in an amount not to exceed the value of the land appraised as if it were uncontaminated; and (2) an innocent landowner who sells an interest in real estate that has been subjected to a spill or discharge shall be liable, to the extent of the net proceeds of such sale, for the costs of containing, removing or mitigating the effects of such spill or discharge. For the purposes of this subsection, “net proceeds” means proceeds received by the person after payment of the reasonable expenses of the sale.\n\n(c) The liability of a person holding a security interest in real estate who acquires title to the real estate by virtue of a foreclosure or tender of a deed in lieu of foreclosure shall be limited as provided in section 22a-452b.\n\n(d) This section shall apply to any spill or discharge which occurred before or after July 6, 1995, except that it shall not affect any enforcement or cost recovery action if such action has become final, and is no longer subject to appeal, prior to July 6, 1995.\n\n(P.A. 93-375, S. 2, 4; P.A. 95-190, S. 8, 17; 95-218, S. 17, 24; P.A. 11-80, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 93-375 effective June 30, 1993; P.A. 95-190 amended Subsec.

Such permit shall be in writing, shall contain such terms and conditions as the commissioner deems necessary and shall be valid for a fixed term not to exceed five years. No permit shall be granted, renewed or transferred unless the commissioner is satisfied that the activities of the permittee will not result in pollution, contamination, emergency or a violation of any regulation adopted under sections 22a-30, 22a-39, 22a-116, 22a-347, 22a-377, 22a-430, 22a-449, 22a-451 and 22a-462. The commissioner shall require payment of a fee of six hundred twenty-five dollars per year for each year covered by a permit to transport hazardous waste and the payment of a fee of fourteen thousand two hundred fifty dollars for a permit to treat waste oil or petroleum or chemical liquids. The commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to prescribe the amount of the fees required pursuant to this section. Upon the adoption of such regulations, the fees required by this section shall be as prescribed in such regulations. The commissioner may suspend or revoke a permit for violation of any term or condition of the permit, for conviction of a violation of section 22a-131a or for assessment of a fine under section 22a-131. The commissioner may conduct a program of study and research and demonstration, relating to new and improved methods of waste oil and petroleum or chemical liquids or waste solid, liquid or gaseous products or hazardous wastes disposal. For the purposes of this section, collecting, storing, or treating of waste oil, petroleum or chemical liquids or hazardous waste shall mean such activities when engaged in by a person whose principal business is the management of such wastes.\n\n(b) No person may dispose of any hazardous waste in a hazardous waste land disposal facility except the following: (1) Metal hydroxide sludge generated from the treatment of electroplating or metal finishing operation waste waters or any other metal hydroxide sludge approved by the commissioner; (2) hazardous waste sludge or residue resulting from an operation determined by the commissioner to be a recycling operation and which has received the required approvals from the commissioner and the Connecticut Siting Council, provided the commissioner determines that such residue cannot reasonably be incinerated or otherwise managed; and (3) hazardous waste spills, fly ash, residue from waste-to-energy facilities or municipal wastewater treatment sludge that has been determined to be hazardous waste but approved for such disposal by the commissioner. As used in this subsection, “hazardous waste” has the same meaning as in section 22a-115 and “hazardous waste land disposal facility” means a facility or part of a facility where hazardous waste is applied onto, placed within or beneath the soil surface and remains after closure of the facility. The prohibition established by this subsection shall not continue after July 1, 1991, unless renewed by the General Assembly. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, any restrictions on the land disposal of hazardous waste imposed by the commissioner pursuant to this subsection shall be as stringent as those imposed under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (42 USC 6901 et seq.), as amended.\n\n(c) No person shall engage in the business of the transfer of hazardous waste from one vehicle to another or from one mode of transportation to another without a permit from the commissioner issued under subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(d) The commissioner shall require the payment of the following fees for permits under this section: (1) Forty-five thousand two hundred fifty dollars to operate a hazardous waste landfill or incinerator; (2) twenty-one thousand two hundred fifty dollars to store or treat hazardous waste; (3) ten thousand seven hundred fifty dollars to engage in the transfer of hazardous waste as described in subsection (c) of this section if the hazardous waste is transferred from its original container to another container; and (4) four thousand dollars to engage in the transfer of hazardous waste as described in subsection (c) of this section if the hazardous waste remains in the original container. The commissioner shall also charge a fee of two hundred dollars for each hazardous waste treatment, disposal or storage facility which submits an application for a status change to a generator. The commissioner shall charge a fee of one hundred dollars for each hazardous waste large quantity generator which submits an application for status change to a small generator.\n\n(e) (1) The commissioner may issue a general permit for a category of activities which require a permit under subsection (a) of this section or license under subsection (b) of section 22a-449, except for an activity for which an individual permit has already been obtained provided the issuance of the general permit is not inconsistent with the requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Any person or municipality conducting an activity for which a general permit has been issued shall not be required to obtain an individual permit under subsection (a) of this section, except as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection. The general permit may regulate a category of activities which: (A) Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations; (B) involve the collection, storage, treatment or disposal of the same types of substances; (C) require the same operating conditions or standards; and (D) require the same or similar monitoring, and which in the opinion of the commissioner are more appropriately controlled under a general permit than under an individual permit. The general permit may require any person or municipality proposing to conduct any activity under the general permit to register such activity with the commissioner before it is covered by the general permit. Registration shall be on a form prescribed by the commissioner.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding any provisions of this section, or any regulations adopted thereunder, or of chapter 54, the following procedures shall apply to the issuance, renewal, modification, revocation or suspension of a general permit: (A) A general permit shall be issued for a term specified by the permit and shall clearly define the activity covered thereby and may include such conditions and requirements as the commissioner deems appropriate, including but not limited to operation and maintenance requirements, management practices, and reporting requirements; (B) the commissioner shall publish notice of intent to issue a general permit in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the affected area; (C) there shall be a comment period of thirty days following publication of such notice during which interested persons may submit written comments to the commissioner; (D) the commissioner shall publish notice of the issuance or decision not to issue a general permit in a newspaper having substantial circulation in the affected area. The commissioner may revoke, suspend or modify a general permit in accordance with the notice and comment procedures for issuance of a general permit specified in this subsection. Any person may request that the commissioner issue, modify, suspend or revoke a general permit in accordance with this subsection; and (E) summary suspension may be ordered in accordance with subsection (c) of section 4-182.\n\n(3) Subsequent to the issuance of a general permit, the commissioner may require any person or municipality whose activity is or may be covered by the general permit to apply for and obtain an individual permit pursuant to subsection (a) of this section if he determines that an individual permit would better protect the land, air and waters of the state from pollution. The commissioner may require an individual permit under this subdivision in cases including, but not limited to the following: (A) When the owner or operator is not in compliance with the conditions of the general permit; (B) when a change has occurred in the availability of demonstrated technology or practices for the control or abatement of pollution applicable to the activity; (C) when circumstances have changed since the time of the issuance of the general permit so that the activity is no longer appropriately controlled under the general permit, or either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized activity is necessary; or (D) when a relevant change has occurred in the applicability of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. In making the determination to require an individual permit, the commissioner may consider the location, character, and size of the activity, and any other relevant factors. The commissioner may require an individual permit under this subdivision only if the affected person or municipality covered by the general permit has been notified in writing that a permit application is required. This notice shall include a brief statement of the reasons for this decision, an application form, a statement setting a time for the person or municipality to file the application, and a statement that on the effective date of the individual permit the general permit as it applies to the individual permittee shall automatically terminate. The commissioner may grant an extension of time upon the request of the applicant. If the affected person or municipality does not submit a complete application for an individual permit within the time frame set forth in the commissioner's notice or as extended by the commissioner in writing, then the general permit as it applies to the affected person or municipality shall automatically terminate. The applicant shall use his best efforts to obtain the individual permit.

      "text": "Whenever a municipality obtains a grant under this chapter for the construction, rebuilding, expansion or acquisition of sewers or other pollution abatement facilities and where the carrying out of such construction, rebuilding, expansion or acquisition requires the temporary or permanent readjustment, relocation or removal of a public service facility from a street or public right-of-way, the municipality shall issue an appropriate order to the company owning or operating such facility and such company shall permanently or temporarily readjust, relocate or remove such facility promptly in accordance with such order, provided an equitable share of the cost of such readjustment, relocation or removal of said public service facility, including the cost of installing and constructing a facility equal in capacity in a new location, shall be borne by the municipality. Such equitable share shall be one hundred per cent of such cost after the deductions hereinafter provided. In establishing the equitable share of the cost to be borne by the municipality, there shall be deducted from the cost of the readjusted, relocated or removed facilities a sum based on a consideration of the value of materials salvaged from existing installations, the cost of the original installation, the life expectancy of the original facility and the unexpired term of such useful life. For the purposes of determining the equitable share of the cost of such readjustment, relocation or removal, the books and records of the company shall be available for the inspection of the municipality. When any facility is removed from a street or public right-of-way to a private right-of-way, the municipality shall not pay for such right-of-way. If the municipality and the company owning or operating such facility cannot agree upon the share of the cost to be borne by the municipality, either may apply to the superior court for the judicial district in which the street or public right-of-way is situated or, if the court is not in session, to any judge thereof for a determination of the cost to be borne by the municipality, and such court or judge after causing notice of the pendency of such application to be given to the other party, shall appoint a state referee to make such determination. Such referee, having given at least ten days' notice to the parties interested of the time and place of the hearing, shall hear both parties, shall take such testimony as such referee may deem material and shall thereupon determine the amount of the cost to be borne by the municipality and forthwith report to the court. If the report is accepted by the court, such determination shall, subject to right of appeal as in civil actions, be conclusive upon such parties. As used in this section, “public service facility” includes any sewer, pipe, main, conduit, cable, wire, tower, building or a utility appliance owned or operated by an electric distribution, gas, telephone, water or community antenna television service company.\n\n(P.A. 79-526, S. 1, 2; P.A. 14-134, S. 34.)\n\nHistory: Sec. 25-54yy transferred to Sec. 22a-470 in 1983; P.A. 14-134 replaced reference to electric company with reference to electric distribution company and deleted reference to telegraph company, effective June 6, 2014.\n\n“Equitable share” discussed. 206 C. 65.",

      "heading": "Pollution of groundwaters. Orders to provide potable drinking water",
      "text": "(a)(1) If the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection determines that pollution of the groundwaters has occurred or can reasonably be expected to occur and the Commissioner of Public Health determines that the extent of pollution creates or can reasonably be expected to create an unacceptable risk of injury to the health or safety of persons using such groundwaters as a public or private source of water for drinking or other personal or domestic uses, the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection may issue an order to the person or municipality responsible for such pollution requiring that potable drinking water be provided to all persons affected by such pollution. In determining if pollution creates an unacceptable risk of injury, the Commissioner of Public Health shall balance all relevant and substantive facts and inferences and shall not be limited to a consideration of available statistical analysis but shall consider all of the evidence presented and any factor related to human health risks. If the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection finds that more than one person or municipality is responsible for such pollution, the commissioner shall attempt to apportion responsibility if the commissioner determines that apportionment is appropriate. If the commissioner does not apportion responsibility, all persons and municipalities responsible for the pollution of the groundwaters shall be jointly and severally responsible for the providing of potable drinking water to persons affected by such pollution. If the commissioner determines that the state or an agency or department of the state is responsible in whole or in part for the pollution of the groundwaters, such agency or department shall prepare or arrange for the preparation of an engineering report and shall provide or arrange for the provision of a long-term potable drinking water supply. If the commissioner is unable to determine the person or municipality responsible or if the commissioner determines that the responsible persons have no assets other than land, buildings, business machinery or livestock and are unable to secure a loan at a reasonable rate of interest to provide potable drinking water, the commissioner may prepare or arrange for the preparation of an engineering report and provide or arrange for the provision of a long-term potable drinking water supply or the commissioner may issue an order to the municipality wherein groundwaters unusable for potable drinking water are located requiring that short-term provision of potable drinking water be made to those existing residential buildings and elementary and secondary schools affected by such pollution and that long-term provision of potable drinking water be made to all persons affected by such pollution. For purposes of this section, “residential building” means any house, apartment, trailer, mobile manufactured home or other structure occupied by individuals as a dwelling, except a non-owner-occupied hotel or motel or a correctional institution.\n\n(2) Any order issued pursuant to this section may require the provision of potable drinking water in such quantities as the commissioner determines are necessary for drinking and other personal and domestic uses and may require the maintenance and monitoring of potable water supply facilities for any period which the commissioner determines is necessary. In making such determinations, the commissioner shall consider the short-term and long-term needs for potable drinking water and the health and safety of those persons whose water supply is unusable. Any order may require the submission of an engineering report which shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner and the Commissioner of Public Health and include, but not be limited to, a description in detail of the problem, area and population affected by pollution of the groundwaters; the expected duration of and extent of the pollution; alternate solutions including relative cost of construction or installation, operation and maintenance; design criteria on all alternate solutions; and any other information which the commissioner deems necessary. Upon review of such report, the commissioner and the Commissioner of Public Health shall consider the nature of the pollution, the expected duration and extent of the pollution, the health and safety of the persons affected, the initial and ongoing cost-effectiveness and reliability of each alternative and any other factors which they deem relevant, and shall approve a system or method to provide potable drinking water pursuant to the order. Each order shall include a time schedule for the accomplishment of the steps leading to the provision of potable drinking water. Notwithstanding the fact that a responsible party has been or may be identified or a request for a hearing on or a pending appeal from an order issued pursuant to this section, when pollution of the groundwaters has occurred or may reasonably be expected to occur, the commissioner may prepare or arrange for the preparation of an engineering report as described in this subdivision and may provide or arrange for the provision of a long-term potable drinking water supply. In any case where the state or an agency or department of the state is responsible in whole or in part for the pollution of the groundwaters, such agency or department shall prepare or arrange for the preparation of an engineering report and shall provide or arrange for the provision of a long-term potable drinking water supply, and if the state is not the sole responsible party, the commissioner shall seek reimbursement under subdivision (4) of subsection (b) of this section for the costs of such report and for the provision of potable water. The cost of the report and of the provision of a long-term potable drinking water supply, as funds allow, shall be paid from the proceeds of any bonds authorized for the provision of potable drinking water.\n\n(3) The provisions of this section shall not affect the rights of any municipality to institute suit to recover all damages, expenses and costs incurred by the municipality from any responsible party, including, but not limited to, the costs specified in subparagraph (B)(i) and (ii) of subdivision (4) of subsection (b) of this section and, in the case of any municipality which is not responsible for the pollution of the groundwaters, the additional amounts specified in subparagraph (B)(iii) and (iv) of subdivision (4) of subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(4) No provision of this section shall limit the liability of any person who or municipality which renders the groundwaters unusable for potable drinking water from a suit for damages by a person who or municipality which relied on said groundwaters for potable drinking water prior to the determination by the commissioner that the groundwaters are polluted.\n\n(5) The commissioner may issue any order pursuant to this section if the pollution of the groundwaters occurred before or after July 1, 1982.\n\n(6) The commissioner may at any time require further action by any person to whom or municipality to which an order is issued pursuant to this section if the commissioner determines that such action is necessary to protect the health and safety of those persons whose water supply was rendered unusable.\n\n(b) (1) (A) Any municipality not responsible for the pollution of the groundwaters that is ordered to provide potable drinking water in accordance with subsection (a) of this section may apply to the commissioner for a grant as provided by this subsection. Except as provided in subparagraph (C) of subdivision (1) of this subsection and in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the commissioner shall make grants for the short-term provision of potable drinking water and the construction or installation of individual wells or individual water treatment systems, including, but not limited to, carbon absorption filters and shall make grants for other capital improvements for the long-term provision of potable drinking water from any bond authorization established for that purpose.\n\n(B) The amount distributed to a municipality shall, as funds allow, equal one hundred per cent of the cost of short-term provision of potable drinking water, one hundred per cent of the cost of the engineering report required by this section, one hundred per cent of the cost of capital improvements for the most cost-effective long-term method of providing potable drinking water as determined by the commissioner and the Commissioner of Public Health upon consideration of such engineering report, and one hundred per cent of the cost during the first five years of installation of monitoring and maintaining individual water treatment systems and monitoring drinking water wells located in an area where the commissioner determines that pollution of the groundwater is reasonably likely to occur. No state funds shall be distributed to a municipality for the cost of operating or maintaining any potable water supply facilities other than as specified in this subsection.\n\n(C) Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection to the contrary, the commissioner may advance to a municipality, from the proceeds of any bonds authorized for the provision of potable drinking water, any percentage of the cost of short-term and long-term provision of potable drinking water that the commissioner deems necessary.\n\n(2) (A) If the commissioner is unable to determine the person or municipality responsible for rendering the groundwaters unusable for potable drinking water or if the commissioner determines that the responsible persons have no assets other than land, buildings, business machinery or livestock and are unable to secure a loan at a reasonable rate of interest to provide potable drinking water, a water company that has less than ten thousand customers and that owns, maintains, operates, manages, controls or employs a water supply well that is rendered unusable for potable drinking water, may apply to the commissioner for a grant from funds established pursuant to section 22a-451 or from the proceeds of any bonds authorized for the provision of potable drinking water. If, upon review of the engineering report required by this subsection to be submitted with an application for such a grant, the commissioner determines that a grant to a water company from available appropriations or from the proceeds of any bonds authorized for the provision of potable drinking water is appropriate, the commissioner may make such a grant in accordance with regulations adopted by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.\n\n(B) The total amount distributed to a water company pursuant to this subsection shall, as funds allow, equal fifty per cent of the cost of the engineering report required by this subsection and fifty per cent of the cost of the most cost-effective long-term method of rendering the water supply in question usable for potable drinking water, as determined by the commissioner and the Commissioner of Public Health upon consideration of the required engineering report.\n\n(C) For purposes of this section, “water company” and “customer” have the same meanings as provided in section 25-32a.\n\n(D) Any water company applying for a grant pursuant to this section shall prepare or have prepared an engineering report that shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner and the Commissioner of Public Health and include, but not be limited to, a description in detail of the problem, area and population affected by pollution of the groundwaters; alternate solutions including relative cost of construction or installation, operation and maintenance; design criteria on all alternate solutions and any other information the commissioner deems necessary.\n\n(3) (A) If a municipality or water company receives funding from a private source, a federal grant or another state grant for any cost for which a grant may be awarded pursuant to this section, the grant under this section shall equal the specified percentage of the costs specified in this subsection minus the amount of the other funding.\n\n(B) If a municipality or water company receives a grant under this section and is compensated by a person who or municipality that is responsible for rendering the groundwaters unusable for potable drinking water, the municipality or water company shall reimburse the account from which the funds were made available for the grant as follows: If the compensation from the responsible party equals or exceeds the costs toward which the grant was to be applied, the municipality or water company shall reimburse the total amount of the grant; if the compensation is less than the cost toward which the grant was to be applied, the municipality or water company shall reimburse a percentage of the compensation equal to the percentage of such costs paid by the grant.\n\n(4) (A) Notwithstanding any request for a hearing or a pending appeal therefrom, if a person or municipality responsible for pollution of the groundwaters fails to comply with an order of the commissioner issued pursuant to this section, the municipality wherein such pollution is located may, after giving written notice of its intent to the commissioner and the responsible person or municipality, undertake the actions required by the order and seek reimbursement for the cost of such actions from the responsible person or municipality. If at any time after receipt of such a notice, the responsible party intends to comply with a step of the order that the municipality has not yet completed, the responsible party may do so with the written approval of the commissioner and municipality, provided the actions that the responsible party takes are consistent with those taken by the municipality.\n\n(B) The commissioner may order any person or municipality responsible for pollution of the groundwaters to reimburse the state, a water company, and any municipality that is not responsible for pollution but received an order pursuant to this section or that did not receive such an order but voluntarily provided potable drinking water, for (i) the expenses each incurred in providing potable drinking water to any person affected by such pollution, provided the required reimbursement for such expenses shall not exceed the actual cost of short-term provision of potable drinking water and an amount equal to the reasonable cost of planning and implementing the most cost-effective long-term method of providing potable drinking water as determined by the commissioner and the Commissioner of Public Health; (ii) costs for recovering such reimbursement; (iii) interest on the expenses specified in (i) at a rate of ten per cent a year from the date such expenses were paid; and (iv) reasonable attorney's fees. The commissioner may request the Attorney General to bring a civil action to recover any costs or expenses incurred by the commissioner pursuant to this subsection provided no such action may be brought later than ten years after the date of discovery of the pollution of public or private sources of water for drinking or other personal or domestic use.\n\n(C) If a municipality fails to recover all expenses specified in subparagraph (B)(i) of subdivision (4) of this subsection from the responsible party, the municipality may apply to the commissioner for a grant in accordance with this subsection, provided the total amount of funds received from the commissioner and the responsible party shall not exceed the amounts specified in subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(5) For purposes of this section except subdivision (3) of subsection (a) and subparagraph (B)(ii) of subdivision (4) of this subsection, “cost” includes only those costs that the commissioner determines are necessary and reasonable, including, but not limited to, the cost of plans and specifications, construction or installation and supervision thereof.\n\n(6) If any grant application is pending on June 7, 1994, and is approved by the commissioner, the percentage of costs to be paid by the grant shall be determined in accordance with this section. Any order pending on May 31, 1985, shall be construed in accordance with this section.\n\n(7) Any person who or municipality that provides potable drinking water pursuant to this section may, with the approval of the commissioner, construct or install facilities beyond the areas included in the order or facilities that are more costly than those that are determined to be most cost-effective, provided any request for a grant or reimbursement shall be limited to the amounts specified in this section.\n\n(8) Notwithstanding any provision of this section and the cost-sharing formula established in section 22a-471-1 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, for any area of a municipality that is adjacent to a federal Superfund site where there is a water line extension component to such project and the federal government is providing fire flow capacity while such water is groundwater supplied by a municipal water company, the minimum size water main required to address pollution may be upgraded in order to carry fire flow and the municipality shall only be responsible to pay the incremental project cost.\n\n(9) Notwithstanding any provision of this section and the cost-sharing formula established in section 22a-471-1 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, for any area of a municipality that is adjacent to a site listed on the State of Connecticut Superfund Priority List where a water line extension component to such project has been installed by a municipal or private water company, the minimum size water main required to address pollution may be upgraded in order to carry fire flow or address public water supply needs that are consistent with an adopted municipal plan of conservation and development and the municipality shall only be responsible to pay the incremental project cost, which may be funded by such water company, another person or available local, state or federal funds.\n\n(c) Any order issued under the provisions of this section shall be subject to the rights of any aggrieved person or municipality to a hearing before the commissioner as provided in section 22a-436, and appeal from the final determination of the commissioner to the Superior Court as provided in section 22a-437. The request for a hearing or pending appeal therefrom shall not constitute a condition which shall stay the commissioner from requesting that an injunction under the provisions of section 22a-6 or 22a-435, or a civil action to recover a forfeiture under the provisions of section 22a-438, be initiated by the Attorney General. The court shall issue an injunction requiring the recipient of the order to take the steps required by the order for short-term and long-term provision of potable drinking water unless such court determines that the issuance of the order was arbitrary. Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, a court shall not grant a stay from any order issued pursuant to this section on the grounds that an administrative appeal is pending. If it is thereafter determined by the Superior Court as the result of an appeal under the provisions of section 22a-437 that the commissioner acted arbitrarily, unreasonably or contrary to law in requiring a person or municipality to comply with an order the commissioner shall reimburse the person or municipality for the total costs which have been incurred from the funds established under section 22a-446.\n\n(d) The commissioner shall not issue an order to any person pursuant to this section if the sole basis for the order is that such person is the owner of the land from which the source of pollution or potential source of pollution emanates.\n\n(e) The commissioner may, in accordance with chapter 54, adopt such regulations as the commissioner deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, and shall adopt regulations for the provision of grants pursuant to this section which shall include criteria for eligibility for funds.\n\n(f) (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, if the commissioner determines that a person whose actions have caused or can reasonably be expected to cause pollution of the groundwaters by the application of a pesticide (A) has properly applied the pesticide or arranged for a pesticide application which was properly performed, (B) was engaged in agriculture at the time the pesticide was applied and used the pesticide solely in the production of agricultural commodities, (C) has agreed to implement the plans specified in subdivision (2) of this subsection, and (D) maintained the records of the application of the pesticide as required by section 22a-58 and the records and plan identified in section 22a-471a, the commissioner shall not issue an order under subsection (a) of this section to the person engaged in agriculture, but may issue an order under said subsection (a) to another responsible person, including, but not limited to, the producer of the pesticide, requiring the short-term and long-term provision of potable drinking water in accordance with said subsection (a). The commissioner shall not issue an order under said subsection (a) to a person engaged in agriculture who did not maintain the records identified under section 22a-471a if said commissioner finds such records are not relevant to a determination of the party responsible for pollution of the groundwaters. If the commissioner is unable to determine the responsible person, the commissioner may issue such order to the municipality wherein groundwaters unusable for potable drinking water are located.\n\n(2) If the commissioner determines that a person engaged in agriculture has caused or can reasonably be expected to cause pollution of the groundwaters by pesticides, the commissioner may cause such person to submit to the commissioner and, upon approval by the commissioner, implement a plan to minimize the potential for groundwater contamination from the storage, handling and disposal of pesticides at the locations where such person engaged in agriculture.\n\n(3) For the purposes of this subsection, a pesticide is properly applied if at the time of the application the pesticide was licensed by or registered with the state and federal government and was applied in a manner consistent with (A) the labeling of the pesticide, as defined in section 22a-47, (B) applicable state and federal statutes and regulations at the time of the application, (C) any approvals or recommendations of the federal, state or local government, including any limitations, warnings or conditions of such approvals or recommendations, and (D) generally accepted agricultural management practices at the time of application, considering any special geological, hydrological or soil conditions of which the farmer was aware or reasonably should have been aware.\n\n(4) Any municipality which receives an order pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be eligible for a grant from the state in accordance with subparagraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(5) The provisions of this subsection shall apply to pollution of the groundwaters by pesticides discovered on or after May 26, 1988. All orders issued pursuant to this section by the commissioner prior to May 26, 1988, shall remain in effect unless the orders are otherwise revoked, amended or modified by said commissioner.\n\n(6) Nothing in this subsection, section 22a-471a or section 22a-471b shall affect or limit any right of action of an individual against any person engaged in agriculture for injury to person or property resulting from the use of a pesticide.\n\n(7) For purposes of this subsection, “pesticide” has the same meaning as provided in section 22a-47.\n\n(P.A. 82-240, S. 1, 3; June Sp.

      "text": "It is hereby found and declared that the establishment of a municipal water quality financial assistance program to provide funds for grants for projects to improve Long Island Sound and to establish a low interest revolving loan fund and grant assistance fund to finance one hundred per cent of eligible project costs is necessary to ensure a continuing source of funds to finance the future needs of the state and is a matter of state-wide concern affecting the health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the state and the quality of the environment of the state, including the purity and adequacy of its drinking water, and that the establishment of such a program to encourage and support the planning, development and construction of water pollution control facilities and of necessary improvements to eligible public water systems serves an essential public purpose. It is further found and declared that, since the federal Water Quality Act of 1987 restructures the federal grant program for municipal water pollution control projects as a program in which grant proceeds must be used to provide financial assistance in a manner which promotes preservation of the corpus of such proceeds for continuing reapplication to the purposes for which the grants were provided, since financial assistance for municipal water pollution control projects can be more effectively provided through state participation in the federal program of capitalization grants to states as set forth in Section 212 of said act and compliance with requirements for eligibility to receive capitalization grants under such program, and since the act also permits states to use a revolving fund and its chief assets as a basis for issuing bonds for further revolving fund activity, and under such an arrangement a state is able to leverage outstanding loans made from an initial set of capitalization grants and make available significant amounts of money much sooner than would otherwise have been possible, it is in the interests of the state to make use of this mechanism. It is further found and declared that the federal government intends to establish a similar revolving fund program, funded in part with federal capitalization grants, which may be established and operated by states as part of the Clean Water Fund program, in order to provide financial assistance to develop and implement drinking water projects, and that therefore it is in the interests of the state to participate in such program. It is further found and declared that it is in the best interests of the state to plan to authorize, in addition to any other funds contemplated, the following amounts for the Long Island Sound clean-up account: Not less than five million dollars in 1991, not less than sixteen million dollars in 1992, not less than twenty million dollars in 1993, not less than sixteen million dollars in 1994, not less than twelve million dollars in 1995, not less than thirty-four million dollars in 1996, and not less than seven million dollars in 1997.\n\n(P.A. 86-420, S. 2, 12; P.A. 87-571, S. 2, 7; P.A. 89-377, S. 2, 8; June Sp.

Sess. P.A. 90-1 added the listing of planned bond authorizations for the Long Island Sound clean-up account; P.A. 96-181 made additions re the purity and adequacy of drinking water and federal revolving fund program and made technical changes, effective July 1, 1996.",

      "text": "(a) A municipality may authorize and approve (1) the execution and delivery of project funding agreements, and (2) the issuance and sale of project obligations, grant account loan obligations and interim funding obligations, in accordance with such statutory and charter requirements as govern the authorization and approval of borrowings and the making of contracts generally by the municipality or in accordance with the provisions of subsection (e) of this section. Project loan obligations, grant account loan obligations and interim funding obligations shall be duly executed and accompanied by an approving legal opinion of bond counsel of recognized standing in the field of municipal law whose opinions are generally accepted by purchasers of municipal bonds and shall be subject to the debt limitation provisions of section 7-374; except that project loan obligations, grant account loan obligations and interim funding obligations issued in order to meet the requirements of any abatement order of the commissioner shall not be subject to the debt limitation provisions of section 7-374, provided the municipality files a certificate, signed by its chief fiscal officer, with the commissioner demonstrating to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the municipality has a plan for levying a system of charges, assessments or other revenues which are sufficient, together with other available funds of the municipality, to repay such obligations as the same become due and payable.\n\n(b) Each recipient which enters into a project funding agreement shall protect, defend and hold harmless the state, its agencies, departments, agents and employees from and against any and all claims, suits, actions, demands, costs and damages arising from or in connection with the performance or nonperformance by the recipient, or any of its officers, employees or agents, of the recipient's obligations under any project funding agreement as such project funding agreement may be amended or supplemented from time to time. Each such recipient may insure against the liability imposed by this subsection through any insurance company organized within or without this state authorized to write such insurance in this state or may elect to act as self-insurer of such liability, provided such indemnity shall not be limited by any such insurance coverage.\n\n(c) Whenever a recipient has entered into a project funding agreement and has authorized the issuance of project loan obligations or grant account loan obligations, it may authorize the issuance of interim funding obligations. Proceeds from the issuance and sale of interim funding obligations shall be used to temporarily finance an eligible project pending receipt of the proceeds of a project loan obligation, a grant account loan obligation or project grant. Such interim funding obligations may be issued and sold to the state for the benefit of the Clean Water Fund or issued and sold to any other lender on such terms and in such manner as shall be determined by a recipient. Such interim funding obligations may be renewed from time to time by the issuance of other notes, provided the final maturity of such notes shall not exceed six months from the date of completion of the planning and design phase or the construction phase, as applicable, of an eligible project, as determined by the commissioner or, if the project is an eligible drinking water project, by the Commissioner of Public Health. Such notes and any renewals of a municipality shall not be subject to the requirements and limitations set forth in sections 7-378, 7-378a and 7-264. The provisions of section 7-374 shall apply to such notes and any renewals thereof of a municipality; except that project loan obligations, grant account loan obligations and interim funding obligations issued in order to meet the requirements of an abatement order of the commissioner shall not be subject to the debt limitation provisions of section 7-374, provided the municipality files a certificate, signed by its chief fiscal officer, with the commissioner demonstrating to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the municipality has a plan for levying a system of charges, assessments or other revenues sufficient, together with other available funds of the municipality, to repay such obligations as the same become due and payable. The officer or agency authorized by law or by vote of the recipient to issue such interim funding obligations shall, within any limitation imposed by such law or vote, determine the date, maturity, interest rate, form, manner of sale and other details of such obligations. Such obligations may bear interest or be sold at a discount and the interest or discount on such obligations, including renewals thereof, and the expense of preparing, issuing and marketing them may be included as a part of the cost of an eligible project. Upon the issuance of a project loan obligation or grant account loan obligation, the proceeds thereof, to the extent required, shall be applied forthwith to the payment of the principal of and interest on all interim funding obligations issued in anticipation thereof and upon receipt of a project grant, the proceeds thereof, to the extent required, shall be applied forthwith to the payment of the principal of and interest on all grant anticipation notes issued in anticipation thereof or, in either case, shall be deposited in trust for such purpose with a bank or trust company, which may be the bank or trust company, if any, at which such obligations are payable.\n\n(d) Project loan obligations, grant account loan obligations, interim funding obligations or any obligation of a municipality that satisfies the requirements of Title VI of the federal Water Pollution Control Act or the federal Safe Drinking Water Act or other related federal act may, as determined by the commissioner or, if the project is an eligible drinking water project, by the Commissioner of Public Health, be general obligations of the issuing municipality and in such case each such obligation shall recite that the full faith and credit of the issuing municipality are pledged for the payment of the principal thereof and interest thereon. To the extent a municipality is authorized pursuant to sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, to issue project loan obligations or interim funding obligations, such obligations may be secured by a pledge of revenues and other funds derived from its sewer system or public water supply system, as applicable. Each pledge and agreement made for the benefit or security of any of such obligations shall be in effect until the principal of, and interest on, such obligations have been fully paid, or until provision has been made for payment in the manner provided in the resolution authorizing their issuance or in the agreement for the benefit of the holders of such obligations. In any such case, such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when such pledge is made. Any revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the municipality shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the municipality, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the project loan obligation, interim funding obligation, project funding agreement nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded. All securities or other investments of moneys of the state permitted or provided for under sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, may, upon the determination of the State Treasurer, be purchased and held in fully marketable form, subject to provision for any registration in the name of the state. Securities or other investments at any time purchased, held or owned by the state may, upon the determination of the State Treasurer and upon delivery to the state, be accompanied by such documentation, including approving bond opinion, certification and guaranty as to signatures and certification as to absence of litigation, and such other or further documentation as shall from time to time be required in the municipal bond market or required by the state.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of the general statutes, any special act or any municipal charter governing the authorization of bonds, notes or obligations or the appropriation of funds, or governing the application for, and expenditure of, grants or loans, or governing the authorization of contracts or financing agreements or governing the pledging of sewer or water revenues or funds, a municipality may, by resolution approved by its legislative body and by (1) its water pollution control authority or sewer authority, if any, authorize a project loan and project grant agreement between the municipality and the state pursuant to sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, and appropriate funds and authorize project loan obligations and interim funding obligations of the municipality paid and secured solely by a pledge of revenues, funds and moneys of the municipality and the water pollution control authority or sewer authority, if any, derived from its sewer system, to pay for and finance the total project costs of an eligible water quality project, pursuant to a project loan and project grant agreement between the municipality and the state pursuant to sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, or (2) by its water authority, if any, authorize a project loan and project grant agreement between the municipality and the state pursuant to sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, and appropriate funds and authorize project loan obligations and interim funding obligations of the municipality paid and secured solely by a pledge of revenues, funds and moneys of the municipality and the water authority, if any, derived from its public water supply system, to pay for and finance the total project costs of an eligible water quality project, pursuant to a project loan agreement between the municipality and the state pursuant to sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive. The provisions of chapter 103 shall apply to the obligations authorized by this section, to the extent such section is not inconsistent with this subsection. A project loan and project grant agreement authorized by such resolution may contain covenants and agreements with respect to, and may pledge the revenues, funds and moneys derived from, the sewer system or public water system to secure such project loan obligations and interim funding obligations, including, but not limited to, covenants and agreements with respect to holding or depositing such revenues, funds and moneys in separate accounts and agreements described in section 7-266. As used in this subsection, “legislative body” means (A) the board of selectmen in a town that does not have a charter, special act or home rule ordinance relating to its government, (B) the council, board of aldermen, representative town meeting, board of selectmen or other elected legislative body described in a charter, special act or home rule ordinance relating to government in a city, consolidated town and city, consolidated town and borough or a town having a charter, special act, consolidation ordinance or home rule ordinance relating to its government, (C) the board of burgesses or other elected legislative body in a borough, or (D) the district committee or other elected legislative body in a district, metropolitan district or other municipal corporation.\n\n(f) Any recipient which is not a municipality shall execute and deliver project loan obligations and interim financing obligations in accordance with applicable law and in such form and with such requirements as may be determined by the commissioner or by the Commissioner of Public Health if the project is an eligible drinking water project. The Commissioner of Public Health and the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority as required by section 16-19e shall review and approve all costs that are necessary and reasonable prior to the award of the project funding agreement with respect to an eligible drinking water project. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, where appropriate, shall include these costs in the recipient's rate structure in accordance with section 16-19e.\n\n(P.A. 86-420, S. 5, 12; P.A. 87-571, S. 5, 7; P.A. 89-377, S. 5, 8; June Sp.

      "text": "(a) For the purposes of sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, the State Bond Commission shall have the power, from time to time to authorize the issuance of bonds of the state in one or more series and in principal amounts, not exceeding in the aggregate two billion one hundred forty-five million one hundred twenty-five thousand nine hundred seventy-six dollars, provided forty million dollars of said authorization shall be effective July 1, 2024.\n\n(b) The proceeds of the sale of any bonds, state bond anticipation notes or state grant anticipation notes issued pursuant to sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, shall be deposited in the Clean Water Fund and not less than fifty million dollars of such proceeds shall be deposited in the Long Island Sound clean-up account of said fund.\n\n(c) All provisions of section 3-20, or the exercise of any right or power granted thereby which are not inconsistent with the provisions of sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, are hereby adopted and shall apply to all bonds authorized by the State Bond Commission pursuant to said sections, and temporary notes in anticipation of the money to be derived from the sale of any such bonds so authorized may be issued in accordance with said section 3-20 and from time to time renewed. None of said bonds shall be authorized except upon a finding by the State Bond Commission that there has been filed with it a request for such authorization, which is signed by or on behalf of the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and states such terms and conditions as said commission, in its discretion, may require. Said bonds issued pursuant to sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, may be general obligations of the state and in such case the full faith and credit of the state of Connecticut are pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on said bonds as the same become due, and accordingly and as part of the contract of the state with the holders of said bonds, appropriation of all amounts necessary for punctual payment of such principal and interest is hereby made, and the Treasurer shall pay such principal and interest as the same become due. Such general obligation bonds shall mature at such time or times not exceeding twenty years from their respective dates as may be provided in or pursuant to the resolution or resolutions of the State Bond Commission authorizing such general obligation bonds. The state, acting by and through the State Bond Commission, is hereby authorized to issue from time to time general obligation bonds in such sums as is appropriate and necessary to meet the state's matching requirement for eligibility pursuant to the federal Water Quality Act of 1987 or the federal Safe Drinking Water Act or other similar federal act, provided such sums shall not exceed the aggregate principal amounts of bonds authorized pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. Whenever such bonds are so authorized, the state's obligations shall be issued on such terms and conditions as shall be determined and established by the Treasurer. Such bonds shall bear such rate of interest as the treasurer shall determine, by reference to such open market indices for obligations having similar terms and characteristics as the Treasurer shall determine relevant, in order to arrive at a taxable rate of interest on the obligations of the state issued and sold to the Clean Water Fund. The Treasurer shall deliver such bonds to the Clean Water Fund upon the receipt of evidence from the Environmental Protection Agency evidencing satisfaction by the state of its federal matching requirement pursuant to the federal Water Quality Act of 1987 or the federal Safe Drinking Water Act or other similar federal act.\n\n*(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude the State Bond Commission from authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds, in principal amounts not exceeding in the aggregate four billion four hundred eighty-six million eighty thousand dollars, provided two hundred thirty-seven million dollars of said authorization shall be effective July 1, 2022, that are not general obligations of the state of Connecticut to which the full faith and credit of the state of Connecticut are pledged for the payment of the principal and interest. Such revenue bonds shall mature at such time or times not exceeding thirty years from their respective dates as may be provided in or pursuant to the resolution or resolutions of the State Bond Commission authorizing such revenue bonds. The revenue bonds, revenue state bond anticipation notes and revenue state grant anticipation notes authorized to be issued under sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, shall be special obligations of the state and shall not be payable from nor charged upon any funds other than the revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged therefor as provided in said sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, including the repayment of municipal loan obligations; nor shall the state or any political subdivision thereof be subject to any liability thereon except to the extent of such pledged revenues or the receipts, funds or moneys pledged therefor as provided in said sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive. The issuance of revenue bonds, revenue state bond anticipation notes and revenue state grant anticipation notes under the provisions of said sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the state or any political subdivision thereof to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment. The revenue bonds, revenue state bond anticipation notes and revenue state grant anticipation notes shall not constitute a charge, lien or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the state or of any political subdivision thereof, except the property mortgaged or otherwise encumbered under the provisions and for the purposes of said sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive. The substance of such limitation shall be plainly stated on the face of each revenue bond, revenue state bond anticipation note and revenue state grant anticipation note issued pursuant to said sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, shall not be subject to any statutory limitation on the indebtedness of the state and such revenue bonds, revenue state bond anticipation notes and revenue state grant anticipation notes, when issued, shall not be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of the state in respect to and to the extent of any such limitation. As part of the contract of the state with the owners of such revenue bonds, revenue state bond anticipation notes and revenue state grant anticipation notes, all amounts necessary for the punctual payment of the debt service requirements with respect to such revenue bonds, revenue state bond anticipation notes and revenue state grant anticipation notes shall be deemed appropriated, but only from the sources pledged pursuant to said sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive. The proceeds of such revenue bonds or notes may be deposited in the Clean Water Fund for use in accordance with the permitted uses of such fund. Any expense incurred in connection with the carrying out of the provisions of this section, including the costs of issuance of revenue bonds, revenue state bond anticipation notes and revenue state grant anticipation notes may be paid from the accrued interest and premiums or from any other proceeds of the sale of such revenue bonds, revenue state bond anticipation notes or revenue state grant anticipation notes and in the same manner as other obligations of the state. All provisions of subsections (g), (k), (l), (s) and (u) of section 3-20 or the exercise of any right or power granted thereby which are not inconsistent with the provisions of said sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, are hereby adopted and shall apply to all revenue bonds, state revenue bond anticipation notes and state revenue grant anticipation notes authorized by the State Bond Commission pursuant to said sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive. For the purposes of subsection (o) of section 3-20, “bond act” shall be construed to include said sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive.\n\n(e) Any pledge made by the state pursuant to sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, is a statutory pledge and shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made, and any revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the state shall be subject immediately to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the state, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded. Any pledge made by the state pursuant to sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, to secure revenue bonds issued to finance eligible water quality projects shall secure only revenue bonds issued for such purpose and any such pledge made by the state to secure revenue bonds issued to finance eligible drinking water projects shall secure only revenue bonds issued for such purpose.\n\n(f) Whenever the General Assembly has authorized the State Bond Commission to authorize bonds of the state for clean water projects and uses and has found that such projects and uses are for any of the purposes set forth in sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, and whenever the State Bond Commission finds that the authorization of such bonds will be in the best interests of the state, the State Bond Commission shall authorize the issuance of such bonds from time to time in one or more series and in principal amounts not exceeding the aggregate amount authorized by the General Assembly.\n\n(g) Whenever the state has a written commitment to receive a grant-in-aid or similar form of assistance with respect to a project or program for which the issuance of bonds has been authorized pursuant to sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, the Treasurer may issue state grant anticipation notes in anticipation of the issuance of such a grant-in-aid or other assistance provided (1) the total amount of such notes shall not exceed the amount of the grant commitment which has not been paid to the state and (2) all grant payments with respect to such project or program received by the state, to the extent required, shall be applied promptly toward repayment of such temporary notes as the same shall become due and payable, or shall be deposited in trust for such purpose. Notes evidencing such borrowings shall be signed by the manual or facsimile signature of the Treasurer or his deputy. The principal of and interest on any state grant anticipation notes issued pursuant to this subsection may be repaid from the proceeds of renewals thereof, from grants-in-aid or other assistance pledged for the payment thereof, or from the proceeds of a credit facility including, but not limited to, a letter of credit or policy of bond insurance.\n\n(h) Bonds, state bond anticipation notes and state grant anticipation notes issued pursuant to sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, are hereby made securities in which public officers and public bodies of the state and its political subdivisions, all insurance companies, credit unions, building and loan associations, investment companies, banking associations, trust companies, executors, administrators, trustees and other fiduciaries and pension, profit-sharing and retirement funds may properly and legally invest funds, including capital in their control or belonging to them. Such bonds, state bond anticipation notes and state grant anticipation notes are hereby made securities which may properly and legally be deposited with and received by any state or municipal officer or any agency or political subdivision of the state for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds, state bond anticipation notes, state grant anticipation notes or other obligations of the state is now or may hereafter be authorized by law.\n\n(i) The proceedings under which bonds are authorized to be issued may, subject to the provisions of the general statutes, contain any or all of the following: (1) Provisions respecting custody of the proceeds from the sale of the bonds and any bond anticipation notes, including any requirements that such proceeds be held separate from or not be commingled with other funds of the state; (2) provisions for the investment and reinvestment of bond proceeds utilized to pay project costs and for the disposition of any excess bond proceeds or investment earnings thereon; (3) provisions for the execution of reimbursement agreements or similar agreements in connection with credit facilities, including, but not limited to, letters of credit or policies of bond insurance, remarketing agreements and agreements for the purpose of moderating interest rate fluctuations, and of such other agreements entered into pursuant to section 3-20a; (4) provisions for the collection, custody, investment, reinvestment and use of the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged therefor as provided in sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive; (5) provisions regarding the establishment and maintenance of reserves, sinking funds and any other funds and accounts as shall be approved by the State Bond Commission in such amounts as may be established by the State Bond Commission, and the regulation and disposition thereof, or the establishment of a reserve fund of the state into which may be deposited any moneys appropriated and made available by the state for such fund, any proceeds of the sale of bonds or notes, to the extent provided in the resolution of the state authorizing the issuance thereof, and any other moneys which may be made available to the state for the purpose of such fund from any source whatever and, in lieu of the deposit of any such moneys, evidence by the state of the satisfaction of a federal matching requirement on the part of the state pursuant to the federal Water Quality Act of 1987 or the federal Safe Drinking Water Act or other related federal act, as applicable, including requirements that any such funds and accounts be held separate from or not be commingled with other funds of the state; (6) covenants for the establishment of pledged revenue coverage requirements for the bonds and state bond anticipation notes; (7) provisions for the issuance of additional bonds on a parity with bonds theretofore issued, including establishment of coverage requirements with respect thereto as herein provided; (8) provisions regarding the rights and remedies available in case of a default to bondowners, noteowners or any trustee under any contract, loan agreement, document, instrument or trust indenture, including the right to appoint a trustee to represent their interests upon occurrence of an event of default, as defined in said proceedings, provided that if any bonds or state bond anticipation notes shall be secured by a trust indenture, the respective owners of such bonds or notes shall have no authority except as set forth in such trust indenture to appoint a separate trustee to represent them; (9) provisions for the payment of rebate amounts; and (10) provisions or covenants of like or different character from the foregoing which are consistent with sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, and which the State Bond Commission determines in such proceedings are necessary, convenient or desirable in order to better secure the bonds or state bond anticipation notes, or will tend to make the bonds or state bond anticipation notes more marketable, and which are in the best interests of the state. Any provision which may be included in proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds hereunder may be included in an indenture of trust duly approved in accordance with sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, which secures the bonds and any notes issued in anticipation thereof, and in such case the provisions of such indenture shall be deemed to be a part of such proceedings as though they were expressly included therein.\n\n(j) Whether or not any bonds, state bond anticipation notes or state grant anticipation notes issued pursuant to sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, are of such form and character as to be negotiable instruments under the terms of title 42a, such bonds, state bond anticipation notes and state grant anticipation notes are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all purposes of title 42a, subject only to the provisions of such bonds, state bond anticipation notes and state grant anticipation notes for registration.\n\n(k) The state covenants with the purchasers and all subsequent owners and transferees of bonds, state bond anticipation notes and state grant anticipation notes issued by the state pursuant to sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, in consideration of the acceptance of and payment for the bonds, state bond anticipation notes and state grant anticipation notes, that such bonds, state bond anticipation notes and state grant anticipation notes shall be free at all times from taxes levied by any municipality or political subdivision or special district having taxing powers of the state and the principal and interest of any bonds, state bond anticipation notes and grant anticipation notes issued under the provisions of sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, their transfer and the income therefrom, including revenues derived from the sale thereof, shall at all times be free from taxation of every kind by the state of Connecticut or under its authority, except for estate or succession taxes. The Treasurer is authorized to include this covenant of the state in any agreement with the owner of any such bonds, state bond anticipation notes or state grant anticipation notes.\n\n(l) Pending the use and application of any bond proceeds, such proceeds may be invested by, or at the direction of the State Treasurer, in obligations listed in section 3-20 or in investment agreements rated within the top rating categories of any nationally recognized rating service or in investment agreements secured by obligations, of or guaranteed by, the United States or agencies or instrumentalities of the United States.\n\n(m) Any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive, and at any time outstanding may, at any time and from time to time, be refunded by the state by the issuance of its revenue refunding bonds in such amounts as the State Bond Commission may deem necessary, but not to exceed an amount sufficient to refund the principal of the revenue bonds to be so refunded, to pay any unpaid interest thereon and any premiums and commissions necessary to be paid in connection therewith and to pay costs and expenses which the Treasurer may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the authorization, sale and issuance of refunding bonds. Any such refunding may be effected whether the revenue bonds to be refunded shall have matured or shall thereafter mature. All revenue refunding bonds issued hereunder shall be payable solely from the revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys out of which the revenue bonds to be refunded thereby are payable and shall be subject to and may be secured in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(n) The Treasurer shall have power, out of any funds available therefor, to purchase revenue bonds, state revenue bond anticipation notes and state revenue grant anticipation notes of the state issued pursuant to sections 22a-475 to 22a-483, inclusive.

For the purposes of this section, “population” means the number of people according to the most recent version of the Connecticut Register and Manual.\n\n(b) In order to be considered for such a grant, each eligible municipality shall submit a grant application on forms prescribed by the commissioner not later than September 15, 2007. The commissioner may reject any grant application that the commissioner determines to be incomplete. The municipality that submitted such rejected application shall be given not more than fifteen days to correct the defects in such application. In the event that a municipality given priority in accordance with subsection (a) of this section is unable to correct such defects to the commissioner's satisfaction, the commissioner shall consider such municipality a nonpriority municipality, as described in subsection (c) of this section. Any municipality that fails to submit a timely application for the grant shall be deemed to have waived such municipality's right to apply for the grant.\n\n(c) In the event that one or more of the municipalities given priority in accordance with subsection (a) of this section waives its right to participate in such pilot program, any municipality required to comply with the requirements of a permit issued pursuant to section 22a-430 or 22a-430b for the discharge of stormwater from, or associated with, a separate storm sewer system owned or operated by such municipality may apply to the commissioner to participate in the pilot program in accordance with procedures prescribed by the commissioner. Timely applications for such grants will be reviewed in the order in which they were received to determine if such municipality meets the selection criteria for nonpriority municipalities. Such selection criteria shall include, but not be limited to: (1) The proximity of the municipality to Long Island Sound or other major river or water body, and (2) whether the inclusion of such municipality will result, in the aggregate of all participating municipalities, in a diverse representation of urban and suburban areas. For the purpose of this section, “separate storm sewer system” means a conveyance for stormwater, including, but not limited to, roads with drainage systems, streets, catch basins, curbs, gutters, ditches, man-made channels or storm drains that discharge into the waters of the state.\n\n(d) Each municipality selected by the commissioner to participate in such pilot program shall submit a stormwater management program for the commissioner's approval.

If a new board or commission is created, such municipality shall, by ordinance, determine the number of members thereof, their compensation, if any, whether such members shall be elected or appointed, the method of their appointment, if appointed, and removal and their terms of office, which shall be so arranged that not more than one-half of such terms shall expire within any one year.\n\n(b) The purposes of the stormwater authority shall be to: (1) Develop a stormwater management program, including, but not limited to, (A) a program for construction and post-construction site stormwater runoff control, including measures to control detention and prevention of stormwater runoff from development sites, and (B) a program for control and abatement of stormwater pollution from existing land uses, and the detection and elimination of connections to the stormwater system that threaten the public health, welfare or the environment; (2) provide public education and outreach in the municipality relating to stormwater management activities and to establish procedures for public participation; (3) provide for the administration of the stormwater management program; (4) establish geographic boundaries of the stormwater authority district; and (5) recommend to the legislative body of the municipality in which such district is located the imposition of a fee upon the interests in real property within such district, subject to the fifteen per cent limitation on, or alternative election to exempt, properties owned by hospitals described in subdivision (3) of subsection (c) of this section, the revenues from which shall be used in carrying out any of the powers of such district. In accomplishing the purposes of this section, the stormwater authority may plan, layout, acquire, construct, reconstruct, repair, maintain, supervise and manage stormwater control systems.\n\n(c) (1) (A) Any stormwater authority created by a municipality pursuant to subsection (a) of this section may levy fees, approved by the legislative body of the municipality in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (3) of this subsection, on property owners of the municipality, except as specified in subdivision (2) of this subsection, for the purposes described in subsection (b) of this section. In establishing fees for properties in its district, the stormwater authority shall (i) consider criteria, including, but not limited to, the area of the property containing impervious surfaces from which stormwater runoff is generated and land use types that result in higher or lower concentrations of stormwater pollution, and (ii) adopt a procedure to provide a partial fee reduction, in the form of a credit, in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision.\n\n(B) The stormwater authority shall provide a partial fee reduction for any property owner in its district who (i) has disconnected a percentage of such property's impervious surfaces from the municipal separate storm sewer system, combined storm sewer system or surface water, and (ii) provides documentation to the satisfaction of the stormwater authority that current stormwater best management practices or other control measures, approved by the stormwater authority, that reduce, retain or treat stormwater onsite are being applied and maintained in compliance with the requirements of the stormwater authority and any applicable permit issued by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection for the discharge of stormwater. For the purposes of this subparagraph, an area of impervious surface is deemed disconnected when the appropriate water quality volume has been retained in accordance with the applicable permit issued by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection for the discharge of stormwater or as required by the stormwater authority.\n\n(C) The stormwater authority may provide a partial fee reduction for any property owner in its district who has installed and is operating and maintaining infrastructure that reduces, retains or treats stormwater onsite, which infrastructure exceeds any requirements for infrastructure that may be applicable to the property under (i) the applicable permit issued by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection for the discharge of stormwater, including any requirements by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection to address water quality impairments resulting from stormwater discharge, (ii) any regulation adopted by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection, or (iii) the local stormwater control ordinance.\n\n(D) The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection may provide additional guidance to stormwater authorities to implement the provisions of this subdivision.\n\n(2) In the case of land classified as, and consisting of, farm, forest or open space land, or property owned by the state government, or any of its political subdivisions or respective agencies, the stormwater authority may only levy such fees on areas of such land that contain impervious surfaces from which stormwater discharges to a municipal separate storm sewer system.\n\n(3) Each stormwater authority shall present its budget annually to the legislative body of the municipality for approval. Such budget shall include the specific programs the authority proposes to undertake during the fiscal year for which the budget is presented, the projected expenditures for such programs for the fiscal year and the amount of the fee or fees the authority proposes to levy to pay for such expenditures. In no event shall the aggregate amount of the fees proposed for the fiscal year exceed the aggregate amount of such projected expenditures for the fiscal year and in no event shall more than fifteen per cent of the aggregate amount of the fees proposed for any fiscal year prior to July 1, 2026, be generated from properties located in the municipality that are owned by hospitals that are parties to the settlement agreement with the state approved pursuant to special act 19-1 of the December 2019 special session. The legislative body of the municipality shall ensure that the aggregate amount of the fees approved comply with such fifteen per cent limitation.

As part of the guarantee of such constituent municipality for payment of principal and interest on the bonds, such constituent municipality may pledge to and agree with the owners of the bonds issued under sections 22a-500 to 22a-519, inclusive, and with those persons who may enter into contracts with the authority or any successor agency pursuant to the provisions of sections 22a-500 to 22a-519, inclusive, that it will not limit or alter the rights thereby vested in the bondowners, the authority or any contracting party until such bonds, together with the interest thereon are fully met and discharged and such contracts are fully performed on the part of the authority, provided nothing contained in sections 22a-500 to 22a-519, inclusive, shall preclude such limitation or alteration if and when adequate provision shall be made by law for the protection of the owners of such bonds of the authority or those entering into such contracts with the authority.

To the extent provided in such agreement or agreements, the obligations of such constituent municipality thereunder shall be obligatory upon such constituent municipality and the inhabitants and property thereof. Thereafter such constituent municipality shall appropriate in each year during the term of such agreement, and there shall be available on or before the date when the same are payable, an amount of money which, together with other revenues available for such purpose, shall be sufficient to meet such obligation. Any such agreement shall be valid, binding and enforceable against such constituent municipality if approved by an ordinance adopted by the legislative body of such constituent municipality or such other body as permitted by section 7-157.\n\n(c) Any authority created pursuant to sections 22a-500 to 22a-519, inclusive, may enter into long-term contracts or agreements with any municipality or any person or persons for water pollution control services whereby such contracting municipality or person agrees to connect its municipal wastewater facilities with the wastewater system of the authority for wastewater treatment and disposal service and to make payments of fees or charges based on a percentage of actual or projected flow or such other formula as such contract or agreement shall provide. Any such contract or agreement may require the continuation of such payments by such contracting municipality whether or not the agreed services are being provided but only until all bonds issued by any of the contracting parties for development and construction of water pollution control facilities or regional water pollution control facilities have been paid or the payment of such bonds shall have been duly provided for. Such contract may further require or permit one or more of the contracting municipalities to pay obligations of another contracting municipality in the event such other contracting municipality fails to make such payments and to bring appropriate legal action against the defaulting municipality to recover the amounts so paid, together with the costs and expenses of such action. The obligation of a contracting municipality to make payments pursuant to any such agreement shall not be included in the aggregate indebtedness of the contracting municipality for the purposes of any state statutory provision limiting the aggregate indebtedness of the municipality.

Any such agreement may provide for the transfer of title of said facilities or wastewater system by deed, lease or other arrangement to the authority. To the extent it is not inconsistent with sections 22a-500 to 22a-519, inclusive, any such agreement may impose such limitations or conditions as may be agreed upon with respect to the power thereafter to sell or otherwise dispose of any property acquired pursuant to such agreement and may provide for or authorize the authority to return property no longer required for water pollution control purposes. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other general, special or local law or charter, any action taken by such constituent municipality pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to referendum. Any such agreement shall set forth the liabilities of such constituent municipality which are contemplated to be paid by the authority from moneys available to it, unless such agreement does not require the authority to assume any such liabilities. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other general, special or local law or charter, any moneys received by any constituent municipality in consideration for the transfer of such water pollution control facilities or wastewater system to the authority may be deposited in the general fund of such constituent municipality and used for any lawful municipal purpose or may be deposited in a special fund for the purpose of paying or redeeming any existing indebtedness issued for water pollution control purposes. A constituent municipality and the authority may make or enter into any contracts, agreements, deeds, leases, conveyances or other instruments as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of sections 22a-500 to 22a-519, inclusive, and they shall have the power and authority to do so and to authorize the doing of all things incidental, desirable or necessary to implement the provisions of said sections. Upon the filing by the authority with the clerk of the constituent municipality and the Secretary of the State of a copy of the instruments or documents effectuating the transfer authorized by sections 22a-500 to 22a-519, inclusive, the authority shall take possession of the water pollution control facilities or wastewater system of the constituent municipality. Any application filed or proceeding heretofore commenced in relation to the water pollution control facility or wastewater system transferred to the authority pending with the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, the Department of Public Health or any other state agency or with the United States Environmental Protection Agency or any other federal agency or instrumentality shall inure to and for the benefit of the authority and be binding upon the authority to the same extent and in the same manner as if the authority had been a party to such application or proceeding from its inception, and the authority shall be deemed a party thereto to the extent not prohibited by any federal law. Any license, approval, permit or decision heretofore or hereafter issued or granted pursuant to or as a result of any such application or proceeding shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the authority and shall be assigned and transferred by the municipality to the authority unless such assignment and transfer is prohibited by federal law. If the municipality has outstanding general obligation bonds issued for acquiring or constructing water pollution control facilities acquired by the authority, whether or not the bonds are also payable from revenues, special assessments or taxes, the municipality may authorize the authority pursuant to the agreement to issue bonds under sections 22a-500 to 22a-519, inclusive, for the purpose of retiring the outstanding bonds or alternatively, the authority may agree to pay the principal of and interest on such bonds until the obligation of such constituent municipality is discharged. No such agreement under the provisions of this subsection shall be executed until such constituent municipality shall have held a public hearing at which users of the water pollution control system and residents of such constituent municipality shall have had the opportunity to be heard concerning the proposed provisions thereof. Notice of such hearing shall be published at least thirty days in advance in the official newspaper or newspapers of the municipality.\n\n(e) The rates, fees, charges, penalties and assessments established by an authority under sections 22a-500 to 22a-519, inclusive, shall be established so as to provide funds sufficient in each year, with other revenues, if any, available therefore (1) to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating its wastewater system and each and every portion thereof, to the extent that adequate provision for the payment of such cost has not otherwise been made, (2) to pay the principal of and the interest on outstanding bonds of the authority as the same shall become due and payable, (3) to meet any requirements of any resolution authorizing, or trust indenture securing, such bonds or notes of the authority, including coverage requirements, (4) to make agreed upon payments in lieu of taxes, as the same become due and payable, upon the properties of the authority to the municipalities in which such properties are situated, (5) to provide for the maintenance, conservation and appropriate use of the land of the authority, and (6) to pay all other reasonable and necessary expenses of the authority. No such rate, fee, charge, penalty or assessment shall be established until it has been approved by the authority and after the authority has held a public hearing at which all the users of its wastewater system, the owners of property served or to be served and benefited or to be benefited and other interested persons have had an opportunity to be heard concerning such proposed rate, fee, charge, penalty and assessment. The authority shall not approve such rates, fees, charges, penalties and assessments unless it finds that such rates, fees, charges, penalties and assessments will provide funds in excess of the amounts required for the purposes described previously in this section, or unless it finds that such rates, fees, charges, penalties and assessments will provide funds sufficient for such purposes. The rates, fees, charges, penalties and assessments so established for any class of user or property served or to be served shall be extended to any additional user or property thereafter benefited or owned which are within the same class, without the necessity of a hearing thereon. Any change in such rates, fees, charges, penalties and assessments shall be made in the same manner in which they were established.\n\n(f) All required payments of rates, fees, charges, penalties and assessments, interest on loans, principal of loans and necessary fees and assessments related thereto required under any contract or agreement entered into pursuant to the provisions of this section, shall be considered expenditures for public purposes by a municipality and, notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, any necessary general or special assessments, fees, rates, charges, penalties and assessments or cost sharing or other assessments authorized to be levied, charged or assessed and collected by municipalities within the state or with respect to fees, rates, charges, penalties and assessments by an authority in accordance with sections 22a-500 to 22a-519, inclusive, may be levied, charged, assessed or collected by said municipality or an authority without limitation as to rate or amount for the purpose of making such required payments.\n\n(P.A. 95-257, S. 12, 21, 58; 95-329, S. 19, 31; P.A. 03-278, S. 83; P.A. 11-80, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 95-329, S. 19 effective July 13, 1995 (Revisor's note: P.A. 95-257 authorized substitution of “Commissioner of Public Health” for “Commissioner of Public Health and Addiction Services”, effective July 1, 1995); P.A. 03-278 made technical changes in Subsec.
