The decision to arrest and charge shall not (1) be dependent on the specific consent of the victim, (2) consider the relationship between persons suspected of committing a family violence crime, or (3) be based solely on a request by the victim. Whenever a peace officer determines that a family violence crime has been committed, such officer may seize any firearm or electronic defense weapon, as defined in section 53a-3, or ammunition at the location where the crime is alleged to have been committed that is in the possession of any person arrested for the commission of such crime or suspected of its commission or that is in plain view. Not later than seven days after any such seizure, the law enforcement agency shall return such firearm, electronic defense weapon or ammunition in its original condition to the rightful owner thereof unless such person is ineligible to possess such firearm, electronic defense weapon or ammunition or unless otherwise ordered by the court.\n\n(b) When complaints of family violence are made by two or more opposing persons, a peace officer is not required to arrest both persons. The peace officer shall evaluate each complaint separately to determine which person is the dominant aggressor. In determining which person is the dominant aggressor, the peace officer shall consider the need to protect victims of domestic violence, whether one person acted in defense of self or a third person, the relative degree of any injury, any threats creating fear of physical injury, and any history of family violence between such persons, if such history can reasonably be obtained by the peace officer. The peace officer shall arrest the person whom the officer believes to be the dominant aggressor.\n\n(c) If a peace officer believes probable cause exists for the arrest of two or more persons, in lieu of arresting or seeking a warrant for the arrest of any person determined not to be the dominant aggressor, such peace officer may submit a report detailing the conduct of such person during the incident to the state's attorney for the judicial district in which the incident took place for further review and advice. The provisions of this section shall be construed to discourage, when appropriate, but not prohibit, dual arrests.\n\n(d) No peace officer investigating an incident of family violence shall threaten, suggest or otherwise indicate, the arrest of all persons involved in such incident for the purpose of discouraging any request from a person for law enforcement intervention.\n\n(e) No peace officer shall be held liable in any civil action regarding personal injury or injury to property brought by any party to a family violence incident for (1) an arrest based on probable cause; (2) any conditions of release imposed pursuant to subsection (b) of section 54-63c; or (3) determinations made pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section.\n\n(f) It shall be the responsibility of the peace officer at the scene of a family violence incident to provide immediate assistance to the victim. Such assistance shall include, but need not be limited to: (1) Assisting the victim to obtain medical treatment if such treatment is required; (2) notifying the victim of the right to file an affidavit for a warrant for arrest; (3) informing the victim of services available, including providing the victim with (A) contact information for a regional family violence organization that employs, or provides referrals to, counselors who are trained in providing trauma-informed care, and (B) on and after January 1, 2023, a copy of the information concerning services and resources available to victims of domestic violence published pursuant to section 10-10g; (4) on and after January 1, 2023, if there is a child at the scene, providing the victim a copy of the documents concerning behavioral and mental health evaluation and treatment resources available to children developed pursuant to section 17a-22r for the mental health region in which such victim is located; (5) referring the victim to the Office of Victim Services; and (6) providing assistance in accordance with the uniform protocols for treating victims of family violence whose immigration status is questionable, established pursuant to subsection (i) of this section. In cases where the officer has determined that no cause exists for an arrest, assistance shall include: (A) Assistance as provided in subdivisions (1) to (6), inclusive, of this subsection; and (B) remaining at the scene for a reasonable time until, in the reasonable judgment of the officer, the likelihood of further imminent violence has been eliminated. For the purposes of this subsection, “trauma-informed care” means services (i) directed by a thorough understanding of the neurological, biological, psychological and social effects of trauma and violence on a person; and (ii) delivered by a regional family violence organization that employs, or provides referrals to, counselors who: (I) Make available to the victim of family violence resources on trauma exposure, its impact and treatment; (II) engage in efforts to strengthen the resilience and protective factors of victims of family violence who are impacted by and vulnerable to trauma; (III) emphasize continuity of care and collaboration among organizations that provide services to children; and (IV) maintain professional relationships for referral and consultation purposes with programs and persons with expertise in trauma-informed care.\n\n(g) (1) Each law enforcement agency shall develop, in conjunction with the Division of Criminal Justice, and implement specific operational guidelines for arrest policies in family violence incidents. Such guidelines shall include, but need not be limited to: (A) Procedures for the conduct of a criminal investigation; (B) procedures for arrest and for victim assistance by peace officers; (C) education as to what constitutes speedy information in a family violence incident; (D) procedures with respect to the provision of services to victims; and (E) such other criteria or guidelines as may be applicable to carry out the purposes of sections 46b-1, 46b-15, 46b-38a to 46b-38f, inclusive, and 54-1g.

On and after October 1, 2012, each law enforcement agency shall develop and implement specific operational guidelines for arrest policies in family violence incidents which, at a minimum, meet the standards set forth in the model law enforcement policy on family violence established in subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n(2) There is established a model law enforcement policy on family violence for the state. Such policy shall consist of the model policy submitted by the task force established in section 19 of public act 11-152* on January 31, 2012, to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to the judiciary, as amended from time to time by the Domestic Violence Criminal Justice Response and Enhancement Advisory Council established pursuant to section 46b-38j.\n\n(3) Not later than January 15, 2013, and annually thereafter, the chairperson of the Police Officer Standards and Training Council shall provide notice of updates to the model policy, if any, adopted by the council during the prior calendar year, to the chief law enforcement officer of each municipality having a police department, the law enforcement instructor of each such police department, and the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection.\n\n(4) Not later than July 1, 2013, and annually thereafter, each law enforcement agency shall submit a report to the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection, in such form as the commissioner prescribes, regarding the law enforcement agency's compliance with the model law enforcement policy on family violence for the state.\n\n(5) (A) On and after July 1, 2021, each law enforcement agency shall designate at least one officer with supervisory duties to expeditiously process, upon request of a victim of family violence or other crime who is applying for U Nonimmigrant Status (i) a certification of helpfulness on Form I-918, Supplement B, or any subsequent corresponding form designated by the United States Department of Homeland Security, confirming that the victim of family violence or other crime has been helpful, is being helpful or is likely to be helpful in the investigation or prosecution of the criminal activity, and (ii) any subsequent certification required by the victim. As used in this subparagraph, “expeditiously” means not later than sixty days after the date of receipt of the request for certification of helpfulness, or not later than fourteen days after the date of receipt of such request if (I) the victim is in federal immigration removal proceedings or detained, or (II) the victim's child, parents or siblings would become ineligible for an immigration benefit by virtue of the victim or the sibling of such victim attaining the age of eighteen years, or the victim's child attaining the age of twenty-one years.\n\n(B) By signing a certification of helpfulness, the officer or agency is not making a determination of eligibility for U Nonimmigrant Status. The officer or agency is solely providing information required by the United States Department of Homeland Security on such form as is required by said department and certifying that: (i) The requesting individual or his or her family member is a victim of one of the enumerated crimes eligible for U Nonimmigrant Status, (ii) the victim possesses or possessed information regarding that crime, (iii) the victim has been, is being or is likely to be helpful in an investigation of that crime, and (iv) the victim has not failed or refused to provide reasonably requested information or assistance. A current or ongoing investigation, filing of criminal charges, prosecution or conviction is not required for a victim to request and obtain certification under this subdivision.\n\n(h) The Police Officer Standards and Training Council, in conjunction with the Division of Criminal Justice, shall establish an education and training program for law enforcement officers, supervisors and state's attorneys on the handling of family violence incidents.

Training under such program shall also include, within available appropriations, information on (i) the impact of arrests of multiple parties in a family violence case on the immigration status of the parties; (ii) crime scene investigation and evaluation practices in family violence cases designed by the council to reduce the number of multiple arrests in family violence cases; and (iii) practical considerations in the application of the general statutes related to family violence. Such training shall also address, within available appropriations, eligibility for federal T Visas for victims of human trafficking and federal U Visas for unauthorized immigrants who are victims of family violence and other crimes.\n\n(i) The Police Officer Standards and Training Council shall establish uniform protocols for treating victims of family violence whose immigration status is questionable, and shall make such protocols available to law enforcement agencies. Each law enforcement agency shall adopt and use such protocols on and after the date they are established by the council.\n\n(j) The provisions of this section shall not apply to persons who are (1) attending an institution of higher education and presently residing together in on-campus housing or in off-campus housing that is owned, managed or operated by the institution of higher education or its agent, provided such persons are not family or household members as defined in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (E) or (F) of subdivision (2) of section 46b-38a, or (2) presently residing in a dwelling unit, as defined in section 47a-1, and making payments pursuant to a rental agreement, as defined in section 47a-1, provided such persons are not family or household members as defined in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (E) or (F) of subdivision (2) of section 46b-38a.\n\n(P.A. 86-337, S. 2; P.A. 87-554; 87-567, S. 2, 7; 87-589, S. 13, 87; P.A. 95-108, S. 15; P.A. 96-246, S. 32; P.A. 99-186, S. 3; P.A. 00-196, S. 58; P.A. 02-120, S. 1; P.A. 04-66, S. 1; P.A. 07-123, S. 2, 7; Sept.

The Court Support Services Division shall oversee direct operations of the local units.\n\n(c) Each such local family violence intervention unit shall: (1) Accept referrals of family violence cases from a judge or prosecutor, (2) prepare written or oral reports on each case for the court by the next court date to be presented at any time during the court session on that date, (3) provide or arrange for services to victims and offenders, (4) administer contracts to carry out such services, and (5) establish centralized reporting procedures. All information provided to a family relations counselor, family relations counselor trainee or family services supervisor employed by the Judicial Department in a local family violence intervention unit shall be used solely for the purposes of preparation of the report and the protective order forms for each case and recommendation of services and shall otherwise be confidential and retained in the files of such unit and not be subject to subpoena or other court process for use in any other proceeding or for any other purpose, except that a family relations counselor, family relations counselor trainee or family services supervisor employed by the Judicial Department:\n\n(A) Shall disclose to the court and the prosecuting authority for appropriate action information that the victim has indicated that the defendant holds a permit to carry a pistol or revolver, possesses one or more firearms or possesses ammunition;\n\n(B) Shall disclose to an employee of the Department of Children and Families information that indicates that a defendant poses a danger or threat to a child or a custodial parent of the child;\n\n(C) May disclose to another family relations counselor, family relations counselor trainee or family services supervisor information pursuant to guidelines adopted by the Chief Court Administrator;\n\n(D) May disclose to a bail commissioner or an intake, assessment and referral specialist employed by the Judicial Department information regarding a defendant who is on or is being considered for pretrial release;\n\n(E) May disclose to a law enforcement agency information that indicates that a defendant poses a danger or threat to another person;\n\n(F) May disclose, after disposition of a family violence case, to a probation officer or a juvenile probation officer, for purposes of determining service needs and supervision levels, information regarding a defendant who has been convicted and sentenced to a period of probation in the family violence case;\n\n(G) May disclose, after a conviction in a family violence case, to a probation officer for the purpose of preparing a presentence investigation report, any information regarding the defendant that has been provided to the family relations counselor, family relations counselor trainee or family services supervisor in the case or in any other case that resulted in the conviction of the defendant;\n\n(H) May disclose to any organization under contract with the Judicial Department to provide family violence programs and services, for the purpose of determining program and service needs, information regarding any defendant who is a client of such organization, provided no information that personally identifies the victim may be disclosed to such organization; and\n\n(I) Shall disclose such information as may be necessary to fulfill such counselor's, trainee's or supervisor's duty as a mandated reporter under section 17a-101a to report suspected child abuse or neglect.\n\n(d) In all cases of family violence, a written or oral report that indicates whether the parties in the family violence case are parties to a case pending on the family relations docket of the Superior Court and includes recommendation of the local family violence intervention unit shall be available to a judge at the first court date appearance to be presented at any time during the court session on that date. A judge of the Superior Court may consider and impose the following conditions to protect the parties, including, but not limited to: (1) Issuance of a protective order pursuant to subsection (e) of this section; (2) prohibition against subjecting the victim to further violence; (3) referral to a family violence education program for persons who commit acts of family violence; and (4) immediate referral for more extensive case assessment. Such protective order shall be an order of the court, and the clerk of the court shall cause (A) a copy of such order to be sent to the victim, and (B) a copy of such order, or the information contained in such order, to be sent by facsimile or other means within forty-eight hours of its issuance to the law enforcement agency for the town in which the victim resides and, if the defendant resides in a town different from the town in which the victim resides, to the law enforcement agency for the town in which the defendant resides. If the victim is employed in a town different from the town in which the victim resides, the clerk of the court shall, upon the request of the victim, send, by facsimile or other means, a copy of such order, or the information contained in such order, to the law enforcement agency for the town in which the victim is employed not later than forty-eight hours after the issuance of such order. If the victim is enrolled in a public or private elementary or secondary school, including a technical education and career school, or an institution of higher education, as defined in section 10a-55, the clerk of the court shall, upon the request of the victim, send, by facsimile or other means, a copy of such order, or the information contained in such order, to such school or institution of higher education, the president of any institution of higher education at which the victim is enrolled and the special police force established pursuant to section 10a-156b, if any, at the institution of higher education at which the victim is enrolled, if the victim provides the clerk with the name and address of such school or institution of higher education.\n\n(e) (1) A protective order issued under this section may include provisions necessary to protect the victim from threats, harassment, injury or intimidation by the defendant, including, but not limited to, an order enjoining the defendant from (A) imposing any restraint upon the person or liberty of the victim, (B) threatening, harassing, assaulting, molesting or sexually assaulting the victim, or (C) entering the family dwelling or the dwelling of the victim. A protective order issued under this section may include provisions necessary to protect any animal owned or kept by the victim including, but not limited to, an order enjoining the defendant from injuring or threatening to injure such animal. Such order shall be made a condition of the bail or release of the defendant and shall contain the following notification: “In accordance with section 53a-223 of the Connecticut general statutes, any violation of this order constitutes criminal violation of a protective order which is punishable by a term of imprisonment of not more than ten years, a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars, or both. Additionally, in accordance with section 53a-107 of the Connecticut general statutes, entering or remaining in a building or any other premises in violation of this order constitutes criminal trespass in the first degree which is punishable by a term of imprisonment of not more than one year, a fine of not more than two thousand dollars, or both. Violation of this order also violates a condition of your bail or release, and may result in raising the amount of bail or revoking release.” Every order of the court made in accordance with this section after notice and hearing shall be accompanied by a notification that is consistent with the full faith and credit provisions set forth in 18 USC 2265(a), as amended from time to time. The information contained in and concerning the issuance of any protective order issued under this section shall be entered in the registry of protective orders pursuant to section 51-5c.\n\n(2) Each person who receives an order of the court in accordance with this subsection shall be given a notice that contains the following language: “If a protective order has been issued on your behalf or on behalf of your child, you may elect to give testimony or appear in a family court proceeding remotely, pursuant to section 46b-15c. Please notify the court in writing at least two days in advance of a proceeding if you choose to give testimony or appear remotely, and your physical presence in the courthouse will not be required in order to participate in the court proceeding.”.\n\n(f) The Judicial Department shall establish a program within each judicial district for the purpose of using electronic monitoring in accordance with this subsection. Under the program, the court may order that any person appearing in such judicial district who is charged with the violation of a restraining order or a protective order, and who has been determined to be a high-risk offender by the family violence intervention unit, be subject to electronic monitoring designed to warn law enforcement agencies, a state-wide information collection center and the victim when the person is within a specified distance of the victim, if the court finds that such electronic monitoring is necessary to protect the victim. If the court orders that such person be subject to electronic monitoring, the clerk of the court shall send, by facsimile or other means, a copy of the order, or the information contained in any such order, to the law enforcement agency or agencies for the town in which the person resides. The Judicial Branch shall establish the program within each judicial district not later than October 1, 2025.\n\n(g) (1) In cases referred to the local family violence intervention unit, it shall be the function of the unit to (A) identify victim service needs, (B) assess offenders for the purpose of identifying appropriate services, (C) monitor compliance with program requirements by offenders who are allowed to participate in the pretrial family violence education program described in subsection (h) of this section, and (D) monitor offenders who have been referred to pretrial services or programs.\n\n(2) The Judicial Department may contract with victim service providers to make available, either directly or through referral, appropriate services that include, but are not limited to, the provision of trauma-informed care, as defined in subsection (f) of section 46b-38b.\n\n(3) The Judicial Department may contract with service providers to provide domestic violence offender treatment programs for offenders referred by the court. Such treatment programs shall comply with the domestic violence offender program standards promulgated under section 46b-38l. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to the pretrial family violence education program described in subsection (h) of this section.\n\n(h) (1) There shall be a pretrial family violence education program for persons who are charged with family violence crimes. At a minimum, such program shall inform participants of the basic elements of family violence law and applicable penalties. The court may, in its discretion, invoke such program on motion of the defendant when it finds: (A) That the defendant has not previously been convicted of a family violence crime which occurred on or after October 1, 1986; (B) the defendant has not had a previous case assigned to the family violence education program; (C) the defendant has not previously invoked or accepted accelerated rehabilitation under section 54-56e for a family violence crime which occurred on or after October 1, 1986; and (D) that the defendant is not charged with a class A, class B or class C felony, or an unclassified felony carrying a term of imprisonment of more than ten years, or unless good cause is shown, a class D felony, an unclassified offense carrying a term of imprisonment of more than five years or an offense that involved the infliction of serious physical injury, as defined in section 53a-3. Participation by any person in the accelerated pretrial rehabilitation program under section 54-56e prior to October 1, 1986, shall not prohibit eligibility of such person for the pretrial family violence education program under this section. The court may require that the defendant answer such questions under oath, in open court or before any person designated by the clerk and duly authorized to administer oaths, under the penalties of perjury as will assist the court in making these findings.\n\n(2) The court, on such motion, may refer the defendant to the family violence intervention unit, and may continue the defendant's case pending the submission of the report of the unit to the court. The court shall also give notice to the victim or victims that the defendant has requested assignment to the family violence education program, and, where possible, give the victim or victims opportunity to be heard. Any defendant who accepts placement in the family violence education program shall agree to the tolling of any statute of limitations with respect to the crime or crimes with which the defendant is charged, and to a waiver of the defendant's right to a speedy trial. Any such defendant shall appear in court and shall be released to the custody of the family violence intervention unit for such period, not exceeding two years, and under such conditions as the court shall order. If the defendant refuses to accept, or, having accepted, violates such conditions, the defendant's case shall be brought to trial. If the defendant satisfactorily completes the family violence education program and complies with the conditions imposed for the period set by the court, the defendant may apply for dismissal of the charges against the defendant and the court, on finding satisfactory compliance, shall dismiss such charges.\n\n(3) Upon dismissal of charges under this subsection, all records of such charges shall be erased pursuant to section 54-142a.\n\n(i) A nonrefundable application fee of one hundred dollars shall be paid to the court by any person who files a motion pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (h) of this section to participate in the pretrial family violence education program, and a fee of three hundred dollars shall be paid to the court by any person who enters the family violence education program, except that no person shall be excluded from such program for inability to pay any such fee, provided (1) the person files with the court an affidavit of indigency or inability to pay and the court enters a finding thereof, or (2) such person has been determined indigent and eligible for representation by a public defender who has been appointed on behalf of such person pursuant to section 51-296. The court shall not require a person to perform community service in lieu of payment of such fee, if such fee is waived. All such fees shall be credited to the General Fund.\n\n(j) The Judicial Department shall establish an ongoing training program for judges, Court Support Services Division personnel, guardians ad litem and clerks to inform them about the policies and procedures of sections 46b-1, 46b-15, 46b-38a to 46b-38f, inclusive, and 54-1g, including, but not limited to, the function of the family violence intervention units and the use of restraining and protective orders. Such training program shall include an examination of the factors that contribute to a family being at risk for episodes of domestic violence within the family. The Judicial Branch may consult with organizations that advocate on behalf of victims of domestic violence in order to ensure that the training includes information on the unique characteristics of family violence crimes.\n\n(P.A. 86-337, S. 3; P.A. 87-567, S. 3, 7; P.A. 89-219, S. 1, 10; P.A. 91-6, S. 2, 3; 91-24, S. 3; 91-381, S. 4; P.A. 93-280, S. 2; 93-343; P.A. 96-180, S. 125, 166; 96-246, S. 33, 34; P.A. 97-126, S. 2; P.A. 01-130, S. 13; P.A. 02-132, S. 13, 14, 55; P.A. 03-202, S. 5; P.A. 05-288, S. 157; P.A. 06-196, S. 170; P.A. 07-78, S. 2; Sept.
