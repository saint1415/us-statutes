Subject to the provisions of section 46b-56a, the court may assign parental responsibility for raising the child to the parents jointly, or may award custody to either parent or to a third party, according to its best judgment upon the facts of the case and subject to such conditions and limitations as it deems equitable.

(7) authorizes court to consider parental alienation syndrome, specific acts of coercion and manipulation on part of defendant when making or modifying an order pursuant to section. 135 CA 337. The portion of the order pertaining to the defendant's visitation is an improper delegation of the court's judicial authority because the court effectively delegated to the plaintiff the authority to suspend or terminate the defendant's visitation and its attendant obligation to consider the best interest of the child pursuant to Subsec. 219 CA 716.\n\nSubsec. (g):\n\nCourt order conferring authority with the children's therapeutic counselors to determine whether the defendant was allowed to have access to the children's private therapy records was an improper delegation of judicial authority, and under the plain and unambiguous language of the Subsec., the defendant, as the noncustodial parent, was statutorily entitled to have access to the children's private therapy records, subject only to the court's denying him right of access to the records for good cause shown. 218 CA 818.",

The court may award joint legal custody without awarding joint physical custody where the parents have agreed to merely joint legal custody.\n\n(b) There shall be a presumption, affecting the burden of proof, that joint custody is in the best interests of a minor child where the parents have agreed to an award of joint custody or so agree in open court at a hearing for the purpose of determining the custody of the minor child or children of the marriage. If the court declines to enter an order awarding joint custody pursuant to this subsection, the court shall state in its decision the reasons for denial of an award of joint custody.\n\n(c) If only one parent seeks an order of joint custody upon a motion duly made, the court may order both parties to submit to conciliation at their own expense with the costs of such conciliation to be borne by the parties as the court directs according to each party's ability to pay.\n\n(d) In any proceeding before the Superior Court involving a dispute between the parents of a minor child with respect to the custody, care, education and upbringing of such child, the parents shall file with the court, at such time and in such form as provided by rule of court, a proposed parental responsibility plan that shall include, at a minimum, the following: (1) A schedule of the physical residence of the child during the year; (2) provisions allocating decision-making authority to one or both parents regarding the child's health, education and religious upbringing; (3) provisions for the resolution of future disputes between the parents, including, where appropriate, the involvement of a mental health professional or other parties to assist the parents in reaching a developmentally appropriate resolution to such disputes; (4) provisions for dealing with the parents' failure to honor their responsibilities under the plan; (5) provisions for dealing with the child's changing needs as the child grows and matures; and (6) provisions for minimizing the child's exposure to harmful parental conflict, encouraging the parents in appropriate circumstances to meet their responsibilities through agreements, and protecting the best interests of the child.\n\n(e) The objectives of a parental responsibility plan under this section are to provide for the child's physical care and emotional stability, to provide for the child's changing needs as the child grows and to set forth the authority and responsibility of each parent with respect to the child.\n\n(f) If both parents consent to a parental responsibility plan under this section, such plan shall be approved by the court as the custodial and access orders of the court pursuant to section 46b-56, unless the court finds that such plan as submitted and agreed to is not in the best interests of the child.\n\n(g) The court may modify any orders made under this section in accordance with section 46b-56.\n\n(P.A. 81-402, S. 2; P.A. 05-258, S. 4.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 05-258 added Subsecs.

      "heading": "Educational support orders.",
      "text": "(a) For purposes of this section, an educational support order is an order entered by a court requiring a parent to provide support for a child or children to attend for up to a total of four full academic years an institution of higher education or a private career school for the purpose of attaining a bachelor's or other undergraduate degree, or other appropriate vocational instruction. An educational support order may be entered with respect to any child who has not attained twenty-three years of age and shall terminate not later than the date on which the child attains twenty-three years of age.\n\n(b) (1) On motion or petition of a parent, the court may enter an educational support order at the time of entry of a decree of dissolution, legal separation or annulment, and no educational support order may be entered thereafter unless the decree explicitly provides that a motion or petition for an educational support order may be filed by either parent at a subsequent date. If no educational support order is entered at the time of entry of a decree of dissolution, legal separation or annulment, and the parents have a child who has not attained twenty-three years of age, the court shall inform the parents that no educational support order may be entered thereafter. The court may accept a parent's waiver of the right to file a motion or petition for an educational support order upon a finding that the parent fully understands the consequences of such waiver.\n\n(2) A waiver of the right to file a motion or petition for an educational support order may be made in writing by either parent and accepted by the court, provided the parent making the writing attests, under oath, that the parent fully understands the consequences of such waiver, and that no restraining order issued pursuant to section 46b-15 or protective order issued pursuant to section 46b-38c, between the parties is in effect or pending before the court. The provisions of this subdivision shall not preclude the court from requiring that the parties attend a hearing and that findings be made on the record.\n\n(3) On motion or petition of a parent, the court may enter an educational support order at the time of entry of an order for support pendente lite pursuant to section 46b-83.\n\n(4) On motion or petition of a parent, the court may enter an educational support order at the time of entering an order of support pursuant to section 46b-61 or 46b-569, or similar section of the general statutes, or at any time thereafter.\n\n(5) On motion or petition of a parent, the court may enter an educational support order at the time of entering an order pursuant to any other provision of the general statutes authorizing the court to make an order of support for a child, subject to the provisions of sections 46b-301 to 46b-425, inclusive.\n\n(c) The court may not enter an educational support order pursuant to this section unless the court finds as a matter of fact that it is more likely than not that the parents would have provided support to the child for higher education or private career school if the family were intact. After making such finding, the court, in determining whether to enter an educational support order, shall consider all relevant circumstances, including: (1) The parents' income, assets and other obligations, including obligations to other dependents; (2) the child's need for support to attend an institution of higher education or private career school considering the child's assets and the child's ability to earn income; (3) the availability of financial aid from other sources, including grants and loans; (4) the reasonableness of the higher education to be funded considering the child's academic record and the financial resources available; (5) the child's preparation for, aptitude for and commitment to higher education; and (6) evidence, if any, of the institution of higher education or private career school the child would attend.\n\n(d) Any finding required to be made by the court, pursuant to this section may be made on the basis of an affidavit, made under oath, by either party, provided that the party making the affidavit attests that no restraining order issued pursuant to section 46b-15 or protective order, issued pursuant to section 46b-38c, between the parties is in effect or pending before the court. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the court from requiring that the parties attend a hearing and that findings be made on the record.\n\n(e) At the appropriate time, both parents shall participate in, and agree upon, the decision as to which institution of higher education or private career school the child will attend. The court may make an order resolving the matter if the parents fail to reach an agreement.\n\n(f) To qualify for payments due under an educational support order, the child must (1) enroll in an accredited institution of higher education or private career school, as defined in section 10a-22a, (2) actively pursue a course of study commensurate with the child's vocational goals that constitutes at least one-half the course load determined by that institution or school to constitute full-time enrollment, (3) maintain good academic standing in accordance with the rules of the institution or school, and (4) make available all academic records to both parents during the term of the order. The order shall be suspended after any academic period during which the child fails to comply with these conditions.\n\n(g) The educational support order may include support for any necessary educational expense, including room, board, dues, tuition, fees, registration and application costs, but such expenses shall not be more than the amount charged by The University of Connecticut for a full-time in-state student at the time the child for whom educational support is being ordered matriculates, except this limit may be exceeded by agreement of the parents. An educational support order may also include the cost of books and medical insurance for such child.\n\n(h) The court may direct that payments under an educational support order be made (1) to a parent to be forwarded to the institution of higher education or private career school, (2) directly to the institution or school, or (3) otherwise as the court determines to be appropriate.\n\n(i) On motion or petition of a parent, an educational support order may be modified or enforced in the same manner as is provided by law for any support order.\n\n(j) This section does not create a right of action by a child for parental support for higher education.\n\n(k) An educational support order under this section does not include support for graduate or postgraduate education beyond a bachelor's degree.\n\n(l) The provisions of this section shall apply only in cases when the initial order for parental support of the child is entered on or after October 1, 2002.\n\n(P.A. 02-128, S. 1; P.A. 11-214, S. 6; P.A. 15-71, S. 80; P.A. 21-104, S. 19; P.A. 22-123, S. 40.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 11-214 amended Subsec. (b)(4) to substitute reference to Sec. 46b-213w for reference to Sec. 46b-213v; P.A. 15-71 amended Subsec.

(b)(2) re waiver of right to file motion or petition in writing, redesignated existing Subsecs. (b)(2) to (b)(4) as Subsecs. (b)(3) to (b)(5), added new Subsec. (d) re finding of court based on affidavit and redesignated existing Subsecs. (d) to (k) as Subsecs. (e) to (l), effective June 28, 2021; P.A. 22-123 changed “private occupational school” to “private career school” throughout, effective July 1, 2022.\n\nAlthough trial court failed to make necessary finding that it was more likely than not that parties would have provided support for their daughter's college education had the family remained intact, its failure to comply with section was harmless, given ample evidence in the record to support such a finding, and given plaintiff's failure to meet his burden of demonstrating that court's failure to make the finding was harmful. 96 CA 102. Trial court did not abuse its discretion by issuing financial order that would secure any educational support order that might be entered in future; however, portion of trial court order, that potentially would have required defendant to maintain life insurance to secure support for child who had reached age of majority and who was not beneficiary of an educational support order, reversed and remanded for clarification. 107 CA 279.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\nSubdiv. (1): Use of “shall” means it is mandatory that court inform parents that if no educational support order is entered at the time of dissolution, neither party may obtain such an order in future. 86 CA 719.\n\nSubsec. (d):\n\nThe word “shall” in subsection creates a mandatory duty on both parents to both participate in and reach an agreement upon the college their child will attend but the statute does not permit a party to evade responsibility for contributing to a child's education by engaging in acts or omissions that violate his statutory obligation. 211 CA 357.\n\nSubsec. (f):\n\nExpenses of relocating child from one state to another, including travel, restaurant meals, lodging or costs of furnishing dorm room and other living expenses, are not within scope of “necessary educational expenses”. 156 CA 383. Trial court abused its discretion by entering an educational support order that required defendant to pay expenses in excess of the amount charged by University of Connecticut for a full-time in-state student when the court made no finding that parents entered into an agreement to exceed the limit imposed by Subsec. 163 CA 517.\n\nSubsec. (h):\n\nContrary to plaintiff's claims, because pursuant to Subsec. an educational support order may be enforced in same manner as provided by law for any support order, trial court had authority to enforce the order by requiring that security be given, it acted within its discretion and authority in establishing a trust as means of securing the order, and did not abuse its discretion in funding the order with proceeds from sale of Vermont property. 96 CA 102.",

In issuing such temporary modification orders, the court shall be guided by the provisions of the general statutes pertaining to custody and visitation. Motions for temporary modification of final orders of custody or visitation because of deployment or mobilization shall be given priority for this purpose.\n\n(d) A temporary court order modifying final orders of custody or visitation issued under subsection (c) of this section shall require that: (1) Whenever the deploying parent is granted leave from such deployment or mobilization, the nondeploying parent shall make the child available to the deploying parent to the extent requested by the deploying parent, provided (A) such request for visitation time is not inconsistent with that provided for in the final orders of custody or visitation being modified by such temporary court order, and (B) the child shall not be absent from school unless ordered by the court or agreed to, in writing, by both parents; (2) the nondeploying parent facilitate opportunities for telephonic, electronic mail, and other such contact between the deploying parent and the child during deployment or mobilization; and (3) the deploying parent provide timely information regarding his or her leave schedule to the nondeploying parent. Changes in actual leave dates shall not be used by the nondeploying parent as a justification to limit contact between the deploying parent and the child.\n\n(e) A temporary court order modifying final orders of custody or visitation issued under subsection (c) of this section shall specify that deployment or mobilization is the basis for the order and shall be entered by the court as a temporary order.

      "text": "(a) As used in this section:\n\n(1) “Grandparent” means a grandparent or great-grandparent related to a minor child by (A) blood, (B) marriage, or (C) adoption of the minor child by a child of the grandparent; and\n\n(2) “Real and significant harm” means that the minor child is neglected, as defined in section 46b-120, or uncared for, as defined in said section.\n\n(b) Any person may submit a verified petition to the Superior Court for the right of visitation with any minor child. Such petition shall include specific and good-faith allegations that (1) a parent-like relationship exists between the person and the minor child, and (2) denial of visitation would cause real and significant harm. Subject to subsection (e) of this section, the court shall grant the right of visitation with any minor child to any person if the court finds after hearing and by clear and convincing evidence that a parent-like relationship exists between the person and the minor child and denial of visitation would cause real and significant harm.\n\n(c) In determining whether a parent-like relationship exists between the person and the minor child, the Superior Court may consider, but shall not be limited to, the following factors:\n\n(1) The existence and length of a relationship between the person and the minor child prior to the submission of a petition pursuant to this section;\n\n(2) The length of time that the relationship between the person and the minor child has been disrupted;\n\n(3) The specific parent-like activities of the person seeking visitation toward the minor child;\n\n(4) Any evidence that the person seeking visitation has unreasonably undermined the authority and discretion of the custodial parent;\n\n(5) The significant absence of a parent from the life of a minor child;\n\n(6) The death of one of the minor child's parents;\n\n(7) The physical separation of the parents of the minor child;\n\n(8) The fitness of the person seeking visitation; and\n\n(9) The fitness of the custodial parent.\n\n(d) In determining whether a parent-like relationship exists between a grandparent seeking visitation pursuant to this section and a minor child, the Superior Court may consider, in addition to the factors enumerated in subsection (c) of this section, the history of regular contact and proof of a close and substantial relationship between the grandparent and the minor child.\n\n(e) If the Superior Court grants the right of visitation pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the court shall set forth the terms and conditions of visitation including, but not limited to, the schedule of visitation, including the dates or days, time and place or places in which the visitation can occur, whether overnight visitation will be allowed and any other terms and conditions that the court determines are in the best interest of the minor child, provided such conditions shall not be contingent upon any order of financial support by the court. In determining the best interest of the minor child, the court shall consider the wishes of the minor child if such minor child is of sufficient age and capable of forming an intelligent opinion. In determining the terms and conditions of visitation, the court may consider (1) the effect that such visitation will have on the relationship between the parents or guardians of the minor child and the minor child, and (2) the effect on the minor child of any domestic violence that has occurred between or among parents, grandparents, persons seeking visitation and the minor child.\n\n(f) Visitation rights granted in accordance with this section shall not be deemed to have created parental rights in the person or persons to whom such visitation rights are granted, nor shall such visitation rights be a ground for preventing the relocation of the custodial parent. The grant of such visitation rights shall not prevent any court of competent jurisdiction from thereafter acting upon the custody of such child, the parental rights with respect to such child or the adoption of such child and any such court may include in its decree an order terminating such visitation rights.\n\n(g) Upon motion, the court may order the payment of fees for another party, the attorney for the minor child, the guardian ad litem, or any expert by any party in accordance with such party's financial ability.\n\n(P.A. 78-69; P.A. 79-8; P.A. 83-95; P.A. 12-137, S. 1; P.A. 13-97, S. 6.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 79-8 added proviso specifying that grant of visitation rights is not contingent upon order for financial support; P.A. 83-95 deleted provisions re visitation rights of grandparents and permitted court to grant right of visitation to any person; P.A. 12-137 deleted former provisions re granting right of visitation, orders according to court's best judgment and making, modifying or terminating orders, designated provisions re parental rights, custody and adoption as Subsec.

Trial court lacked jurisdiction to decide issue of visitation; provisions of section as they related to provisions of Secs. 46b-56 and 46b-57 discussed. 239 C. 336. Implicit in statute is rebuttable presumption that visitation that is opposed by a fit parent is not in child's best interest; for a court to have jurisdiction over petition for visitation contrary to wishes of a parent and to grant such petition, petition must contain specific, good faith allegations that petitioner has a relationship with the child that is similar in nature to a parent-child relationship and specific, good faith allegations that denial of visitation will cause real and significant harm to the child, analogous to the kind of harm contemplated by Secs. 46b-120 and 46b-129, that child is neglected, uncared-for or dependent, and petitioner must prove allegations by clear and convincing evidence; statute is unconstitutional as applied to facts in this case. 259 C. 202. Trial court did not have jurisdiction over petition for visitation pursuant to statute that is contrary to the wishes of a fit parent in the absence of allegations and proof that plaintiff had a parent-like relationship with the child and that the child would suffer real and significant harm if deprived of visitation with plaintiff. Id., 240. 259 C. 202 applies retrospectively. 272 C. 500. Where unrelated plaintiff had parent-like relationship with child sufficient for visitation rights, court improperly refused to grant visitation due to concern that defendant would cause child damage in retaliation, and court should have invoked its authority to compel defendant's compliance with visitation order; “best interest of the child” standard cannot overcome the standard in 259 C. 202 for ordering visitation. 300 C. 59.

Court may only reach the question of whether a grandparent has proven a history of regular contact and a close and substantial relationship with a grandchild pursuant to subsection (d) if grandparent made specific and good faith allegations that a parent-like relationship exists pursuant to subsection (c). 188 CA 724.\n\nSeparation of parties in same sex relationship constituted disruption of family unit and conferred standing upon plaintiff noncustodial parent to petition for visitation rights with minor child conceived through artificial insemination who had been jointly raised by coguardian same sex partners. 46 CS 165.",

Trial court had authority under section to award attorney's fees to plaintiff without first finding defendant in contempt; judgment of Appellate Court in 41 CA 861 reversed. 241 C. 490. Present case distinguishable from 222 C. 32 because here record supports finding that plaintiff either lacked liquid assets to pay attorney fees or such fees would undermine effect of the other financial orders. 245 C. 508. Section does not authorize an award of attorney's fees against grandparents or other third parties petitioning for visitation under Sec. 46b-59. 294 C. 484.

Court can award attorney's fees for appeal of case it dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 48 CA 645. Trial court properly found that defendant was liable for plaintiff's attorney's fees but improperly awarded a dollar amount for such fees without an appropriate evidentiary showing to determine the reasonableness of such award. 54 CA 634. Trial court's discretion should be guided so that its decision regarding attorney's fees does not undermine its purpose in making any other financial award. 57 CA 165. Trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering plaintiff to pay $4,000 in counsel fees to defendant to defend the appeal. 69 CA 146. Reiterated previous holdings that specific finding concerning award of attorney's fees not required if record would support a finding that the party to whom attorney's fees are charged does not have sufficient liquid assets to pay such fees or that failure to award such fees would undermine other financial orders of the court. 79 CA 783. Trial court abused its discretion in awarding plaintiff counsel fees of $100,000 because court could not reasonably have concluded that plaintiff was financially unable able to pay her counsel fees or that the failure to award such fees would undermine court's other financial orders. 82 CA 41. Trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined plaintiff lacked funds to defend appeal and ordered defendant to pay a set fee to plaintiff's attorney. 83 CA 478. Trial court judgment awarding attorney's fees award must be reversed because court's basis for award was improper. 102 CA 1. Trial court improperly decided issue regarding who drafted agreement and therefore award of counsel fees was improper. Id., 96. Although the order for payment of guardian ad litem fees requires consideration of the financial resources of both parties and the criteria set forth in Sec. 46b-82, postdissolution fault is not a factor included among those enumerated in said section, and there is no requirement that the court consider any additional factors or evidence deemed relevant by any of the parties. 107 CA 488. Court did not abuse its discretion when it considered party's litigation misconduct to form part of the basis of an award of attorney's fees for an appeal. 110 CA 798. Court did not abuse its discretion in ordering plaintiff to pay fees and counsel for guardian ad litem because section makes clear the court has power to order payment of reasonable fees regardless of whether there is a written contract or retainer agreement. 117 CA 304. Trial court not authorized to choose from which of defendant's assets fees shall be paid. 159 CA 167. Trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney's fees to the defendant because the consideration of ample liquid assets pertains to the party requesting fees, not to the party opposing the award. 168 CA 141.",

Advanced degree (medical degree) is not property subject to distribution upon dissolution of marriage but is properly classified as an expectancy rather than as presently existing property interest; definition of “property” discussed. 244 C. 158. Based on the evidence, unvested stock options were properly distributed as property under section; in accord with prior cases, in distributing property in dissolution proceeding, court must consider all statutory criteria, and no single criterion is preferred over others, but court has latitude to vary weight placed on each item; right to purchase contents of defendant's rented apartment was properly subject to distribution under section; date of dissolution of marriage is date on which to value the parties' assets in accordance with prior cases. 245 C. 508. Plaintiff's personal injury award is a property interest subject to equitable distribution under statute. 247 C. 356.

Trial court did not abuse its discretion by including in the marital property estate the entire amount received by defendant in an employment case. 265 C. 669. For purposes of determining an equitable distribution of property, the court may consider evidence that a spouse dissipated marital assets prior to the couple's physical separation as long as the actions constituting dissipation occur either in contemplation of divorce or separation, or while the marriage is in serious jeopardy or is undergoing an irretrievable breakdown. 287 C. 491.

Parties to a dissolution of marriage proceeding must disclose all potentially distributable retirement or employment benefits and may not decide for themselves whether such benefits constitute property subject to disclosure; when reviewing a dissolution of marriage judgment that pre-dates 258 C. 733, courts must consider what impact, if any, the knowledge of unvested pension benefits would have had on the outcome of the proceeding. 312 C. 428.

Financial orders cannot be logically inconsistent with factual findings. 82 CA 378. Court did not abuse discretion by awarding plaintiff a portion of stock that vested in defendant after the date of separation. 83 CA 53. Trial court's order requiring sale of marital home and barring parties from purchasing the home was equitable and did not exceed court's statutory authority under section. 84 CA 495.

Trial court properly determined plaintiff did not own the inventory in his antiques business. 102 CA 74. Court did not improperly rely on section in dividing the net partition proceeds. 108 CA 184. Nothing in section prohibits court from mending its erroneous personal property orders. 119 CA 120. Although the court has leeway in determining value of assets in a marital dissolution, a market value approach to valuation, nevertheless, necessarily requires an examination of marketability of the asset being appraised. 121 CA 659. It was within the court's authority to order defendant to repay loans and promissory notes made to plaintiff during course of their marriage and to award interest on any wrongfully withheld moneys. 123 CA 146. Court's second order altered the original property distribution from an award of the qualified domestic relations order to an award of a fixed sum to be paid out of the funds in the qualified domestic relations order as well as the sale of assets and constituted an improper postjudgment modification that exceeded court's powers under section. 125 CA 441. Nothing in section forbids a court from awarding periodic alimony to one spouse when the court has made an equitable distribution of the other spouse's closely held business. 129 CA 171. Court order requiring defendant to release plaintiff and hold him harmless from pending civil action was not error because the pending civil action was “property” subject to distribution under section and section does not require transfer of title or ownership of property in all cases. 148 CA 837. Plaintiff's interest in a limited liability company, i.e., an enforceable right to $520,000 credit for plaintiff's transfer of land to the LLC, was properly characterized as distributable property for purposes of section. 160 CA 708. Based on plain language, there is no presumption that marital property should be divided equally prior to applying the statutory criteria; the specified criteria are not exhaustive, and court properly may consider other equitable factors when crafting property distribution and alimony orders. 167 CA 138. Vested pension benefits in pay status at time of dissolution constitute property for the purposes of equitable distribution. 180 CA 64. The wilful dissipation of assets by defendant did not constitute exceptional intervening circumstances for not entering an order distributing the value of a marital asset as of the date of the original judgment of dissolution. 189 CA 353. Potential future unvested stream of income is a mere expectancy, and too speculative to be categorized as property for purposes of equitable distribution. 217 CA 530.\n\nUnliquidated personal injury action is subject to award under section. 41 CS 115.

Trial court's award of marital residence and 100 per cent of equity in the residence to plaintiff wife did not constitute abuse of discretion where defendant husband was not ordered to pay alimony and retained his pensions free from any claim of plaintiff wife. 101 CA 106. Court does not have authority to modify division of property once the dissolution becomes final; court's subsequent modification of arbitrator's decision and award concerning transfer of property and court's order to defendant to pay a specific monetary amount rather than to transfer the actual stock and options that had been previously awarded to plaintiff was improper. 132 CA 291.\n\nSubsec.

The order may direct that security be given therefor on such terms as the court may deem desirable, including an order pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or an order to either party to contract with a third party for periodic payments or payments contingent on a life to the other party. The court may order that a party obtain life insurance as such security unless such party proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, that such insurance is not available to such party, such party is unable to pay the cost of such insurance or such party is uninsurable. In determining whether alimony shall be awarded, and the duration and amount of the award, the court shall consider the evidence presented by each party and shall consider the length of the marriage, the causes for the annulment, dissolution of the marriage or legal separation, the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, earning capacity, vocational skills, education, employability, estate and needs of each of the parties and the award, if any, which the court may make pursuant to section 46b-81, and, in the case of a parent to whom the custody of minor children has been awarded, the desirability and feasibility of such parent's securing employment.\n\n(b) If the court, following a trial or hearing on the merits, enters an order pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, or section 46b-86, and such order by its terms will terminate only upon the death of either party or the remarriage of the alimony recipient, the court shall articulate with specificity the basis for such order.\n\n(c) Any postjudgment procedure afforded by chapter 906 shall be available to secure the present and future financial interests of a party in connection with a final order for the periodic payment of alimony.\n\n(P.A. 73-373, S. 21; P.A. 78-230, S. 37, 54; P.A. 83-527, S. 1; P.A. 03-130, S. 3; 03-202, S. 23; P.A. 13-213, S. 3.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 78-230 restated provisions; Sec. 46-52 transferred to Sec. 46b-82 in 1979 and references to other sections within provisions revised as necessary to reflect their transfer; P.A. 83-527 added provision that court may order either party to contract with a third party for periodic payments or payments contingent on a life to the other party; P.A. 03-130 designated existing provisions as Subsec.

Life insurance is not a necessary form of security to assure payment of periodic alimony. 51 CA 530. Court order limiting duration of alimony payments to 10 years held not improper. 54 CA 304. Trial court may exercise broad discretion in awarding alimony. 57 CA 165. Plaintiff cannot succeed in claim that he is entitled to immediate appellate review of denial of his motion to dismiss on the proposition that section deprives any trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over a request for postjudgment alimony absent finding of a substantial change in circumstances where plaintiff's argument of lack of statutory jurisdiction does not support claim of lack of subject matter jurisdiction and appeal does not pass theState v. Curciotest. 61 CA 112. If party asserts health an issue in claim for alimony and is receiving Social Security disability benefits, such assertion can be refuted by introduction of evidence relevant to health. 66 CA 16. Court unable to discern whether contributions from parents were gifts or loans regarding motion to modify alimony and child support awards. 69 CA 251. Court not required to reference expressly the statutory criteria it considered in awarding alimony. Id., 472. Capital gains generated by an asset distributed in dissolution decree do not fall within purview of section; if an asset is property acquired by plaintiff after the dissolution, and, therefore, not distributed as part of the property assignment, then it is income that must be considered by court in an alimony modification; capital gains tax realized on sale of asset acquired after dissolution may be considered by court in determining whether there has been a substantial change in circumstances; appreciation of an asset that was distributed at time of dissolution does not constitute a change in circumstances that court may consider when deciding whether to entertain a motion for modification of alimony. 70 CA 772. In considering “amount and sources of income”, court cannot ignore fact that defendant receives a substantial year-end bonus simply because it is not received until the following year; provision does not require court to structure payment of alimony and child support to accommodate payor's compensation schedule. 71 CA 614. Duration of alimony in context of length of the marriage was not a properly considered “equitable factor”. 79 CA 488. Financial orders cannot be logically inconsistent with factual findings. 82 CA 378. Trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined plaintiff lacked funds to defend appeal and ordered defendant to pay a set fee to plaintiff's attorney. 83 CA 478. Court statements re consideration of criteria for alimony means it considered and decided issue of alimony even though there was no express finding on alimony. 85 CA 772. Court must consider all statutory criteria but is free to accord whatever weight it determines appropriate to each statutory factor. 86 CA 665. Trial court properly considered defendant's cohabitation in relation to her financial situation in analyzing statutory factors and determining whether modification of alimony was warranted. 88 CA 674. Defendant's argument that court ignored several factors is unavailing since court is not required to make explicit reference to the statutory criteria that it considered in making its decision or to make express findings as to each statutory factor. 107 CA 488. Court abused its discretion by failing to award time limited or rehabilitative alimony to plaintiff who was found to be responsible for certain debts but could be in dire financial straits due to her inability to increase her earning capacity, receive alimony or receive a portion of the marital property. 125 CA 265. Real property may serve as security for the court's alimony award under section despite language in the prenuptial agreement prohibiting the transfer of interest in premarital net worth that includes such real property. 136 CA 773. A court must base its alimony orders on a case-by-case basis the available net income of the parties, not gross income, and a court may differentiate between an order that is a function of gross income and one that is based on gross income. 189 CA 353.\n\nCited. 41 CS 115.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nAppellate Court's conclusion that trial court improperly relied on total length of parties' relationship in crafting its financial orders was supported by record; under Sec. 46b-81(c) and this Subsec., a court shall consider length of parties' marriage, which does not include prior marriages or cohabitation preceding marriage. 280 C. 632.\n\nPrior marriage and cohabitation between parties before their remarriage to each other are not to be included when calculating “length of the marriage” in remarriage divorce proceedings. 93 CA 618. Defendant's annual bonus constituted an “amount and source of income” that court should have considered when determining division of marital property and awarding alimony and child support, and matter should be remanded for recalculation of all awards even though child support award was calculated correctly. 98 CA 706. Court must consider all statutory criteria but there is no additional requirement that court specifically state how it weighed statutory criteria or explain in detail the importance assigned to each statutory factor. 99 CA 326.",

Upon the filing of a motion requesting an initial order of alimony or support pendente lite that is accompanied by an affidavit, on a form prescribed by the Chief Court Administrator, by the moving party attesting that (1) the moving party has insufficient funds to meet the moving party's reasonable needs or the reasonable needs of the minor children of the parties, (2) the other party is not providing sufficient funds to the moving party to meet such reasonable needs, and (3) the moving party reasonably believes that the other party has sufficient means or earning capacity to so provide, then such hearing shall be held by the court not later than sixty days after the date on which such motion requesting an initial order of alimony or support pendente lite and accompanying affidavit were filed. In the event that such hearing requires a continuance to another date, the court shall give calendar priority to scheduling such hearing on a date that facilitates the expeditious resumption and conclusion of the hearing, absent a written agreement or interim orders that provide for such alimony or support pendente lite. In the event of a delay necessitated by a court closure or emergency experienced by a party, such hearing shall be rescheduled to a date that is not later than fourteen days after the date of the originally scheduled hearing date. Full credit shall be given for all sums paid to one party by the other from the date of the filing of such a motion to the date of rendition of such order. In making an order for alimony pendente lite, the court shall consider all factors enumerated in section 46b-82, except the grounds for the complaint or cross complaint, to be considered with respect to a permanent award of alimony. In making an order for support pendente lite, the court shall consider all factors enumerated in section 46b-84. The court may also award exclusive use of the family home or any other dwelling unit which is available for use as a residence pendente lite to either of the parties as is just and equitable without regard to the respective interests of the parties in the property.

The provisions of this subsection shall apply only in cases where the decree of dissolution of marriage, legal separation or annulment is entered on or after July 1, 1994.\n\n(c) (1) The court may make appropriate orders of support of any child with intellectual disability, as defined in section 1-1g, or a mental disability, as defined in section 46a-51, or who is physically disabled, as defined in section 46a-51, who resides with a parent and is principally dependent upon such parent for maintenance until such child attains the age of twenty-one. The provisions of this subdivision shall apply only in cases where the decree of dissolution of marriage, legal separation or annulment is entered on or after October 1, 1997, and before October 1, 2023, or where the initial support orders in actions not claiming any such decree are entered on or after October 1, 1997, and before October 1, 2023. (2) The court may make appropriate orders of support of any child with intellectual disability, as defined in section 1-1g, or a mental disability, as defined in section 46a-51, or who is physically disabled, as defined in section 46a-51, who resides with a parent and is principally dependent upon such parent for maintenance until such child attains the age of twenty-six.

(3) The child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a shall not apply to any order entered under this subsection.\n\n(d) In determining whether a child is in need of maintenance and, if in need, the respective abilities of the parents to provide such maintenance and the amount thereof, the court shall consider the age, health, station, occupation, earning capacity, amount and sources of income, estate, vocational skills and employability of each of the parents, and the age, health, station, occupation, educational status and expectation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate and needs of the child.\n\n(e) At any time at which orders are entered in a proceeding for dissolution of marriage, annulment, legal separation, custody, or support, whether before, at the time of, or after entry of a decree or judgment, if health insurance coverage for a child is ordered by the court to be maintained, the court shall provide in the order that (1) the signature of the custodial parent or custodian of the insured dependent shall constitute a valid authorization to the insurer for purposes of processing an insurance reimbursement payment to the provider of the medical services, to the custodial parent or to the custodian, (2) neither parent shall prevent or interfere with the timely processing of any insurance reimbursement claim and (3) if the parent receiving an insurance reimbursement payment is not the parent or custodian who is paying the bill for the services of the medical provider, the parent receiving such insurance reimbursement payment shall promptly pay to the parent or custodian paying such bill any insurance reimbursement for such services. For purposes of subdivision (1), the custodial parent or custodian is responsible for providing the insurer with a certified copy of the order of dissolution or other order requiring maintenance of insurance for a child provided if such custodial parent or custodian fails to provide the insurer with a copy of such order, the Commissioner of Social Services may provide the insurer with a copy of such order. Such insurer may thereafter rely on such order and is not responsible for inquiring as to the legal sufficiency of the order. The custodial parent or custodian shall be responsible for providing the insurer with a certified copy of any order which materially alters the provision of the original order with respect to the maintenance of insurance for a child. If presented with an insurance reimbursement claim signed by the custodial parent or custodian, such insurer shall reimburse the provider of the medical services, if payment is to be made to such provider under the policy, or shall otherwise reimburse the custodial parent or custodian.\n\n(f) (1) After the granting of a decree annulling or dissolving the marriage or ordering a legal separation, and upon complaint or motion with order and summons made to the Superior Court by either parent or by the Commissioner of Administrative Services in any case arising under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, the court shall inquire into the child's need of maintenance and the respective abilities of the parents to supply maintenance. The court shall make and enforce the decree for the maintenance of the child as it considers just, and may direct security to be given therefor, including an order to either party to contract with a third party for periodic payments or payments contingent on a life to the other party. The court may order that a party obtain life insurance as such security unless such party proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, that such insurance is not available to such party, such party is unable to pay the cost of such insurance or such party is uninsurable.\n\n(2) The court shall include in each support order a provision for the health care coverage of the child who is subject to the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) of this section. Such provision may include an order for either parent or both parents to provide such coverage under any or all of subparagraphs (A), (B) or (C) of this subdivision.\n\n(A) The provision for health care coverage may include an order for either parent to name any child as a beneficiary of any medical or dental insurance or benefit plan carried by such parent or available to such parent at a reasonable cost, as described in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. If such order in a IV-D support case requires the parent to maintain insurance available through an employer, the order shall be enforced using a National Medical Support Notice as provided in section 46b-88.\n\n(B) The provision for health care coverage may include an order for either parent to: (i) Apply for and maintain coverage on behalf of the child under HUSKY B; or (ii) provide cash medical support, as described in subparagraphs (E) and (F) of this subdivision. An order under this subparagraph shall be made only if the cost to the parent obligated to maintain the coverage under HUSKY B or provide cash medical support is reasonable, as described in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. An order under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be made only if insurance coverage as described in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision is unavailable at reasonable cost to either parent, or inaccessible to the child.\n\n(C) An order for payment of the child's medical and dental expenses, other than those described in clause (ii) of subparagraph (E) of this subdivision, that are not covered by insurance or reimbursed in any other manner shall be entered in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a.\n\n(D) Health care coverage shall be deemed reasonable in cost if: (i) The parent obligated to maintain such coverage would qualify as a low-income obligor under the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a, based solely on such parent's income, and the cost does not exceed five per cent of such parent's net income; or (ii) the parent obligated to maintain such coverage would not qualify as a low-income obligor under such guidelines and the cost does not exceed seven and one-half per cent of such parent's net income. In either case, net income shall be determined in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a. If a parent obligated to maintain insurance must obtain coverage for himself or herself to comply with the order to provide coverage for the child, reasonable cost shall be determined based on the combined cost of coverage for such parent and such child.\n\n(E) Cash medical support means: (i) An amount ordered to be paid toward the cost of premiums for health insurance coverage provided by a public entity, including HUSKY A or B, except as provided in subparagraph (F) of this subdivision, or by another parent through employment or otherwise, or (ii) an amount ordered to be paid, either directly to a medical provider or to the person obligated to pay such provider, toward any ongoing extraordinary medical and dental expenses of the child that are not covered by insurance or reimbursed in any other manner, provided such expenses are documented and identified (I) specifically on the record, or (II) in an affidavit, made under oath, that states no restraining order issued pursuant to section 46b-15 or protective order issued pursuant to section 46b-38c, between the parties is in effect or pending before the court. Cash medical support, as described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph may be ordered in lieu of an order under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision to be effective until such time as health insurance that is accessible to the child and reasonable in cost becomes available, or in addition to an order under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, provided the combined cost of insurance and cash medical support is reasonable, as defined in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. An order for cash medical support shall be payable to the state or the custodial party, as their interests may appear, provided an order under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be effective only as long as health insurance coverage is maintained. Any unreimbursed medical and dental expenses not covered by an order issued pursuant to clause (ii) of this subparagraph are subject to an order for unreimbursed medical and dental expenses pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this subdivision.\n\n(F) Cash medical support to offset the cost of any insurance payable under HUSKY A or B, shall not be ordered against a noncustodial parent who is a low-income obligor, as defined in the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a, or against a custodial parent of children covered under HUSKY A or B.\n\n(g) Whenever an obligor is before the court in proceedings to establish, modify or enforce a support order, and such order is not secured by an income withholding order, the court may require the obligor to execute a bond or post other security sufficient to perform such order for support, provided the court finds that such a bond is available for purchase within the financial means of the obligor. Upon failure of such obligor to comply with such support order, the court may order the bond or the security forfeited and the proceeds thereof distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act. In any IV-D case in which the obligor is found by the court to owe past-due support, the court may issue an order for the periodic payment of such support or, if such obligor is not incapacitated, order such obligor to participate in work activities which may include, but shall not be limited to, job search, training, work experience and participation in the job training and retraining program established by the Labor Commissioner pursuant to section 31-3t.\n\n(h) In IV-D support cases, as defined in subdivision (13) of subsection (b) of section 46b-231, a copy of any support order established or modified pursuant to this section or, in the case of a motion for modification of an existing support order, a notice of determination that there should be no change in the amount of the support order, shall be provided to each party and the state case registry within fourteen days after issuance of such order or determination.\n\n(P.A. 73-373, S. 26; P.A. 74-169, S. 14, 18; P.A. 77-614, S. 70, 610; P.A. 78-230, S. 42, 54; P.A. 83-527, S. 2; P.A. 84-205, S. 1; 84-230; P.A. 87-207, S. 2; P.A. 89-195, S. 2; P.A. 91-4, S. 1, 2; P.A. 94-61, S. 1, 2; May Sp.

      "text": "(a) Unless and to the extent that the decree precludes modification, any final order for the periodic payment of permanent alimony or support, an order for alimony or support pendente lite or an order requiring either party to maintain life insurance for the other party or a minor child of the parties may, at any time thereafter, be continued, set aside, altered or modified by the court upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party or upon a showing that the final order for child support substantially deviates from the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a, unless there was a specific finding on the record at a hearing, or in a written judgment, order or memorandum of decision of the court, that the application of the guidelines would be inequitable or inappropriate. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any deviation of less than fifteen per cent from the child support guidelines is not substantial and any deviation of fifteen per cent or more from the guidelines is substantial. Modification may be made of such support order without regard to whether the order was issued before, on or after May 9, 1991. In determining whether to modify a child support order based on a substantial deviation from such child support guidelines the court shall consider the division of real and personal property between the parties set forth in the final decree and the benefits accruing to the child as the result of such division. After the date of judgment, modification of any child support order issued before, on or after July 1, 1990, may be made upon a showing of such substantial change of circumstances, whether or not such change of circumstances was contemplated at the time of dissolution. By written agreement, stipulation or decision of the court, those items or circumstances that were contemplated and are not to be changed may be specified in the written agreement, stipulation or decision of the court. This section shall not apply to assignments under section 46b-81 or to any assignment of the estate or a portion thereof of one party to the other party under prior law. No order for periodic payment of permanent alimony or support may be subject to retroactive modification, except that the court may order modification with respect to any period during which there is a pending motion for modification of an alimony or support order from the date of service of notice of such pending motion upon the opposing party pursuant to section 52-50. If a court finds that a substantial change in circumstances of either party has occurred, the court shall determine what modification of alimony, if any, is appropriate, considering the criteria set forth in section 46b-82.\n\n(b) In an action for divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal separation or annulment brought by a spouse, in which a final judgment has been entered providing for the payment of periodic alimony by one party to the other spouse, the Superior Court may, in its discretion and upon notice and hearing, modify such judgment and suspend, reduce or terminate the payment of periodic alimony upon a showing that the party receiving the periodic alimony is living with another person under circumstances which the court finds should result in the modification, suspension, reduction or termination of alimony because the living arrangements cause such a change of circumstances as to alter the financial needs of that party. In the event that a final judgment incorporates a provision of an agreement in which the parties agree to circumstances, other than as provided in this subsection, under which alimony will be modified, including suspension, reduction, or termination of alimony, the court shall enforce the provision of such agreement and enter orders in accordance therewith.\n\n(c) When one of the parties, or a child of the parties, is receiving or has received aid or care from the state under its aid to families with dependent children or temporary family assistance program, HUSKY A, or foster care program as provided in Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, or when one of the parties has applied for child support enforcement services under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act as provided in section 17b-179, such motion to modify shall be filed with the Family Support Magistrate Division for determination in accordance with subsection (m) of section 46b-231.\n\n(P.A. 73-373, S. 23; P.A. 78-230, S. 39, 54; P.A. 86-359, S. 2, 44; P.A. 87-104; P.A. 89-360, S. 12, 45; P.A. 90-188, S. 1; 90-213, S. 46, 56; P.A. 91-76, S. 1, 7; June 18 Sp.

(c) to change “HUSKY Plan, Part A” to “HUSKY A”, effective June 19, 2015; P.A. 21-104 amended Subsec.

When the only substantial change in circumstances after an alimony award has been made is an increase in the income of the paying spouse, a modification of the alimony award is ordinarily not justified if the original award was and continues to be sufficient to fulfill the original purpose for which it was made; when determining whether an alimony award should be modified when the only change in circumstances is an increase in the supporting spouse's income, the trial court may consider factors such as length of marriage, cause of the divorce, and other factors presumptively considered in determining the purpose and amount of the initial alimony award and that have not changed since that time, only to shed light on the intent of the initial award, and such reasons should not be considered as reasons for changing the purpose of the initial award. 315 C. 1.\n\nCited. 1 CA 172; Id., 337; 2 CA 472; 3 CA 25.

Defendant deemed to have waived claim for support modification by not claiming that trial court abused its discretion in unjustified deviation from child support guidelines in support order. 248 C. 487. Statute permits court to alter order for alimony only in absence of nonmodification clause that would extend to bar requested change. 285 C. 687. In cases in which primary physical custody is transferred from the party receiving the unallocated alimony and support payments to the party making the payments, a nonmodification provision in the parties' separation agreement does not prevent the modification of the unallocated order in an amount attributable to child support; to the extent that the application of the specific language of Sec. 46b-224 to suspend or modify a support order that purports to preclude modification appears to conflict with the general language of this Subsec., Sec. 46b-224 must prevail. 305 C. 539. When considering a motion for modification under Subsec., court must first determine whether moving party has established a substantial change in circumstances, and, in making such determination, if party's voluntary action gave rise to the alleged substantial change in circumstances warranting modification, court must assess motivations underlying the voluntary conduct in order to determine if there is culpable conduct of the party to preclude a determination of substantial change in circumstances; crux of inquiry is culpability not voluntariness. 310 C. 665.

Trial court has authority to determine, sua sponte, whether an award is alimony or support, or a property settlement; trial court may find that an obligation was intended as property settlement made pursuant to Sec. 46b-81 and therefore nonmodifiable pursuant to this Subsec., despite the fact that a judgment has conditions attached terminating the obligation, or that there is a later stipulation modifying the obligation. 54 CA 142. Retroactive modification of alimony pendente lite orders by the pendente lite court prior to dissolution judgment held not improper. Id., 304. Child support award found not to be modifiable even though it exceeded presumptive amount set by the child support guidelines in case in which defendant's gross earnings did not increase and the parties had agreement that limited modification to a change in circumstances reflecting an increase in gross earnings in excess of a specified amount. 56 CA 459. Alimony may be suspended under statute where there is a distinct separation agreement. 59 CA 628. Statute deprives Superior Court of continuing jurisdiction over that portion of a dissolution judgment providing for assignment of property of one party to the other party under Sec. 46b-81; court improperly applied the law and abused its discretion by modifying child support order without first finding that there was a substantial change in the circumstances of one of the parties. 70 CA 212. “Pending motion” as used in Subsec. means “remaining undecided”. 88 CA 246. Plaintiff failed to demonstrate, as required by the consent to judgment, that defendant was gainfully employed and therefore there was no substantial change in circumstances; trial court was effectively precluded from granting plaintiff any relief. 102 CA 1. Court may increase plaintiff's alimony based on motion to increase alimony under Subsec. despite defendant's motion to reduce or terminate alimony under Subsec. (b). 124 CA 472. Court abused its discretion in failing to find the presumptive amount of child support pursuant to the guidelines and in issuing the combined child support order without justifying a deviation from the guidelines. 132 CA 291. Court abused its discretion by granting plaintiff's motion to modify alimony when plaintiff's employment situation had not changed since the original judgment of dissolution and court could not reasonably find that there was a decrease in plaintiff's earning capacity that constituted a substantial change in plaintiff's financial circumstances. Id., 339. Defendant failed to meet burden of showing a substantial change in circumstances that was not tainted by his culpable conduct of commingling his assets with those of his new spouse and making large gifts to his new spouse and to his children without consideration. 136 CA 210. If a party makes a preliminary showing that an affidavit submitted at the time of dissolution was inaccurate, that the error was not intentional or misleading, and that it would be inequitable to rely only on the mistaken information, a postdissolution court may consider factors other than the financial affidavit to determine if there has been a substantial change of circumstances. 156 CA 739. Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter postdissolution orders modifying property distribution provisions in a judgment of dissolution even when parties submitted a stipulation requiring that the court modify the order. 157 CA 587; judgment reversed, see 322 C. 757. To the extent that Sec. 46b-224 conflicts with general provisions of Subsec. precluding retroactive modification of child support unless service of process requirement in Sec. 52-50 is satisfied, Sec. 46b-224 must prevail; while child support portion of unallocated support award was subject to retroactive modification, court lacked authority to retroactively modify alimony portion of unallocated support award or supplemental bonus alimony award due to defendant's failure to provide plaintiff with proper service of motion to modify in accordance with Sec. 52-50. 161 CA 271. Provisions for the payment of child care costs are part of an order of child support and are subject to the prohibition against retroactive modification under section. 164 CA 665. Subsec. does not require court to make a modification retroactive to the date of service of the motion for modification. 172 CA 767. Subsec. limits court discretion to modify a support order with retroactive effect to the date upon which the motion to modify was served upon the opposing party. 176 CA 658.\n\nCited. 41 CS 100; 44 CS 431.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\nCited. 185 C. 42; 186 C. 167; 191 C. 328. Trial court cannot on its own initiative consider alimony termination under statute; notice required by a written motion. Id., 468. Cited. 192 C. 443; 237 C. 481. Despite a divorce dissolution judgment that provided for termination of alimony upon recipient's “cohabitation” with an unmarried male, trial court was properly guided by statute's requirement that there be a change in financial circumstance prior to termination of alimony. 247 C. 715. Plaintiff had to demonstrate that defendant's remarriage had a financial impact pursuant to the dissolution judgment, even though statute only references cohabitation; legislative intent has no bearing on whether parties or dissolution court can invoke statute for a different purpose in an agreement or decree. 276 C. 491.\n\nWithout written notice, the court has no authority to terminate periodic alimony under statute. 1 CA 356, 361. Cited. 4 CA 165; 5 CA 198; 7 CA 92; Id., 361; 8 CA 356; 17 CA 291; 32 CA 147; 40 CA 570; 41 CA 716; 46 CA 327. Judgment of dissolution provision supersedes statutory provision re payment of alimony. 47 CA 729. Although plaintiff established that defendant was cohabiting with another person, he failed to show that defendant's financial needs had been altered as a result of the cohabitation, thus trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying motion to modify or terminate periodic alimony. 67 CA 628. Once court finds cohabitation and a change in financial needs of the party receiving alimony and cohabitating, court must consider factors listed in Sec. 46b-82. 91 CA 840. Trial court properly rejected defendant's claim that his cohabitation with another woman served as a proper ground for modification of alimony as to term. 102 CA 90. When court, in setting alimony award pursuant to Sec. 46b-82, quantifies person's financial needs in terms of dollar amounts at time of dissolution, proper way for court to subsequently determine whether such person's financial needs have changed as a result of cohabitation is to quantify such person's financial needs in terms of dollar amounts during period of cohabitation. 109 CA 316. Subsec. does not require a court to reduce alimony if a party proves that the other party's financial circumstances have changed as a result of his or her choice to live with another person; there is no language in Subsec. to preclude a party who is receiving alimony from pursuing a motion to increase alimony. 124 CA 472. Divorce judgment requiring payment of alimony only until date of cohabitation required court to terminate alimony as of that date despite discretion under section to modify or amend in other cases. 144 CA 319; judgment affirmed, see 316 C. 182. Trial court interpreted Subsec. too narrowly by focusing on lack of proof of financial contributions made by defendant's boyfriend, with whom she was living, to the exclusion of defendant's savings as a result of moving in with boyfriend. 181 CA 716.\n\nCited. 45 CS 94.",

Statute does not contain any requirement that an award of attorney's fees must be determined with reference to relative financial positions of the parties. 71 CA 744. Award of attorney's fees is within discretion of trial court. 72 CA 408. Award of attorney's fees in contempt proceeding is punitive in nature and court may consider defendant's behavior as an additional factor in determining both the necessity of awarding such fees and the proper amount of the award. 110 CA 798. The court's order for the plaintiff to reimburse defendant for certain expenses under the agreement does not impact the court's ability to award attorney's fees to the plaintiff as the prevailing party on the issue of contempt, even when there is not finding of contempt, and when the defendant did not exercise good faith incurring certain expenses not covered by the agreement. 215 CA 24.\n\nAgreement of parties to submit to arbitration cannot deprive court of jurisdiction to issue contempt order prescribed by statute. 36 CS 266.",

      "heading": "National Medical Support Notice. Duties of issuing agency, employer and administrator of group health plan.",
      "text": "(a) For the purposes of this section:\n\n(1) “Issuing agency” means an agency providing child support enforcement services, as defined in subsection (b) of section 46b-231, and includes the Office of Child Support Services within the Department of Social Services and Support Enforcement Services within Judicial Branch Court Operations; and\n\n(2) “NMSN” means the National Medical Support Notice required under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act used by state child support agencies to enforce health care coverage support provisions in child support orders.\n\n(b) (1) Whenever a court or family support magistrate enters a support order in a Title IV-D support case, as defined in subsection (b) of section 46b-231, that requires a noncustodial parent to provide employment-based health care coverage for a child, and the noncustodial parent's employer is known to the issuing agency, such agency shall enforce the health care coverage provisions of the order through the use of a NMSN. The issuing agency may also use the NMSN to enforce provisions of the support order requiring the custodial parent to provide employment-based health coverage for the child.\n\n(2) In addition to other notice and requirements contained therein, the NMSN shall serve as notice to the employer that: (A) The employee is obligated to provide employment-based health care coverage for the child; (B) the employer may be required to withhold any employee contributions required by the group health plan or plans in which the child is eligible to be enrolled; and (C) the employer is required to forward the NMSN to the administrator of each group health plan providing such coverage for enrollment determination purposes.\n\n(3) In addition to other notice requirements contained therein, the NMSN shall serve as notice to the group health plan that: (A) Receipt of the NMSN from an employer constitutes receipt of a medical support order; and (B) an appropriately completed NMSN constitutes a qualified medical child support order for health care coverage enrollment purposes.\n\n(4) In any case in which the noncustodial parent is a newly hired employee, the NMSN shall be transferred by the issuing agency to the employer no later than two business days after the date of the entry of the employee in the State Directory of New Hires established under section 31-254, together with any necessary income withholding notice.\n\n(c) (1) An employer who receives a NMSN from the issuing agency shall: (A) No later than twenty business days, after the date of NMSN, either (i) return the notice to such agency indicating why the health care coverage is not available, or (ii) transfer the notice to the administrator of each appropriate group health plan for which the child may be eligible; (B) upon notification from any such group health plan that the child is eligible for enrollment, withhold from the employee's income any employee contribution required under such plan and send the withheld payments directly to the plan, except as provided in subsection (d) of this section; and (C) notify the issuing agency whenever the employee's employment terminates. (2) Any employer who discharges an employee from employment, refuses to employ, or takes disciplinary action against an employee because of a medical child support withholding, or fails to withhold income or transmit withheld income to the group health plan as required by the NMSN shall be subject to the penalties related to employer processing of child support income withholding, as provided in subsections (f) and (j) of section 52-362. (3) The issuing agency shall notify the employer promptly when there is no longer a current order for medical support.\n\n(d) The NMSN shall inform the employer of the duration of the withholding requirement, of any limitations on withholding prescribed by federal or state law, and of any withholding priorities that apply when available income is insufficient to satisfy all cash and medical support obligations. A withholding for medical support obligations shall take priority over all support obligations other than current child and spousal support. The employer shall notify the issuing agency when any such withholding limitations or priorities prevent the employer from withholding the amount required to obtain coverage under the group health plan for which the child is otherwise eligible.\n\n(e) (1) The administrator of a group health plan who receives a NMSN from an employer pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall deem the NMSN to be a “qualified medical child support order” and an application by the issuing agency for enrollment of the child. Enrollment of the child may not be denied because the child: (A) Was born out of wedlock, (B) is not claimed as a dependent on the participant's federal income tax return, (C) does not reside with the participant or in the plan's service area, or (D) is receiving benefits or is eligible for benefits under a state medical assistance plan required by the Social Security Act. An enrollment shall be made without regard to open season enrollment restrictions, and if enrollment of a child is dependent on the enrollment of a participant who is not enrolled, both the child and the participant shall be enrolled. (2) No later than forty business days after the date of the NMSN the plan administrator shall notify the issuing agency whether coverage is available or, if necessary, of the steps to be taken to begin such coverage. The administrator shall also provide to the custodial parent a description of the coverage available and of any forms or documents necessary to begin coverage. The issuing agency, in consultation with the custodial parent, shall promptly select from any available plan options when necessary. Upon completion of enrollment, the group health plan administrator shall return the NMSN to the employer for a determination of whether any necessary employee contributions are available.\n\n(f) A NMSN issued pursuant to this section shall be deemed part of the court order requiring employment-based health care coverage. The NMSN shall have the same force and effect as a court order directed to an employer or group health plan administrator and may be enforced by the court or family support magistrate in the same manner as an order of the court or family support magistrate. The requirements imposed on employers and group health plan administrators under this section and the NMSN shall be in addition to any requirements imposed on said employer or administrator under other provisions of the general statutes.\n\n(May 9 Sp. Sess. P.A. 02-7, S. 38; P.A. 07-247, S. 8, 9; P.A. 16-13, S. 7.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 07-247 amended Subsec. (b)(1) by providing that issuing agency may use NMSN to enforce provisions of support order requiring custodial parent to provide employment-based health coverage for the child and amended Subsec. (d) by specifying that withholding order for medical support obligations takes priority over all support obligations other than current child support and spousal support; P.A. 16-13 amended Subsec. (a)(1) to replace “Bureau of Child Support Enforcement” with “Office of Child Support Services”, effective May 6, 2016.\n\nSee Sec. 17b-745 re court orders for support of persons supported by state.\n\nSee Sec. 38a-497a re group coverage and benefits of a noncustodial parent.\n\nSee Sec. 46b-84 re parents' obligation for maintenance of minor child.\n\nSee Sec. 46b-215 re relatives obliged to furnish support.\n\nSee Sec. 46b-569 re judgment and order of court or family support magistrate.",
