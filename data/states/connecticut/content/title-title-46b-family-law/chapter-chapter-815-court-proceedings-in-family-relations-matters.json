Subdiv. (8): Does not confer parents, acting as grandparents, whose son's parental rights have been terminated, the authorization to bring a habeas corpus petition to seek custody of a grandchild. 47 CS 273. Superior Court does have jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a Probate Court change of name proceeding; when the question presented is whether name of a minor child should be changed, the court, in line with its universal duty to protect the interests of minors, must take into consideration whether the change of name will promote the child's best welfare. 48 CS 647.",

In the event that the parties (A) fail to timely provide the court with the name of the person to serve as counsel or guardian ad litem, or (B) cannot agree on the name of the person to serve as counsel or guardian ad litem, the court shall appoint counsel or a guardian ad litem for the minor child by selecting one person from the fifteen names provided to the parties.\n\n(b) The provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall not apply when: (1) The parties have requested that counsel or a guardian ad litem be appointed and present to the court a written agreement that contains the name of the person who the parties have selected to serve as counsel or a guardian ad litem for the minor child for their matter; or (2) an emergency situation requires the immediate appointment of counsel or a guardian ad litem for the minor child.\n\n(c) Not later than twenty-one days following the date on which the court enters an initial order appointing counsel or a guardian ad litem for any minor child pursuant to this section, the court shall enter a subsequent order that includes the following information: (1) The specific nature of the work that is to be undertaken by such counsel or guardian ad litem; (2) the date on which the appointment of such counsel or guardian ad litem is to end, provided such end date may be extended for good cause shown pursuant to an order of the court; (3) the deadline for such counsel or guardian ad litem to report back to the court concerning the work undertaken; (4) the fee schedule of such counsel or guardian ad litem that shall minimally set forth (A) the amount of the retainer, (B) the hourly rate to be charged, (C) the apportionment of the retainer and hourly fees between the parties, and (D) if applicable, all provisions related to the calculation of fees on a sliding-scale basis; and (5) a proposed schedule of periodic court review of the work undertaken by such counsel or guardian ad litem and the fees charged by such counsel or guardian ad litem. Periodic court review shall be undertaken not less than every three months following the date of the appointment of such counsel or guardian ad litem, unless such periodic court review is waived by the parties and any such counsel or guardian ad litem pursuant to a written agreement filed with the court. Not later than thirty days after the entry of a final judgment in a family relations matter involving counsel or a guardian ad litem for a minor child, such counsel or guardian ad litem shall file with the court an affidavit that sets forth (A) the case name, (B) the case docket number, and (C) the hourly fee charged, total number of hours billed, expenses billed and the total amount charged by such counsel or guardian ad litem.
