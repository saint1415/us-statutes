If such child is unmarried and a full-time high school student, such support shall continue according to the parents' respective abilities, if such child is in need of support, until such child completes the twelfth grade or attains the age of nineteen, whichever occurs first.\n\n(2) Any such support order in a IV-D support case shall include a provision for the health care coverage of the child. Such provision may include an order for either parent or both parents to provide such coverage under any or all of subparagraphs (A), (B) or (C) of this subdivision.\n\n(A) The provision for health care coverage may include an order for either parent to name any child as a beneficiary of any medical or dental insurance or benefit plan carried by such parent or available to such parent at a reasonable cost, as defined in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. If such order requires the parent to maintain insurance available through an employer, the order shall be enforced using a National Medical Support Notice as provided in section 46b-88.\n\n(B) The provision for health care coverage may include an order for either parent to: (i) Apply for and maintain coverage on behalf of the child under the HUSKY Plan, Part B; or (ii) provide cash medical support, as described in subparagraphs (E) and (F) of this subdivision. An order under this subparagraph shall be made only if the cost to the parent obligated to maintain coverage under the HUSKY Plan, Part B, or provide cash medical support is reasonable, as defined in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. An order under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be made only if insurance coverage as described in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision is unavailable at reasonable cost to either parent, or inaccessible to the child.\n\n(C) An order for payment of the child's medical and dental expenses, other than those described in clause (ii) of subparagraph (E) of this subdivision, that are not covered by insurance or reimbursed in any other manner shall be entered in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a.\n\n(D) Health care coverage shall be deemed reasonable in cost if: (i) The parent obligated to maintain such coverage would qualify as a low-income obligor under the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a, based solely on such parent's income, and the cost does not exceed five per cent of such parent's net income; or (ii) the parent obligated to maintain such coverage would not qualify as a low-income obligor under such guidelines and the cost does not exceed seven and one-half per cent of such parent's net income. In either case, net income shall be determined in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a. If a parent obligated to maintain insurance must obtain coverage for himself or herself to comply with the order to provide coverage for the child, reasonable cost shall be determined based on the combined cost of coverage for such parent and such child.\n\n(E) Cash medical support means (i) an amount ordered to be paid toward the cost of premiums for health insurance coverage provided by a public entity, including the HUSKY Plan, Part A or Part B, except as provided in subparagraph (F) of this subdivision, or by another parent through employment or otherwise, or (ii) an amount ordered to be paid, either directly to a medical provider or to the person obligated to pay such provider, toward any ongoing extraordinary medical and dental expenses of the child that are not covered by insurance or reimbursed in any other manner, provided such expenses are documented and identified (I) specifically on the record, or (II) in an affidavit, made under oath, that also states that no restraining order issued pursuant to section 46b-15 or protective order issued pursuant to section 46b-38c, between the parties is in effect or pending before the court. Cash medical support, as described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, may be ordered in lieu of an order under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision to be effective until such time as health insurance that is accessible to the child and reasonable in cost becomes available, or in addition to an order under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, provided the total cost to the obligated parent of insurance and cash medical support is reasonable, as described in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. An order for cash medical support shall be payable to the state or the custodial party, as their interests may appear, provided an order under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be effective only as long as health insurance coverage is maintained. Any unreimbursed medical and dental expenses not covered by an order issued pursuant to clause (ii) of this subparagraph are subject to an order for unreimbursed medical and dental expenses pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this subdivision.\n\n(F) Cash medical support to offset the cost of any insurance payable under the HUSKY Plan, Part A or Part B, shall not be ordered against a noncustodial parent who is a low-income obligor, as defined in the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a, or against a custodial parent of children covered under the HUSKY Plan, Part A or Part B.\n\n(3) Proceedings to obtain orders of support under this section shall be commenced by the service on the liable person or persons of a verified petition, with summons and order, of the husband or wife, child or any relative or the conservator, guardian or support enforcement officer, town or state, or any selectmen or the public official charged with the administration of public assistance of the town, or in IV-D support cases, as defined in subdivision (13) of subsection (b) of section 46b-231, the Commissioner of Social Services. The verified petition, summons and order shall be filed in the judicial district in which the petitioner or respondent resides or does business, or if filed in the Family Support Magistrate Division, in the judicial district in which the petitioner or respondent resides or does business.\n\n(4) For purposes of this section, the term “child” shall include one born to parents married to each other whose alleged genetic parent has acknowledged in writing parentage of such child or has been adjudged the parent by a court of competent jurisdiction, or a child who was born before marriage whose parents afterwards intermarry.\n\n(5) Said court or family support magistrate shall also have authority to make and enforce orders directed to the conservator or guardian of any person, or payee of Social Security or other benefits to which such person is entitled, to the extent of the income or estate held by such fiduciary or payee in any such capacity.\n\n(6) Said court or family support magistrate shall also have authority to determine, order and enforce payment of any sums due under a written agreement to support against the person liable for such support under such agreement.\n\n(7) (A) The court or family support magistrate may also determine, order and enforce payment of any support due because of neglect or refusal to furnish support for periods prior to the action. In the case of a child born out of wedlock whose parents have not intermarried, a parent's liability for such support shall be limited to the three years next preceding the filing of a petition or written agreement to support pursuant to this section.\n\n(B) In the determination of support due based on neglect or refusal to furnish support prior to the action, the support due for periods of time prior to the action shall be based upon the obligor's ability to pay during such prior periods, as determined in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a. The state shall disclose to the court any information in its possession concerning current and past ability to pay. If no information is available to the court concerning past ability to pay, the court may determine the support due for periods of time prior to the action as if past ability to pay is equal to current ability to pay, if current ability is known. If current ability to pay is not known, the court shall determine the past ability to pay based on the obligor's work history, if known, or if not known, on the state minimum wage that was in effect during such periods, provided only actual earnings shall be used to determine ability to pay for past periods during which the obligor was a full-time high school student or was incarcerated, institutionalized or incapacitated.\n\n(C) Any finding of support due for periods of time prior to an action in which the obligor failed to appear shall be entered subject to adjustment. Such adjustment may be made upon motion of any party, and the state in IV-D cases shall make such motion if it obtains information that would have substantially affected the court's determination of past ability to pay if such information had been available to the court. Motion for adjustment under this subparagraph may be made not later than twelve months from the date upon which the obligor receives notification of (i) the amount of such finding of support due for periods of time prior to the action, and (ii) the right not later than twelve months from the date of receipt of such notification to present evidence as to such obligor's past ability to pay support for such periods of time prior to the action. A copy of any support order entered, subject to adjustment, shall state in plain language the basis for the court's determination of past support, the right to request an adjustment and to present information concerning the obligor's past ability to pay, and the consequences of a failure to request such adjustment.\n\n(8) (A) The judge or family support magistrate shall cause a summons, signed by such judge or magistrate, by the clerk of said court or Family Support Magistrate Division, or by a commissioner of the Superior Court to be issued requiring such liable person or persons to appear in court or before a family support magistrate, at a time and place as determined by the clerk but not more than ninety days after the issuance of the summons. Service may be made by a state marshal, any proper officer or any investigator employed by the Department of Social Services or by the Commissioner of Administrative Services. The state marshal, proper officer or investigator shall make due return of process to the court not less than twenty-one days before the date assigned for hearing. Upon proof of the service of the summons to appear in court or before a family support magistrate at the time and place named for hearing upon such petition, the failure of the defendant or defendants to appear shall not prohibit the court or family support magistrate from going forward with the hearing. If the summons and order is signed by a commissioner of the Superior Court, upon proof of service of the summons to appear in court or before a family support magistrate and upon the failure of the defendant to appear at the time and place named for hearing upon the petition, request may be made by the petitioner to the court or family support magistrate for an order that a capias mittimus be issued.\n\n(B) In the case of a person supported wholly or in part by a town, the welfare authority of the town shall notify the responsible relatives of such person of the amount of assistance given, the beginning date thereof and the amount of support expected from each of them, if any, and if any such relative does not contribute in such expected amount, the superior court for the judicial district in which such town is located or a family support magistrate sitting in the judicial district in which such town is located may order such relative or relatives to contribute to such support, from the time of the beginning date of expense shown on the notice, such sum as said court or family support magistrate deems reasonably within each such relative's ability to support such person.\n\n(C) The court, or any judge thereof, or family support magistrate when said court or family support magistrate is not sitting, may require the defendant or defendants to become bound, with sufficient surety, to the state, town or person bringing the complaint, to abide such judgment as may be rendered on such complaint. Failure of the defendant or defendants to obey any order made under this section may be punished as contempt of court and the costs of commitment of any person imprisoned for contempt shall be paid by the state as in criminal cases. Except as otherwise provided, upon proof of the service of the summons to appear in court or before a family support magistrate at the time and place named for a hearing upon the failure of the defendant or defendants to obey such court order or order of the family support magistrate, the court or family support magistrate may order a capias mittimus be issued and directed to a judicial marshal to the extent authorized pursuant to section 46b-225, or any other proper officer to arrest such defendant or defendants and bring such defendant or defendants before the Superior Court for the contempt hearing. When any person is found in contempt under this section, the court or family support magistrate may award to the petitioner a reasonable attorney's fee and the fees of the officer serving the contempt citation, such sums to be paid by the person found in contempt.\n\n(9) In addition to or in lieu of such contempt proceedings, the court or family support magistrate, upon a finding that any person has failed to obey any order made under this section, may: (A) Order a plan for payment of any past-due support owing under such order, or, in IV-D cases, if such obligor is not incapacitated, order such obligor to participate in work activities which may include, but shall not be limited to, job search, training, work experience and participation in the job training and retraining program established by the Labor Commissioner pursuant to section 31-3t; (B) suspend any professional, occupational, recreational, commercial driver's or motor vehicle operator's license as provided in subsections (b) to (e), inclusive, of section 46b-220, provided such failure was without good cause; (C) issue an income withholding order against such amount of any debt accruing by reason of personal services as provided by sections 52-362, 52-362b and 52-362c; and (D) order executions against any real, personal, or other property of such person which cannot be categorized solely as either, for payment of accrued and unpaid amounts due under such order.\n\n(10) No entry fee, judgment fee or any other court fee shall be charged by the court or the family support magistrate to either party in proceedings under this section.\n\n(11) Any written agreement to support which is filed with the court or the Family Support Magistrate Division shall have the effect of an order of the court or a family support magistrate.\n\n(b) The Attorney General of the state of Connecticut and the attorney representing a town shall become a party for the interest of the state of Connecticut and such town in any proceedings for support which concerns any person who is receiving or has received public assistance or care from the state or any town. The Attorney General shall represent the IV-D agency in non-TFA IV-D support cases if the IV-D agency determines that such representation is required pursuant to guidelines issued by the Commissioner of Social Services.\n\n(c) The court or a family support magistrate shall direct all payments on orders of support in IV-D cases to be made to the state acting by and through the IV-D agency. In IV-D support cases, the IV-D agency or a support enforcement agency under cooperative agreement with the IV-D agency may, upon notice to the obligor and obligee, redirect payments for the support of any child receiving child support enforcement services either to the state of Connecticut or to the present custodial party, as their interests may appear, provided neither the obligor nor the obligee objects in writing within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice. Any such notice shall be sent by first class mail to the most recent address of such obligor and obligee, as recorded in the state case registry pursuant to section 46b-218, and a copy of such notice shall be filed with the court or family support magistrate if both the obligor and obligee fail to object to the redirected payments within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice. All payments made shall be distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.\n\n(d) No order for support made by the court or a family support magistrate shall be stayed by an appeal but such order shall continue in effect until a determination is made thereon upon such appeal; if however as a result of such appeal or further hearing, the amount of such order is reduced or vacated, such defendant shall be credited or reimbursed accordingly.\n\n(e) Except as provided in sections 46b-301 to 46b-425, inclusive, any court or family support magistrate, called upon to enforce a support order, shall insure that such order is reasonable in light of the obligor's ability to pay. Except as provided in sections 46b-301 to 46b-425, inclusive, any support order entered pursuant to this section, or any support order from another jurisdiction subject to enforcement by the state of Connecticut, may be modified by motion of the party seeking such modification upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party or upon a showing that such support order substantially deviates from the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a, unless there was a specific finding on the record at a hearing, or in a written judgment, order or memorandum of decision of the court, that the application of the guidelines would be inequitable or inappropriate, provided the court or family support magistrate finds that the obligor or the obligee and any other interested party have received actual notice of the pendency of such motion and of the time and place of the hearing on such motion. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any deviation of less than fifteen per cent from the child support guidelines is not substantial and any deviation of fifteen per cent or more from the guidelines is substantial. Modification may be made of such support order without regard to whether the order was issued before, on or after May 9, 1991. No such support orders may be subject to retroactive modification, except that the court or family support magistrate may order modification with respect to any period during which there is a pending motion for a modification of an existing support order from the date of service of the notice of such pending motion upon the opposing party pursuant to section 52-50. In any hearing to modify any support order from another jurisdiction the court or the family support magistrate shall conduct the proceedings in accordance with sections 46b-384 to 46b-387, inclusive.\n\n(f) In IV-D support cases, as defined in subdivision (13) of subsection (b) of section 46b-231, a copy of any support order established or modified pursuant to this section or, in the case of a motion for modification of an existing support order, a notice of determination that there should be no change in the amount of the support order, shall be provided to each party and the state case registry within fourteen days after issuance of such order or determination.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 2610; 1951, 1955, S. 1444d; September, 1957, P.A. 11, S. 20; 1959, P.A. 34; 1961, P.A. 307; 1967, P.A. 746, S. 4; 1972, P.A. 127, S. 29; P.A. 74-183, S. 216, 291; P.A. 75-103; P.A. 76-334, S. 10, 12; 76-436, S. 185, 681; P.A. 77-452, S. 9, 72; 77-594, S. 3, 7; 77-614, S. 70, 608, 610; P.A. 83-295, S. 14; P.A. 84-159, S. 4; P.A. 86-359, S. 33, 44; P.A. 87-316, S. 10; 87-589, S. 31, 87; P.A. 89-195, S. 3; P.A. 90-188, S. 5; 90-213, S. 32, 56; P.A. 91-76, S. 5, 7; 91-391, S. 6; P.A. 93-187, S. 4; 93-262, S. 72, 87; 93-396, S. 18; P.A. 95-310, S. 2, 9; June 18 Sp.

Such suspension order shall specify the conditions which must be met to avoid license suspension and shall be effective only on the filing of an affidavit, sufficient under subsection (c) of this section, as to the obligor's delinquency. Such order shall also specify the conditions of reinstatement of any such suspended license in the event of suspension by the court or family support magistrate. In IV-D cases, the order shall specify that the Department of Social Services shall notify the licensing authority of the suspension order and of compliance with or rescission of such order. In non-IV-D cases, the order shall specify the procedure for notification of the licensing authority of the suspension order and of compliance with or rescission of such order and the person required to provide such notification.

The licensing authority shall, upon receipt of such order and affidavit, suspend such license. Upon the obligor's compliance with the conditions of the license suspension order concerning reinstatement, or upon any subsequent order of the court or family support magistrate to rescind such license suspension, the licensing authority shall immediately reinstate such license.

If a person is served with any such summons, subpoena or citation issued by a family support magistrate or the assistant clerk of the Family Support Magistrate Division and fails to appear, a family support magistrate may issue a capias mittimus directed to a judicial marshal to the extent authorized pursuant to section 46b-225, or any other proper officer to arrest the obligor or the witness and bring the obligor or witness before a family support magistrate. Whenever such a capias mittimus is ordered, the family support magistrate shall establish a recognizance to the state of Connecticut in the form of a bond of such character and amount as to assure the appearance of the obligor at the next regular session of the Family Support Magistrate Division in the judicial district in which the matter is pending. If the obligor posts such a bond, and thereafter fails to appear before the family support magistrate at the time and place the obligor is ordered to appear, the family support magistrate may order the bond forfeited, and the proceeds thereof distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.\n\n(2) (A) Family support magistrates shall hear and determine matters involving child and spousal support in IV-D support cases including petitions for support brought pursuant to sections 17b-81, 17b-179, 17b-745 and 46b-215, applications for show cause orders in IV-D support cases brought pursuant to subsection (a) of section 46b-570, and actions for interstate enforcement of child and spousal support and parentage under sections 46b-301 to 46b-425, inclusive, and shall hear and determine all motions for modifications of child and spousal support in such cases.\n\n(B) In all IV-D support cases, family support magistrates shall have the authority to order any obligor who is subject to a plan for reimbursement of past-due support and is not incapacitated to participate in work activities which may include, but shall not be limited to, job search, training, work experience and participation in the job training and retraining program established by the Labor Commissioner pursuant to section 31-3t.\n\n(C) A family support magistrate shall not modify an order for periodic payment on an arrearage due the state for state assistance which has been discontinued to increase such payments, unless the family support magistrate first determines that the state has made a reasonable effort to notify the current recipient of child support, at the most current address available to the IV-D agency, of the pendency of the motion to increase such periodic arrearage payments and of the time and place of the hearing on such motion. If such recipient appears, either personally or through a representative, at such hearing, the family support magistrate shall determine whether the order in effect for child support is reasonable in relation to the current financial circumstances of the parties, prior to modifying an order increasing such periodic arrearage payments.\n\n(3) Family support magistrates shall review and approve or disapprove all agreements for support in IV-D support cases filed with the Family Support Magistrate Division in accordance with sections 17b-179, 17b-745, 46b-215, 46b-570 and subsection (c) of section 53-304.\n\n(4) Motions for modification of existing child and spousal support orders entered by the Superior Court in IV-D support cases, including motions to modify existing child and spousal support orders entered in actions brought pursuant to chapter 815j, shall be brought in the Family Support Magistrate Division and decided by a family support magistrate. Family support magistrates, in deciding if a spousal or child support order should be modified, shall make such determination based upon the criteria set forth in sections 46b-84 and 46b-215b. A person who is aggrieved by a decision of a family support magistrate modifying a Superior Court order is entitled to appeal such decision in accordance with the provisions of subsection (n) of this section.\n\n(5) Venue for proceedings to establish parentage in IV-D support cases shall be in accordance with the provisions of subsection (e) of section 46b-461. The matter shall be heard and determined by a family support magistrate in accordance with the provisions of chapter 815y.\n\n(6) Agreements for support obtained in IV-D support cases shall be filed with the assistant clerk of the family support magistrate division for the judicial district where a parent of the child resides, pursuant to subsection (a) of section 46b-570, and shall become effective as an order upon filing with the clerk. Such support agreements shall be reviewed by a family support magistrate who shall approve or disapprove the agreement. If the support agreement filed with the clerk is disapproved by a family support magistrate, the reason for disapproval shall be stated in the record and such disapproval shall have a retroactive effect. Upon such disapproval, the clerk shall schedule a hearing for the purpose of determining appropriate support amounts and shall notify all appearing parties of the hearing date.\n\n(7) Family support magistrates shall enforce orders for child and spousal support entered by such family support magistrate and by the Superior Court in IV-D support cases by citing an obligor for contempt. Family support magistrates, in IV-D support cases, may order any obligor who is subject to a plan for reimbursement of past-due support and is not incapacitated, to participate in work activities which may include, but shall not be limited to, job search, training, work experience and participation in the job training and retraining program established by the Labor Commissioner pursuant to section 31-3t. Family support magistrates shall also enforce income withholding orders entered pursuant to section 52-362, including any additional amounts to be applied toward liquidation of any arrearage, as required under subsection (e) of said section. Family support magistrates may require the obligor to furnish recognizance to the state of Connecticut in the form of a cash deposit or bond of such character and in such amount as the Family Support Magistrate Division deems proper to assure appearance at the next regular session of the Family Support Magistrate Division in the judicial district in which the matter is pending. Upon failure of the obligor to post such bond, the family support magistrate may refer the obligor to a community correctional center until he has complied with such order, provided the obligor shall be heard at the next regular session of the Family Support Magistrate Division in the court to which he was summoned. If no regular session is held within seven days of such referral, the family support magistrate shall either cause a special session of the Family Support Magistrate Division to be convened, or the obligor shall be heard by a Superior Court judge in the judicial district in which the matter is pending. If the obligor fails to appear before the family support magistrate at the time and place he is ordered to appear, the family support magistrate may order the bond, if any, forfeited, and the proceeds thereof distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, and the family support magistrate may issue a capias mittimus for the arrest of the obligor, ordering him to appear before the family support magistrate. A family support magistrate may determine whether or not an obligor is in contempt of the order of the Superior Court or of a family support magistrate and may make such orders as are provided by law to enforce a support obligation, except that if the family support magistrate determines that incarceration of an obligor for failure to obey a support order may be indicated, the family support magistrate shall inform the obligor of his right to be represented by an attorney and his right to a court-appointed attorney to represent him if he is indigent. If the obligor claims he is indigent and desires an attorney to represent him, the family support magistrate shall conduct a hearing to determine if the obligor is indigent. If, after such hearing, the family support magistrate finds that the obligor is indigent, the family support magistrate shall appoint an attorney to represent the obligor.\n\n(8) Agreements between parties as to custody and visitation of minor children in IV-D support cases may be filed with the assistant clerk of the Family Support Magistrate Division. Such agreements shall be reviewed by a family support magistrate, who shall approve the agreement unless he finds such agreement is not in the best interests of the child. Agreements between parties as to custody and visitation in IV-D support cases shall be enforced in the same manner as agreements for support are enforced, pursuant to subdivision (7) of this subsection.\n\n(9) Agreements between the parties as to the modification or enforcement of support orders in IV-D support cases may be filed with the assistant clerk of the Family Support Magistrate Division for the judicial district where the mother or father of the child resides and where the parties have submitted to a motion for modification or an application for contempt of an existing child or spousal support order. Such agreements may be approved by the family support magistrate after an inquiry into the financial needs, resources and the respective abilities of the parties. The inquiry required pursuant to this subdivision may take place on the record at a hearing, or may be made on the basis of an affidavit from each party, made under oath, stating that (A) each party has the financial resources and other facts satisfying any requirement of the inquiry in question, and (B) that no restraining order issued pursuant to section 46b-15 or protective order issued pursuant to section 46b-38c, between the parties is in effect or pending before the court. If each party so attests, a family support magistrate may (i) determine whether the agreement between the parties as to modification or enforcement of a support order is fair and equitable under all the circumstances, and (ii) make any other findings required by this section.\n\n(10) Whenever an obligor is before a family support magistrate in proceedings to establish, modify or enforce a support order in a IV-D support case and such order is not secured by an income withholding order, the family support magistrate may require the obligor to execute a bond or post other security sufficient to perform such order for support, provided the family support magistrate finds that such a bond is available for purchase within the financial means of the obligor. Upon failure of such obligor to comply with such support order, the family support magistrate may order the bond or the security forfeited and the proceeds thereof distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.\n\n(11) In any proceeding in the Family Support Magistrate Division, if the family support magistrate finds that a party is indigent and unable to pay a fee or fees payable to the court or to pay the cost of service of process, the family support magistrate shall waive such fee or fees and the cost of service of process shall be paid by the state.\n\n(12) A family support magistrate may dismiss any action or proceeding which the family support magistrate may hear and determine.\n\n(13) A family support magistrate may order parties to participate in the parenting education program in accordance with the provisions of section 46b-69b.\n\n(14) Family support magistrates may issue writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum in IV-D support cases for persons in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction.\n\n(15) A family support magistrate may, upon the filing of a motion to modify an existing support order based on the fact that the Social Security Administration, or a state agency authorized to award disability benefits has determined that the obligor qualifies for disability benefits under the federal Supplemental Security Income Program and the filing of an affidavit by a support enforcement officer: (A) Modify the existing support order to zero dollars without a hearing; (B) schedule the motion for a hearing; or (C) deny the motion without a hearing. The support enforcement officer's affidavit shall state: (i) The date that the child support obligor qualified for benefits under the federal Supplemental Security Income Program; (ii) that the support enforcement officer confirmed such benefits with the federal Social Security Administration or another federal agency with access to Social Security Administration applicant and benefit information; (iii) that a diligent search failed to identify any other income or assets that could be used to satisfy the child support order; (iv) that support enforcement services provided notice to the custodial party in accordance with section 52-57 or by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the proposed modification, that the custodial party had the right to object to the proposed modification, and that support enforcement services must receive any objection to the proposed modification not later than fifteen calendar days after the date that the custodial party received such notice; and (v) that support enforcement services did not receive an objection from the custodial party. Any support order modified pursuant to this subdivision may be later modified upon a finding of a substantial change in circumstances. Nothing in this subdivision shall preclude a family support magistrate from modifying an existing support order under any other section of the general statutes.\n\n(n) (1) A person who is aggrieved by a final decision of a family support magistrate is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal under this section.\n\n(2) Proceedings for such appeal shall be instituted by filing a petition in superior court for the judicial district in which the decision of the family support magistrate was rendered not later than fourteen days after filing of the final decision with an assistant clerk assigned to the Family Support Magistrate Division or, if a rehearing is requested, not later than fourteen days after filing of the notice of the decision thereon. In a IV-D support case, such petitions shall be accompanied by a certification that copies of the petition have been served upon the IV-D agency as defined in subsection (b) of this section and all parties of record. Service upon the IV-D agency may be made by the appellant mailing a copy of the petition by certified mail to the office of the Attorney General in Hartford.\n\n(3) Within fourteen days after the filing of the petition, or within such further time as may be allowed by the court, the Family Support Magistrate Division shall transmit to the reviewing court the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding appealed from, which shall include the decision of the family support magistrate. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record.\n\n(4) The aggrieved party shall file with his appeal a statement that no transcript is required for the purpose of determining the issues raised on appeal or a statement that he has ordered a transcript. A transcript may be filed by any party to an appeal and shall be filed within thirty days from the filing of said appeal unless the time for filing such transcript is extended by order of the Superior Court or the family support magistrate. Costs of preparing the transcript shall be paid by the party ordering the preparation of the transcript.\n\n(5) If, before the date set for hearing, application is made to the Superior Court for leave to present additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the proceeding before the family support magistrate, the Superior Court may permit additional evidence be taken before it upon conditions determined by the court.\n\n(6) The appeal shall be conducted by the Superior Court without a jury and shall be confined to the record and such additional evidence as the Superior Court has permitted to be introduced. The Superior Court, upon request, shall hear oral argument and receive written briefs.\n\n(7) The Superior Court may affirm the decision of the family support magistrate or remand the case for further proceedings. The Superior Court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the decision of the family support magistrate is: (A) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (B) in excess of the statutory authority of the family support magistrate; (C) made upon unlawful procedure; (D) affected by other error of law; (E) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (F) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\n\n(8) Any order entered by the court pursuant to an appeal under this subsection may be retroactive to the date of the original order entered by the family support magistrate.\n\n(9) Upon all such appeals which are denied, costs may be taxed in favor of the prevailing party at the discretion of the Superior Court, but no costs shall be taxed against the state.\n\n(10) In any case in which any party claims that he cannot pay the costs of an appeal or defending an appeal under this section, he shall, within the time permitted for filing the appeal, or the time permitted for filing of a transcript of testimony if preparation of such transcript is required, file with the clerk of the superior court to which the appeal is to be taken an application for waiver of payment of such fees, costs and necessary expenses. The application shall conform to rules adopted pursuant to section 51-14. After such hearing as the Superior Court determines is necessary, the Superior Court shall enter its judgment on the application, which judgment shall contain a statement of the facts the Superior Court has found, with its conclusions thereon. The filing of the application for the waiver shall toll the time limits for the filing of an appeal until such time as a judgment on such application is entered.\n\n(o) Upon final determination of any appeal from a decision of a family support magistrate by the Superior Court, there shall be no right to further review except to the Appellate Court. The procedure on such appeal to the Appellate Court shall, except as otherwise provided herein, be in accordance with the procedures provided by rule or law for the appeal of judgments rendered by the Superior Court unless modified by rule of the judges of the Appellate Court. There shall be no right to further review except to the Supreme Court pursuant to the provisions of section 51-197f.\n\n(p) The filing of an appeal from a decision of a family support magistrate does not affect the order of support of a family support magistrate, but it shall continue in effect until the appeal is decided, and thereafter, unless denied, until changed by further order of a family support magistrate or the Superior Court.\n\n(q) When an order for child or spousal support has been entered against an obligor by the Superior Court in an action originating in the Superior Court, such order shall supersede any previous order for child or spousal support against such obligor entered by a family support magistrate and shall also supersede any previous agreement for support executed by such obligor and filed with the Family Support Magistrate Division.\n\n(r) Orders for support entered by a family support magistrate shall have the same force and effect as orders of the Superior Court, except where otherwise provided in sections 17b-81, 17b-93, 17b-179, 17b-743, 17b-744, 17b-745, and 17b-746, 46b-55, 46b-59a, 46b-86 and 46b-570, this chapter, subsection (b) of section 51-348, section 52-362, subsection (a) of section 52-362d, subsection (a) of section 52-362e and subsection (c) of section 53-304, and shall be considered orders of the Superior Court for the purpose of establishing and enforcing support orders of the family support magistrate, as provided in sections 17b-81, 17b-93, 17b-179, 17b-745, 52-362, 52-362d, 52-362e and 53-304, except as otherwise provided in this section. All orders for support issued by family support magistrates in any matter before a magistrate shall contain an order for withholding to enforce such orders as set forth in section 52-362.\n\n(s) Support enforcement officers of Support Enforcement Services of the Superior Court shall:\n\n(1) Supervise the payment of any child or spousal support order in IV-D support cases and cases under sections 46b-301 to 46b-425, inclusive.

A requesting party under subparagraph (A)(i) or (B) of this subdivision shall have a right to such review every three years without proving a substantial change in circumstances, but more frequent reviews shall be made only if such requesting party demonstrates a substantial change in circumstances. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any deviation of less than fifteen per cent from the child support guidelines is not substantial and any deviation of fifteen per cent or more from the guidelines is substantial. Modification may be made of such support order without regard to whether the order was issued before, on or after May 9, 1991. In determining whether to modify a child support order based on a substantial deviation from such child support guidelines, consideration shall be given to the division of real and personal property between the parties set forth in any final decree entered pursuant to chapter 815j and the benefits accruing to the child as the result of such division. No order for periodic payment of support may be subject to retroactive modification, except that the family support magistrate may order modification with respect to any period during which there is a pending motion for modification of a support order from the date of service of notice of such pending motion to the opposing party pursuant to section 52-50; and\n\n(5) In proceedings before the Family Support Magistrate Division under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (A) perform clerical, administrative and other nonjudicial functions on behalf of the Family Support Magistrate Division; (B) maintain a registry of support orders and judgments; and (C) assist the IV-D agency in performing its functions under sections 46b-398 to 46b-410, inclusive.\n\n(t) The Attorney General shall:\n\n(1) Represent the interest of the state in all actions for child or spousal support in all cases in which the state is furnishing or has furnished aid or care to one of the parties to the action or a child of one of the parties;\n\n(2) In interstate support enforcement under sections 46b-301 to 46b-425, inclusive, provide necessary legal services on behalf of the support enforcement agency in providing services to a petitioner; and\n\n(3) Represent the IV-D agency in providing support enforcement services in non-TFA IV-D support cases pursuant to sections 17b-179, 17b-745 and 46b-215.\n\n(u) (1) The Department of Social Services may in IV-D cases (A) bring petitions for support orders pursuant to section 46b-215, (B) obtain acknowledgments of parentage, (C) bring applications for show cause orders pursuant to section 46b-570, (D) file agreements for support with the assistant clerk of the Family Support Magistrate Division, (E) issue withholding orders entered by the Superior Court or a family support magistrate in accordance with subsection (b) of section 52-362, and (F) upon notice to the obligor and obligee, redirect payments for the support of any child receiving child support enforcement services either to the state of Connecticut or to the present custodial party, as their interests may appear, for distribution in accordance with Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, provided neither the obligor nor the obligee objects in writing within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice, and provided further that any such notice shall be sent by first class mail to the most recent address of such obligor and obligee, as recorded in the state case registry pursuant to section 46b-218, and a copy of such notice shall be filed with the court or family support magistrate if both the obligor and obligee fail to object to the redirected payments within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice.\n\n(2) The Department of Social Services shall provide notice not less than once every three years to the parents subject to a support order in a IV-D case informing the parents of their right to request a review under subdivision (4) of subsection (s) of this section.\n\n(P.A. 86-359, S. 1, 44; 86-403, S. 113, 114, 132; P.A. 87-316, S. 7; P.A. 89-195, S. 1; 89-302, S. 5, 7; 89-360, S. 9–11, 45; P.A. 90-132; 90-189; 90-213, S. 34, 56; P.A. 91-76, S. 6, 7; 91-190, S. 8, 9; P.A. 92-226, S. 3, 28; May Sp.
