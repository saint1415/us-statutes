Information disclosed to the victim pursuant to this subsection shall not be further disclosed, except as specifically authorized by an order of the court.\n\n(c) In determining whether good cause exists for the granting or denial of access to records pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the court shall consider: (1) The age of the child; (2) the degree of injury to the victim or damage to property caused by the child's delinquent act; (3) whether a compelling reason exists for disclosure or nondisclosure of the information contained in such records; and (4) whether the release of such information would jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation.

In making such findings, the court shall consider (i) any prior criminal or juvenile offenses committed by the child, (ii) the seriousness of such offenses, (iii) any evidence that the child has intellectual disability or mental illness, and (iv) the availability of services in the docket for juvenile matters that can serve the child's needs. Any motion under this subdivision shall be made, and any hearing under this subdivision shall be held, not later than thirty days after the child is arraigned in the superior court for juvenile matters.\n\n(b) Upon motion of a prosecutorial official, the superior court for juvenile matters shall conduct a hearing to determine whether the case of any child charged with the commission of a class C, D or E felony or an unclassified felony shall be transferred from the docket for juvenile matters to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court. The court shall not order that the case be transferred under this subdivision unless the court finds that (1) such offense was committed after such child attained the age of fifteen years, (2) there is probable cause to believe the child has committed the act for which the child is charged, and (3) the best interests of the child and the public will not be served by maintaining the case in the superior court for juvenile matters.

Any motion under this subdivision shall be made, and any hearing under this subdivision shall be held, not later than thirty days after the child is arraigned in the superior court for juvenile matters.\n\n(c) If a case is transferred to the regular criminal docket pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section or subsection (b) of this section, or if a case is transferred to the regular criminal docket pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of this section and the charge in such case is subsequently reduced to that of the commission of an offense for which a case may be transferred pursuant to subdivision (2) or (3) of subsection (a) of this section or subsection (b) of this section, the court sitting for the regular criminal docket may return the case to the docket for juvenile matters at any time prior to the court or jury rendering a verdict or the entry of a guilty plea for good cause shown for proceedings in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(d) Upon the effectuation of the transfer, such child shall stand trial and be sentenced, if convicted, as if such child were eighteen years of age, subject to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section and section 54-91g.

A transfer shall be final (1) upon the arraignment on the regular criminal docket until a motion filed by the state's attorney pursuant to subsection (a) of this section is granted by the court, or (2) upon the arraignment on the regular criminal docket of a transfer ordered pursuant to subsection (b) of this section until the court sitting for the regular criminal docket orders the case returned to the docket for juvenile matters for good cause shown. Any child whose case is returned to the docket for juvenile matters who is detained pursuant to such case shall be in the custody of the Judicial Department.\n\n(f) The transfer of a child to a Department of Correction facility shall be limited as provided in subsection (e) of this section and said subsection shall not be construed to permit the transfer of or otherwise reduce or eliminate any other population of juveniles in detention or confinement within the Judicial Department.\n\n(g) Upon the motion of any party or upon the court's own motion, the case of any youth age sixteen or seventeen, except a case that has been transferred to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this section, which is pending on the youthful offender docket, regular criminal docket of the Superior Court or any docket for the presentment of defendants in motor vehicle matters, where the youth is charged with committing any offense or violation for which a term of imprisonment may be imposed, other than a violation of section 14-227a, 14-227g or 14-227m or subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of section 14-227n, may, before trial or before the entry of a guilty plea, be transferred to the docket for juvenile matters if (1) the youth is alleged to have committed such offense or violation on or after January 1, 2010, while sixteen years of age, or is alleged to have committed such offense or violation on or after July 1, 2012, while seventeen years of age, and (2) after a hearing considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the prior history of the youth, the court determines that the programs and services available pursuant to a proceeding in the superior court for juvenile matters would more appropriately address the needs of the youth and that the youth and the community would be better served by treating the youth as a delinquent. Upon ordering such transfer, the court shall vacate any pleas entered in the matter and advise the youth of the youth's rights, and the youth shall (A) enter pleas on the docket for juvenile matters in the jurisdiction where the youth resides, and (B) be subject to prosecution as a delinquent child. The decision of the court concerning the transfer of a youth's case from the youthful offender docket, regular criminal docket of the Superior Court or any docket for the presentment of defendants in motor vehicle matters shall not be a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\n\n(P.A. 75-620, S. 1–4; P.A. 76-194, S. 3; 76-436, S. 18, 19, 20, 681; P.A. 79-581, S. 3; P.A. 83-402, S. 2; P.A. 86-185, S. 2; P.A. 90-136, S. 2; 90-187, S. 2, 3; July Sp.

If so, the court may authorize the filing of a verified petition of alleged delinquency or it may make without such petition whatever nonjudicial disposition is practicable, including the ordering of such child to do work of which he is capable in public buildings or on public property, particularly in cases in which the complaint alleges that the conduct of such child resulted in the wilful destruction of property, provided the facts establishing jurisdiction are admitted and that a competent acceptance of such a disposition has been given by the child and his parent or guardian. If a nonjudicial disposition is made, the term of any nonjudicial supervision shall be established by the juvenile probation supervisor or designee provided such period of supervision shall not exceed one hundred eighty days. Each verified petition of delinquency filed by the court shall set forth plainly (1) the facts which bring the child within the jurisdiction of the court, (2) the name, date of birth, sex and residence of the child, (3) the names and residence of his parent or parents, guardian or other person having control of the child, and (4) a prayer for appropriate action by the court in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(b) Upon the filing of a delinquency petition, the court may, either forthwith or after investigation, cause a summons, which summons shall have a copy of said verified petition attached thereto, signed by the judge or by the clerk or assistant clerk of such court, to be issued, requiring the child and the parent or parents, guardian or other person having control of the child to appear in court at the time and place therein specified. Whenever it appears to the judge that orders addressed to an adult, as set forth in section 46b-121, are necessary for the welfare of such child, a similar summons shall be issued and served upon such adult if such adult is not already in court. Service of summons, together with a copy of the verified petition, may be made by any one of the following methods: (1) By the delivery of a true and attested copy thereof to the person summoned, or at such person's usual place of abode; (2) by restricted delivery addressed to the person summoned, return receipt requested; or (3) by first class mail addressed to the person summoned. Any notice sent by first class mail shall include a provision informing the party that appearance in court as a result of the notice may subject the appearing party to the jurisdiction of the court. If service is made by first class mail and the party does not appear, no order may be entered by the court in the case. If, after reasonable effort, personal service has not been made, such substitute service, by publication or otherwise, as the judge may order, shall be sufficient. Service may be made by any officer authorized by law to serve process, or by a probation officer, probation aide or indifferent person, and the court may allow suitable expenses and a reasonable fee therefor.

Whenever a request for a competency examination is under consideration by the court, the child or youth shall be represented by counsel in accordance with the provisions of sections 46b-135 and 46b-136.\n\n(c) A child or youth alleged to have committed an offense is presumed to be competent.

The burden of going forward with the evidence and proving that the child or youth is not competent by a preponderance of the evidence shall be on the party raising the issue of competency, except that if the court raises the issue of competency, the burden of going forward with the evidence shall be on the state. The court may call its own witnesses and conduct its own inquiry.\n\n(d) If the court finds that the request for a competency examination is justified and that there is probable cause to believe that the child or youth has committed the alleged offense, the court shall order a competency examination of the child or youth. Competency examinations shall be conducted, within available appropriations, by (1) a clinical team constituted under policies and procedures established by the Chief Court Administrator, or (2) if agreed to by all parties, a physician specializing in psychiatry who has experience in conducting forensic interviews and in child and adult psychiatry. Any clinical team constituted under this section shall consist of three persons: A clinical psychologist with experience in child and adolescent psychology, and two of the following three types of professionals: (A) A clinical social worker licensed pursuant to chapter 383b, (B) a child and adolescent psychiatric nurse clinical specialist holding a master's degree in nursing, or (C) a physician specializing in psychiatry. At least one member of the clinical team shall have experience in conducting forensic interviews and at least one member of the clinical team shall have experience in child and adolescent psychology. The court may authorize a physician, a clinical psychologist, a child and adolescent psychiatric nurse specialist or a clinical social worker licensed pursuant to chapter 383b, selected by the child or youth, to observe the examination, at the expense of the child or youth or, if the child or youth is represented by counsel appointed through the Public Defender Services Commission, the Office of the Chief Public Defender. In addition, counsel for the child or youth, his or her designated representative and, if the child or youth is represented by a public defender, a social worker from the Division of Public Defender Services, may observe the examination.\n\n(e) The examination shall be completed not later than fifteen business days after the date it was ordered, unless the time for completion is extended by the court for good cause shown. The members of the clinical team or the examining physician shall prepare and sign, without notarization, a written report and file such report with the court not later than twenty-one business days after the date of the order. The report shall address the child's or youth's ability to understand the proceedings against such child or youth and such child's or youth's ability to assist in his or her own defense. If the opinion of the clinical team or the examining physician set forth in such report is that the child cannot understand the proceedings against such child or youth or is not able to assist in his or her own defense, the members of the team or the examining physician must determine and address in their report: (1) Whether there is a substantial probability that the child or youth will attain or regain competency within ninety days of an intervention being ordered by the court; and (2) the nature and type of intervention, in the least restrictive setting possible, recommended to attain or regain competency. On receipt of the written report, the clerk of the court shall cause copies of such written report to be delivered to counsel for the state and counsel for the child or youth at least forty-eight hours prior to the hearing held under subsection (f) of this section.\n\n(f) The court shall hold a hearing as to the competency of the child or youth not later than ten business days after the court receives the written report of the clinical team or the examining physician pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. A child or youth may waive such evidentiary hearing only if the clinical team or examining physician has determined without qualification that the child or youth is competent. Any evidence regarding the child's or youth's competency, including, but not limited to, the written report, may be introduced in evidence at the hearing by either the child or youth or the state. If the written report is introduced as evidence, at least one member of the clinical team or the examining physician shall be present to testify as to the determinations in the report, unless the clinical team's or the examining physician's presence is waived by the child or youth and the state. Any member of the clinical team shall be considered competent to testify as to the clinical team's determinations.\n\n(g) (1) If the court, after the competency hearing, finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the child or youth is competent, the court shall continue with the prosecution of the juvenile matter.\n\n(2) If the court, after the competency hearing, finds that the child or youth is not competent, the court shall determine: (A) Whether there is a substantial probability that the child or youth will attain or regain competency within ninety days of an intervention being ordered by the court; and (B) whether the recommended intervention to attain or regain competency is appropriate. In making its determination on an appropriate intervention, the court may consider: (i) The nature and circumstances of the alleged offense; (ii) the length of time the clinical team or examining physician estimates it will take for the child or youth to attain or regain competency; (iii) whether the child or youth poses a substantial risk to reoffend; and (iv) whether the child or youth is able to receive community-based services or treatment that would prevent the child or youth from reoffending.\n\n(h) If the court finds that there is not a substantial probability that the child or youth will attain or regain competency within ninety days or that the recommended intervention to attain or regain competency is not appropriate, the court may issue an order in accordance with subsection (k) of this section.\n\n(i) (1) If the court finds that there is a substantial probability that the child or youth will attain or regain competency within ninety days if provided an appropriate intervention, the court shall schedule a hearing on the implementation of such intervention within five business days.\n\n(2) An intervention implemented for the purpose of restoring competency shall comply with the following conditions: (A) The period of intervention shall not exceed ninety days, unless extended for an additional ninety days in accordance with the criteria set forth in subsection (j) of this section; and (B) the intervention services shall be provided by the Department of Children and Families or, if the child's or youth's parent or guardian agrees to pay for such services, by any appropriate person, agency, mental health facility or treatment program that agrees to provide appropriate intervention services in the least restrictive setting available to the child or youth and comply with the requirements of this section.\n\n(3) Prior to the hearing, the court shall notify the Commissioner of Children and Families, the commissioner's designee or the appropriate person, agency, mental health facility or treatment program that has agreed to provide appropriate intervention services to the child or youth that an intervention to attain or regain competency will be ordered. The commissioner, the commissioner's designee or the appropriate person, agency, mental health facility or treatment program shall be provided with a copy of the report of the clinical team or examining physician and shall report to the court on a proposed implementation of the intervention prior to the hearing.\n\n(4) At the hearing, the court shall review the written report and order an appropriate intervention for a period not to exceed ninety days in the least restrictive setting available to restore competency. In making its determination, the court shall use the criteria set forth in subdivision (2) of subsection (g) of this section. Upon ordering an intervention, the court shall set a date for a hearing, to be held at least ten business days after the completion of the intervention period, for the purpose of reassessing the child's or youth's competency.\n\n(j) (1) At least ten business days prior to the date of any scheduled hearing on the issue of the reassessment of the child's or youth's competency, the Commissioner of Children and Families, the commissioner's designee or other person, agency, mental health facility or treatment program providing intervention services to restore a child or youth to competency shall report on the progress of such intervention services to the clinical team or examining physician.\n\n(2) Upon receipt of the report on the progress of such intervention, the child or youth shall be reassessed by the original clinical team or examining physician, except that if the original team or examining physician is unavailable, the court may appoint a new clinical team that, where possible, shall include at least one member of the original team, or a new examining physician. The new clinical team or examining physician shall have the same qualifications as the original team or examining physician, as provided in subsection (d) of this section, and shall have access to clinical information available from the provider of the intervention services. Not less than two business days prior to the date of any scheduled hearing on the reassessment of the child's or youth's competency, the clinical team or examining physician shall submit a report to the court that includes: (A) The clinical findings of the provider of the intervention services and the facts upon which the findings are made; (B) the clinical team's or the examining physician's opinion on whether the child or youth has attained or regained competency or is making progress toward attaining or regaining competency within the period covered by the intervention order; and (C) any other information concerning the child or youth requested by the court, including, but not limited to, the method of intervention or the type, dosage and effect of any medication the child or youth is receiving.\n\n(3) Within two business days of the filing of a reassessment report, the court shall hold a hearing to determine if the child or youth has attained or regained competency within the period covered by the intervention order. If the court finds that the child or youth has attained or regained competency, the court shall continue with the prosecution of the juvenile matter. If the court finds that the child or youth has not attained or regained competency within the period covered by the intervention order, the court shall determine whether further efforts to attain or regain competency are appropriate. The court shall make its determination of whether further efforts to attain or regain competency are appropriate in accordance with the criteria set forth in subdivision (2) of subsection (g) of this section. If the court finds that further intervention to attain or regain competency is appropriate, the court shall order a new period for restoration of competency not to exceed ninety days. If the court finds that further intervention to attain or regain competency is not appropriate or the child or youth has not attained or regained competency after an additional intervention of ninety days, the court shall issue an order in accordance with subsection (k) of this section.\n\n(k) (1) If the court determines after the period covered by the intervention order that the child or youth has not attained or regained competency and that there is not a substantial probability that the child or youth will attain or regain competency, or that further intervention to attain or regain competency is not appropriate based on the criteria set forth in subdivision (2) of subsection (g) of this section, the court shall: (A) Dismiss the petition if it is a delinquency petition; (B) vest temporary custody of the child or youth in the Commissioner of Children and Families and notify the Office of the Chief Public Defender, which shall assign an attorney to serve as guardian ad litem for the child or youth and investigate whether a petition should be filed under section 46b-129; or (C) order that the Department of Children and Families or some other person, agency, mental health facility or treatment program, or such child's or youth's probation officer, conduct or obtain an appropriate assessment and, where appropriate, propose a plan for services that can appropriately address the child's or youth's needs in the least restrictive setting available and appropriate. Any plan for services may include a plan for interagency collaboration for the provision of appropriate services after the child or youth attains the age of eighteen.\n\n(2) Not later than ten business days after the issuance of an order pursuant to subparagraph (B) or (C) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the court shall hold a hearing to review the order of temporary custody or any recommendations of the Department of Children and Families, such probation officer or such attorney or guardian ad litem for the child or youth.\n\n(3) If the child or youth is adjudicated neglected, uncared-for or abused subsequent to such a petition being filed, or if a plan for services pursuant to subparagraph (C) of subdivision (1) of this subsection has been approved by the court and implemented, the court may dismiss the delinquency petition, or, in the discretion of the court, order that the prosecution of the case be suspended for a period not to exceed eighteen months. During the period of suspension, the court may order the Department of Children and Families to provide periodic reports to the court to ensure that appropriate services are being provided to the child or youth. If during the period of suspension, the child or youth or the parent or guardian of the child or youth does not comply with the requirements set forth in the plan for services, the court may hold a hearing to determine whether the court should follow the procedure under subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of this subsection for instituting a petition alleging that a child is neglected, uncared for or abused. Whenever the court finds that the need for the suspension of prosecution is no longer necessary, but not later than the expiration of such period of suspension, the delinquency petition shall be dismissed.\n\n(June 12 Sp.

      "text": "(a) Any selectman, town manager, or town, city or borough welfare department, any probation officer, or the Commissioner of Social Services, the Commissioner of Children and Families or any child-caring institution or agency approved by the Commissioner of Children and Families, a child or such child's representative or attorney or a foster parent of a child, having information that a child or youth is neglected, uncared for or abused may file with the Superior Court that has venue over such matter a verified petition plainly stating such facts as bring the child or youth within the jurisdiction of the court as neglected, uncared for or abused within the meaning of section 46b-120, the name, date of birth, sex and residence of the child or youth, the name and residence of such child's parents or guardian, and praying for appropriate action by the court in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. Upon the filing of such a petition, except as otherwise provided in subsection (k) of section 17a-112, the court shall cause a summons to be issued requiring the parent or parents or the guardian of the child or youth to appear in court at the time and place named, which summons shall be served not less than fourteen days before the date of the hearing in the manner prescribed by section 46b-128, and the court shall further give notice to the petitioner and to the Commissioner of Children and Families of the time and place when the petition is to be heard not less than fourteen days prior to the hearing in question.\n\n(b) If it appears from the specific allegations of the petition and other verified affirmations of fact accompanying the petition and application, or subsequent thereto, that there is reasonable cause to believe that (1) the child or youth is suffering from serious physical illness or serious physical injury or is in immediate physical danger from the child's or youth's surroundings, and (2) as a result of said conditions, the child's or youth's safety is endangered and immediate removal from such surroundings is necessary to ensure the child's or youth's safety, the court shall either (A) issue an order to the parents or other person having responsibility for the care of the child or youth to appear at such time as the court may designate to determine whether the court should vest the child's or youth's temporary care and custody in a person related to the child or youth by blood or marriage or in some other person or suitable agency pending disposition of the petition, or (B) issue an order ex parte vesting the child's or youth's temporary care and custody in a person related to the child or youth by blood or marriage or in some other person or suitable agency. A preliminary hearing on any ex parte custody order or order to appear issued by the court shall be held not later than ten days after the issuance of such order. The service of such orders may be made by any officer authorized by law to serve process, or by any probation officer appointed in accordance with section 46b-123, investigator from the Department of Administrative Services, state or local police officer or indifferent person. Such orders shall include a conspicuous notice to the respondent written in clear and simple language containing at least the following information: (i) That the order contains allegations that conditions in the home have endangered the safety and welfare of the child or youth; (ii) that a hearing will be held on the date on the form; (iii) that the hearing is the opportunity to present the parents' position concerning the alleged facts; (iv) that an attorney will be appointed for parents who cannot afford an attorney; (v) that such parents may apply for a court-appointed attorney by going in person to the court address on the form and are advised to go as soon as possible in order for the attorney to prepare for the hearing; (vi) that such parents, or a person having responsibility for the care and custody of the child or youth, may request the Commissioner of Children and Families to investigate placing the child or youth with a person related to the child or youth by blood or marriage who might serve as a licensed foster parent or temporary custodian for such child or youth. The commissioner shall investigate any relative or relatives proposed to serve as a licensed foster parent or temporary custodian for such child or youth prior to the preliminary hearing and provide a preliminary report to the court at such hearing as to such relative's or relatives' suitability and any potential barriers to licensing such relative or relatives as a foster parent or parents or granting temporary custody of such child or youth to such relative or relatives; and (vii) that if such parents have any questions concerning the case or appointment of counsel, any such parent is advised to go to the court or call the clerk's office at the court as soon as possible. Upon application for appointed counsel, the court shall promptly determine eligibility and, if the respondent is eligible, promptly appoint counsel. The expense for any temporary care and custody shall be paid by the town in which such child or youth is at the time residing, and such town shall be reimbursed for such expense by the town found liable for the child's or youth's support, except that where a state agency has filed a petition pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the agency shall pay such expense. The agency shall give primary consideration to placing the child or youth in the town where such child or youth resides. The agency shall file in writing with the clerk of the court the reasons for placing the child or youth in a particular placement outside the town where the child or youth resides. Upon issuance of an ex parte order, the court shall provide to the commissioner and the parent or guardian specific steps necessary for each to take to address the ex parte order for the parent or guardian to retain or regain custody of the child or youth. Upon the issuance of such order, or not later than sixty days after the issuance of such order, the court shall make a determination whether the Department of Children and Families made reasonable efforts to keep the child or youth with his or her parents or guardian prior to the issuance of such order and, if such efforts were not made, whether such reasonable efforts were not possible, taking into consideration the child's or youth's best interests, including the child's or youth's health and safety. Any person or agency in which the temporary care and custody of a child or youth is vested under this section shall have the following rights and duties regarding the child or youth: (I) The obligation of care and control; (II) the authority to make decisions regarding emergency medical, psychological, psychiatric or surgical treatment; and (III) such other rights and duties that the court having jurisdiction may order.\n\n(c) The preliminary hearing on the order of temporary custody or order to appear or the first hearing on a petition filed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be held in order for the court to:\n\n(1) Advise the parent or guardian of the allegations contained in all petitions and applications that are the subject of the hearing and the parent's or guardian's right to counsel pursuant to subsection (b) of section 46b-135;\n\n(2) Ensure that an attorney, and where appropriate, a separate guardian ad litem has been appointed to represent the child or youth in accordance with subsection (b) of section 51-296a and sections 46b-129a and 46b-136;\n\n(3) Upon request, appoint an attorney to represent the respondent when the respondent is unable to afford representation, in accordance with subsection (b) of section 51-296a;\n\n(4) Advise the parent or guardian of the right to a hearing on the petitions and applications, to be held not later than ten days after the date of the preliminary hearing if the hearing is pursuant to an order of temporary custody or an order to show cause;\n\n(5) Accept a plea regarding the truth of the allegations;\n\n(6) Make any interim orders, including visitation orders, that the court determines are in the best interests of the child or youth. The court, after a hearing pursuant to this subsection, shall order specific steps the commissioner and the parent or guardian shall take for the parent or guardian to regain or to retain custody of the child or youth;\n\n(7) Take steps to determine the identity of the alleged genetic parent of the child or youth, including, if necessary, inquiring of the birth parent of the child or youth, under oath, as to the identity and address of any person who might be the genetic parent of the child or youth and ordering genetic testing, and order service of the petition and notice of the hearing date, if any, to be made upon such alleged genetic parent;\n\n(8) If the person named as the alleged genetic parent appears and admits that such person is the genetic parent, provide such person and the birth parent with the notices that comply with section 17b-27 and provide them with the opportunity to sign an acknowledgment of parentage on forms that comply with section 17b-27. Such documents shall be executed and filed in accordance with chapter 815y and a copy delivered to the clerk of the superior court for juvenile matters. The clerk of the superior court for juvenile matters shall send the original acknowledgment of parentage to the Department of Public Health for filing in the parentage registry maintained under section 19a-42a, and shall maintain a copy of the acknowledgment of parentage in the court file;\n\n(9) If the person named as an alleged genetic parent appears and denies that such person is the genetic parent of the child or youth, order genetic testing to determine parentage in accordance with the Connecticut Parentage Act. The clerk of the court shall send a certified copy of any judgment adjudicating parentage to the Department of Public Health for filing in the parentage registry maintained under section 19a-42a. If the results of the genetic tests indicate that the person named as the alleged genetic parent is not the genetic parent of the child or youth, the court shall enter a judgment that such person is not the genetic parent and the court shall remove such person from the case and afford such person no further standing in the case or in any subsequent proceeding regarding the child or youth;\n\n(10) Identify any person or persons related to the child or youth by blood, marriage or law residing in this state who might serve as licensed foster parents or temporary custodians and order the Commissioner of Children and Families to investigate and report to the court, not later than thirty days after the preliminary hearing, the appropriateness of placing the child or youth with such relative or relatives; and\n\n(11) In accordance with the provisions of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children pursuant to section 17a-175, identify any person or persons related to the child or youth by blood, marriage or law residing out of state who might serve as licensed foster parents or temporary custodians, and order the Commissioner of Children and Families to investigate and determine, within a reasonable time, the appropriateness of placing the child or youth with such relative or relatives.\n\n(d) (1) (A) If not later than thirty days after the preliminary hearing, or within a reasonable time when a relative resides out of state, the Commissioner of Children and Families determines that there is not a suitable person related to the child or youth by blood or marriage who can be licensed as a foster parent or serve as a temporary custodian, and the court has not granted temporary custody to a person related to the child or youth by blood or marriage, any person related to the child or youth by blood or marriage may file, not later than ninety days after the date of the preliminary hearing, a motion to intervene for the limited purpose of moving for temporary custody of such child or youth. If a motion to intervene is timely filed, the court shall grant such motion except for good cause shown.\n\n(B) Any person related to a child or youth may file a motion to intervene for purposes of seeking temporary custody of a child or youth more than ninety days after the date of the preliminary hearing. The granting of such motion shall be solely in the court's discretion, except that such motion shall be granted absent good cause shown whenever the child's or youth's most recent placement has been disrupted or is about to be disrupted.\n\n(C) A relative shall appear in person, with or without counsel, and shall not be entitled to court appointed counsel or the assignment of counsel by the office of Chief Public Defender, except as provided in section 46b-136.\n\n(2) Upon the granting of intervenor status to such relative of the child or youth, the court shall issue an order directing the Commissioner of Children and Families to conduct an assessment of such relative and to file a written report with the court not later than forty days after such order, unless such relative resides out of state, in which case the assessment shall be ordered and requested in accordance with the provisions of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, pursuant to section 17a-175. The court may also request such relative to release such relative's medical records, including any psychiatric or psychological records and may order such relative to submit to a physical or mental examination. The expenses incurred for such physical or mental examination shall be paid as costs of commitment are paid. Upon receipt of the assessment, the court shall schedule a hearing on such relative's motion for temporary custody not later than fifteen days after the receipt of the assessment. If the Commissioner of Children and Families, the child's or youth's attorney or guardian ad litem, or the parent or guardian objects to the vesting of temporary custody in such relative, the agency or person objecting at such hearing shall be required to prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that granting temporary custody of the child or youth to such relative would not be in the best interests of such child or youth.\n\n(3) If the court grants such relative temporary custody during the period of such temporary custody, such relative shall be subject to orders of the court, including, but not limited to, providing for the care and supervision of such child or youth and cooperating with the Commissioner of Children and Families in the implementation of treatment and permanency plans and services for such child or youth. The court may, on motion of any party or the court's own motion, after notice and a hearing, terminate such relative's intervenor status if such relative's participation in the case is no longer warranted or necessary.\n\n(4) Any person related to a child or youth may file a motion to intervene for purposes of seeking guardianship of a child or youth more than ninety days after the date of the preliminary hearing. The granting of such motion to intervene shall be solely in the court's discretion, except that such motion shall be granted absent good cause shown whenever the child's or youth's most recent placement has been disrupted or is about to be disrupted. The court may, in the court's discretion, order the Commissioner of Children and Families to conduct an assessment of such relative granted intervenor status pursuant to this subdivision.\n\n(5) Any relative granted intervenor status pursuant to this subsection shall not be entitled to court-appointed counsel or representation by Division of Public Defender Services assigned counsel, except as provided in section 46b-136.\n\n(e) If any parent or guardian fails, after service of such order, to appear at the preliminary hearing, the court may enter or sustain an order of temporary custody.\n\n(f) Upon request, or upon its own motion, the court shall schedule a hearing on the order for temporary custody or the order to appear to be held not later than ten days after the date of the preliminary hearing. Such hearing shall be held on consecutive days except for compelling circumstances or at the request of the parent or guardian.\n\n(g) At a contested hearing on the order for temporary custody or order to appear, credible hearsay evidence regarding statements of the child or youth made to a mandated reporter or to a parent may be offered by the parties and admitted by the court upon a finding that the statement is reliable and trustworthy and that admission of such statement is reasonably necessary. A signed statement executed by a mandated reporter under oath may be admitted by the court without the need for the mandated reporter to appear and testify unless called by a respondent or the child, provided the statement: (1) Was provided at the preliminary hearing and promptly upon request to any counsel appearing after the preliminary hearing; (2) reasonably describes the qualifications of the reporter and the nature of his contact with the child; and (3) contains only the direct observations of the reporter, and statements made to the reporter that would be admissible if the reporter were to testify to them in court and any opinions reasonably based thereupon. If a respondent or the child gives notice at the preliminary hearing that he intends to cross-examine the reporter, the person filing the petition shall make the reporter available for such examination at the contested hearing.\n\n(h) If any parent or guardian fails, after due notice of the hearing scheduled pursuant to subsection (g) of this section and without good cause, to appear at the scheduled date for a contested hearing on the order of temporary custody or order to appear, the court may enter or sustain an order of temporary custody.\n\n(i) When a petition is filed in said court for the commitment of a child or youth, the Commissioner of Children and Families shall make a thorough investigation of the case and shall cause to be made a thorough physical and mental examination of the child or youth if requested by the court. The court after hearing may also order a thorough physical or mental examination, or both, of a parent or guardian whose competency or ability to care for a child or youth before the court is at issue. The expenses incurred in making such physical and mental examinations shall be paid as costs of commitment are paid.\n\n(j) (1) For the purposes of this subsection and subsection (k) of this section, (A) “permanent legal guardianship” means a permanent guardianship, as defined in section 45a-604, (B) “caregiver” means (i) a fictive kin caregiver, as defined in section 17a-114, who is caring for a child, (ii) a relative caregiver, as defined in section 17a-126, who is caring for a child, or (iii) a person who is licensed or approved to provide foster care pursuant to section 17a-114, who is caring for a child, and (C) “trial home visit” means the temporary placement of a child or youth committed to the Commissioner of Children and Families in the home of such child's or youth's parent or guardian.\n\n(2) Upon finding and adjudging that any child or youth is uncared for, neglected or abused the court may (A) commit such child or youth to the Commissioner of Children and Families, and such commitment shall remain in effect until further order of the court, except that such commitment may be revoked or parental rights terminated at any time by the court; (B) vest such child's or youth's legal guardianship in any private or public agency that is permitted by law to care for neglected, uncared for or abused children or youths or with any other person or persons found to be suitable and worthy of such responsibility by the court, including, but not limited to, any relative of such child or youth by blood or marriage; (C) vest such child's or youth's permanent legal guardianship in any person or persons found to be suitable and worthy of such responsibility by the court, including, but not limited to, any relative of such child or youth by blood or marriage in accordance with the requirements set forth in subdivision (6) of this subsection; or (D) place the child or youth in the custody of the parent or guardian with protective supervision by the Commissioner of Children and Families subject to conditions established by the court.\n\n(3) If the court approves a permanency plan filed with the court that recommends the reunification of the child or youth with such child's or youth's parent or guardian, the Commissioner of Children and Families may, with the agreement of all parties of record, authorize a trial home visit prior to the revocation of the order of commitment pertaining to such child or youth. The commissioner shall (A) provide the court and all parties of record written notice of the commissioner's intent to authorize any such trial home visit not later than fifteen days prior to such authorization; (B) create a trial home visit plan that shall be provided to all parties of record, and include, but need not be limited to, announced and unannounced visits to the home by the department and the provision of any services during such trial home visit that the commissioner determines are necessary to promote the child's or youth's well-being; and (C) file a motion for revocation of commitment not later than thirty days after the date such trial home visit commences, unless the commissioner removes the child or youth from the home prior to that time pursuant to its responsibility and authority over children and youth committed to the care and custody of the commissioner. A trial home visit authorized under this section shall remain in effect until the commissioner removes such child or youth pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this subdivision or the court grants a motion for revocation of commitment filed pursuant to said subparagraph.\n\n(4) If the court determines that the commitment should be revoked and the child's or youth's legal guardianship or permanent legal guardianship should vest in someone other than the respondent parent, parents or former guardian, or if parental rights are terminated at any time, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that an award of legal guardianship or permanent legal guardianship upon revocation to, or adoption upon termination of parental rights by, any caregiver or person or who is, pursuant to an order of the court, the temporary custodian of the child or youth at the time of the revocation or termination, shall be in the best interests of the child or youth and that such caregiver is a suitable and worthy person to assume legal guardianship or permanent legal guardianship upon revocation or to adopt such child or youth upon termination of parental rights. The presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that an award of legal guardianship or permanent legal guardianship to, or an adoption by, such caregiver would not be in the child's or youth's best interests and such caregiver is not a suitable and worthy person. The court shall order specific steps that the parent must take to facilitate the return of the child or youth to the custody of such parent.\n\n(5) The commissioner shall be the guardian of such child or youth for the duration of the commitment, provided the child or youth has not reached the age of eighteen years, or until another guardian has been legally appointed, and in like manner, upon such vesting of the care of such child or youth, such other public or private agency or individual shall be the guardian of such child or youth until such child or youth has reached the age of eighteen years or, in the case of a child or youth in full-time attendance in a secondary school, a technical education and career school, a college or a state-accredited job training program, until such child or youth has reached the age of twenty-one years or until another guardian has been legally appointed. The commissioner may place any child or youth so committed to the commissioner in a suitable foster home or in the home of a fictive kin caregiver, relative caregiver, or in a licensed child-caring institution or in the care and custody of any accredited, licensed or approved child-caring agency, within or without the state, provided a child shall not be placed outside the state except for good cause and unless the parents or guardian of such child are notified in advance of such placement and given an opportunity to be heard, or in a receiving home maintained and operated by the commissioner. When placing such child or youth, the commissioner shall provide written notification of the placement, including the name, address and other relevant contact information relating to the placement, to any attorney or guardian ad litem appointed to represent the child or youth pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. The commissioner shall provide written notification to such attorney or guardian ad litem of any change in placement of such child or youth, including a hospitalization or respite placement, and if the child or youth absconds from care. The commissioner shall provide such written notification not later than ten business days prior to the date of change of placement in a nonemergency situation, or not later than two business days following the date of a change of placement in an emergency situation. In placing such child or youth, the commissioner shall, if possible, select a home, agency, institution or person of like religious faith to that of a parent of such child or youth, if such faith is known or may be ascertained by reasonable inquiry, provided such home conforms to the standards of the commissioner and the commissioner shall, when placing siblings, if possible, place such children together. At least ten days prior to transferring a child or youth to a second or subsequent placement, the commissioner shall give written notice to such child or youth and such child's or youth's attorney of said commissioner's intention to make such transfer, unless an emergency or risk to such child's or youth's well-being necessitates the immediate transfer of such child and renders such notice impossible. Upon the issuance of an order committing the child or youth to the commissioner, or not later than sixty days after the issuance of such order, the court shall determine whether the department made reasonable efforts to keep the child or youth with his or her parents or guardian prior to the issuance of such order and, if such efforts were not made, whether such reasonable efforts were not possible, taking into consideration the child's or youth's best interests, including the child's or youth's health and safety.\n\n(6) A youth who is committed to the commissioner pursuant to this subsection and has reached eighteen years of age may remain in the care of the commissioner, by consent of the youth and provided the youth has not reached the age of twenty-one years of age, if the youth is (A) enrolled in a full-time approved secondary education program or an approved program leading to an equivalent credential; (B) enrolled full time in an institution which provides postsecondary or vocational education; or (C) participating full time in a program or activity approved by said commissioner that is designed to promote or remove barriers to employment. The commissioner, in the commissioner's discretion, may waive the provision of full-time enrollment or participation based on compelling circumstances. Not more than one hundred twenty days after the youth's eighteenth birthday, the department shall file a motion in the superior court for juvenile matters that had jurisdiction over the youth's case prior to the youth's eighteenth birthday for a determination as to whether continuation in care is in the youth's best interest and, if so, whether there is an appropriate permanency plan. The court, in its discretion, may hold a hearing on said motion.\n\n(7) Prior to issuing an order for permanent legal guardianship, the court shall provide notice to each parent that the parent may not file a motion to terminate the permanent legal guardianship, or the court shall indicate on the record why such notice could not be provided, and the court shall find by clear and convincing evidence that the permanent legal guardianship is in the best interests of the child or youth and that the following have been proven by clear and convincing evidence:\n\n(A) One of the statutory grounds for termination of parental rights exists, as set forth in subsection (j) of section 17a-112, or the parents have voluntarily consented to the establishment of the permanent legal guardianship;\n\n(B) Adoption of the child or youth is not possible or appropriate;\n\n(C) (i) If the child or youth is at least twelve years of age, such child or youth consents to the proposed permanent legal guardianship, or (ii) if the child is under twelve years of age, the proposed permanent legal guardian is: (I) A relative, (II) a caregiver, or (III) already serving as the permanent legal guardian of at least one of the child's siblings, if any;\n\n(D) The child or youth has resided with the proposed permanent legal guardian for at least a year; and\n\n(E) The proposed permanent legal guardian is (i) a suitable and worthy person, and (ii) committed to remaining the permanent legal guardian and assuming the right and responsibilities for the child or youth until the child or youth attains the age of majority.\n\n(8) An order of permanent legal guardianship may be reopened and modified and the permanent legal guardian removed upon the filing of a motion with the court, provided it is proven by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the permanent legal guardian is no longer suitable and worthy. A parent may not file a motion to terminate a permanent legal guardianship. If, after a hearing, the court terminates a permanent legal guardianship, the court, in appointing a successor legal guardian or permanent legal guardian for the child or youth shall do so in accordance with this subsection.\n\n(k) (1) (A) Nine months after placement of the child or youth in the care and custody of the commissioner pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement, or removal of a child or youth pursuant to section 17a-101g or an order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, whichever is earlier, the commissioner shall file a motion for review of a permanency plan if the child or youth has not reached his or her eighteenth birthday. Nine months after a permanency plan has been approved by the court pursuant to this subsection or subdivision (5) of subsection (j) of this section, the commissioner shall file a motion for review of the permanency plan. Any party seeking to oppose the commissioner's permanency plan, including a relative of a child or youth by blood or marriage who has intervened pursuant to subsection (d) of this section and is licensed as a foster parent for such child or youth or is vested with such child's or youth's temporary custody by order of the court, shall file a motion in opposition not later than thirty days after the filing of the commissioner's motion for review of the permanency plan, which motion shall include the reason therefor. A permanency hearing on any motion for review of the permanency plan shall be held not later than ninety days after the filing of such motion. The court shall hold evidentiary hearings in connection with any contested motion for review of the permanency plan and credible hearsay evidence regarding any party's compliance with specific steps ordered by the court shall be admissible at such evidentiary hearings. The commissioner shall have the burden of proving that the proposed permanency plan is in the best interests of the child or youth. After the initial permanency hearing, subsequent permanency hearings shall be held not less frequently than every twelve months while the child or youth remains in the custody of the Commissioner of Children and Families or, if the youth is over eighteen years of age, while the youth remains in voluntary placement with the department. The court shall provide notice to the child or youth, the parent or guardian of such child or youth, and any intervenor of the time and place of the court hearing on any such motion not less than fourteen days prior to such hearing.\n\n(B) (i) If a child is at least twelve years of age, the child's permanency plan, and any revision to such plan, shall be developed in consultation with the child. In developing or revising such plan, the child may consult up to two individuals participating in the department's case plan regarding such child, neither of whom shall be the foster parent or caseworker of such child. One individual so selected by such child may be designated as the child's advisor for purposes of developing or revising the permanency plan. Regardless of the child's age, the commissioner shall provide not less than five days' advance written notice of any permanency team meeting concerning the child's permanency plan to an attorney or guardian ad litem appointed to represent the child pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(ii) If a child is at least twelve years of age, the commissioner shall notify the parent or guardian, foster parent and child of any administrative case review regarding such child's commitment not less than five days prior to such review and shall make a reasonable effort to schedule such review at a time and location that allows the parent or guardian, foster parent and child to attend.\n\n(iii) If a child is at least twelve years of age, such child shall, whenever possible, identify not more than three adults with whom such child has a significant relationship and who may serve as a permanency resource. The identity of such adults shall be recorded in the case plan of such child.\n\n(2) At a permanency hearing held in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the court shall approve a permanency plan that is in the best interests of the child or youth and takes into consideration the child's or youth's need for permanency. The child's or youth's health and safety shall be of paramount concern in formulating such plan. Such permanency plan may include the goal of (A) revocation of commitment and reunification of the child or youth with the parent or guardian, with or without protective supervision; (B) transfer of guardianship or permanent legal guardianship; (C) filing of termination of parental rights and adoption; or (D) for a child sixteen years of age or older, another planned permanent living arrangement ordered by the court, provided the Commissioner of Children and Families has documented a compelling reason why it would not be in the best interests of the child or youth for the permanency plan to include the goals in subparagraphs (A) to (C), inclusive, of this subdivision. Such other planned permanent living arrangement shall, whenever possible, include an adult who has a significant relationship with the child, and who is willing to be a permanency resource, and may include, but not be limited to, placement of a youth in an independent living program or long term foster care with an identified foster parent.\n\n(3) If the permanency plan for a child sixteen years of age or older includes the goal of another planned permanent living arrangement pursuant to subparagraph (D) of subdivision (2) of this subsection or subdivision (3) of subsection (c) of section 17a-111b, the department shall document for the court: (A) The manner and frequency of efforts made by the department to return the child home or to secure placement for the child with a fit and willing relative, legal guardian or adoptive parent; and (B) the steps the department has taken to ensure (i) the child's foster family home or child care institution is following a reasonable and prudent parent standard, as defined in section 17a-114d; and (ii) the child has regular opportunities to engage in age appropriate and developmentally appropriate activities, as defined in section 17a-114d.\n\n(4) At a permanency hearing held in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the court shall (A) (i) ask the child or youth about his or her desired permanency outcome, or (ii) if the child or youth is unavailable to appear at such hearing, require the attorney for the child or youth to consult with the child or youth regarding the child's or youth's desired permanency outcome and report the same to the court, (B) review the status of the child or youth, (C) review the progress being made to implement the permanency plan, (D) determine a timetable for attaining the permanency plan, (E) determine the services to be provided to the parent if the court approves a permanency plan of reunification and the timetable for such services, and (F) determine whether the commissioner has made reasonable efforts to achieve the permanency plan. The court may revoke commitment if a cause for commitment no longer exists and it is in the best interests of the child or youth.\n\n(5) If the permanency plan for a child sixteen years of age or older includes the goal of another planned permanent living arrangement pursuant to subparagraph (D) of subdivision (2) of this subsection, the court shall (A) (i) ask the child about his or her desired permanency outcome, or (ii) if the child is unavailable to appear at a permanency hearing held in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, require the attorney for the child to consult with the child regarding the child's desired permanency outcome and report the same to the court; (B) make a judicial determination that, as of the date of hearing, another planned permanent living arrangement is the best permanency plan for the child; and (C) document the compelling reasons why it is not in the best interest of the child to return home or to be placed with a fit and willing relative, legal guardian or adoptive parent.\n\n(6) If the court approves the permanency plan of adoption: (A) The Commissioner of Children and Families shall file a petition for termination of parental rights not later than sixty days after such approval if such petition has not previously been filed; (B) the commissioner may conduct a thorough adoption assessment and child-specific recruitment; and (C) the court may order that the child be photo-listed within thirty days if the court determines that such photo-listing is in the best interests of the child or youth. As used in this subdivision, “thorough adoption assessment” means conducting and documenting face-to-face interviews with the child or youth, foster care providers and other significant parties and “child specific recruitment” means recruiting an adoptive placement targeted to meet the individual needs of the specific child or youth, including, but not limited to, use of the media, use of photo-listing services and any other in-state or out-of-state resources that may be used to meet the specific needs of the child or youth, unless there are extenuating circumstances that indicate that such efforts are not in the best interests of the child or youth.\n\n(l) The Commissioner of Children and Families shall pay directly to the person or persons furnishing goods or services determined by said commissioner to be necessary for the care and maintenance of such child or youth the reasonable expense thereof, payment to be made at intervals determined by said commissioner; and the Comptroller shall draw his or her order on the Treasurer, from time to time, for such part of the appropriation for care of committed children or youths as may be needed in order to enable the commissioner to make such payments. The commissioner shall include in the department's annual budget a sum estimated to be sufficient to carry out the provisions of this section. Notwithstanding that any such child or youth has income or estate, the commissioner may pay the cost of care and maintenance of such child or youth. The commissioner may bill to and collect from the person in charge of the estate of any child or youth aided under this chapter, or the payee of such child's or youth's income, the total amount expended for care of such child or youth or such portion thereof as any such estate or payee is able to reimburse, provided the commissioner shall not collect from such estate or payee any reimbursement for the cost of care or other expenditures made on behalf of such child or youth from (1) the proceeds of any cause of action received by such child or youth; (2) any lottery proceeds due to such child or youth; (3) any inheritance due to such child or youth; (4) any payment due to such child or youth from a trust other than a trust created pursuant to 42 USC 1396p, as amended from time to time; or (5) the decedent estate of such child or youth.\n\n(m) The commissioner, a parent or the child's attorney may file a motion to revoke a commitment, and, upon finding that cause for commitment no longer exists, and that such revocation is in the best interests of such child or youth, the court may revoke the commitment of such child or youth. No such motion shall be filed more often than once every six months.\n\n(n) If the court has ordered legal guardianship of a child or youth to be vested in a suitable and worthy person pursuant to subsection (j) of this section, the child's or youth's parent or former legal guardian may file a motion to reinstate guardianship of the child or youth in such parent or former legal guardian. Upon the filing of such a motion, the court may order the Commissioner of Children and Families to investigate the home conditions and needs of the child or youth and the home conditions of the person seeking reinstatement of guardianship, and to make a recommendation to the court. A party to a motion for reinstatement of guardianship shall not be entitled to court-appointed counsel or representation by Division of Public Defender Services assigned counsel, except as provided in section 46b-136. Upon finding that the cause for the removal of guardianship no longer exists, and that reinstatement is in the best interests of the child or youth, the court may reinstate the guardianship of the parent or the former legal guardian. No such motion may be filed more often than once every six months.\n\n(o) Upon service on the parent, guardian or other person having control of the child or youth of any order issued by the court pursuant to the provisions of subsections (b) and (j) of this section, the child or youth concerned shall be surrendered to the person serving the order who shall forthwith deliver the child or youth to the person, agency, department or institution awarded custody in the order. Upon refusal of the parent, guardian or other person having control of the child or youth to surrender the child or youth as provided in the order, the court may cause a warrant to be issued charging the parent, guardian or other person having control of the child or youth with contempt of court. If the person arrested is found in contempt of court, the court may order such person confined until the person complies with the order, but for not more than six months, or may fine such person not more than five hundred dollars, or both.\n\n(p) A foster parent, prospective adoptive parent or relative caregiver shall receive notice and have the right to be heard for the purposes of this section in Superior Court in any proceeding concerning a foster child living with such foster parent, prospective adoptive parent or relative caregiver. A foster parent, prospective adoptive parent or relative caregiver who has cared for a child or youth shall have the right to be heard and comment on the best interests of such child or youth in any proceeding under this section which is brought not more than one year after the last day the foster parent, prospective adoptive parent or relative caregiver provided such care. Any notice provided pursuant to this subsection shall include the Internet web site address for any proceeding that will be conducted on a virtual platform. The court shall confirm compliance with the notice requirements set forth in this subsection at any such proceeding.\n\n(q) Upon motion of any sibling of any child committed to the Department of Children and Families pursuant to this section, such sibling shall have the right to be heard concerning visitation with, and placement of, any such child. In awarding any visitation or modifying any placement, the court shall be guided by the best interests of all siblings affected by such determination.\n\n(r) The provisions of section 17a-152, regarding placement of a child from another state, and section 17a-175, regarding the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, shall apply to placements pursuant to this section. In any proceeding under this section involving the placement of a child or youth in another state where the provisions of section 17a-175 are applicable, the court shall, before ordering or approving such placement, state for the record the court's finding concerning compliance with the provisions of section 17a-175. The court's statement shall include, but not be limited to: (1) A finding that the state has received notice in writing from the receiving state, in accordance with subsection (d) of Article III of section 17a-175, indicating that the proposed placement does not appear contrary to the interests of the child, (2) the court has reviewed such notice, (3) whether or not an interstate compact study or other home study has been completed by the receiving state, and (4) if such a study has been completed, whether the conclusions reached by the receiving state as a result of such study support the placement.\n\n(s) In any proceeding under this section, the Department of Children and Families shall provide notice to (1) each attorney of record for each party involved in the proceeding when the department seeks to transfer a child or youth in its care, custody or control to an out-of-state placement, and (2) the attorney for the child or youth, and any guardian ad litem for such child or youth, of (A) any new report of abuse or neglect pertaining to such child or youth or such child's or youth's parent or guardian received pursuant to section 17a-103a, (B) whether such report resulted in an investigation, and (C) the results of any such investigation.\n\n(t) If a child or youth is placed into out-of-home care by the Commissioner of Children and Families pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall include in any report the commissioner submits to the court information regarding (1) the safety and suitability of such child's or youth's placement, taking into account the requirements set forth in section 17a-114; (2) whether the department has received or obtained the most recent information concerning such child's or youth's medical, dental, developmental, educational and treatment needs from any relevant service providers; (3) a timeline for ensuring that such needs are met; (4) for any such child or youth under three years of age, whether the child or youth was screened for developmental and social-emotional delays pursuant to section 17a-106e, whether any such delays were identified and, if so, whether the child or youth was referred to the birth-to-three program pursuant to said section; (5) the dates of administrative case review meetings and permanency team meetings; (6) any new report alleging abuse or neglect pertaining to such child or youth or a parent or guardian of such child or youth pursuant to section 17a-103a, and (A) whether such report resulted in an investigation, and (B) the findings of any such investigation; and (7) any new criminal charges pending against any such parent or guardian. Such information shall also be submitted to the court (A) not later than ninety days after such child or youth is placed into out-of-home care; (B) if such child's or youth's out-of-home placement changes; and (C) if the commissioner files a permanency plan on behalf of such child or youth. The court shall consider such information in making decisions regarding such child's or youth's best interests.\n\n(u) Prior to the issuance of any order affecting the legal status or placement of a child in any proceeding under this section, the court shall confirm that (1) any attorney for such child has obtained a clear understanding of the situation and the needs of such child, as described in 42 USC 5106a(b)(2)(B), as amended from time to time; (2) any guardian ad litem for such child has performed an independent investigation of the case and is prepared to present information pertinent to the court's determination of the best interests of such child, in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (D) of subdivision (2) of section 46b-129a; and (3) any attorney or guardian ad litem for such child has (A) communicated regularly with such child, or, in the case of a nonverbal child, such child's caregivers and service providers, and (B) visited with such child with sufficient frequency as to be informed of such child's situation and needs.\n\n(v) In any proceeding to review, modify, terminate or extend an order of protective supervision, the Department of Children and Families shall file with the court information concerning (1) whether the department has received or obtained the most up-to-date information concerning the child's medical, dental, developmental, educational and treatment needs from any relevant service providers; (2) whether the child has received services recommended by any such providers and a description of any concerns identified by such providers; (3) a description of (A) any new report alleging abuse or neglect pertaining to the child or a parent of the child received pursuant to section 17a-103a, (B) whether such report resulted in an investigation, and (C) the findings of any such investigation; (4) any new criminal charges pending against any such parent; and (5) for any child under three years of age, whether the child was screened for developmental and social-emotional delays pursuant to section 17a-106e, whether any such delays were identified and, if so, whether the child was referred to the birth-to-three program pursuant to said section.\n\n(w) In any proceeding under this section, the Department of Children and Families shall identify the source of any documentation, statements or allegations included in the department's submissions to the court and the date or dates upon which any such information was obtained by the department.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 2634, subs.

Superior Court for juvenile matters did not lose subject matter jurisdiction because the youth, who was seeking relief in the proceeding, attained the age of 18, except that Superior Court for juvenile matters lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the youth's claim under Subsec. (j) because the youth was over age of 18 and had not alleged factual predicate that he was in full-time attendance in a secondary school, training school, college or job training program. 297 C. 673.

Right to family integrity is not absolute; state's intervention in family matters is justified when it is found that a child has been neglected or uncared for. 76 CA 693.

Trial court's consideration of the age of the case in denying a motion to compel the department's provision of reunification services reflects the legislature's desire to shift the focus of juvenile proceedings from parental rights to the child's right to safety, stability, and permanency. 217 CA 330.\n\nCited. 39 CS 514; 41 CS 23; Id., 145; Id., 505; 42 CS 562; 43 CS 108; 44 CS 235; Id., 551.

A finding of immediate physical danger is a prerequisite to entry of order under Subsec. granting temporary custody of a child in one other than the child's parents. 126 CA 493. An order of temporary custody issued pursuant to Subsec. necessarily suspends or interrupts a period of protective supervision such that a previously ordered period of protective supervision cannot expire and terminate the underlying neglect petition while the order of temporary custody is in place; trial court had ongoing jurisdiction to rule on the order of temporary custody even though no new neglect petition or motion to modify had been filed. 191 CA 397.\n\nSubsec.

Court's failure to order specific steps to facilitate reunification after a finding of neglect, although in error, did not preclude the termination of respondent's parental rights on the basis of abandonment pursuant to Sec. 17a-112(j). 111 CA 500. 18-year-old petitioner failed to establish factual predicate to allow court to commit petitioner to Department of Children and Families pursuant to Subsec. 125 CA 572; Id., 584. Subsec. is the basis on which the legislature intended a court to adjudicate a motion to transfer guardianship of a child or youth from Commissioner of Children and Families to an individual other than the parent or former guardian. 151 CA 820. Subsec. contains no presumption in favor of a parent; Sec. 46b-56b does not apply to proceeding under this section. 153 CA 599. A determination of whether a proposed guardian is a suitable and worthy caregiver is not required prior to proceeding to the best interests determination because a party seeking to transfer guardianship must satisfy both determination requirements. Id., 786. A court's disposition of neglect proceeding awarding custody and guardianship of child to one parent deprives the court of continuing jurisdiction over other parent's possible future reunification with child and requires the cessation of such reunification efforts. 165 CA 604.\n\nSubsec. (k):\n\nThe approval or rejection of a permanency plan under section is not an appealable final judgment; the current statutory scheme for proposing permanency plans deals with future goals for custody of the child and there is nothing in the language of the section that would suggest that the court's authority to revoke commitment is any greater during a permanency hearing than it is at any other point during the proceedings and the respondent will not suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an immediate appeal. 221 CA 59.\n\nSubsec. (m):\n\nBecause Subsec. directs the court to make two findings, first, that there no longer is a cause for commitment, and second, that revoking the commitment is in the child's best interest, Subsec. carries the implication that, at least when a motion for revocation of commitment is contested, an evidentiary hearing shall be held and the moving party must establish facts necessary to warrant revocation of the commitment. 297 C. 737.\n\nBecause respondent parents have not exhausted their statutory remedy of moving to revoke commitment pursuant to section, court lacks jurisdiction over their claim. 66 CA 305. Notwithstanding trial court's failure to make express finding with respect to whether a cause for commitment remained for two minor children committed to custody of Commissioner of Children and Families, trial court's denial of respondent mother's motion to revoke the commitment was proper given its clear and unequivocal finding that it would be in the best interests of the children to remain with their foster parents. 93 CA 25. Trial court improperly revoked, sua sponte, child's commitment to Department of Children and Families and acted outside scope of its authority pursuant to section by opening judgment and revoking commitment without proper evidence, without giving notice to the parties and foster mother, and without giving foster mother opportunity to be heard as required by Subsec. (o). 98 CA 319. Moving party has burden to prove that cause for commitment no longer exists. 116 CA 83. Procedures set forth in Subsec. and Practice Book Sec. 35a-14A strike the appropriate balance between petitioner's and respondent's interests, and comply with the constitution's procedural due process requirements. Subsec. does not infringe on respondent's right to substantive due process because respondent was seeking to acquire custody of daughter from petitioner following daughter's commitment, rather than seeking to prevent interference with an existing and ongoing parent/child relationship. 183 CA 327. Procedures set forth in Subsec. and Practice Book Sec. 35a-14A strike the appropriate balance between petitioner's and respondent's interests, and comply with the constitution's procedural due process requirements. Subsec. does not infringe on respondent's right to substantive due process because respondent was seeking to acquire custody of daughter from petitioner following daughter's commitment, rather than seeking to prevent interference with an existing and ongoing parent/child relationship. 183 CA 327.\n\nSubsec. (n):\n\nA parent who has demonstrated that the reasons that led to the removal of that parent's guardianship rights have been resolved satisfactorily is constitutionally entitled to a presumption that reinstatement is in the best interests of the child, and this presumption applies when the current guardian is a nonparent, but does not apply in a dispute between two parents, and a nonparent must rebut this presumption by clear and convincing evidence. 213 CA 858.",

Such assignment or appointment shall continue for the duration of any such proceeding under section 46b-129, notwithstanding such child's attainment of eighteen years of age. If the child's parent or guardian has been accused by a competent witness of abusing the child, or of causing the child to be neglected or uncared for, upon the assignment or appointment of counsel, such counsel shall be granted immediate access to (i) records relating to the child, including, but not limited to, Department of Social Services records and medical, mental health and substance abuse treatment, law enforcement and educational records, without the necessity of securing further releases, and (ii) the child, for the purpose of consulting with the child privately. The court shall give the parties prior notice of such assignment or appointment. Counsel for the child shall act solely as attorney for the child.\n\n(B) If a child requiring assignment of counsel in a proceeding under section 46b-129 is represented by an attorney for a minor child in an ongoing probate or family matter proceeding, the court may appoint the attorney to represent the child in the proceeding under section 46b-129, provided (i) such counsel is knowledgeable about representing such children, and (ii) the court notifies the office of Chief Public Defender of the appointment. Any child who is subject to an ongoing probate or family matters proceeding who has been appointed a guardian ad litem in such proceeding shall be assigned a separate guardian ad litem in a proceeding under section 46b-129 if it is deemed necessary pursuant to subparagraph (D) of this subdivision.\n\n(C) The primary role of any counsel for the child shall be to advocate for the child in accordance with the Rules of Professional Conduct, except that if the child is incapable of expressing the child's wishes to the child's counsel because of age or other incapacity, the counsel for the child shall advocate for the best interests of the child.\n\n(D) If the court, based on evidence before it, or counsel for the child, determines that the child cannot adequately act in his or her own best interests and the child's wishes, as determined by counsel, if followed, could lead to substantial physical, financial or other harm to the child unless protective action is taken, counsel may request and the court may order that a separate guardian ad litem be assigned for the child, in which case the court shall either appoint a guardian ad litem to serve on a voluntary basis or notify the office of Chief Public Defender who shall assign a separate guardian ad litem for the child. The guardian ad litem shall perform an independent investigation of the case and may present at any hearing information pertinent to the court's determination of the best interests of the child. The guardian ad litem shall be subject to cross-examination upon the request of opposing counsel. The guardian ad litem is not required to be an attorney-at-law but shall be knowledgeable about the needs and protection of children and relevant court procedures. If a separate guardian ad litem is assigned, the person previously serving as counsel for the child shall continue to serve as counsel for the child and a different person shall be assigned as guardian ad litem, unless the court for good cause also determines that a different person should serve as counsel for the child, in which case the court shall notify the office of Chief Public Defender who shall assign a different person as counsel for the child. No person who has served as both counsel and guardian ad litem for a child shall thereafter serve solely as the child's guardian ad litem.\n\n(E) The counsel and guardian ad litem's fees, if any, shall be paid by the office of Chief Public Defender unless the parents or guardian, or the estate of the child, are able to pay, in which case the court shall assess the rate the parent or guardian is able to pay and the office of Chief Public Defender may seek reimbursement for the costs of representation from the parents, guardian or estate of the child;\n\n(3) The privilege against the disclosure of communications between husband and wife shall be inapplicable and either may testify as to any relevant matter; and\n\n(4) Evidence that the child has been abused or has sustained a nonaccidental injury shall constitute prima facie evidence that shall be sufficient to support an adjudication that such child is uncared for or neglected.\n\n(P.A. 96-246, S. 13; P.A. 01-148, S. 1; P.A. 11-51, S. 17; June 12 Sp.

Whenever a child is arrested and charged with a delinquent act, such child (1) shall be brought before a judge of the Superior Court not later than the fifth business day after such arrest, unless required sooner pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, and (2) may be required to submit to the taking of his photograph, physical description and fingerprints. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 46b-124, the name, photograph and custody status of any child arrested for the commission of a capital felony under the provisions of section 53a-54b in effect prior to April 25, 2012, or class A felony may be disclosed to the public.\n\n(b) Whenever a child is brought before a judge of the Superior Court, which court shall be the court that has jurisdiction over juvenile matters where the child resides if the residence of such child can be determined, such judge shall immediately have the case proceeded upon as a juvenile matter. Such judge may admit the child to bail or release the child in the custody of the child's parent or parents, the child's guardian or some other suitable person to appear before the Superior Court when ordered. If there is probable cause to believe that the child has committed the acts alleged, the court may consider if the child should be assessed for services. Such assessment shall be held not later than two weeks after the child is arraigned and such child shall have the right to counsel at such assessment. If detention becomes necessary, such detention shall be in the manner prescribed by this chapter, provided the child shall be placed in the least restrictive environment possible in a manner consistent with public safety.\n\n(c) (1) Upon the arrest of any child by an officer, such officer may (A) release the child to the custody of the child's parent or parents, guardian or some other suitable person or agency, (B) at the discretion of the officer, release the child to the child's own custody, or (C) using the form prescribed pursuant to section 46b-133p, seek a court order to detain the child in a juvenile residential center. No child may be placed in a juvenile residential center unless a judge of the Superior Court determines, based on the available facts, that (i) there is probable cause to believe that the child has committed the acts alleged, (ii) detention of the child is more reasonable than an appropriate less restrictive alternative, and (iii) there is (I) probable cause to believe that the level of risk that the child poses to public safety if released to the community prior to the court hearing or disposition cannot be managed in a less restrictive setting, (II) a need to hold the child in order to ensure the child's appearance before the court or compliance with court process, as demonstrated by the child's previous failure to respond to the court process, or (III) a need to hold the child for another jurisdiction. No child shall be held in any juvenile residential center unless an order to detain is issued by a judge of the Superior Court. If any such judge declines to detain a child, such judge shall articulate the reasons in writing, upon the form submitted in accordance with subparagraph (C) of this subdivision, for not holding the child in a juvenile residential center.\n\n(2) A judge of the Superior Court may order any child who is released into the custody of his or her parent or guardian or some other suitable person or agency after being charged with a second or subsequent delinquency offense involving a motor vehicle, as defined in section 46b-133j, or property theft, to be electronically monitored by using a global positioning system device until such child's case is disposed of or earlier upon order of the court. Any failure by the child to adhere to the judge's order concerning electronic monitoring may result in immediate detention of such child.\n\n(d) When a child is arrested for the commission of a delinquent act and the child is not placed in a juvenile residential center or referred to a diversionary program, an officer shall serve a written complaint and summons on the child and the child's parent, guardian or some other suitable person or agency. If such child is released to the child's own custody, the officer shall make reasonable efforts to notify, and to provide a copy of a written complaint and summons to, the parent or guardian or some other suitable person or agency prior to the court date on the summons. If a child is arrested for a firearms offense or a motor vehicle offense, the court date shall be scheduled for the next business day following the date of the child's arrest for such offense. If any person so summoned wilfully fails to appear in court at the time and place so specified, the court may issue a warrant for the child's arrest or a capias to assure the appearance in court of such parent, guardian or other person. If a child wilfully fails to appear in response to such a summons, the court may order such child taken into custody and such child may be charged with the delinquent act of wilful failure to appear under section 46b-120. The court may punish for contempt, as provided in section 46b-121, any parent, guardian or other person so summoned who wilfully fails to appear in court at the time and place so specified.\n\n(e) When a child is arrested for the commission of a delinquent act and is placed in a juvenile residential center pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, such child may be detained pending a hearing which shall be held on the business day next following the child's arrest. No child may be detained after such hearing unless the court determines, based on the available facts, that (1) there is probable cause to believe that the child has committed the acts alleged, (2) there is no less restrictive alternative available, and (3) through the use of the detention risk screening instrument developed pursuant to section 46b-133g, that there is (A) probable cause to believe that the level of risk the child poses to public safety if released to the community prior to the court hearing or disposition cannot be managed in a less restrictive setting, (B) a need to hold the child in order to ensure the child's appearance before the court or compliance with court process, as demonstrated by the child's previous failure to respond to the court process, or (C) a need to hold the child for another jurisdiction. Such probable cause may be shown by sworn affidavit in lieu of testimony. No child shall be released from a juvenile residential center who is alleged to have committed a serious juvenile offense except by order of a judge of the Superior Court. The court may, in its discretion, consider as an alternative to detention a suspended detention order with graduated sanctions to be imposed based on the detention risk screening for such child, using the instrument developed pursuant to section 46b-133g. Any child confined in a community correctional center or lockup shall be held in an area separate and apart from any adult detainee, except in the case of a nursing infant, and no child shall at any time be held in solitary confinement. No such child may be held for a period that exceeds six hours, except such child may be held for a period that does not exceed eight hours in a case where an officer has submitted an application for an order of detention and the judge has not yet ruled on such application, or if such officer has been unable to contact such child's parent or guardian. When a female child is held in custody, she shall, as far as possible, be in the charge of a woman attendant.\n\n(f) The police officer who brings a child into detention shall have first notified, or made a reasonable effort to notify, the parents or guardian of the child in question of the intended action and shall file at the juvenile residential center a signed statement setting forth the alleged delinquent conduct of the child and the order to detain such child. Upon admission, the child shall be administered the detention risk screening instrument developed pursuant to section 46b-133g, and unless the child was arrested for a serious juvenile offense or unless an order not to release is noted on the take into custody order, arrest warrant or order to detain, the child may be released to the custody of the child's parent or parents, guardian or some other suitable person or agency in accordance with policies adopted by the Court Support Services Division of the Judicial Department pursuant to section 46b-133h.\n\n(g) In conjunction with any order of release from detention, the court may, when it has reason to believe a child is alcohol-dependent or drug-dependent as defined in section 46b-120, and where necessary, reasonable and appropriate, order the child to participate in a program of periodic alcohol or drug testing and treatment as a condition of such release. The results of any such alcohol or drug test shall be admissible only for the purposes of enforcing the conditions of release from detention.\n\n(h) The detention supervisor of a juvenile residential center in charge of intake shall admit only a child who: (1) Is the subject of an order to detain or an outstanding court order to take such child into custody, (2) is ordered by a court to be held in detention, or (3) is being transferred to such center to await a court appearance.\n\n(i) Whenever a child is subject to a court order to take such child into custody, or other process issued pursuant to this section or section 46b-140a, the Judicial Branch may cause the order or process to be entered into a central computer system in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Chief Court Administrator. The existence of the order or process in the computer system shall constitute prima facie evidence of the issuance of the order or process. Any child named in the order or process may be arrested or taken into custody based on the existence of the order or process in the computer system and, if the order or process directs that such child be detained, the child shall be held in a juvenile residential center.\n\n(j) In the case of any child held in detention, the order to detain such child shall be for a period that does not exceed seven days or until the dispositional hearing is held, whichever is shorter, unless, following a detention review hearing, such order is renewed for a period that does not exceed seven days or until the dispositional hearing is held, whichever is shorter.\n\n(k) For purposes of subsections (c) and (e) of this section, a child may be determined to pose a risk to public safety if such child has previously been adjudicated as delinquent for or convicted of or pled guilty or nolo contendere to two or more felony offenses, has had two or more prior dispositions of probation and is charged with commission of a larceny under section 53a-119c.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 2810; 1959, P.A. 28, S. 54; P.A. 74-183, S. 211, 291; P.A. 76-426; 76-436, S. 22, 668, 681; P.A. 77-452, S. 24, 72; P.A. 80-236; P.A. 82-220; P.A. 83-504; P.A. 84-369, S. 1; P.A. 89-273, S. 3; P.A. 90-161, S. 2, 6; P.A. 95-225, S. 15; P.A. 98-256, S. 4; June Sp.

If good cause is shown, the hearing shall be held not later than ninety days after the filing of such request. The court shall decide whether to designate the proceeding as a serious juvenile repeat offender prosecution not later than thirty days after the completion of such hearing. The court shall grant the request to designate the proceeding as a serious juvenile repeat offender prosecution if the prosecutorial official shows by clear and convincing evidence that such designation will serve the public safety. The decision to designate the proceeding as a serious juvenile repeat offender prosecution shall not be a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\n\n(c) A proceeding designated as a serious juvenile repeat offender prosecution pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall be held before the court without a jury provided the child has waived his or her right to a trial by jury. If a child is convicted of or pleads guilty to a felony in such proceeding, the court shall: (1) Sentence the child in accordance with section 46b-140, and (2) sentence the child in accordance with section 53a-28 with the execution of such sentence stayed on the condition that the child not violate the conditions of the sentence imposed pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection or commit a subsequent crime.\n\n(d) If a child is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor in a proceeding designated as a serious juvenile repeat offender prosecution pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the court shall sentence the child in accordance with section 46b-140.\n\n(e) Whenever it appears that a child who has been sentenced pursuant to subsection (c) of this section has violated the conditions of the sentence imposed pursuant to subdivision (1) of said subsection (c) or has committed a subsequent crime, the court may, without notice, order that the child be immediately taken into custody in accordance with the provisions of section 46b-125. The court shall notify the child and such child's parent or guardian and the attorney of record, if any, in writing of the reasons alleged to exist for the lifting of the stay of execution of the sentence imposed pursuant to subdivision (2) of said subsection (c). If the child challenges such reasons, the court shall hold a hearing at which the child shall be entitled to be heard and be represented by counsel. After such hearing, if the court finds that the child has violated the conditions of the sentence imposed pursuant to subdivision (1) of said subsection (c) or committed a subsequent crime, it shall order the child to serve a sentence not to exceed that imposed pursuant to subdivision (2) of said subsection (c) unless it determines there are mitigating circumstances that justify continuing the stay of execution and specifically states such mitigating circumstances in writing for the record. The child shall receive credit against any sentence imposed pursuant to subdivision (2) of said subsection (c) for time served in a juvenile facility pursuant to the sentence imposed pursuant to subdivision (1) of said subsection (c).\n\n(f) Whenever a proceeding has been designated a serious juvenile repeat offender prosecution pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and the child does not waive such child's right to a trial by jury, the court shall transfer the case from the docket for juvenile matters to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court. Upon transfer, such child shall stand trial and be sentenced, if convicted, as if such child were eighteen years of age, subject to the provisions of section 54-91g, except that no such child shall be placed in a correctional facility but shall be maintained in a facility for children and youths until such child attains eighteen years of age or until such child is sentenced, whichever occurs first. Such child shall receive credit against any sentence imposed for time served in a juvenile facility prior to the effectuation of the transfer. A child who has been transferred may enter a guilty plea to a lesser offense if the court finds that such plea is made knowingly and voluntarily. Any child transferred to the regular criminal docket who pleads guilty to a lesser offense shall not resume such child's status as a juvenile regarding such offense.

      "text": "(a) For the purposes of this section, “special juvenile probation” means a period of probation imposed by the superior court for juvenile matters upon a child in a proceeding designated as a serious homicide, firearm or sexual offender prosecution during which the child is supervised by a juvenile probation officer prior to such child attaining eighteen years of age and by an adult probation officer after such child attains eighteen years of age.\n\n(b) Whenever a child is referred for (1) the commission of any crime of (A) murder or manslaughter in the first degree, (B) a violation of section 53a-56a, 53a-60a, 53a-60c, 53a-92a, 53a-94a, 53a-102a, 53a-103a or 53a-212, or (C) a violation of section 53a-59, 53a-101 or 53a-136a if such violation involved the use of a firearm, or (2) the commission of any crime of a sexual nature, and such case is not transferred to the regular criminal docket pursuant to section 46b-127, the prosecutorial official may request the court to designate the proceeding as a serious homicide, firearm or sexual offender prosecution.\n\n(c) If a prosecutorial official requests that a proceeding be designated as a serious homicide, firearm or sexual offender prosecution, the court shall hold a hearing not later than thirty days after the filing of such request unless good cause is shown by the prosecutorial official or by the child as to why the hearing should not be held within such period. If good cause is shown, the hearing shall be held not later than ninety days after the filing of such request. The court shall decide whether to designate the proceeding as a serious homicide, firearm or sexual offender prosecution not later than thirty days after the completion of such hearing. The court shall grant the request to designate the proceeding as a serious homicide, firearm or sexual offender prosecution if the court finds probable cause to believe the child has committed the felony act charged and the prosecutorial official shows by clear and convincing evidence that such designation will serve the public safety. The decision to designate the proceeding as a serious homicide, firearm or sexual offender prosecution shall not be a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\n\n(d) A proceeding designated as a serious homicide, firearm or sexual offender prosecution pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall be held before the court without a jury provided the child has waived the right to a trial by jury. If a child is convicted of or pleads guilty or nolo contendere to a charge in a proceeding that has been designated as a serious homicide, firearm or sexual offender prosecution, the court shall: (1) Sentence the child in accordance with section 46b-140, provided such sentence may be extended for a period not to exceed sixty months, (2) sentence the child to a period of special juvenile probation of at least five years, to commence upon the release of the child from the institution, agency or program in whose care the child had been placed, and (3) sentence the child in accordance with section 53a-28 with the execution of such sentence stayed on the condition that the child not violate the conditions of the sentence imposed pursuant to subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection or commit a subsequent crime.\n\n(e) Whenever there is probable cause to believe that a child who has been sentenced pursuant to subsection (d) of this section has violated the conditions of the sentence imposed pursuant to subdivision (2) of said subsection or has committed a subsequent crime, the court may issue a warrant for the arrest of the child for a violation of the conditions of the sentence imposed pursuant to subsection (d) of this section and may order that the child be taken into custody in accordance with the provisions of sections 46b-125 and 53a-32. If such violation of probation or subsequent crime occurs prior to the person attaining eighteen years of age, the matter shall be handled by the superior court for juvenile matters. If such violation of probation or subsequent crime occurs after the person has attained eighteen years of age, the matter shall be handled by the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court. Whenever such matter is handled by the superior court for juvenile matters, the court shall notify the child and such child's parent or guardian and the attorney of record, if any, in writing of the reasons alleged to exist for the lifting of the stay of execution of the sentence imposed pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection (d) of this section. If the child challenges such reasons, the court shall hold a hearing at which the child shall be entitled to be heard and be represented by counsel. After such hearing, if the court finds that (1) the child has violated the conditions of the sentence imposed pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (d) of this section, (2) committed a subsequent crime, or (3) by clear and convincing evidence that the best interest of the community cannot be served by continued supervision by the superior court for juvenile matters or in the community, it shall order the child to serve a sentence not to exceed that imposed pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection (d) of this section unless it determines there are mitigating circumstances that justify continuing the stay of execution and specifically states such mitigating circumstances in writing for the record. The child shall receive credit against any sentence imposed pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection (d) of this section for time served in a juvenile facility pursuant to the sentence imposed pursuant to subdivision (1) of said subsection.\n\n(f) When a proceeding has been designated as a serious homicide, firearm or sexual offender prosecution pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and the child does not waive the right to a trial by jury, the court shall transfer the case from the docket for juvenile matters to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court. Upon transfer, such child shall stand trial and be sentenced, if convicted, as if such child were eighteen years of age, subject to the provisions of section 54-91g, except that no such child shall be placed in a correctional facility but shall be maintained in a facility for children and youths until such child attains eighteen years of age or until such child is sentenced, whichever occurs first. Such child shall receive credit against any sentence imposed for time served in a juvenile facility prior to the effectuation of the transfer. A child who has been transferred may enter a guilty plea to a lesser offense if the court finds that such plea is made knowingly and voluntarily. Any child transferred to the regular criminal docket who pleads guilty to a lesser offense shall not resume such child's status as a juvenile regarding such offense. If the action is dismissed or nolled or if such child is found not guilty of the charge for which such child was transferred, the child shall resume such child's status as a juvenile until such child attains eighteen years of age.\n\n(June Sp.

The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 USC Section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.\n\nIt is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to: (A) Ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state; (B) ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected; (C) return juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return; (D) make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services; (E) provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles; (F) equitably allocate the costs, benefits and obligations of the compacting states; (G) establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders; (H) ensure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; (I) establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact; (J) establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators; (K) monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; (L) coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and (M) coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nAs used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction:\n\nA. “Bylaws” means those bylaws established by the Interstate Commission for its governance, or for directing or controlling its actions or conduct.\n\nB. “Compact administrator” means the individual in each compacting state appointed pursuant to the terms of this compact, responsible for the administration and management of the state's supervision and transfer of juveniles subject to the terms of this compact, the rules adopted by the Interstate Commission and policies adopted by the State Council under this compact.\n\nC. “Compacting state” means any state which has enacted the enabling legislation for this compact.\n\nD. “Commissioner” means the voting representative of each compacting state appointed pursuant to Article III of this compact.\n\nE. “Court” means any court having jurisdiction over delinquent, neglected or dependent children.\n\nF. “Deputy compact administrator” means the individual, if any, in each compacting state appointed to act on behalf of a compact administrator pursuant to the terms of this compact responsible for the administration and management of the state's supervision and transfer of juveniles subject to the terms of this compact, the rules adopted by the Interstate Commission and policies adopted by the State Council under this compact.\n\nG. “Interstate Commission” means the Interstate Commission for Juveniles created by Article III of this compact.\n\nH. “Juvenile” means any person defined as a juvenile in any compacting state or by the rules of the Interstate Commission, including:\n\n(1) Accused Delinquent: A person charged with an offense that, if committed by an adult, would be a criminal offense;\n\n(2) Adjudicated Delinquent: A person found to have committed an offense that, if committed by an adult, would be a criminal offense;\n\n(3) Accused Status Offender: A person charged with an offense that would not be a criminal offense if committed by an adult;\n\n(4) Adjudicated Status Offender: A person found to have committed an offense that would not be a criminal offense if committed by an adult; and\n\n(5) Non-Offender: A person in need of supervision who has not been accused or adjudicated a status offender or delinquent.\n\nI. “Non-compacting state” means any state which has not enacted the enabling legislation for this compact.\n\nJ. “Probation or parole” means any kind of supervision or conditional release of juveniles authorized under the laws of the compacting states.\n\nK. “Rule” means a written statement by the Interstate Commission promulgated pursuant to Article VI of this compact that is of general applicability and implements, interprets or prescribes a policy or provision of the compact, or an organizational, procedural or practice requirement of the Interstate Commission, and has the force and effect of statutory law in a compacting state, and includes the amendment, repeal or suspension of an existing rule.\n\nL. “State” means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia or its designee, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Marianas Islands.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nINTERSTATE COMMISSION FOR JUVENILES\n\nA.

The Interstate Commission shall, through its executive committee, appoint or retain an executive director for such period, upon such terms and conditions and for such compensation as the Interstate Commission may deem appropriate. The executive director shall serve as secretary to the Interstate Commission, but shall not be a member and shall hire and supervise such other staff as may be authorized by the Interstate Commission.\n\nSection C. Qualified Immunity, Defense and Indemnification\n\n1. The Interstate Commission's executive director and employees shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for any claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of or relating to any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties or responsibilities; provided, that any such person shall not be protected from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury or liability caused by the intentional or wilful and wanton misconduct of any such person.\n\n2.

The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Interstate Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.\n\nTHE STATE COUNCIL\n\nEach compacting state shall create a State Council for Interstate Juvenile Supervision.

The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.\n\n5.

The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, the bylaws, or rules and any other grounds designated in the bylaws and rules of the Interstate Commission. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission and of the default pending a cure of the default. The Interstate Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Interstate Commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.\n\n2. Within sixty days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the Interstate Commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice or chief judicial officer, the majority and minority leaders of the legislature and the state council of the defaulting state of such termination.\n\n3. The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n4. The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.\n\n5. Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the rules.\n\nSection C.

The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.\n\nB. The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.\n\nARTICLE XIII\n\nBINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS\n\nSection A. Other Laws\n\n1.

If any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency of the compacting state to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.\n\n(P.A. 03-255, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 03-255 effective July 1, 2004, or upon enactment by thirty-five jurisdictions, whichever is later; Illinois became the thirty-fifth enacting jurisdiction on August 26, 2008 (Revisor's note: A reference in paragraph F. of Article VI to “this act” was changed editorially by the Revisors to “this compact” for consistency with other references in the compact).",
