Amendment to Sec. 29-32 re pistol permits affected defendant's substantive right to bear arms and thus this section applies, but its presumption in this case is rebutted by unequivocally expressed legislative intent. 243 C. 250. Cited. 247 C. 638. Retroactive effect of P.A. 00-174, Sec. 71, discussed. 255 C. 498.
