A position is directly attributable to the manufacturing facility if: (A) The work is performed or the base of operations is at the facility; (B) the position did not exist prior to the construction, renovation, expansion or acquisition of the facility; and (C) but for the construction, renovation, expansion or acquisition of the facility, the position would not have existed, provided nothing in this section shall preclude a position from being considered directly attributable to a manufacturing facility if such position formerly existed in an eligible manufacturing facility in the same municipality under section 32-9p. For income years commencing on and after January 1, 2012, the credit under this section for that portion of the tax imposed by this chapter, which is allocable to any manufacturing facility shall be available under the same terms and conditions to that portion of such tax which is allocable to an eligible facility. For purposes of this section, “eligible facility” means any facility described in subparagraph (D) of subdivision (2) of subsection (d) of section 32-9p.\n\n(b) There shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter an amount equal to the following percentage of that portion of such tax which is allocable to any service facility: (1) Fifteen per cent, if there are three hundred or more but not more than five hundred ninety-nine new employees working at such facility; (2) twenty per cent if there are six hundred or more but not more than eight hundred ninety-nine new employees working at such facility; (3) twenty-five per cent, if there are nine hundred or more but not more than one thousand one hundred ninety-nine new employees working at such facility; (4) thirty per cent if there are one thousand two hundred or more but not more than one thousand four hundred ninety-nine new employees working at such facility; (5) forty per cent, if there are one thousand five hundred or more but not more than one thousand nine hundred ninety-nine new employees working at such facility; or (6) fifty per cent if there are two thousand or more new employees working at such facility. As used in this subsection: (A) “New employee” means a person hired by a taxpayer to fill a position for a new job or a person shifted from an existing location of the taxpayer outside this state to a service facility in this state, provided (i) in no case shall the total number of new employees allowed for purposes of this credit exceed the total increase in the taxpayer's employment in this state, which increase shall be the difference between (I) the number of employees employed by the taxpayer in this state at the time of application to the Commissioner of Revenue Services for such credit plus the number of new employees who would be eligible for inclusion under the credit allowed under this subsection without regard to this calculation, and (II) the highest number of employees employed by the taxpayer in this state in the year preceding the taxpayer's application to the Commissioner of Revenue Services for such credit, and (ii) a person shall be deemed to be a “new employee” only if such person's duties in connection with the operation of the facility are on a regular, full-time or equivalent or full-time and permanent basis; and (B) “new job” means a job that did not exist in the business of a taxpayer in this state prior to the taxpayer's application to the Commissioner of Revenue Services for such credit and that is filled by a new employee, but does not include a job created when an employee is shifted from an existing location of the taxpayer in this state to a service facility.\n\n(c) The portion of such tax which is allocable to such a manufacturing facility, service facility or eligible facility shall be determined by multiplying such tax by a fraction computed as the simple arithmetical mean of the following fractions: First, a fraction the numerator of which is the average monthly net book value in the income year of the manufacturing facility, service facility or eligible facility, and machinery and equipment acquired for and installed in the manufacturing facility, service facility or eligible facility, without deduction on account of any encumbrance thereon, or if rented to the taxpayer, the value of the manufacturing facility, service facility or eligible facility, and machinery and equipment acquired for and installed in the manufacturing facility, service facility or eligible facility, computed by multiplying the gross rents payable by the taxpayer for the manufacturing facility, service facility or eligible facility, and such machinery and equipment during the income year or period by eight, and the denominator of which is the sum of the average monthly net book value of all real property and machinery and equipment held and owned by the taxpayer in the state, without deduction on account of any encumbrance thereon and the value of all real property and machinery and equipment rented to the taxpayer in the state, computed by multiplying the gross rents payable during the income year by eight; and second, a fraction the numerator of which is all wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the income year to employees of the taxpayer whose positions are directly attributable to the manufacturing facility, service facility or eligible facility and the denominator of which is the wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the income year to all employees of the taxpayer in the state. An employee's position is directly so attributable if (1) the employee's service is performed or his base of operations is at the manufacturing facility, service facility or eligible facility, (2) the position did not exist prior to the construction, renovation, expansion or acquisition of the manufacturing facility, service facility or eligible facility, and (3) but for the construction, renovation, expansion or acquisition of the manufacturing facility, service facility or eligible facility the position would not have existed. For the purposes of this subsection, “gross rents” means gross rents as defined in section 12-218.\n\n(d) The credit allowed by this section may be claimed only by the initial occupant or occupants of the manufacturing facility, service facility or eligible facility. The owner of the manufacturing facility, service facility or eligible facility may not claim the credit unless the owner is also an occupant. The credit may first be claimed on the tax return for the taxpayer's income year which begins during the calendar year next succeeding the calendar year in which the taxpayer was issued an eligibility certificate, and may be claimed in each of the following nine income years. If within such period, however, any facility for which an eligibility certificate has been issued ceases to qualify as a manufacturing facility, service facility or eligible facility, or any occupant of a manufacturing facility, service facility or eligible facility ceases to be an occupant, the entitlement to the credit allowed by this section shall terminate in the income year in which the qualification or occupancy ceases, and there shall not be a pro rata application of the credit to such income year. No credit allowed by this section may be first claimed for any income year commencing on or after January 1, 2018.\n\n(e) Any subsequent occupant or occupants of a manufacturing facility, service facility or eligible facility for which an eligibility certificate has been issued may claim the credit allowed by this section in accordance with subsection (c) of this section but only after obtaining a new eligibility certificate with respect to the manufacturing facility, service facility or eligible facility being occupied in the manner provided in section 32-9r.\n\n(f) The Commissioner of Economic and Community Development shall, upon request, provide a copy of the applicable eligibility certificate to the Commissioner of Revenue Services.\n\n(P.A. 78-303, S. 85, 136; 78-357, S. 7, 16; P.A. 81-445, S. 4, 11; P.A. 82-435, S. 3, 8; P.A. 83-381, S. 2; 83-587, S. 26, 96; P.A. 90-270, S. 23, 38; P.A. 93-311, S. 6, 8; P.A. 94-247, S. 5, 8; P.A. 96-239, S. 12, 17; P.A. 97-295, S. 14, 25; P.A. 98-262, S. 14, 22; P.A. 00-174, S. 22, 83; P.A. 06-159, S. 7; P.A. 10-98, S. 4; P.A. 11-78, S. 2; P.A. 18-145, S. 1.)\n\n*Note: Section 2 of public act 93-311 is special in nature and therefore has not been codified but remains in full force and effect according to its terms.\n\nHistory: P.A. 78-303 allowed substitution of commissioner of revenue services for tax commissioner in accordance with provisions of P.A. 77-614; P.A. 81-445 included provisions allowing double credit for certain facilities in enterprise zones in Subsec.

Any amount of credit refunded under this section shall be refunded to the taxpayer under the provisions of this chapter, except that such credit refund shall not be subject to the provisions of section 12-227. Payment of the capital base tax under section 12-219 for an income year commencing on or after January 1, 2002, in which year the taxpayer reports no net income, as defined in section 12-213, or payment of the minimum tax of two hundred fifty dollars under section 12-219 or 12-223c for any income year, shall not be considered a tax liability for purposes of this section.\n\n(b) An application for refund of such credit amount shall be made to the Commissioner of Revenue Services, at the same time such taxpayer files its return for the income year on or before the original due date or, if applicable, the extended due date of such year's return, on such forms and containing such information as prescribed by said commissioner.

and (B) such expenditures and payments are not funded, within the meaning of Section 41(d)(4)(H) of said Internal Revenue Code, by any grant, contract, or otherwise by a person or governmental entity other than the taxpayer unless such other person is included in a combined return with the person paying or incurring such expenses;\n\n(2) “Combined return” means a combined unitary tax return under section 12-222;\n\n(3) “Commissioner” means the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development;\n\n(4) “Qualified small business” means a company that (A) has gross income for the previous income year that does not exceed one hundred million dollars, and (B) has not, in the determination of the commissioner, met the gross income test through transactions with a related person, as defined in section 12-217w.\n\n(c) (1) The amount allowed as a credit in any income year shall be the tentative credit calculated under subdivision (2) of this subsection, modified as provided in subsection (e) or (f) of this section, if applicable, except that in the case of a qualified small business the tentative credit allowed for research and development expenses shall be equal to six per cent of such expenses or in the case of any business employing over two thousand five hundred people in the state of Connecticut with annual revenues in excess of three billion dollars and headquartered in an enterprise zone the tentative credit allowed for research and development expenses shall be equal to the greater of (A) the tentative credit calculated under subdivision (2), modified as provided in subsection (e) or (f) of this section, if applicable, or (B) three and one-half per cent of such expense.\n\n(2) Where the research and development expenses paid or incurred in the income year equal: (A) Fifty million dollars or less, the tentative credit allowed shall be an amount equal to one per cent of such expenses; (B) more than fifty million dollars but not more than one hundred million dollars, the tentative credit allowed shall be equal to five hundred thousand dollars plus two per cent of the excess of such expenses over fifty million dollars; (C) more than one hundred million dollars but not more than two hundred million dollars, the tentative credit allowed shall be equal to one million five hundred thousand dollars plus four per cent of the excess of such expenses over one hundred million dollars; and (D) more than two hundred million dollars, the tentative credit allowed shall be equal to five million five hundred thousand dollars plus six per cent of the excess of such expenses over two hundred million dollars.\n\n(d) (1) The credit provided for by this section shall be allowed for any income year commencing on or after January 1, 1993, provided any credits allowed for income years commencing on or after January 1, 1993, and prior to January 1, 1995, may not be taken until income years commencing on or after January 1, 1995, and, for the purposes of subdivision (2) of this subsection, shall be treated as if the credit for each such income year first became allowable in the first income year commencing on or after January 1, 1995.\n\n(2) No more than one-third of the amount of the credit allowable for any income year may be included in the calculation of the amount of the credit that may be taken in that income year.\n\n(3) The total amount of the credit under subdivision (1) of this subsection that may be taken for any income year may not exceed the greater of (A) fifty per cent of the taxpayer's tax liability or in the case of a combined return, fifty per cent of the combined tax liability, for such income year, determined without regard to any credits allowed under this section, and (B) the lesser of (i) two hundred per cent of the credit otherwise allowed under subsection (c) of this section for such income year, and (ii) ninety per cent of the taxpayer's tax liability or in the case of a combined return, ninety per cent of the combined liability for such income year, determined without regard to any credits allowed under this section.\n\n(4) (A) Credits that are allowed under this section for income years commencing prior to January 1, 2021, that exceed the amount permitted to be taken in an income year pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (1), (2) or (3) of this subsection shall be carried forward to each of the successive income years until such credits, or applicable portion thereof, are fully taken.\n\n(B) Credits that are allowed under this section for income years commencing on or after January 1, 2021, that exceed the amount permitted to be taken in an income year pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (1), (2) or (3) of this subsection shall be carried forward to each of the successive income years until such credits, or applicable portion thereof, are fully taken. No credit or portion thereof allowed under this section for income years commencing on or after January 1, 2021, shall be carried forward for a period of more than fifteen years.\n\n(C) No credit allowed under this section shall be taken in any income year until the full amount of all allowable credits carried forward to such year from any prior income year, commencing with the earliest such prior year, that otherwise may be taken under subdivision (2) of this subsection in that income year, have been fully taken.\n\n(e) In addition to the wage base test set forth in subsection (f) of this section, any aerospace company or in the case of a combined return, any combined group including an aerospace company, shall be subject to this subsection for any income year commencing on or after January 1, 1993, and prior to January 1, 1996. For purposes of this subsection, an aerospace company is any taxpayer, whether or not included in a combined return, engaged principally in the aerospace industry whose research and development expenses during each of the income years beginning on or after January 1, 1990, 1991 and 1992, respectively, exceeded two hundred million dollars. No aerospace company, or in the case of a combined return, a combined group including an aerospace company, shall be allowed any credit under this section for any income year to which this subsection applies in which the aggregate transfers by an aerospace company, if any, of historical economic base functions outside of this state, other than to a location outside the United States, since January 1, 1993, through the end of such income year, have materially reduced the historical economic base functions in this state. For purposes of this subsection, the historical economic base functions shall be those economic base functions conducted by an aerospace company, which need not be all economic base functions of the aerospace company, in this state on January 1, 1993, whose continuance in this state, as determined by the commissioner in his discretion, will further the policies set forth in section 32-221. Such historical economic base functions shall be set forth in a binding memorandum of understanding between the commissioner and an aerospace company that may be entered into at any time prior to the expiration of the first income year to which this subsection applies, with sufficient specificity to allow the commissioner and the aerospace company to determine in all income years subject to this subsection whether there has been such a reduction in said historical economic base functions. As a prerequisite to the allowance of any credit otherwise allowable under this section for any income year to which this subsection applies, each aerospace company shall obtain a certificate of eligibility issued by the commissioner to the aerospace company for such income year. The aerospace company shall not later than sixty days after the close of each income year to which this subsection applies certify to the commissioner that there has been no such aggregate material reduction in the historical economic base functions in this state for the income year just completed that otherwise has not been offset as provided below. Within sixty days thereafter, the commissioner shall review the certification and, if the commissioner determines that there has been no such net aggregate material reduction in the historical economic base functions in this state, the commissioner shall issue a certificate of eligibility for said income year. The following shall not constitute a material reduction in the historical economic base functions in this state: (1) A reduction of not more than two per cent of the historical economic base functions; (2) transfer of an historical economic base function to a person in this state; (3) transfer of a historical economic base function outside of the United States; or (4) reductions in historical economic base functions attributable to reductions in volume, productivity improvements or the discontinuance of operations due to obsolescence or the like. Any transfers that may otherwise be counted in determining if a material reduction occurred may be offset to the extent economic base functions listed in, or comparable to those listed in, the memorandum of understanding are increased in this state, transferred into this state, or established in this state. Any such increase, transfer or establishment made during an income year, or subsequent to such income year but prior to the filing of the return for such income year, shall be effective for such income year and all income years thereafter. The commissioner may issue or reissue a certificate of eligibility for the applicable income year following any such offset. The commissioner shall, upon request, provide a copy of the certificate of eligibility and memorandum of understanding to the Commissioner of Revenue Services.\n\n(f) The tentative credit allowable to the taxpayer, or in the case of a combined return, the combined group, that pays or incurs research and development expenses in excess of two hundred million dollars for the income year shall be reduced for any income year in which the workforce reductions, if any, exceed the percentages set forth below. For purposes of this subsection, workforce reductions shall be reductions of the historical Connecticut wage base of the taxpayer, or in the case of a combined return, the combined group, as a result of the transfer outside of this state, other than to a location outside the United States, of work done by employees of the taxpayer, or in the case of a combined return, the combined group. Such reduction in the tentative credit shall be as follows: (1) If the historical Connecticut wage base for the income year is so reduced by not more than two per cent, the tentative credit allowable for the income year shall not be reduced; (2) if the historical Connecticut wage base for the income year is so reduced by more than two per cent but not more than three per cent, the tentative credit allowable for the income year shall be reduced by ten per cent; (3) if the historical Connecticut wage base for the income year is so reduced by more than three per cent but not more than four per cent, the tentative credit allowable for the income year shall be reduced by twenty per cent; (4) if the historical Connecticut wage base for the income year is so reduced by more than four per cent but not more than five per cent, the tentative credit allowable for the income year shall be reduced by forty per cent; (5) if the historical Connecticut wage base for the income year is so reduced by more than five per cent but not more than six per cent, the tentative credit allowable for the income year shall be reduced by seventy per cent; and (6) if the historical Connecticut wage base for the income year is so reduced by more than six per cent, no credit for the income year shall be allowed. The Connecticut wage base for any income year shall be the total wages assigned to Connecticut for such income year under section 12-218 excluding wages paid to the ten most highly-compensated executives of the taxpayer, or in the case of a combined return, the combined group, and any compensation that does not subject the recipient thereof to federal income tax thereon in said income year. The historical Connecticut wage base shall be the Connecticut wage base for the third full income year immediately preceding the current income year; provided the historical Connecticut wage base for the first three income years commencing on or after January 1, 1993, shall be the Connecticut wage base for May 1993, converted to an annual basis. The following shall not constitute a workforce reduction for any income year: (A) A reduction of wages attributable to the transfer of work done by a taxpayer, or in the case of a combined return, by the combined group, in this state to a party in this state; (B) a reduction of wages attributable to the transfer of work done by a taxpayer, or in the case of a combined return, by the combined group, outside the United States; or (C) a reduction in wages attributable to reductions in volume, productivity improvements or the discontinuance of operations due to obsolescence or the like. Solely for purposes of determining whether the allowable credit is to be reduced under this subsection for any income year, the Connecticut wages attributable to any new jobs or jobs moved into this state by the taxpayer, or in the case of a combined return, the combined group, during such income year or subsequent to such income year but prior to the filing of the return for such income year shall be an offset to any workforce reduction of a taxpayer, or in the case of a combined return, the combined group, for said income year. A new job shall be a job that did not exist in the business of a taxpayer, or in the case of a combined return, a member of the combined group, in this state at the end of the income year just completed. Notwithstanding subsection (g) of this section, a taxpayer may elect for any income year to separately compute its allowable tentative credit under this subsection for any one or more business units that had gross revenues for such income year in excess of one hundred million dollars. Any taxpayer subject to this subsection shall not later than sixty days after the close of each income year certify to the commissioner whether or not there has been any workforce reduction for the income year just completed, the amount thereof, and any offsets thereto as provided above. Not later than sixty days thereafter, the commissioner shall review the certification and, if the commissioner determines that there has been no more than a six per cent workforce reduction, net of any such offsets, the commissioner shall issue a certificate of eligibility stating the amount of net workforce reduction so determined for said income year, if any. The commissioner shall not issue a certificate of eligibility for any income year in which the commissioner determines that there has been more than a six per cent net workforce reduction. The commissioner shall, upon request, provide a copy of the certificate of eligibility to the Commissioner of Revenue Services.\n\n(g) Where one or more taxpayers properly included in a combined return pays or incurs research and development expenses, all allowances and limitations under this section shall be made on an aggregate basis for all taxpayers included in such combined return, provided, the credit attributable to a qualified small business may be taken only against the combined tax liability attributable to such qualified small business. The amount of the combined tax for all corporations properly included in a combined corporation business tax return that is attributable to a qualified small business shall be in the same ratio to such combined tax that the net income apportioned to this state of the qualified small business bears to the net income, in the aggregate of all corporations included in such combined return. Solely for the purposes of computing such ratio, any net loss apportioned to this state by a corporation included in such combined return shall be disregarded.\n\n(h) Any taxpayer, or in the case of a combined return, any combined group of taxpayers, that claims a credit under section 12-217j for any income year shall reduce the amount of research and development expenses that otherwise may be taken into account in computing the allowable credit under subsection (c) of this section for such income year by the amount of excess research and experimental expenditures, as computed under said section 12-217j, for which the credit thereunder is given.\n\n(i) The commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to carry out the purposes of this section.\n\n(P.A. 93-433, S. 1, 26; P.A. 95-250, S. 1; P.A. 96-211, S. 1, 5, 6; P.A. 98-110, S. 23, 27; June Sp.

The commissioner shall require the financial institution to submit quarterly reports of the number of individuals to whom the financial institution or a related person made payments of six hundred dollars or more which must be reported as provided by Section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, for each income year for which the credit is claimed and to submit such other information as may be necessary to determine whether all appropriate requirements have been met and that the applicant continues to be a financial institution. Such reports shall also include the number of individuals who are principals and who qualify as qualified employees under subparagraph (C) of subdivision (1) of subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(h) The sale, merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other reorganization by or of a financial institution may not create new eligibility for the credit allowed under subsection (b) or (f) of this section in a succeeding company. Any successor to the financial institution which is a financial institution may qualify under subsection (b) or (f) of this section if either the original financial institution or such successor satisfies the new facility construction and certificate of occupancy requirements and such successor qualifies under subsection (b) or (f) of this section on an annual basis, provided the total credits available to the successor financial institution, when added to all credits taken by the original financial institution, shall not exceed the applicable limits under subsection (b) or (f) of this section, or both, as the case may be.\n\n(i) The commissioner may accept and approve proposals to create new positions as described in subsection (d) of this section.

The total amount of credit allowed under subsection (f) of this section to such a taxpayer shall not exceed, in the aggregate, twenty-five million dollars.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, for purposes of any credit allowed under subsection (f) of this section to a taxpayer which has received financial assistance under section 32-236, the initial qualified year shall be the income year in which the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development executes an agreement with such financial institution to provide financial assistance pursuant to section 32-236.\n\n(3) For purposes of determining the number and specification of qualified employees under subsection (d) of this section, and the number and specification of new employees under section 12-217e, with respect to any taxpayer which has received financial assistance under section 32-236, the dates, numbers and specifications shall be the dates, numbers and specifications provided in an agreement executed by the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development with such financial institution to provide financial assistance pursuant to section 32-236.

A motor vehicle shall be deemed to be used wholly in the state in which it is registered.\n\n(e) (1) The numerator of the receipts factor includes interest and fees or penalties in the nature of interest from loans secured by real property if the property is located within this state.

If more than fifty per cent of the fair market value of the real property is not located within any one state, the receipts described in this subsection shall be included in the numerator of the receipts factor if the borrower is located in this state.\n\n(2) The determination of whether the real property securing a loan is located within this state shall be made as of the time the original agreement was made and all subsequent substitutions of collateral shall be disregarded.\n\n(f) The numerator of the receipts factor includes interest and fees or penalties in the nature of interest from loans not secured by real property if the borrower is located in this state.\n\n(g) (1) The numerator of the receipts factor includes net gains from the sale of loans. Net gains from the sale of loans includes income recorded under the coupon stripping rules of Section 1286 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(2) The amount of net gains, but not less than zero, from the sale of loans secured by real property included in the numerator is determined by multiplying such net gains by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount included in the numerator of the receipts factor pursuant to subsection (e) of this section and the denominator of which is the total amount of interest and fees or penalties in the nature of interest from loans secured by real property.\n\n(3) The amount of net gains, but not less than zero, from the sale of loans not secured by real property included in the numerator is determined by multiplying such net gains by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount included in the numerator of the receipts factor pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and the denominator of which is the total amount of interest and fees or penalties in the nature of interest from loans not secured by real property.\n\n(h) (1) The numerator of the receipts factor includes loan servicing fees derived from loans secured by real property multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount included in the numerator of the receipts factor pursuant to subsection (e) of this section and the denominator of which is the total amount of interest and fees or penalties in the nature of interest from loans secured by real property.\n\n(2) The numerator of the receipts factor includes loan servicing fees derived from loans not secured by real property multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount included in the numerator of the receipts factor pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and the denominator of which is the total amount of interest and fees or penalties in the nature of interest from loans not secured by real property.\n\n(3) In circumstances in which the taxpayer receives loan servicing fees for servicing either the secured or the unsecured loans of another, the numerator of the receipts factor shall include such fees if the borrower is located in this state.\n\n(i) (1) Interest, dividends, net gains, but not less than zero, and other income from investment assets and activities and from trading assets and activities shall be included in the receipts factor. Investment assets and activities and trading assets and activities include, but are not limited to, investment securities, trading account assets, federal funds, securities purchased and sold under agreements to resell or repurchase, options, futures contracts, forward contracts, notional principal contracts such as swaps, equities, and foreign currency transactions. With respect to the investment and trading assets and activities described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this subdivision, the receipts factor shall include the amounts described in said subparagraphs (A) and (B).\n\n(A) The receipts factor shall include the amount by which interest from federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements exceeds interest expense on federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements.\n\n(B) The receipts factor shall include the amount by which interest, dividends, gains and other income from trading assets and activities, including, but not limited to, assets and activities in the matched book, in the arbitrage book, and foreign currency transactions, exceed amounts paid in lieu of interest, amounts paid in lieu of dividends and losses from such assets and activities.\n\n(2) The numerator of the receipts factor includes interest, dividends, net gains, but not less than zero, and other income from investment assets and activities and from trading assets and activities described in subdivision (1) of this subsection that are attributable to this state.\n\n(A) The amount of interest, dividends, net gains, but not less than zero, and other income from investment assets and activities in the investment account to be attributed to this state and included in the numerator is determined by multiplying all such income from such assets and activities by a fraction, the numerator of which is the average value of such assets which are properly assigned to a regular place of business of the taxpayer within this state and the denominator of which is the average value of all such assets.\n\n(B) The amount of interest from federal funds sold and purchased and from securities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold under repurchase agreements attributable to this state and included in the numerator is determined by multiplying the amount described in subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of this subsection from such funds and such securities by a fraction, the numerator of which is the average value of federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell which are properly assigned to a regular place of business of the taxpayer within this state and the denominator of which is the average value of all such funds and such securities.\n\n(C) The amount of interest, dividends, gains and other income from trading assets and activities, including, but not limited to, assets and activities in the matched book, in the arbitrage book and foreign currency transactions, but excluding amounts described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of this subdivision, attributable to this state and included in the numerator is determined by multiplying the amount described in subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of this subsection by a fraction, the numerator of which is the average value of such trading assets which are properly assigned to a regular place of business of the taxpayer within this state and the denominator of which is the average value of all such assets.\n\n(D) For purposes of this subdivision, the average value of property owned by the taxpayer is computed on an annual basis by adding the value of the property on the first day of the income year and the value on the last day of the income year and dividing the sum by two. If averaging on this basis does not properly reflect average value, the commissioner may require averaging on a more frequent basis. The taxpayer may elect to average on a more frequent basis. When averaging on a more frequent basis is required by the commissioner or is elected by the taxpayer, the same method of valuation must be used consistently by the taxpayer with respect to property within and without this state and on all subsequent returns unless the taxpayer receives prior permission from the commissioner or the commissioner requires a different method of determining average value.\n\n(3) In lieu of using the method set forth in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the taxpayer may elect, or the commissioner may require in order to fairly represent the business activity of the taxpayer in this state, the use of the method set forth in this subdivision.\n\n(A) The amount of interest, dividends, net gains, but not less than zero, and other income from investment assets and activities in the investment account to be attributed to this state and included in the numerator is determined by multiplying all such income from such assets and activities by a fraction, the numerator of which is the gross income from such assets and activities which are properly assigned to a regular place of business of the taxpayer within this state and the denominator of which is the gross income from all such assets and activities.\n\n(B) The amount of interest from federal funds sold and purchased and from securities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold under repurchase agreements attributable to this state and included in the numerator is determined by multiplying the amount described in subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of this subsection from such funds and such securities by a fraction, the numerator of which is the gross income from such funds and such securities which are properly assigned to a regular place of business of the taxpayer within this state and the denominator of which is the gross income from all such funds and securities.\n\n(C) The amount of interest, dividends, gains and other income from trading assets and activities, including, but not limited to, assets and activities in the matched book, in the arbitrage book and foreign currency transactions, but excluding amounts described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of this subdivision, attributable to this state and included in the numerator is determined by multiplying the amount described in subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of this subsection by a fraction, the numerator of which is the gross income from such trading assets and activities which are properly assigned to a regular place of business of the taxpayer within this state and the denominator of which is the gross income from all such assets and activities.\n\n(4) If the taxpayer elects or is required by the commissioner to use the method set forth in subdivision (3) of this subsection, it shall use this method on all subsequent returns unless the taxpayer receives prior permission from the commissioner to use, or the commissioner requires a different method.\n\n(5) The taxpayer shall have the burden of proving that an investment asset or activity or trading asset or activity was properly assigned to a regular place of business outside of this state by demonstrating that the day-to-day decisions regarding the asset or activity occurred at a regular place of business outside this state. Where the day-to-day decisions regarding an investment asset or activity or trading asset or activity occur at more than one regular place of business and one such regular place of business is in this state and one such regular place of business is outside this state, such asset or activity shall be considered to be located at the regular place of business of the taxpayer where the investment or trading policies or guidelines with respect to the asset or activity are established. Unless the taxpayer demonstrates to the contrary, such policies and guidelines shall be presumed to be established at the commercial domicile of the taxpayer.\n\n(j) (1) The numerator of the receipts factor includes receipts received for management, distribution and administrative services performed on behalf of an investment entity in an amount equal to the product of such receipts for the income year multiplied by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the average of (i) the fair market value of the interests in the investment entity issued and outstanding on the first day of such investment entity's taxable year for federal income tax purposes, which ends within or at the same time as the income year of the financial service company, that are owned by investors in such investment entity if the billing address of such investors is in this state, and (ii) the fair market value of the interests in the investment entity issued and outstanding on the last day of such investment entity's taxable year for federal income tax purposes, which ends within or at the same time as the income year of the financial service company, that are owned by investors in such investment entity if the billing address of such investors is in this state; and (B) the denominator of which shall be the average of the fair market value of the interests in the investment entity issued and outstanding that are owned by investors in such investment entity on such dates.\n\n(2) The numerator of the receipts factor includes receipts received for management, distribution and administrative services performed on behalf of a pension fund or retirement account in an amount equal to the product of such receipts for the income year multiplied by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the average of (i) the number of participants with an interest in the pension fund or retirement account on the first day of the pension fund or retirement account taxable year, for federal income tax purposes, which ends within or at the same time as the income year of the financial service company, whose billing address is in this state, and (ii) the number of participants with an interest in the pension fund or retirement account on the last day of the pension fund or retirement account taxable year, for federal income tax purposes, which ends within or at the same time as the income year of the financial service company, whose billing address is in this state; and (B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of participants with an interest in the pension fund or retirement account on such dates. In lieu of using the billing addresses of the participants with an interest in the pension fund or retirement account as provided in this subdivision, the taxpayer may elect to determine receipts in the manner provided for in this subsection based upon the average of the fair market value of funds under management in each income year allocated to the commercial domicile of the sponsor of the pension fund or retirement account and, where there is no sponsor for a particular pension fund or retirement account, the billing address of the participant. The election, if made by the taxpayer, shall be irrevocable for, and applicable for, five successive income years and shall be applicable to all receipts from the rendering of management, distribution or administrative services performed for any pension fund or retirement account.\n\n(3) In the case of a separate account of an insurance company, to the extent that both subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection may be applicable, then subdivision (2) shall apply.\n\n(k) This section shall not apply to net income from services or activities described in subsection (e), (f) or (i) of section 12-218, which income shall be apportioned in accordance with said subsection (e), (f) or (i), whether or not the taxpayer is taxable outside this state, or, for income years commencing prior to January 1, 2002, in the case of net income from activities described in said subsection (i) that is earned by a taxpayer that is either not eligible to make the election described in said subsection (i) or does not make the election described in said subsection (i) which income shall be apportioned in accordance with subsection (b) of said section 12-218.\n\n(l) For all other receipts not otherwise sourced by this section, the numerator of the receipts factor includes all other receipts if the billing address of the customer is in this state; otherwise the numerator will include all other receipts pursuant to the provisions of section 12-218.\n\n(m) Each financial service company that is a member of a combined group required to file a combined unitary tax return pursuant to section 12-222 shall apportion its net income as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of section 12-218e.\n\n(P.A. 98-110, S. 11, 27; P.A. 99-121, S. 5, 28; June Sp.

If the limited partner is not otherwise carrying on or doing business in Connecticut, its distributive share of income from an investment partnership is not subject to tax under this chapter.\n\n(5) All dividends paid by one member to another member of the combined group shall be eliminated from the income of the recipient.\n\n(6) The principles set forth in the Treasury regulations promulgated under Section 1502 of the Internal Revenue Code, including the principles relating to deferrals, eliminations, and exclusions, shall apply to the extent consistent with the Connecticut combined group membership and combined unitary reporting principles. Upon the occurrence of either of the following events, deferred business income resulting from an intercompany transaction among members of a combined group shall be restored to the income of the seller and shall be included in the combined group's net income as if the seller had earned the income immediately before the event:\n\n(A) The object of a deferred intercompany transaction is: (i) Resold by the buyer to an entity that is not a member of the combined group, (ii) resold by the buyer to an entity that is a member of the combined group for use outside the unitary business in which the buyer and seller are engaged, or (iii) converted by the buyer to a use outside the unitary business in which the buyer and seller are engaged; or\n\n(B) The buyer and seller are no longer members of the same combined group, regardless of whether the members remain unitary.\n\n(7) A charitable expense incurred by a member of a combined group shall, to the extent allowable as a deduction pursuant to Section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code, be subtracted first from the combined group's net income, subject to the income limitations of said section applied to the entire business income of the group. Any charitable deduction disallowed under the foregoing rule, but allowed as a carryover deduction in a subsequent year, shall be treated as originally incurred in the subsequent year by the same member and the rules of this section shall apply in the subsequent year in determining the allowable deduction for that year.\n\n(8) Gain or loss from the sale or exchange of capital assets, property described by Section 1231(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and property subject to an involuntary conversion shall be removed from the net income of each member of a combined group and shall be included in the combined group's net income as follows:\n\n(A) For each class of gain or loss, whether short-term capital, long-term capital, Section 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code gain or loss, or gain or loss from involuntary conversions, all members' business gain and loss for the class shall be combined, without netting among such classes, and each class of net business gain or loss shall be apportioned to each member under subsection (b) of this section; and\n\n(B) Any resulting income or loss apportioned to this state, as long as the loss is not subject to the limitations of Section 1211 of the Internal Revenue Code, of a taxable member produced by the application of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision shall then be applied to all other income or loss of that member apportioned to this state. Any resulting loss of a member apportioned to this state that is subject to the limitations of said Section 1211 shall be carried forward by that member and shall be treated as short-term capital loss apportioned to this state and incurred by that member for the year for which the carryover applies.\n\n(9) Any expense of any member of the combined group that is directly or indirectly attributable to the income of any member of the combined group, which income this state is prohibited from taxing pursuant to the laws or Constitution of the United States, shall be disallowed as a deduction for purposes of determining the combined group's net income.\n\n(b) A taxable member of a combined group shall determine its apportionment percentage as follows:\n\n(1) Each taxable member shall determine its apportionment percentage based on the otherwise applicable apportionment formula provided in this chapter. In computing its denominators for all factors, the taxable member shall use the combined group's denominator for that factor. In computing the numerator of its receipts factor, each taxable member shall add to such numerator its share of receipts of nontaxable members assignable to this state, as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection.\n\n(2) The combined group shall determine its property and payroll factor denominators using the factors from all members, whether or not a member would otherwise apportion its income using such property and payroll factors.\n\n(3) Receipts assignable to this state of each nontaxable member shall be determined based upon the apportionment formula that would be applicable to such member if it were a taxable member and shall be aggregated. Each taxable member of the combined group shall include in the numerator of its receipts factor a portion of the aggregate receipts assignable to this state of nontaxable members based on a ratio, the numerator of which is such taxable member's receipts assignable to this state, without regard to this subsection, and the denominator of which is the aggregate receipts assignable to this state of all the taxable members of the combined group, without regard to this subsection.\n\n(4) In determining the numerator and denominator of the apportionment factors of taxable members, transactions between or among members of such combined group shall be eliminated.\n\n(5) If any member of a combined group required to file a combined unitary tax return pursuant to section 12-222 is taxable without this state, or is a financial service company, as defined in section 12-218b, each taxable member shall be entitled to apportion its net income in accordance with this section.\n\n(c) To calculate each taxable member's net income or loss apportioned to this state, each taxable member shall apply its apportionment percentage, as determined pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, to the combined group's net income.\n\n(d) After calculating its net income or loss apportioned to this state, pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, each taxable member of a combined group required to file a combined unitary tax return pursuant to section 12-222 may deduct a net operating loss from its net income apportioned to this state as follows:\n\n(1) For income years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, if the computation of a combined group's net income results in a net operating loss, a taxable member of such group may carry over its net loss apportioned to this state, as calculated under subsection (c) of this section, derived from the unitary business in a future income year to the extent that the carryover and deduction is otherwise consistent with subparagraph (A) of subdivision (4) of subsection (a) of section 12-217. Any taxable member that has more than one operating loss carryover shall apply the carryovers in the order that the operating loss was incurred, with the oldest carryover to be deducted first.\n\n(2) Where a taxable member of a combined group has an operating loss carryover derived from a loss incurred by a combined group in an income year beginning on or after January 1, 2016, then the taxable member may share the operating loss carryover with other taxable members of the combined group if such other taxable members were members of the combined group in the income year that the loss was incurred. Any amount of operating loss carryover that is deducted by another taxable member of the combined group shall reduce the amount of operating loss carryover that may be carried over by the taxable member that originally incurred the loss.\n\n(3) Where a taxable member of a combined group has an operating loss carryover derived from a loss incurred in an income year beginning prior to January 1, 2016, or derived from an income year during which the taxable member was not a member of such combined group, the carryover shall remain available to be deducted by that taxable member or other group members that, in the year the loss was incurred, were part of the same combined group as such taxable member under section 12-223a or same unitary group as such taxable member under subsection (d) of section 12-218d of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2015. Such carryover shall not be deductible by any other members of the combined group.\n\n(e) Each taxable member shall multiply its income or loss apportioned to this state, as calculated under subsection (c) of this section and as further modified by subsection (d) of this section, by the tax rate set forth in section 12-214.\n\n(f) The additional tax base of taxable and nontaxable members of a combined group required to file a combined unitary tax return pursuant to section 12-222 shall be calculated as follows:\n\n(1) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, members of the combined group shall calculate the combined group's additional tax base by aggregating their separate additional tax bases under subsection (a) of section 12-219 provided (A) intercorporate stockholdings in the combined group shall be eliminated, (B) no deduction shall be allowed under subparagraph (B)(ii) of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 12-219, for such intercorporate stockholdings, and (C) assets and liabilities attributable to transactions with another member of the combined group, including, but not limited to, a financial service company, as defined in section 12-218b, shall be eliminated. In calculating the combined group's additional tax base, the separate additional tax bases of nontaxable members shall be included, as if those nontaxable members were taxable members. The amount calculated under this subdivision shall be apportioned to those members pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (g) of this section.\n\n(2) Members of the combined group that are financial service companies, as defined in section 12-218b, shall not be included in the calculation of the combined group's additional tax base set forth in subdivision (1) of this subsection. Financial service companies that are taxable members shall calculate their additional tax liability under subsection (d) of section 12-219.\n\n(g) A taxable member of a combined group required to file a combined unitary tax return pursuant to section 12-222 shall determine its apportionment percentage under section 12-219a as follows:\n\n(1) A taxable member whose separate additional tax base is included in the calculation of the combined group's additional tax base under subdivision (1) of subsection (f) of this section shall apportion the combined group's additional tax base using the otherwise applicable apportionment formula provided in section 12-219a. However, the denominator of such apportionment fraction shall be the sum of subdivisions (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of said section 12-219a for all members whose separate additional tax bases are included in the calculation of the combined group's additional tax base under subdivision (1) of subsection (f) of this section. The numerator of such apportionment fraction shall be the sum of subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of said section 12-219a and subparagraph (A) of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of said section 12-219a for such taxable member.\n\n(2) Taxable members of the combined group that are financial service companies, as defined in section 12-218b, shall each have an additional tax liability as described in subdivision (2) of subsection (h) of this section.\n\n(h) (1) A taxable member whose separate additional tax base is included in the calculation of the combined group's additional tax base under subdivision (1) of subsection (f) of this section shall multiply the combined group's additional tax base, as calculated under subdivision (1) of subsection (f) of this section, by such member's apportionment fraction determined in subdivision (1) of subsection (g) of this section, by the tax rate set forth in subsection (a) of section 12-219. In no event shall the aggregate tax so calculated for all members of the combined group exceed one million dollars, nor shall a tax credit allowed against the tax imposed by this chapter reduce a taxable member's tax calculated under this subsection to an amount less than two hundred fifty dollars.\n\n(2) Taxable members of the combined group that are financial service companies, as defined in section 12-218b, shall each have an additional tax liability of two hundred fifty dollars. In no event shall a tax credit allowed against the tax imposed by this chapter reduce a financial service company's tax calculated under this subsection to an amount less than two hundred fifty dollars.\n\n(3) To the extent that the aggregate amount of tax calculated on each taxable member's additional tax base exceeds one million dollars, each taxable member will prorate its tax, in proportion to the group's tax calculated without regard to the one-million-dollar cap, such that the group's aggregate additional tax equals one million dollars.\n\n(i) If the aggregate amount of tax calculated on each taxable member's apportioned net income under subsection (e) of this section equals or exceeds the aggregate amount of tax calculated on each taxable member's apportioned additional tax base under subsection (h) of this section, each taxable member shall be subject to tax on its net income. If the aggregate amount of tax calculated on each taxable member's apportioned additional tax base under subsection (h) of this section exceeds the aggregate amount of tax calculated on each taxable member's apportioned net income under subsection (e) of this section, each taxable member shall be subject to tax on its additional tax base.\n\n(j) (1) Each taxable member of a combined group required to file a combined unitary tax return pursuant to section 12-222 shall separately apply the provisions of sections 12-217ee and 12-217zz in determining the amount of tax credit available to such member.\n\n(2) If a taxable member of a combined group earns a tax credit in an income year beginning on or after January 1, 2016, then the taxable member may share the credit with other taxable members of the combined group. Any amount of credit that is utilized by another taxable member of the combined group shall reduce the amount of credit carryover that may be carried over by the taxable member that originally earned the credit. If a taxable member of a combined group has a tax credit carryover derived from an income year beginning on or after January 1, 2016, then the taxable member may share the carryover credit with other taxable members of the combined group, if such other taxable members were members of the combined group in the income year in which the credit was earned.\n\n(3) If a taxable member of a combined group has a tax credit carryover derived from an income year beginning prior to January 1, 2016, or derived from an income year during which the taxable member was not a member of such combined group, the credit carryover shall remain available to be utilized by such taxable member or other group members which, in the year the credit was earned, were part of the same combined group as such taxable member under section 12-223a or the same unitary group as such taxable member under subsection (d) of section 12-218d of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2015.\n\n(4) To the extent a taxable member has more than one corporation business tax credit that it may utilize in an income year, whether such credits were earned by said member or are available to said member in accordance with subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection, the credits shall be claimed in the same order as provided in section 12-217aa.\n\n(k) (1) In no event shall the tax calculated for a combined group on a combined unitary basis, prior to surtax and application of credits, exceed the nexus combined base tax described in subdivision (2) of this subsection by more than two million five hundred thousand dollars.\n\n(2) (A) The nexus combined base tax equals the tax measured on the sum of the separate net income or loss of each taxable member or the minimum tax base of each taxable member as if such members were not required to file a combined unitary tax return, but only to the extent that such income, loss or minimum tax base of any taxable member is separately apportioned to Connecticut in accordance with the applicable provisions of section 12-218, 12-218b, 12-219a or 12-244. In computing such net income or loss, intercorporate dividends shall be eliminated, and in computing the combined additional tax base, intercorporate stockholdings shall be eliminated.\n\n(B) In computing such net income or loss, any intangible expenses and costs, as defined in section 12-218c, any interest expenses and costs, as defined in section 12-218c, and any income attributable to such intangible expenses and costs or to such interest expenses and costs shall be eliminated, provided the corporation that is required to make adjustments under section 12-218c for such intangible expenses and costs or for such interest expenses and costs, and the related member or members, as defined in section 12-218c, are both taxable members of the combined group. If any such income and any such expenses and costs are eliminated as provided in this subparagraph, the intangible property, as defined in section 12-218c, of the corporation eliminating such income shall not be taken into account in apportioning under the provisions of section 12-219a the tax calculated under subsection (a) of section 12-219 of such corporation.\n\n(C) In computing the apportionment fraction under this subdivision:\n\n(i) Intercompany rents shall not be included in the computation of the value of property rented if the lessor and lessee are both taxable members in the combined unitary tax return; and\n\n(ii) Intercompany business receipts, receipts by a taxable member included in a combined unitary tax return from any other taxable member included in such return, shall not be included.\n\n(P.A. 15-244, S. 139; June Sp.

Such increase in valuation allowance shall be computed based on the change in valuation allowance that was reported in the combined group's financial statements for the income year commencing on or after January 1, 2016, but prior to January 1, 2017.\n\n(c) The deduction computed under subsection (b) of this section shall not be reduced as a result of any events happening subsequent to such computation, including, but not limited to, any disposition or abandonment of assets. Such deduction shall not alter the tax basis of any asset. If the deduction under subsection (b) of this section is greater than the combined group net income, any excess deduction shall be carried forward and applied as a deduction to combined group net income in future income years until fully utilized.\n\n(d) Any combined group intending to claim a deduction under this section shall file a statement with the Commissioner of Revenue Services on or before July 1, 2025, specifying the total amount of the deduction the combined group claims. The statement shall be made on such form and in such manner as prescribed by the commissioner and shall contain such information or computations as the commissioner may specify. No deduction shall be allowed under this section for any income year except to the extent claimed on or before July 1, 2025, in the manner prescribed. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority of the commissioner to review or redetermine the proper amount of any deduction claimed, whether on the statement required under this subsection or on a tax return for any income year.\n\n(P.A. 24-151, S. 137.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 24-151 effective January 1, 2025.",

For the purposes of this section, the intangible assets of a company having its principal place of business within the state shall be deemed to have a tax situs within the state unless it can be clearly established that some or all of such assets are held in connection with business conducted during the income year without the state, and a similar rule shall apply to intangible assets of a company having its principal place of business without the state. Such assets shall be reported by the taxpayer at the valuations at which they appear upon its books, provided the Commissioner of Revenue Services shall exercise the powers with respect to such valuations granted him under the terms of said section 12-219. For the purpose of apportionment of the base as provided in said section 12-219, a taxpayer is taxable in another state if in such state such taxpayer conducts business and is subject to a net income tax, a franchise tax measured by net income, a franchise tax for the privilege of doing business or a corporate stock tax, or if such state has jurisdiction to subject such taxpayer to such a tax, regardless of whether such state does, in fact, impose such a tax.\n\n(b) (1) Any company that is (A) a limited partner in a partnership, other than an investment partnership, that does business, owns or leases property or maintains an office within this state and (B) not otherwise carrying on or doing business in this state shall apportion the average value of its partnership interest within and without this state under the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, except that the numerator and the denominator of its apportionment fraction shall be its proportionate part of the partnership's apportionment factors. For purposes of this section, the partnership shall compute its apportionment fraction and the numerator and the denominator of its apportionment factors as if it were a company taxable both within and without this state. However, if the commissioner determines that the company and the partnership are, in substance, parts of a unitary business engaged in a single business enterprise, or, if the company is a member of a combined group that files a combined unitary tax return, the company shall be taxed in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (3) of this subsection and not in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision.\n\n(2) Any company that is (A) a limited partner (i) in an investment partnership or (ii) in a limited partnership, other than an investment partnership, that does business, owns or leases property or maintains an office within this state and (B) otherwise carrying on or doing business in this state shall apportion its additional tax base, including the average value of its partnership interest, within and without the state under the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, except that the numerator and the denominator of its apportionment factors shall include its proportionate part of the numerator and the denominator of the partnership's apportionment factors.

In computing said net income or loss, intercorporate dividends shall be eliminated, and in computing the combined additional tax base, intercorporate stockholdings shall be eliminated.\n\n(B) In computing said net income or loss, any intangible expenses and costs, as defined in section 12-218c, any interest expenses and costs, as defined in section 12-218c, and any income attributable to such intangible expenses and costs or to such interest expenses and costs shall be eliminated, provided the corporation that is required to make adjustments under section 12-218c for such intangible expenses and costs or for such interest expenses and costs, and the related member or members, as defined in section 12-218c, are included in such combined return. If any such income and any such expenses and costs are eliminated as provided in this subparagraph, the intangible property, as defined in section 12-218c, of the corporation eliminating such income shall not be taken into account in apportioning under the provisions of section 12-219a the tax calculated under subsection (a) of section 12-219 of such corporation.\n\n(2) If the method of determining the combined measure of such tax in accordance with this subsection for two or more affiliated companies validly electing to file a combined return under the provisions of subsection (a) of this section is deemed by such companies to unfairly attribute an undue proportion of their total income or minimum tax base to this state, said companies may submit a petition in writing to the Commissioner of Revenue Services for approval of an alternate method of determining the combined measure of their tax not later than sixty days prior to the due date of the combined return to which the petition applies, determined with regard to any extension of time for filing such return, and said commissioner shall grant or deny such approval before said due date. In deciding whether or not the companies included in such combined return should be granted approval to employ the alternate method proposed in such petition, the Commissioner of Revenue Services shall consider approval only in the event that the petitioners have clearly established to the satisfaction of said commissioner that all the companies included in such combined return are, in substance, parts of a unitary business engaged in a single business enterprise and further that there are substantial intercorporate business transactions among such included companies.\n\n(3) Upon the filing of a combined return under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, combined returns shall be filed for all succeeding income years or periods for those corporations reporting therein, provided, in the case of corporations filing under subsection (a) of this section, such corporations are included in a federal consolidated corporation income tax return filed for the succeeding income years and, in the case of a corporation filing under subsection (b) of this section, the aforesaid ownership or control continues in full force and effect and is not extended to other corporations, and further, provided no substantial change is made in the nature or locations of the operations of such corporations.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of this section, any taxpayer which has elected to file a combined return under this chapter as provided in said subsection (a), may subsequently revoke its election to file a combined corporation business tax return and elect to file a separate corporation business tax return under this chapter, although continuing to be included in a federal consolidated corporation income tax return with other companies subject to tax under this chapter, provided such election shall not be effective before the fifth income year immediately following the initial income year in which the corporation elected to file a combined return under this chapter. Notice of an election made pursuant to the provisions of this subsection and consent to such election must be submitted in written form to the Commissioner of Revenue Services by each corporation that had been included in such combined return not later than the due date, or if an extension of time to file has been requested and granted, extended due date of the separate returns due from the electing corporations for the initial income year for which the election to file separate returns is made. The election to file separate returns shall be irrevocable for and applicable for five successive income years.\n\n(e) The provisions of this section shall not apply to income years commencing on or after January 1, 2016.\n\n(P.A. 73-350, S. 19, 27; P.A. 74-304, S. 1, 3; P.A. 77-534, S. 1, 2; 77-607, S. 1, 2; 77-614, S. 139, 587, 610; P.A. 78-303, S. 85, 136; P.A. 81-411, S. 4, 42; P.A. 96-197, S. 10, 11; P.A. 98-110, S. 21, 27; 98-244, S. 8, 35; P.A. 00-174, S. 26, 83; June Sp.

Except as otherwise provided in this section, the commissioner shall (A) in the case of a return on which an operating loss is not reported, not later than three years after the due date for the filing of such return or not later than three years after the date on which such return was received by the commissioner, whichever period expires later, or (B) in the case of a return on which an operating loss is reported, not later than three years after the due date or the date of receipt by the commissioner, whichever period expires later, of the return on which a carry-over of such loss is fully utilized or deemed fully utilized because such loss is not available for deduction in any subsequent income year, examine it and, in case any error is disclosed by such examination, shall mail a notice of deficiency assessment to the taxpayer. Where, within the sixty-day period ending on the day on which the time prescribed in this section for mailing a notice of deficiency assessment for any income year would otherwise expire, the commissioner receives a written document signed by such taxpayer showing that such taxpayer owes an additional amount of tax for such income year, the commissioner then shall have up to sixty days after the day such written document is received in which to mail a notice of deficiency assessment.\n\n(2) A notice of deficiency assessment may be mailed to the taxpayer at any time in the case of (A) failure to file a return, including any amended return required pursuant to section 12-226, or (B) a deficiency due to fraud or intent to evade the provisions of this chapter or regulations adopted thereunder.\n\n(3) In the case of an omission from gross income of an amount properly includable therein that is in excess of twenty-five per cent of the amount of gross income stated in the return, a notice of deficiency assessment may be mailed to the taxpayer at any time not later than six years after the return was filed. For purposes of this subdivision, there shall not be taken into account any amount that is omitted from gross income stated in the return if such amount is disclosed in the return or in a statement attached to the return, in a manner adequate to apprise the commissioner of the nature and amount of such item.\n\n(4) In the case of a failure to disclose a listed transaction, as defined in Section 6707A of the Internal Revenue Code, on the taxpayer's federal income tax return, a notice of deficiency assessment may be mailed to the taxpayer at any time not later than six years after the return required under this chapter for the same income year was filed.\n\n(b) (1) When it appears that any part of the deficiency for which a deficiency assessment is made is due to negligence or intentional disregard of the provisions of this part or regulations adopted thereunder, there shall be imposed a penalty equal to ten per cent of the amount of such deficiency assessment, or fifty dollars, whichever is greater. When it appears that any part of the deficiency for which a deficiency assessment is made is due to fraud or intent to evade the provisions of this part or regulations adopted thereunder, there shall be imposed a penalty equal to twenty-five per cent of the amount of such deficiency assessment. For audits of returns commencing on or after January 1, 2006, when it appears that any part of the deficiency for which a deficiency assessment is made pursuant to this section is due to failure to disclose a listed transaction, as defined in Section 6707A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, on the taxpayer's federal tax return, there shall be imposed a penalty equal to seventy-five per cent of the amount of such deficiency assessment.\n\n(2) No taxpayer shall be subject to more than one penalty under this section in relation to the same tax period.\n\n(3) Any decision rendered by any federal court holding that a taxpayer has filed a fraudulent return with the Director of Internal Revenue shall subject the taxpayer to the penalty imposed by this section without the necessity of further proof thereof, except when it can be shown that the return to the state so differed from the return to the federal government as to afford a reasonable presumption that the attempt to defraud did not extend to the return to the state.\n\n(c) Not later than thirty days after the mailing of a notice of deficiency assessment, the taxpayer shall pay to the commissioner, in cash or by check, draft or money order drawn to the order of the Commissioner of Revenue Services, any additional amount of tax shown to be due by such notice, or such taxpayer shall be paid by the State Treasurer, upon order of the Comptroller, any amount shown to be due it by the corrected return.
