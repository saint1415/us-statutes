The amount of tax that would be due from the dissolved hospital after its dissolution or cessation of operations shall not be collected by the commissioner for the state fiscal year in which such hospital dissolves or ceases to operate. In the next succeeding state fiscal year after the hospital dissolves or ceases to operate and in each subsequent state fiscal year, the total audited net revenue for fiscal year 2016 shall be reduced by such hospital's audited net revenue for fiscal year 2016 and the effective rate of the tax due under this section shall be adjusted to ensure that the total amount of such tax to be collected under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this subdivision is redistributed among the surviving hospitals in proportion to the reduced total audited net revenue for fiscal year 2016 attributable to inpatient hospital services and outpatient hospital services, of all hospitals.\n\n(E) (i) For each state fiscal year commencing on or after July 1, 2026, if the Commissioner of Social Services determines for any fiscal year that the effective rate of tax for the tax imposed on net revenue for the provision of inpatient hospital services exceeds the rate permitted under the provisions of 42 CFR 433.68(f), as amended from time to time, the amount of tax collected that exceeds the permissible amount shall be refunded to hospitals, in proportion to the amount of net revenue for the provision of inpatient hospital services upon which the hospitals were taxed.

Not later than thirty days after receiving such notice, the Commissioner of Revenue Services shall notify the Comptroller of the amount of each such refund and the Comptroller shall draw an order on the Treasurer for payment of each such refund. No interest shall be added to any refund issued pursuant to this subparagraph.\n\n(2) Except as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection, each hospital subject to the tax imposed under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be required to pay the total amount due in four quarterly payments consistent with section 12-263s, with the first quarter commencing with the first day of each state fiscal year and the last quarter ending on the last day of each state fiscal year.

Such information shall be provided to the commissioner not later than January 1, 2018. The commissioner shall make additional requests for information as necessary to fully audit each hospital's net revenue. Upon completion of the commissioner's examination, the commissioner shall notify, prior to February 28, 2018, each hospital of its audited net inpatient revenue for fiscal year 2016, audited net outpatient revenue for fiscal year 2016 and audited net revenue for fiscal year 2016.\n\n(B) Any hospital that fails to provide the requested information by the dates specified in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision or fails to comply with a request for additional information made under this subdivision shall be subject to a penalty of one thousand dollars per day for each day the hospital fails to provide the requested information or additional information.\n\n(C) The commissioner may engage an independent auditor to assist in the performance of the commissioner's duties and responsibilities under this subdivision.\n\n(5) Net revenue derived from providing a health care item or service to a patient shall be taxed only one time under this section.\n\n(6) (A) For purposes of this section:\n\n(i) “Audited net inpatient revenue for fiscal year 2016” means the amount of revenue that the commissioner determines, in accordance with federal law, that a hospital received for the provision of inpatient hospital services during the 2016 federal fiscal year;\n\n(ii) “Audited net outpatient revenue for fiscal year 2016” means the amount of revenue that the commissioner determines, in accordance with federal law, that a hospital received for the provision of outpatient hospital services during the 2016 federal fiscal year; and\n\n(iii) “Audited net revenue for fiscal year 2016” means net revenue, as reported in each hospital's audited financial statements, less the amount of revenue that the commissioner determines, in accordance with federal law, that a hospital received from other than the provision of inpatient hospital services and outpatient hospital services.

Upon said commissioner's receipt of a determination by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that a hospital is not exempt, the total audited net revenue from the provision of outpatient hospital services for fiscal year 2016 shall be increased by such hospital's audited net revenue from the provision of outpatient hospital services for fiscal year 2016 and the effective rate of the tax due under this section shall be adjusted to ensure that the total amount of such tax to be collected under subsection (a) of this section is redistributed, commencing with the calendar quarter next succeeding the date of the determination by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\n(3) Upon receipt of a determination by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under this subsection that a hospital is not exempt, said commissioner shall notify all hospitals subject to the tax under this section of such determination, the corresponding increase to the total audited net revenue for fiscal year 2016 and the change in any effective rate of the tax to be collected under subsection (a) of this section through the state fiscal year 2026. Such notice shall be provided prior to the end of the calendar quarter next succeeding the date of the determination by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. If a state fiscal year has commenced when such determination is made, the adjusted audited net revenue for fiscal year 2016 and the change in any effective rate of the tax to be collected under subsection (a) of this section shall be prorated to take into account the amount of the tax already paid during the applicable state fiscal year.\n\n(d) The commissioner shall issue guidance regarding the administration of the tax on inpatient hospital services and outpatient hospital services. Such guidance shall be issued upon completion of a study of the applicable federal law governing the administration of tax on inpatient hospital services and outpatient hospital services. The commissioner shall conduct such study in collaboration with the Commissioner of Social Services, the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, the Connecticut Hospital Association and the hospitals subject to the tax imposed on inpatient hospital services and outpatient hospital services.\n\n(e) (1) The commissioner shall determine, in consultation with the Commissioner of Social Services, the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, the Connecticut Hospital Association and the hospitals subject to the tax imposed on inpatient hospital services and outpatient hospital services, if there is any underreporting of revenue on hospitals' audited financial statements.

The commissioner shall issue guidance, if necessary, to address any such underreporting.\n\n(2) If the commissioner determines, in accordance with this subsection, that a hospital underreported net revenue on its audited financial statements, the amount of underreported net revenue shall be added to the amount of net revenue reported on such hospital's audited financial statements so as to comply with federal law and the revised net revenue amount shall be used for purposes of calculating the amount of tax owed by such hospital under this section. For purposes of this subsection, “underreported net revenue” means any revenue of a hospital subject to the tax imposed under this section that is required to be included in net revenue from the provision of inpatient hospital services and net revenue from the provision of outpatient hospital services to comply with 42 CFR 433.56, as amended from time to time, 42 CFR 433.68, as amended from time to time, and Section 1903(w) of the Social Security Act, as amended from time to time, but that was not reported on such hospital's audited financial statements. Underreported net revenue shall only include revenue of the hospital subject to such tax.\n\n(f) Nothing in this section shall affect the commissioner's obligations under section 12-15 regarding disclosure and inspection of returns and return information.\n\n(g) The provisions of section 17b-8 shall not apply to any exemption or exemptions sought by the Commissioner of Social Services from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under this section.\n\n(June Sp.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the general statutes, any health care provider that has been assigned tax credits under section 32-9t for application against the taxes imposed under chapter 211a may further assign such tax credits to another taxpayer or taxpayers one time, provided such other taxpayer or taxpayers may claim such credit only with respect to a taxable year for which the assigning health care provider would have been eligible to claim such credit and such other taxpayer or taxpayers may not further assign such credit. The assigning health care provider shall file with the commissioner information requested by the commissioner regarding such assignments, including but not limited to, the current holders of credits as of the end of the preceding calendar year.\n\n(b) (1) Each taxpayer doing business in this state shall, on or before the last day of January, April, July and October of each year, render to the commissioner a quarterly return, on forms prescribed or furnished by the commissioner and signed by one of the taxpayer's principal officers, stating specifically the name and location of such taxpayer, the amount of its net patient revenue or resident days during the calendar quarter ending on the last day of the preceding month and such other information as the commissioner deems necessary for the proper administration of this section and the state's Medicaid program. Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the taxes and fees imposed under section 12-263q or 12-263r shall be due and payable on the due date of such return. Each taxpayer shall be required to file such return electronically with the department and to make such payment by electronic funds transfer in the manner provided by chapter 228g, irrespective of whether the taxpayer would have otherwise been required to file such return electronically or to make such payment by electronic funds transfer under the provisions of said chapter.\n\n(2) (A) A taxpayer may file, on or before the due date of a payment of tax or fee imposed under section 12-263q or 12-263r, a request for a reasonable extension of time for such payment for reasons of undue hardship. Undue hardship shall be demonstrated by a showing that such taxpayer is at substantial risk of defaulting on a bond covenant or similar obligation if such taxpayer were to make payment on the due date of the amount for which the extension is requested. Such request shall be filed on forms prescribed by the commissioner and shall include complete information of such taxpayer's inability, due to undue hardship, to make payment of the tax or fee on or before the due date of such payment. The commissioner shall not grant any extension for a general statement of hardship by the taxpayer or for the convenience of the taxpayer.\n\n(B) The commissioner may grant an extension if the commissioner determines an undue hardship exists.

The tax or fee shall bear interest at the rate of one per cent per month or fraction thereof, from the due date of such tax or fee until the date of payment.\n\n(2) If any taxpayer has not made its return within one month of the due date of such return, the commissioner may make such return at any time thereafter, according to the best information obtainable and according to the form prescribed. There shall be added to the tax or fee imposed upon the basis of such return an amount equal to ten per cent of such tax or fee, or fifty dollars, whichever is greater. The tax or fee shall bear interest at the rate of one per cent per month or fraction thereof, from the due date of such tax or fee until the date of payment.\n\n(3) Subject to the provisions of section 12-3a, the commissioner may waive all or part of the penalties provided under this subsection when it is proven to the commissioner's satisfaction that the failure to pay any tax or fee on time was due to reasonable cause and was not intentional or due to neglect.\n\n(4) The commissioner shall notify the Commissioner of Social Services of any amount delinquent under this section and, upon receipt of such notice, the Commissioner of Social Services shall deduct and withhold such amount from amounts otherwise payable by the Department of Social Services to the delinquent taxpayer.\n\n(d) (1) Any person required under sections 12-263q to 12-263v, inclusive, to pay any tax or fee, make a return, keep any records or supply any information, who wilfully fails, at the time required by law, to pay such tax or fee, make such return, keep such records or supply such information, shall, in addition to any other penalty provided by law, be fined not more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

If the commissioner determines from such examination that there is a deficiency with respect to the payment of any such tax or fee due under section 12-263q or 12-263r, the commissioner shall assess the deficiency in tax or fee, give notice of such deficiency assessment to the taxpayer and make demand for payment. Such amount shall bear interest at the rate of one per cent per month or fraction thereof from the date when the original tax or fee was due and payable. (A) When it appears that any part of the deficiency for which a deficiency assessment is made is due to negligence or intentional disregard of the provisions of this section or regulations adopted thereunder, there shall be imposed a penalty equal to ten per cent of the amount of such deficiency assessment, or fifty dollars, whichever is greater. (B) When it appears that any part of the deficiency for which a deficiency assessment is made is due to fraud or intent to evade the provisions of this section or regulations adopted thereunder, there shall be imposed a penalty equal to twenty-five per cent of the amount of such deficiency assessment.

Not later than thirty days after the mailing of such notice, the taxpayer shall pay to the commissioner, in cash or by check, draft or money order drawn to the order of the Commissioner of Revenue Services, any additional amount of tax, penalty and interest shown to be due.\n\n(2) Except in the case of a wilfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax or fee, no assessment of additional tax or fee shall be made after the expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a return or from the original due date of a return, whichever is later. Where, before the expiration of the period prescribed under this subsection for the assessment of an additional tax or fee, a taxpayer has consented, in writing, that such period may be extended, the amount of such additional tax due may be determined at any time within such extended period. The period so extended may be further extended by subsequent consents, in writing, before the expiration of the extended period.\n\n(b) (1) The commissioner may enter into an agreement with the Commissioner of Social Services delegating to the Commissioner of Social Services the authority to examine the records and returns of any taxpayer subject to any tax or fee imposed under section 12-263q or 12-263r and to determine whether such tax has been underpaid or overpaid. If such authority is so delegated, examinations of such records and returns by the Commissioner of Social Services and determinations by the Commissioner of Social Services that such tax or fee has been underpaid or overpaid shall have the same effect as similar examinations or determinations made by the commissioner.\n\n(2) The commissioner may enter into an agreement with the Commissioner of Social Services in order to facilitate the exchange of returns or return information necessary for the Commissioner of Social Services to perform his or her responsibilities under this section and to ensure compliance with the state's Medicaid program.\n\n(3) The Commissioner of Social Services may engage an independent auditor to assist in the performance of said commissioner's duties and responsibilities under this subsection. Any reports generated by such independent auditor shall be provided simultaneously to the department and the Department of Social Services.\n\n(c) (1) The commissioner may require all persons subject to a tax or fee imposed under section 12-263q or 12-263r to keep such records as the commissioner may prescribe and may require the production of books, papers, documents and other data, to provide or secure information pertinent to the determination of the taxes or fees imposed under section 12-263q or 12-263r and the enforcement and collection thereof.\n\n(2) The commissioner or any person authorized by the commissioner may examine the books, papers, records and equipment of any person liable under the provisions of this section and may investigate the character of the business of such person to verify the accuracy of any return made or, if no return is made by the person, to ascertain and determine the amount required to be paid.\n\n(d) The commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to implement the provisions of sections 12-263q to 12-263x, inclusive.\n\n(June Sp.
