      "text": "(a) With respect to estates of decedents who die prior to January 1, 2005, and except as otherwise provided in section 59 of public act 03-1 of the June 30 special session*, a tax is imposed upon the transfer of the estate of each person who at the time of death was a resident of this state. The amount of the tax shall be the amount of the federal credit allowable for estate, inheritance, legacy and succession taxes paid to any state or the District of Columbia under the provisions of the federal internal revenue code in force at the date of such decedent's death in respect to any property owned by such decedent or subject to such taxes as part of or in connection with the estate of such decedent. If real or tangible personal property of such decedent is located outside this state and is subject to estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes by any state or states, other than the state of Connecticut, or by the District of Columbia for which such federal credit is allowable, the amount of tax due under this section shall be reduced by the lesser of: (1) The amount of any such taxes paid to such other state or states or said district and allowed as a credit against the federal estate tax; or (2) an amount computed by multiplying such federal credit by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the value of that part of the decedent's gross estate over which such other state or states or said district have jurisdiction for estate tax purposes to the same extent to which this state would assert jurisdiction for estate tax purposes under this chapter with respect to the residents of such other state or states or said district, and (B) the denominator of which is the value of the decedent's gross estate. Property of a resident estate over which this state has jurisdiction for estate tax purposes includes real property situated in this state, tangible personal property having an actual situs in this state, and intangible personal property owned by the decedent, regardless of where it is located. The amount of any estate tax imposed under this subsection shall also be reduced, but not below zero, by the amount of any tax that is imposed under chapter 216 and that is actually paid to this state.\n\n(b) With respect to the estates of decedents who die prior to January 1, 2005, and except as otherwise provided in section 59 of public act 03-1 of the June 30 special session*, a tax is imposed upon the transfer of the estate of each person who at the time of death was a nonresident of this state, the amount of which shall be computed by multiplying (1) the federal credit allowable for estate, inheritance, legacy, and succession taxes paid to any state or states or the District of Columbia under the provisions of the federal internal revenue code in force at the date of such decedent's death in respect to any property owned by such decedent or subject to such taxes as a part of or in connection with the estate of such decedent by (2) a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the value of that part of the decedent's gross estate over which this state has jurisdiction for estate tax purposes and (B) the denominator of which is the value of the decedent's gross estate. Property of a nonresident estate over which this state has jurisdiction for estate tax purposes includes real property situated in this state and tangible personal property having an actual situs in this state. The amount of any estate tax imposed under this subsection shall also be reduced, but not below zero, by the amount of any tax that is imposed under chapter 216 and that is actually paid to this state.\n\n(c) For purposes of this section and section 12-392:\n\n(1) (A) “Connecticut taxable estate” means, with respect to the estates of decedents dying on or after January 1, 2005, but prior to January 1, 2010, (i) the gross estate less allowable deductions, as determined under Chapter 11 of the Internal Revenue Code, plus (ii) the aggregate amount of all Connecticut taxable gifts, as defined in section 12-643, made by the decedent for all calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, but prior to January 1, 2010.

The deduction for state death taxes paid under Section 2058 of the Internal Revenue Code shall be disregarded.\n\n(2) “Internal Revenue Code” means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time, except in the event of repeal of the federal estate tax, then all references to the Internal Revenue Code in this section shall mean the Internal Revenue Code as in force on the day prior to the effective date of such repeal.\n\n(3) “Gross estate” means the gross estate, for federal estate tax purposes.\n\n(4) “Federal basic exclusion amount” means the dollar amount published annually by the Internal Revenue Service at which a decedent would be required to file a federal estate tax return based on the value of the decedent's gross estate and federally taxable gifts.\n\n(d) (1) (A) With respect to the estates of decedents who die on or after January 1, 2005, but prior to January 1, 2010, a tax is imposed upon the transfer of the estate of each person who at the time of death was a resident of this state.

Nothing in this subparagraph shall be deemed to impose a lien in favor of the state of Connecticut under subsection (d) of section 12-398 or section 45a-107b against any real property included in the nonresident decedent's estate under this subparagraph to any greater extent than if the nonresident decedent was a resident decedent owning an interest in a pass-through entity owning real property located in this state. For purposes of this subparagraph, “pass-through entity” means a partnership or an S corporation, as those terms are defined in section 12-699, or a single member limited liability company that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes.\n\n(C) The state is permitted to calculate the estate tax and levy said tax to the fullest extent permitted by the Constitution of the United States.\n\n(f) (1) For purposes of the tax imposed under this section, the value of the Connecticut taxable estate shall be determined taking into account all of the deductions available under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, specifically including, but not limited to, the deduction available under Section 2056(b)(7) of said code for a qualifying income interest for life in a surviving spouse.\n\n(2) An election under said Section 2056(b)(7) may be made for state estate tax purposes regardless of whether any such election is made for federal estate tax purposes. The value of the gross estate shall include the value of any property in which the decedent had a qualifying income interest for life for which an election was made under this subsection.\n\n(g) (1)

purposes of this chapter, each decedent shall be presumed to have died a resident of this state. The burden of proof in an estate tax proceeding shall be upon any decedent's estate claiming exemption by reason of the decedent's alleged nonresidency.\n\n(2) Any person required to make and file a tax return under this chapter, believing that the decedent died a nonresident of this state, may file a request for determination of domicile in writing with the Commissioner of Revenue Services, stating the specific grounds upon which the request is founded provided (A) such person has filed such return, (B) at least two hundred seventy days, but no more than three years, has elapsed since the due date of such return or, if an application for extension of time to file such return has been granted, the extended due date of such return, (C) such person has not been notified, in writing, by said commissioner that a written agreement of compromise with the taxing authorities of another jurisdiction, under section 12-395a, is being negotiated, and (D) the commissioner has not previously determined whether the decedent died a resident of this state. Not later than one hundred eighty days following receipt of such request for determination, the commissioner shall determine whether such decedent died a resident or a nonresident of this state. If the commissioner commences negotiations over a written agreement of compromise with the taxing authorities of another jurisdiction after a request for determination of domicile is filed, the one-hundred-eighty-day period shall be tolled for the duration of such negotiations. When, before the expiration of such one-hundred-eighty-day period, both the commissioner and the person required to make and file a tax return under this chapter have consented in writing to the making of such determination after such time, the determination may be made at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. The commissioner shall mail notice of his proposed determination to the person required to make and file a tax return under this chapter. Such notice shall set forth briefly the commissioner's findings of fact and the basis of such proposed determination. Sixty days after the date on which it is mailed, a notice of proposed determination shall constitute a final determination unless the person required to make and file a tax return under this chapter has filed, as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection, a written protest with the Commissioner of Revenue Services.\n\n(3) On or before the sixtieth day after mailing of the proposed determination, the person required to make and file a tax return under this chapter may file with the commissioner a written protest against the proposed determination in which such person shall set forth the grounds on which the protest is based. If such a protest is filed, the commissioner shall reconsider the proposed determination and, if the person required to make and file a tax return under this chapter has so requested, may grant or deny such person or the authorized representatives of such person an oral hearing.\n\n(4) Notice of the commissioner's determination shall be mailed to the person required to make and file a tax return under this chapter and such notice shall set forth briefly the commissioner's findings of fact and the basis of decision in each case decided adversely to such person.\n\n(5) The action of the commissioner on a written protest shall be final upon the expiration of one month from the date on which he mails notice of his action to the person required to make and file a tax return under this chapter unless within such period such person seeks review of the commissioner's determination pursuant to subsection (b) of section 12-395.\n\n(6) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to relieve any person filing a request for determination of domicile of the obligation to pay the correct amount of tax on or before the due date of the tax.\n\n(i) The tax calculated pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be reduced in an amount equal to half of the amount invested by a decedent in a private investment fund or fund of funds pursuant to subdivision (40) of section 32-39, provided (1) any such reduction shall not exceed five million dollars for any such decedent, (2) any such amount invested by the decedent shall have been invested in such fund or fund of funds for ten years or more, and (3) the aggregate amount of all taxes reduced under this subsection shall not exceed thirty million dollars.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 2065; 1961, P.A. 163, S. 1.; P.A. 97-165, S. 1, 16; P.A. 05-251, S. 69; June Sp.

Cited. 149 C. 334. Subsec. (c)(3): Plain meaning of Subsec. is that assets in a QTIP trust are included in decedent's state gross estate because they are included in the federal gross estate; Subsec. (c)(3) does not incorporate all provisions of the federal tax code. 325 C. 705. Subsec. (d)(3): Assets in QTIP trust were properly taxable even though they were not “owned by the decedent” as required by law in effect at the time of decedent's death, because subsequent amendment to provision allowing for taxation of assets “included in the gross estate of the decedent” was clarifying in nature and, therefore, applies retroactively to decedent's estate. Id. Subsec. (d)(1)(B): Inclusion of assets within QTIP trust in decedent's estate did not violate due process even though the transfer of assets at the time of decedent's death was a “deemed” or “fictional” transfer of assets in which the decedent enjoyed only a life interest.

      "text": "(a)(1) For the estates of decedents dying prior to July 1, 2009, the tax imposed by this chapter shall become due at the date of the taxable transfer and shall become payable, and shall be paid, without assessment, notice or demand, to the Commissioner of Revenue Services at the expiration of nine months from the date of death. For the estates of decedents dying on or after July 1, 2009, the tax imposed by this chapter shall become due at the date of the taxable transfer and shall become payable and shall be paid, without assessment, notice or demand, to the commissioner at the expiration of six months from the date of death. Executors, administrators, trustees, grantees, donees, beneficiaries and surviving joint owners shall be liable for the tax and for any interest or penalty thereon until it is paid, notwithstanding any provision of chapter 802b, except that no executor, administrator, trustee, grantee, donee, beneficiary or surviving joint owner shall be liable for a greater sum than the value of the property actually received by him or her. If the amount of tax reported to be due on the return is not paid, for the estates of decedents dying prior to July 1, 2009, within such nine months, or for the estates of decedents dying on or after July 1, 2009, within such six months, there shall be imposed a penalty equal to ten per cent of such amount due and unpaid, or fifty dollars, whichever is greater. Such amount shall bear interest at the rate of one per cent per month or fraction thereof from the due date of such tax until the date of payment. Subject to the provisions of section 12-3a, the commissioner may waive all or part of the penalties provided under this chapter when it is proven to the commissioner's satisfaction that the failure to pay any tax was due to reasonable cause and was not intentional or due to neglect.\n\n(2) The Commissioner of Revenue Services may, for reasonable cause shown, extend the time for payment. The commissioner may require the filing of a tentative return and the payment of the tax reported to be due thereon in connection with such extension. Any additional tax which may be found to be due on the filing of a return as allowed by such extension shall bear interest at the rate of one per cent per month or fraction thereof from the original due date of such tax to the date of actual payment.\n\n(3) (A) Whenever there is a claimed overpayment of the tax imposed by this chapter, the Commissioner of Revenue Services shall return to the fiduciary or transferee the overpayment which shall bear interest at the rate of two-thirds of one per cent per month or fraction thereof, such interest commencing, for the estates of decedents dying prior to July 1, 2009, from the expiration of nine months after the death of the transferor or date of payment, whichever is later, or, for the estates of decedents dying on or after July 1, 2009, from the expiration of six months after the death of the transferor or date of payment, whichever is later, as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this subdivision.\n\n(B) In case of such overpayment pursuant to a tax return, no interest shall be allowed or paid under this subdivision on such overpayment for any month or fraction thereof prior to (i) the ninety-first day after the last day prescribed for filing the tax return associated with such overpayment, determined without regard to any extension of time for filing, or (ii) the ninety-first day after the date such return was filed, whichever is later.\n\n(C) In case of such overpayment pursuant to an amended tax return, no interest shall be allowed or paid under this subdivision on such overpayment for any month or fraction thereof prior to the ninety-first day after the date such amended tax return was filed.\n\n(b) (1) The tax imposed by this chapter shall be reported on a tax return which shall be filed on or before the date fixed for paying the tax, determined without regard to any extension of time for paying the tax. The commissioner shall design a form of return and forms for such additional statements or schedules as the commissioner may require to be filed. Such forms shall provide for the setting forth of such facts as the commissioner deems necessary for the proper enforcement of this chapter. The commissioner shall furnish appropriate forms to each taxpayer upon application or otherwise as the commissioner deems necessary. Failure to receive a form shall not relieve any person from the obligation to file a return under the provisions of this chapter. In any case in which the commissioner believes that it would be advantageous to him or her in the administration of the tax imposed by this chapter, the commissioner may require that a true copy of the federal estate tax return made to the Internal Revenue Service be provided.\n\n(2) Any tax return or other document, including any amended tax return under section 12-398, that is required to be filed under this chapter shall be filed, and shall be treated as filed, only if filed with (A) the Commissioner of Revenue Services, if required under subdivision (3) of this subsection, and (B) (i) the court of probate for the district within which the decedent resided at the date of his or her death, or, (ii) if the decedent died a nonresident of this state, in the court of probate for the district within which real estate or tangible personal property of the decedent is situated.

Any person shall be entitled to a certificate that the tax upon the transfer of any real property has been paid, and such certificate may be recorded in the office of the town clerk of the town within which such real property is situated, and it shall be conclusive proof that the tax on the transfer of such real property has been paid and such lien discharged.\n\n(e) (1) Any person shall be entitled to a certificate of release of lien with respect to the interest of the decedent in such real property, if either the court of probate for the district within which the decedent resided at the date of his death or, if the decedent died a nonresident of this state, for the district within which real estate or tangible personal property of the decedent is situated, or the Commissioner of Revenue Services finds, upon evidence satisfactory to said court or said commissioner, as the case may be, that payment of the tax imposed under this chapter with respect to the interest of the decedent in such real property is adequately assured, or that no tax imposed under this chapter is due. The certificate of release of lien shall be issued by the court of probate, unless a tax return is required to be filed with the commissioner under subdivision (3) of subsection (b) of section 12-392, in which case the certificate of release of lien shall be issued by the commissioner. Any certificate of release of lien shall be valid if issued by a probate court prior to May 4, 2011, and recorded in the office of the town clerk of the town in which such real property is situated prior to May 4, 2011, for the estate of a decedent who died on or after January 1, 2011, and whose Connecticut taxable estate is more than two million dollars but equal to or less than three million five hundred thousand dollars.\n\n(2) A certificate of release of lien may be recorded in the office of the town clerk of the town within which such real property is situated, and it shall be conclusive proof that such real property has been released from the operation of such lien.\n\n(3) The commissioner may adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 that establish procedures to be followed by a court of probate or by said commissioner, as the case may be, for issuing certificates of release of lien, and that establish the requirements and conditions that must be satisfied in order for a court of probate or for the commissioner, as the case may be, to find that the payment of such tax is adequately assured or that no tax imposed under this chapter is due.\n\n(f) The amount of any tax, penalty or interest due and unpaid under the provisions of this chapter may be collected under the provisions of section 12-35. The warrant provided under section 12-35 shall be signed by the commissioner or his authorized agent.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 2072; P.A. 77-614, S. 139, 610; P.A. 97-165, S. 4, 16; 97-203, S. 18, 20; P.A. 00-174, S. 62, 83; June Sp.
