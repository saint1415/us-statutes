For taxable years commencing prior to January 1, 2013, each affected business entity shall annually, on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of its taxable year, pay to the Commissioner of Revenue Services a tax in the amount of two hundred fifty dollars. For taxable years commencing on or after January 1, 2013, but prior to January 1, 2020, each affected business entity shall, on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of every other taxable year, pay to the Commissioner of Revenue Services a tax in the amount of two hundred fifty dollars.\n\n(c) Upon failure of any affected business entity to pay the tax due under this section within thirty days of the due date, the provisions of section 12-35 shall apply with respect to the enforcement of this section and the collection of such tax. The warrant therein provided for shall be signed by the commissioner or an authorized agent of the commissioner. The amount of any such tax, penalty and interest shall be a lien, from the thirty-first day of December next preceding the due date of such tax until discharged by payment, against all real estate of the taxpayer within the state, and a certificate of such lien signed by the commissioner may be filed for record in the office of the clerk of any town in which such real estate is situated, provided no such lien shall be effective as against any bona fide purchaser or qualified encumbrancer of any interest in any such property. When any tax with respect to which a lien has been recorded under the provisions of this section has been satisfied, the commissioner, upon request of any interested party, shall issue a certificate discharging such lien, which certificate shall be recorded in the same office in which the lien was recorded.

Subject to the provisions of section 12-3a, the commissioner may waive all or part of the penalties provided under this section when it is proven to the commissioner's satisfaction that the failure to pay any tax was due to reasonable cause and was not intentional or due to neglect.\n\n(e) If any tax is not paid when due as provided in this section, there shall be added to the amount of the tax interest at the rate of one per cent per month or fraction thereof from the date the tax became due until it is paid.\n\n(f) If the commissioner is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the failure to file a return or to pay the tax was due to reasonable cause and was not intentional or due to neglect, the commissioner may abate or remit the whole or any part of any penalty under this section.\n\n(g) The provisions of sections 12-548 to 12-554, inclusive, and section 12-555a shall apply to the provisions of this section in the same manner and with the same force and effect as if the language of said sections 12-548 to 12-554, inclusive, and section 12-555a had been incorporated in full into this section and had expressly referred to the tax under this section, except to the extent that any such provision is inconsistent with a provision of this section.\n\n(May 9 Sp.
