The provisions of this subsection shall apply to part-year resident trusts, as defined in said section 12-701, and, wherever reference is made in this section to part-year resident individuals, such reference shall be construed to include part-year resident trusts, provided any reference to a part-year resident individual's Connecticut adjusted gross income shall be construed, in the case of a part-year resident trust, to mean the part-year resident trust's Connecticut taxable income.\n\n(d) (1) For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1994, a credit shall be allowed as provided herein in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the adjusted net Connecticut minimum tax imposed for all prior taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1993, over the amount allowable as a credit under this subsection for such prior taxable years.\n\n(2) The credit allowable for a taxable year under this subsection is limited to the amount, if any, by which (A)(i) the tax imposed under section 12-700, (ii) less the credit, if any, allowed under section 12-704 exceeds (B)(i) the Connecticut minimum tax, determined without regard to whether the individual or the trust or estate is subject to and required to pay for that taxable year the federal alternative minimum tax under Section 55 of the Internal Revenue Code, (ii) less the credit, if any, allowed under subsection (e) of this section.\n\n(e) A resident or part-year resident shall be allowed a credit against the tax otherwise due under this section in the amount of any similar tax imposed on such resident or part-year resident for the taxable year by another state of the United States or a political subdivision thereof or the District of Columbia on income which is derived from sources therein and which is also subject to tax under this section. In the case of a resident, the credit provided under this subsection shall not exceed the proportion of the tax otherwise due under this section that the amount of the taxpayer's adjusted federal tentative minimum tax derived from or connected with sources in the other taxing jurisdiction, as the phrase is used in section 12-704, bears to the taxpayer's adjusted federal tentative minimum tax. In the case of a part-year resident, the credit provided under this subsection shall not exceed the proportion of the tax otherwise due during the period of residency that the amount of the taxpayer's adjusted federal tentative minimum tax derived from or connected with sources in the other taxing jurisdiction, as the phrase is used in said section 12-704, during the period of residency bears to such taxpayer's adjusted federal tentative minimum tax during the period of residency, nor shall the allowance of the credit provided under this subsection reduce the tax otherwise due under this section to an amount less than what would have been due if the amount subject to similar taxation by such other jurisdiction were excluded in the calculation of the adjusted federal tentative minimum tax.\n\n(P.A. 93-74, S. 54, 67; 93-332, S. 15, 42; May Sp.

Any individual who has made a joint return under this chapter may elect to seek relief under the provisions of subsection (f) of this section, even if such individual is not eligible to seek relief under subsection (b) or (c) of this section.\n\n(b) (1) Under procedures prescribed by the commissioner, if (A) a joint return has been made for a taxable year and on such return there is an understatement of tax attributable to erroneous items of one individual filing the joint return; (B) the other individual filing the joint return establishes that in signing the return such other individual did not know, and had no reason to know, that there was such an understatement; (C) taking into account all the facts and circumstances, it is inequitable to hold such other individual liable for the deficiency in tax for such taxable year attributable to such understatement or portion of such understatement, as the case may be; and (D) such other individual elects the application of this subsection, in such form as the Commissioner of Revenue Services may prescribe, not later than the date which is two years after the date the commissioner has begun collection activities with respect to the individual making the election, such other individual shall be relieved of liability for tax, including interest, penalties and other amounts due for such taxable year to the extent such liability is attributable to such understatement.\n\n(2) If the electing individual satisfies the conditions of subdivision (1) of this subsection except subparagraph (B) of said subdivision (1), and establishes that in signing the return such individual did not know, and had no reason to know, the extent of such understatement, such individual shall be relieved of liability for tax, including interest, penalties and other amounts due for such taxable year to the extent such liability is attributable to the portion of such understatement of which such individual did not know and had no reason to know.\n\n(c) (1) If an individual who has made a joint return for any taxable year elects the application of this subsection, the individual's liability for any deficiency which is assessed with respect to the return shall not exceed the portion of such deficiency properly allocable to such individual under subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(2) The electing individual shall have the burden of proof with respect to establishing the portion of any deficiency allocable to such individual.\n\n(3) An individual shall be eligible to elect the application of this subsection if (A) at the time such election is filed, such individual is no longer married to, or is legally separated from, the individual with whom such individual filed the joint return to which the election relates, or (B) such individual was not a member of the same household as the individual with whom such joint return was filed at any time during the twelve-month period ending on the date such election is filed.\n\n(4) If the commissioner demonstrates that assets were transferred between individuals filing a joint return as part of a fraudulent scheme by such individuals, an election under this subsection by either individual shall be invalid.\n\n(5) If the commissioner demonstrates that the individual electing under this subsection had actual knowledge, at the time such individual signed the return, of any item giving rise to a deficiency or portion thereof which is not allocable to such individual under subsection (d) of this section, the election shall not apply to such deficiency or portion thereof, unless the individual with actual knowledge establishes that the electing individual signed the return under duress.\n\n(6) The portion of the deficiency for which the individual electing under this subsection is liable shall be increased by the value of any disqualified asset transferred to the individual. For purposes of this section, “disqualified asset” means any property or right to property transferred to an electing individual with respect to a joint return by the other individual filing such joint return if the principal purpose of the transfer was the avoidance of tax or payment of tax. Any transfer which is made after the date which is one year before the date on which a notice of proposed deficiency assessment is sent, other than any transfer pursuant to a decree of divorce or separate maintenance or a written instrument incident to such a decree or to any transfer which an individual establishes did not have as its principal purpose the avoidance of tax or payment of tax, shall be presumed to have as its principal purpose the avoidance of tax or payment of tax.\n\n(7) An election under this subsection for any taxable year shall be made not later than two years after the date on which the commissioner has begun collection activities with respect to the individual making the election.\n\n(d) (1) The portion of any deficiency on a joint return allocated to an individual electing under subsection (c) of this section shall be the amount which bears the same ratio to such deficiency as the net amount of items taken into account in computing the deficiency and allocable to the individual under this subdivision bears to the net amount of all items taken into account in computing the deficiency.\n\n(2) If a deficiency or portion thereof is attributable to the disallowance of a credit, and such item is allocated to one individual under subdivision (3) of this subsection, such deficiency or portion thereof shall be allocated to such individual. Any such item shall not be taken into account under subdivision (1) of this subsection.\n\n(3) Except as provided in subdivisions (4) and (5) of this subsection, any item giving rise to a deficiency on a joint return shall be allocated to individuals filing the return in the same manner as it would have been allocated if the individuals had filed separate returns for the taxable year. If the commissioner establishes that the allocation of any item is appropriate due to fraud of one or both individuals, the commissioner may provide for such allocation in a manner as prescribed in regulations adopted in accordance with chapter 54.\n\n(4) If an exemption under section 12-702 or a credit under section 12-703 would be disallowed in its entirety solely because a separate return is filed, such disallowance shall be disregarded and the item shall be computed as if a joint return had been filed and then allocated between the joint filers appropriately.\n\n(5) If the liability of a child of a taxpayer is included on a joint return, such liability shall be disregarded in computing the separate liability of either joint filer and such liability shall be allocated appropriately between the joint filers.\n\n(e) (1) The commissioner shall determine what relief, if any, is available to an electing individual under this section and shall mail notice of the proposed determination to such individual. Such notice shall set forth briefly the commissioner's findings of fact and the basis of the determination in each case decided in whole or in part adversely to such individual. Sixty days after the date on which it is mailed, a notice of proposed determination shall constitute a final determination except only for such amounts as to which such individual has filed a written protest with the commissioner in accordance with subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n(2) On or before the sixtieth day after the mailing of the proposed determination, such individual may file with the commissioner a written protest against the proposed determination in which such individual sets forth the grounds on which the protest is based. If a protest is filed, the commissioner shall reconsider the proposed determination and, if such individual has so requested, may grant or deny such individual or such individual's authorized representative an oral hearing.\n\n(3) The commissioner shall mail notice of the commissioner's determination to such individual, which notice shall set forth briefly the commissioner's findings of fact and the basis of decision in each case decided in whole or in part adversely to such individual.\n\n(4) The action of the commissioner on such individual's protest shall be final upon the expiration of one month from the date on which the commissioner mails notice of the commissioner's action to such individual unless within such period such individual seeks judicial review of the commissioner's determination pursuant to section 12-730.\n\n(f) Under procedures prescribed by the commissioner, if taking into account all the facts and circumstances, it is inequitable to hold such individual liable for any unpaid tax or any deficiency, or any portion of such unpaid tax or deficiency, and relief is not otherwise available to such individual under this section, the commissioner may relieve such individual of such liability.\n\n(g) The commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, including regulations providing the opportunity for an individual to have notice of, and an opportunity to participate in, any administrative proceeding with respect to an election made under this section by the other individual filing the joint return.\n\n(h) The provisions of this section shall be applicable with respect to any liability arising after May 27, 1999, and any liability arising on or before May 27, 1999, if such liability remains unpaid as of said date, provided the two-year period to make an election under subsection (b) or (c) of this section shall not expire before the date that is two years after the date of the first collection activity after May 27, 1999.\n\n(P.A. 99-48, S. 4, 10; P.A. 00-230, S. 12; June Sp.

(a) to allow individual who made joint return to elect relief under Subsec. (f) even if not eligible for relief under Subsec. (b) or (c), amended Subsec.

The provisions of this section shall also apply to resident trusts and estates and, wherever reference is made in this section to residents of this state, such reference shall be construed to include resident trusts and estates.\n\n(3) In the case of a part-year resident, the credit provided under this section shall not exceed the proportion of the tax otherwise due during the period of residency under this chapter that the amount of the taxpayer's Connecticut adjusted gross income derived from or connected with sources in the other jurisdiction during the period of residency bears to such taxpayer's Connecticut adjusted gross income during the period of residency under this chapter. The provisions of this section shall also apply to part-year resident trusts and, wherever reference is made in this section to part-year residents of this state, such reference shall be construed to include part-year resident trusts.\n\n(4) The allowance of the credit provided under this section shall not reduce the tax otherwise due under this chapter to an amount less than what would have been due if the income subject to taxation by such other jurisdiction were excluded from Connecticut adjusted gross income.\n\n(5) For purposes of this subsection, a tax on wages that is paid to another state of the United States or a political subdivision thereof or the District of Columbia by an employer on behalf of an employee and for which a credit is allowed by such other jurisdiction shall be considered an income tax and a comparable credit may be claimed by the resident or part-year resident, subject to the limitations set forth in this subsection, in the form and manner prescribed by the commissioner.\n\n(b) (1) (A) If, as a direct result of (i) the change to or correction of a taxpayer's income tax return filed with another state of the United States or a political subdivision thereof or the District of Columbia by the tax officers or other competent authority of such jurisdiction, or (ii) a taxpayer paying an assessment issued against the taxpayer by the tax officers or other competent authority of such jurisdiction for any taxable year for which the taxpayer has not filed an income tax return with such jurisdiction, the amount of tax of such other jurisdiction that the taxpayer is finally required to pay is different from the amount used to determine the credit allowed to any taxpayer under this section for any taxable year, the taxpayer shall provide notice of such difference to the commissioner by filing, on or before the date that is ninety days after the final determination of such amount, an amended return under this chapter, and shall concede the accuracy of such determination or state wherein it is erroneous. The commissioner may redetermine, and the taxpayer shall be required to pay, the tax for any taxable year affected, regardless of any otherwise applicable statute of limitations.\n\n(B) If a taxpayer files an amended return under this subdivision as a direct result of the taxpayer paying an assessment as set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii) of this subdivision, the taxpayer shall not be eligible for a refund if the amended return is filed more than five years after the original due date of the taxpayer's Connecticut income tax return, even if such amended return is filed within the time prescribed under subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of section 12-732.\n\n(2) If, as a direct result of a taxpayer filing an amended income tax return with another state of the United States or a political subdivision thereof or the District of Columbia, the amount of tax of such other jurisdiction that the taxpayer is required to pay is different from the amount used to determine the credit allowed to any taxpayer under this section for any taxable year, the taxpayer shall provide notice of such difference to the commissioner by filing, on or before the date that is ninety days after the final determination is made on such amended return by the tax officers or other competent authority of such other jurisdiction, an amended return under this chapter and shall give such information as the commissioner may require. The commissioner shall treat any such amended return under this chapter reporting a tax overpayment as containing sufficient required information after proof of such final determination on such amended income tax return of such other jurisdiction by the tax officers or other competent authority of such other jurisdiction is submitted to the commissioner. The commissioner may redetermine, and the taxpayer shall be required to pay, the tax for any taxable year affected, regardless of any otherwise applicable statute of limitations.\n\n(3) The commissioner may by regulation prescribe such exceptions to the requirements of this subsection as he deems appropriate.\n\n(c) A taxpayer shall not be allowed credit under this section if such taxpayer has claimed or will claim a credit against the income tax imposed by such other jurisdiction for the tax paid or payable under this chapter.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, if an individual is not domiciled in this state but maintains a permanent place of abode in this state and is in this state for an aggregate of more than one hundred eighty-three days of a taxable year and such individual is domiciled in another state of the United States, a political subdivision of such state, or the District of Columbia for the taxable year, such individual shall be allowed a credit under this section against the tax otherwise due under this chapter for income tax imposed by and paid to the qualifying jurisdiction in which such individual is domiciled on such individual's income from intangible personal property, to the extent such income is from property not employed in a business, trade, profession or occupation carried on in this state, and on such individual's income derived from or connected with sources within another state of the United States or the District of Columbia that does not impose an income tax on such income. This subsection shall apply only where the jurisdiction in which such individual is domiciled allows an income tax credit for the tax imposed by this state to an individual who is domiciled in this state for a taxable year but maintains a permanent place of abode in such jurisdiction and is in such jurisdiction for an aggregate of more than one hundred eighty-three days of the taxable year that is analogous to that provided in this subsection.\n\n(June Sp.

For taxable years commencing on or after January 1, 2016, compensation for personal services rendered in this state by such nonresident employee who is present in this state for not more than fifteen days during a taxable year shall not constitute income derived from sources within this state. If a nonresident employee is present in this state for more than fifteen days during a taxable year, all compensation the employee receives for the rendering of all personal services in this state during the taxable year shall constitute income derived from sources within this state during the taxable year.\n\n(B) For purposes of determining whether a nonresident employee is “present in this state” under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, presence in this state for any part of a day constitutes being present in this state for that entire day unless such presence is solely for the purpose of transit through this state. The provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply to subsection (c) of this section or to any other provision of law unless expressly provided.\n\n(C) For purposes of determining the compensation derived from or connected with sources within this state, a nonresident natural person shall include income from days worked outside this state for such person's convenience if such person's state of domicile uses a similar test.\n\n(D) The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to sources of income from a business, trade, profession, or occupation carried on in this state other than compensation for personal services rendered by a nonresident employee, and shall not apply to sources of income derived by an athlete, entertainer or performing artist, including, but not limited to, a member of an athletic team.\n\n(3) Income from intangible personal property, including annuities, dividends, interest and gains from the disposition of intangible personal property, shall constitute income derived from sources within this state only to the extent that such income is from (A) property employed in a business, trade, profession or occupation carried on in this state, or (B) winnings from a wager placed in a lottery conducted by the Connecticut Lottery Corporation, if the proceeds from such wager are required, under the Internal Revenue Code or regulations adopted thereunder, to be reported by the Connecticut Lottery Corporation to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n(4) Deductions with respect to capital losses and net operating losses shall be based solely on income, gain, loss and deduction derived from or connected with sources within this state, under regulations adopted by the commissioner, but otherwise shall be determined in the same manner as the corresponding federal deductions.\n\n(5) Income directly or indirectly derived by an athlete, entertainer or performing artist, including, but not limited to, a member of an athletic team, from closed-circuit and cable television transmissions of an event, other than events occurring on a regularly scheduled basis, taking place within this state as a result of the rendition of services by such athlete, entertainer or performing artist shall constitute income derived from or connected with sources within this state only to the extent that such transmissions were received or exhibited within this state.\n\n(6) For purposes of subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, “real property in this state” includes an interest in an entity, and “entity” means a partnership, limited liability company or S corporation that owns, directly or indirectly, real property that is located within this state and has a fair market value that equals or exceeds fifty per cent of all the assets of the entity on the date of sale or disposition by a nonresident natural person of such person's interest in the entity. Only those assets that the entity owned, directly or indirectly, for at least two years prior to the date of the sale or disposition of the person's interest in the entity shall be used in determining the fair market value of all the assets of the entity on the date of such sale or disposition.

The gross income percentage shall be computed by dividing the gross receipts from sales earned within this state by the total gross receipts from sales, whether earned within or without this state. For the purposes of this subdivision:\n\n(A) Gross receipts from sales of tangible personal property are considered to be earned within this state when the property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser within this state, regardless of the F.O.B. point or other conditions of the sale.\n\n(B) Gross receipts from sales of services are considered to be earned within this state if the market for the services is in this state. The taxpayer's market for services is in this state if and to the extent the service is used at a location in this state.\n\n(C) Gross receipts from the rental, lease or license of tangible personal property are considered to be earned within this state if and to the extent such property is situated in this state.\n\n(D) Gross receipts from the rental, lease or license of intangible property are considered to be earned within this state if and to the extent such property is used in this state. Intangible property utilized in marketing a good or service to a consumer is used in this state if that good or service is purchased by a consumer in this state.\n\n(E) Gross receipts from the sale or other disposition of tangible personal property or intangible property are excluded from the gross income percentage if such property is not held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business.\n\n(F) Gross receipts from the sale, rental, lease or license of real property are excluded from the gross income percentage.\n\n(G) Gross receipts, other than those receipts described in subparagraphs (A) to (F), inclusive, of this subdivision, are considered to be earned within this state to the extent the taxpayer's market for the sales is in this state.\n\n(H) If a taxpayer concludes that it cannot reasonably determine where its gross receipts are earned in accordance with subparagraphs (A) to (G), inclusive, of this subdivision, such taxpayer may petition the commissioner for approval to use a methodology that reasonably approximates the method for determining where such receipts are earned provided for in this subdivision. Any such petition shall be submitted not later than sixty days prior to the due date of the return for the first taxable year to which the petition applies, determined with regard to any extension of time for filing such return. The commissioner shall grant or deny such petition before such due date.\n\n(d) Compensation paid by the United States for active service in the armed forces of the United States, performed by an individual not domiciled in this state, shall not constitute income derived from sources within this state.\n\n(e) If a husband and wife determine their federal income tax on a joint return but are required to determine their Connecticut income taxes separately, they shall determine their incomes derived from or connected with sources within this state separately as if their federal adjusted gross incomes had been determined separately.\n\n(f) Any nonresident, other than a dealer holding property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business, shall not be deemed to carry on a trade, business, profession or occupation in this state solely by reason of the purchase or sale of intangible property or the purchase, sale or writing of stock option contracts, or both, for his own account.\n\n(June Sp.

The commissioner may make any deficiency assessment against, at the commissioner's sole discretion, either the S corporation or the shareholder, provided any such assessment against the shareholder shall be limited to the shareholder's share thereof.

When it appears that any part of the deficiency for which a deficiency assessment is made is due to fraud or intent to evade the provisions of this chapter or regulations adopted thereunder, there shall be imposed a penalty equal to twentyfive per cent of the amount of such deficiency assessment.\n\n(B) (i) For audits of returns commencing on or after January 1, 2006, and prior to January 1, 2018, when it appears that any part of the deficiency for which a deficiency assessment is made is due to failure to disclose a listed transaction, as defined in Section 6707A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time, on the taxpayer's federal tax return, there shall be imposed a penalty equal to seventy-five per cent of the amount of such deficiency assessment.\n\n(ii) For audits of returns commencing on or after January 1, 2018, when it appears that any part of the deficiency for which a deficiency assessment is made is due to failure to disclose a reportable transaction, as defined in said Section 6707A, on the taxpayer's federal tax return, there shall be imposed a penalty equal to seventy-five per cent of the amount of such deficiency assessment.\n\n(3) No taxpayer shall be subject to more than one penalty under this section in relation to the same tax period.\n\n(4) Any decision rendered by any federal court holding that a taxpayer has filed a fraudulent return with the Director of Internal Revenue shall subject the taxpayer to the twenty-five per cent penalty imposed by this subsection without the necessity of further proof thereof, except when it can be shown that the return to the state so differed from the return to the federal government as to afford a reasonable presumption that the attempt to defraud did not extend to the state.\n\n(b) A notice of deficiency shall set forth the reason for the proposed assessment. The notice shall be mailed to the taxpayer at his last-known address. In the case of a joint return, the notice of deficiency may be a single joint notice except that if the commissioner is notified by either spouse that separate residences have been established he shall mail joint notices to each spouse. If the taxpayer is deceased or under a legal disability, a notice of deficiency may be mailed to his last-known address unless the commissioner has received notice of the existence of a fiduciary relationship with respect to such taxpayer.\n\n(June Sp.
