The commissioner shall, before entering upon the duties of his office, take the oath by law provided for executive and judicial officers and, in the performance of his duties, he shall have power to administer oaths.\n\n(2) The commissioner may prescribe regulations, to be adopted in accordance with chapter 54, and make rulings, not inconsistent with law, to carry into effect the provisions of this title, which regulations or rulings, when reasonably designed to carry out the intents and purposes of this title, shall be prima facie evidence of its proper interpretation. Each regulation shall be assigned a section number corresponding to the section of the general statutes (A) pursuant to which such regulation is authorized or required or (B) with respect to which such regulation pertains for purposes of implementation, procedural details or supplementary interpretation, provided whenever such section number corresponds to a section which does not include the authorization or requirement for such regulation, a reference to the section providing such authorization or requirement shall be included in the text of the regulation.\n\n(3) The commissioner shall publish for distribution all regulations prescribed hereunder and such rulings as appear in the discretion of the commissioner to be of general interest.\n\n(4) The commissioner may require any person who is or appears to be affected by the provisions of any tax law of this state to furnish to the Department of Revenue Services the Social Security account number or numbers issued to such person by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or the employer identification number or numbers issued to such person by the Secretary of the Treasury, or both numbers.\n\n(5) No interest, penalty or addition to tax shall be imposed on any tax or installment of estimated tax required to be paid to the Department of Revenue Services with respect to any tax or installment of estimated tax not paid when required to the extent that the Commissioner of Revenue Services determines that, by reason of casualty or disaster, the imposition of such interest, penalty or addition to tax would be against equity and good conscience. The provisions of this subdivision shall not be construed as authorizing suit against the state where the Commissioner of Revenue Services does not determine that the imposition of interest, penalty or addition to tax would be against equity and good conscience and shall not be construed as a waiver of sovereign immunity.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes to the contrary, the commissioner may issue administrative pronouncements providing his interpretation of the tax laws. Such pronouncements shall not have the force and effect of regulations and shall carry a notice stating that the administrative pronouncements do not have the force and effect of law, provided taxpayers shall be entitled to rely on such pronouncements. For the purpose of this subsection “administrative pronouncement” means a statement by the Commissioner of Revenue Services which provides his interpretation of the tax laws and which is published and made available to the public.

The agreement shall include a fee to be paid by such municipality to said commissioner in an amount that covers fully the cost of collection of such taxes, fines, penalties, costs or fees, or charges by said commissioner. The commissioner shall transmit to the municipality all such taxes, fines, penalties, costs or fees, or charges so collected on behalf of such municipality on or before the date specified in such agreement, less the agreed upon collection fee. Where such an agreement exists, the commissioner may collect, on behalf of such municipality, such taxes, fines, penalties, costs or fees, or charges, and all interest, penalties, fees and other charges added thereto by law, under the provisions of section 12-35 as if such taxes, fines, penalties, costs or fees, or charges due such municipality were “tax due the state”, as such term is defined in said section 12-35, and as if such term expressly included taxes, fines, penalties, costs or fees, or charges due to such municipality.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 1680; 1949, S. 1028d; 1967, P.A. 867; 1969, P.A. 297; P.A. 77-614, S. 139, 610; P.A. 84-422, S. 1, 2; P.A. 90-36; P.A. 93-361, S. 1; P.A. 95-283, S. 31, 68; P.A. 96-114, S. 1, 4; 96-221, S. 13, 25; P.A. 97-309, S. 15, 23; 97-322, S. 7, 9; P.A. 10-32, S. 32; June Sp.

The commissioner shall not collect such taxes unless the laws of the claimant state (A) allow the commissioner, in cases where a taxpayer owes taxes to this state, to certify that such tax is owed and to request the tax officer of the claimant state to collect such taxes owed to this state, and (B) provide for the payment of such collected amount to this state.\n\n(2) Such certification shall include (A) the full name and address of the taxpayer; (B) the taxpayer's Social Security number or federal employer identification number; (C) the amount of the tax for the taxable period sought to be collected, including a detailed statement for each taxable period showing tax, interest and penalty; (D) a statement whether the taxpayer filed a tax return with the claimant state for such tax, and, if so, whether such tax return was filed under protest; and (E) a statement that any administrative or judicial remedies, or both, have been exhausted or have lapsed and that the amount of taxes is legally enforceable under the laws of such state against the taxpayer.\n\n(3) Upon receipt by the commissioner of the required certification, he or she shall notify the taxpayer by first-class mail to the taxpayer's last-known address that he or she has received a request from the claimant state to collect taxes from the taxpayer, that the taxpayer has the right to protest the collection of such taxes by the commissioner for the claimant state, that failure to file a protest in accordance with subdivision (4) of this subsection shall constitute a waiver of any demand against this state on account of the collection of such taxes and that the amount, upon collection, will be paid over to the claimant state. The notice shall include a copy of the certification by the tax officer of such claimant state. Sixty days after the date on which it is mailed, a notice under this subdivision shall be final except only for such amounts as to which the taxpayer has filed, as provided in subdivision (4) of this subsection, a written protest with the commissioner.\n\n(4) Any taxpayer notified in accordance with subdivision (3) of this subsection may, on or before the sixtieth day after the mailing of such notice by the commissioner, protest the collection of all or a portion of such taxes by filing with the commissioner a written protest in which the taxpayer shall set forth the grounds on which the protest is based. If a timely protest is filed, the commissioner shall refrain from collecting such taxes and shall send a copy of the protest to the claimant state for determination of the protest on its merits in accordance with the laws of such state. In the case of a taxpayer that did not file a tax return for the tax for the taxable period sought to be collected and where the amount of taxes owed to the claimant state is based on an assessment made against the taxpayer by the tax officer of the claimant state, and where the taxpayer has filed a timely protest under this subdivision, the commissioner shall require the claimant state to certify that the assessment was contested before and adjudicated by an administrative or judicial tribunal of competent jurisdiction in the claimant state. If the commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer's written protest is based on a bona fide contention that the claimant state did not have jurisdiction to tax the taxpayer, the commissioner shall require the claimant state to certify that the assessment was contested before and adjudicated by a judicial tribunal of competent jurisdiction in the claimant state. If the claimant state fails, on or before the forty-fifth day after the sending of the copy of the protest by the commissioner to such claimant state, to certify to the commissioner that the claimant state has reviewed the stated grounds on which the protest is based, and to renew the certification described in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the commissioner shall not collect such taxes. If such certifications are made within such time period, and if the commissioner is satisfied that such certifications are true, accurate and complete, the commissioner shall collect such tax.\n\n(c) The commissioner may enter into agreements with the tax officers of claimant states relating to: (1) Procedures and methods to be employed by a claimant state with respect to the operation of this section, (2) safeguards against the disclosure or inappropriate use of any information that identifies, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer obtained or maintained pursuant to this section, and (3) a minimum threshold for the amount of taxes owed by a taxpayer to a claimant state that would trigger the operation of this section.\n\n(P.A. 04-201, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 04-201 effective July 1, 2004.\n\nSee Sec. 12-35c re Attorney General's authority to bring suit in other states to recover taxes due this state or its political subdivisions and reciprocity granted to other states.",
