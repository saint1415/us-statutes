If title to real property is recorded in the name of the person or the spouse making a claim and qualifying under said sections and any other person or persons, the claimant hereunder shall be entitled to pay the claimant's fractional share of the tax on such property calculated in accordance with the provisions of this section, and such other person or persons shall pay the person's or persons' fractional share of the tax without regard for the provisions of said sections. For the purposes of this section, a “mobile manufactured home”, as defined in section 12-63a, shall be deemed to be real property.\n\n(c) If an owner of real property has qualified and received tax relief under this section and section 12-129c and subsequently has adjusted gross income in excess of the maximum as described in this section, he shall notify the municipal tax assessor on or before the next assessment date and shall be denied tax relief under this section for such assessment year and thereafter. Any person who fails to notify the municipal tax assessor of such disqualification shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars.\n\n(d) If any person with respect to whom a claim for tax relief in accordance with this section and section 12-129c has been approved for any assessment year transfers, assigns, grants or otherwise conveys subsequent to the first day of October, but prior to the first day of August in such assessment year the interest in real property to which such claim for tax relief is related, regardless of whether such transfer, assignment, grant or conveyance is voluntary or involuntary, the amount of such tax relief benefit, determined as the amount by which the tax payable without benefit of this section exceeds the tax payable under the provisions of this section, shall be a pro rata portion of the amount otherwise applicable in such assessment year to be determined by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of full months from the first day of October in such assessment year to the date of such conveyance and the denominator of which shall be twelve. If such conveyance occurs in the month of October the grantor shall be disqualified for such tax relief in such assessment year. The grantee shall be required within a period not exceeding ten days immediately following the date of such conveyance to notify the assessor thereof, or in the absence of such notice, upon determination by the assessor that such transfer, assignment, grant or conveyance has occurred, the assessor shall (1) determine the amount of tax relief benefit to which the grantor is entitled for such assessment year with respect to the interest in real property conveyed and notify the tax collector of the reduced amount of such benefit, and (2) notify the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management on or before the October first next following the end of the assessment year in which such conveyance occurs of the reduction in such benefit for purposes of a corresponding adjustment in the amount of state payment to the municipality next following as reimbursement for the revenue loss related to such tax relief.

Upon receipt of such notice from the assessor, the tax collector shall, if such notice is received after the tax due date in the municipality, not later than thirty days after such receipt, mail or hand a bill to the grantee stating the additional amount of tax due as determined by the assessor or assessors. Such tax shall be due and payable and collectible as other property taxes and subject to the same liens and processes of collection, provided such tax shall be due and payable in an initial or single installment not sooner than thirty days after the date such bill is mailed or handed to the grantee and in equal amounts in any remaining, regular installments as the same are due and payable.\n\n(1967, P.A. 755, S. 1; 1969, P.A. 338, S. 1; 673, S. 1; 814, S. 2; 1971, P.A. 632, S. 2; 749; 1972, P.A. 253, S. 1; P.A. 74-55, S. 3, 4, 14; P.A. 76-383, S. 1, 2; P.A. 79-498, S. 1, 4; 79-514, S. 1, 4; 79-630; P.A. 80-139, S. 1, 2; 80-391, S. 1, 6; 80-463, S. 4, 6; P.A. 81-60, S. 1; 81-244, S. 1, 2; P.A. 83-409, S. 1; June Sp.

After the initial approval of such property tax relief by the legislative body of such municipality, such plan may be amended from time to time by vote of its legislative body on recommendation of its board of finance or equivalent body without compliance with the requirements of this subsection applicable to such initial approval.\n\n(c) The total abatement of property tax revenue, based on an estimate in any tax year by the board of finance or equivalent body of such municipality, which may be granted in such tax year by such municipality pursuant to the provisions of this section shall not exceed an amount equal to ten per cent of the total real property tax assessed in such municipality in the preceding tax year.\n\n(d) Any such property tax relief granted to any such resident in accordance with the provisions of this section shall not disqualify such resident with respect to any benefits for which such resident shall be eligible under the provisions of sections 12-129b to 12-129d, inclusive, and 12-170aa, and any such property tax relief provided under this section shall be in addition to any such benefits for which such resident shall be eligible under said sections.\n\n(e) Reimbursement of such municipality under the provisions of sections 12-129b to 12-129d, inclusive, and 12-170aa shall be limited to such amount as the municipality would be entitled to receive for revenues lost because of tax relief provided under the provisions of said sections.

For purposes of this section the assessor shall determine the assumed amount of property tax liability applicable to the assessed value for the dwelling unit of each such person who is otherwise eligible under this subsection, but such determination shall not constitute a tax bill for purposes of property taxation of such cooperative or any individual dwelling unit thereof.

The assumed property tax liability for purposes of determining the amount of the relief shall be the product of such assessed value and the mill rate in such municipality as determined for purposes of property tax imposed on said assessment list for the assessment year commencing October first immediately preceding. The amount of relief to which such person shall be entitled for such assessment year shall be equivalent to the amount of tax reduction for which such person would qualify, considering such assumed property tax liability to be the actual property tax applicable to such person's dwelling unit and such person as liable for the payment of such tax.\n\n(P.A. 73-628; P.A. 74-294, S. 1, 2; P.A. 81-405; P.A. 85-442, S. 2, 3; P.A. 87-91, S. 1, 2; 87-116, S. 1, 2; P.A. 93-120, S. 1, 2; P.A. 99-89, S. 5, 10; 99-189, S. 19, 20; P.A. 07-251, S. 2; P.A. 14-124, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 74-294 made former provisions Subsecs.

He shall also send by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the delinquent taxpayer and to each mortgagee, lienholder and other encumbrancer of record whose interest in such property is choate and will be affected by such sale, a similar notice which shall not be required to list information pertaining to properties in which the person to whom the notice is directed has no interest. The notice shall be sent at least twice, the first not more than eight nor less than five weeks before such sale and the last not more than four weeks nor less than two weeks before such sale. The notice shall be addressed to his or her place of residence, if known to the collector, or to his or her estate or the fiduciary thereof if the collector knows him or her to be deceased, or to the address, or the agent of such person, to which such person has requested that tax bills be sent. If there is no address of such person, or if no such agent is given in the records of such town, the notice shall be sent to the place where such person regularly conducts business or other address as the collector believes will give notice of the levy and sale. If a person is a corporation, limited partnership or other legal entity, the notice may be sent to any person upon whom process may be served to initiate a civil action against such corporation, limited partnership or entity or to any other address that the collector believes will give notice of the levy and sale. If no place of residence or business is known and cannot be determined by the tax collector for any owner, taxpayer, mortgagee, lienholder or other encumbrancer whose interest in the property is choate and will be affected by the sale, in lieu of notice by certified mail as provided in this subsection, the notice, together with the list of mortgagees, lienholders, and other encumbrancers of record whose interests in the property are choate and will be affected by such sale, shall be published in a newspaper published in this state, having a general circulation in the town in which such property is located at least twice, the first not more than eight weeks nor less than five weeks before such sale and the last not more than four weeks nor less than two weeks before such sale.\n\n(b) The collector may, for any reason, adjourn such sale from time to time by causing public notice of such adjournment and the time and place of such adjourned sale to be given either by oral announcement or posting of a written notice at the time and place designated for the sale in the notices of such sale. If the adjourned date is set for a date more than three days from the date of the original or rescheduled sale date, the tax collector shall provide a postage prepaid written notice of the new time and place of the sale to the delinquent taxpayer and each mortgagee, lienholder and other encumbrancer of record whose interest is choate and will be affected by the sale.\n\n(c) At the time and place stated in such notices, or, if such sale is adjourned, at the time and place specified at the time of adjournment as aforesaid, such collector (1) may sell at public auction to the highest bidder all of said real property, to pay the taxes with the interest, fees and other charges allowed by law, including, but not limited to, those charges set forth in section 12-140, or (2) may sell all of said real property to his municipality if there has been no bidder or the amount bid is insufficient to pay the amount due.\n\n(d) The collector shall post, at the time and place of the sale, a written notice stating the amount of all taxes, interest, fees and other charges authorized by law with respect to each property to be sold. The tax collector may publish or announce any rules for the orderly conduct of the auction and the making of payment by successful bidders which are not inconsistent with the requirements of law. The tax collector or the municipality may retain the services of auctioneers, clerks and other persons to assist the tax collector in the conduct of the sale and the cost of such persons paid for their services shall be added to the taxes due from the delinquent taxpayer. If more than one property is sold, the tax collector shall apportion all shared costs equally among all the properties.\n\n(e) Within two weeks after such sale, the collector shall execute a deed thereof to the purchaser or to the municipality conducting the sale and shall lodge the same in the office of the town clerk of such town, where it shall remain unrecorded six months from the date of such sale.\n\n(f) Within sixty days after such sale, the collector shall cause to be published in a newspaper having a daily general circulation in the town in which the real property is located, and shall send by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the delinquent taxpayer and each mortgagee, lienholder and other encumbrancer of record whose interest in such property is choate and is affected by such sale, a notice stating the date of the sale, the name and address of the purchaser, the amount the purchaser paid for the property and the date the redemption period will expire. The notice shall include a statement that if redemption does not take place by the date stated and in the manner provided by law, the delinquent taxpayer, and all mortgagees, lienholders and other encumbrancers who have received actual or constructive notice of such sale as provided by law, that their respective titles, mortgages, liens, restraints on alienation and other encumbrances in such property shall be extinguished. After such notice is published, and not later than six months after the date of the sale or within sixty days if the property was abandoned or meets other conditions established by ordinance adopted by the legislative body of the municipality, if the delinquent taxpayer, mortgagee, lienholder or other encumbrancer whose interest in the property will be affected by such sale, pays to the collector, the amount of taxes, interest and charges which were due and owing at the time of the sale together with interest on the total purchase price paid by the purchaser at the rate of eighteen per cent per annum from the date of such sale plus any taxes and debts owed to the municipality that were not recovered by the sale and any additional charges under section 12-140, such deed, executed pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, shall be delivered to the collector by the town clerk for cancellation and the collector shall provide a certificate of satisfaction to the person paying the money who, if not the person whose primary duty it was to pay the tax or taxes, shall have a claim against the person whose primary duty it was to pay such tax or taxes for the amount so paid, and may add the same with the equivalent precedence, rate of interest and priority as the tax paid over other nongovernmental encumbrances but without precedence or priority over any state or municipal tax lien or any tax that was not yet due and payable when notice of the levy was first published to any claim for which he has security upon the property sold, provided the certificate of satisfaction is recorded on the land records but the interests of other persons in the property shall not be affected. Within ten days of receipt of such amounts in redemption of the levied property, the collector shall notify the purchaser by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the property has been redeemed and shall tender such payment, together with the amount held pursuant to subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of subsection (i) of this section, if any, to the purchaser. If the purchase money and interest are not paid within such redemption period, the deed shall be recorded and have full effect.\n\n(g) During the redemption period, the purchaser or the municipality shall have a sufficient insurable interest in buildings and improvements upon such property to insure them against fire and other risk of physical loss, and may petition the Superior Court for the appointment of a receiver or for other equitable relief if there shall be imminent danger of damage or destruction thereto or imminent danger of injury to persons or to other property resulting from conditions thereon or on adjoining properties. The purchaser or the municipality shall not be liable to any person, or subjected to forfeiture of their interest, solely by reason of acquisition by the person of the tax deed, for any condition existing or occurrence upon such property or adjoining public sidewalks and streets, or for any failure to act to remedy or investigate any such condition or occurrence during such redemption period. The expenses of any receiver appointed on the application of such purchaser or municipality in excess of any rents or profits paid to the receiver, all taxes and debts owed to the municipality that were not recovered by the sale, and any additional charges under section 12-140 shall be added to the amount of the purchase money and interest required to be paid by any person to the purchaser or municipality for the collector's deed and paid to the party that incurred such expenses.\n\n(h) Any municipality holding a lien for unpaid taxes on real estate, other than the municipality conducting the sale, may purchase all of such property at a tax sale.\n\n(i) (1) If the sale realizes an amount in excess of the amount needed to pay all delinquent taxes, interest, penalties, fees, and costs, the amount of the excess shall be held in an interest-bearing escrow account separate from all other accounts of the municipality. Any interest earned from such escrow account shall be the property of the municipality. (A) If the property is redeemed prior to the expiration of the redemption period, the amount held in escrow shall, within ten days of the tax collector receiving notice of redemption, be turned over to the purchaser. (B) If the property is not redeemed in the redemption period, the amount held in escrow may be used to pay the delinquent taxes, interest, penalties, fees and costs on the same or any other property of the taxpayer, including personal property and motor vehicles. In the case of subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, the tax collector shall, within ten days of the expiration of the redemption period, pay to the clerk of the court for the judicial district in which the property is located the amount held in escrow remaining after paying the delinquent taxes, interest, fees, penalties and costs owed by the taxpayer to the municipality. The tax collector shall, within five days of the payment, provide notice to the delinquent taxpayer, any mortgagee, lienholder, or other encumbrancer of record whose interest in such property is choate and is affected by the sale, by certified mail, return receipt requested of the name and address of the court to which the moneys were paid, the person's right to file an application with the court for return of said money, and the amount of money paid to the court.\n\n(2) If the tax collector pays to the court any moneys pursuant to subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the delinquent taxpayer, any mortgagee, lienholder or other encumbrancer whose interest in such property is choate and is affected by the sale may, within ninety days of the date the tax collector paid the moneys to the court, file an application with the court for return of the proceeds. Any person may make an application for payment of moneys deposited in court as provided for in this subsection to the superior court for the judicial district in which the property that is the subject of the proceedings referred to is located, or if said court is not in session to any judge thereof, for a determination of the equity of the parties having an interest in such moneys. Notice of such application shall be served in the same manner as to commence a civil action on all persons having an interest of record in such property on the date the collector's deed is recorded, provided neither the purchaser nor the municipality shall be a party to such action without such purchaser's or municipality's consent. The court or judge upon such motion or upon its own motion may appoint a state referee to hear the facts and to make a determination of the equity of the parties in such moneys. Such referee, after providing at least ten days' notice to the parties interested of the time and place of hearing, shall hear the applicant and any parties interested, take such testimonies as such referee deems material and determine the equities of the parties having a record interest in such moneys and immediately report to the court or judge. The report shall contain a detailed statement of findings by the referee, sufficient to enable the court to determine the considerations upon which the referee based his conclusions. The report may be rejected for any irregular or improper conduct in the performance of the duties of such referee. If the report is rejected, the court or judge shall appoint another referee to make such determination and report. If the report is accepted, such determination of the equities shall be conclusive upon all parties given notice of such hearing, subject to appeal to the Appellate Court. If no appeal to the Appellate Court is filed within the time allowed by law, or if one is filed and the proceedings have terminated in a final judgment determining the amount due to each party, the clerk shall send a certified copy of the statement of compensation and of the judgment to the prevailing party or parties, as the case may be, which shall, upon receipt thereof, pay such parties the amount due them as compensation.\n\n(3) If no application is filed with the court, any moneys held by the court shall escheat to the state pursuant to the provisions of part III of chapter 32.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 1838; P.A. 82-141, S. 3, 4; P.A. 84-146, S. 9; P.A. 95-228, S. 3, 15; P.A. 96-180, S. 21, 166; P.A. 97-139; P.A. 99-283, S. 4, 10; P.A. 02-103, S. 37; P.A. 13-276, S. 30; P.A. 14-139, S. 3; P.A. 15-156, S. 5.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 82-141 increased rate of interest applicable from date of sale to purchase when real estate previously sold for taxes by a municipality is purchased, as allowed, by the owner or other interested party within a period of one year following date of such sale for taxes, with rate of 15% per annum in effect for any such sale in period July 1, 1981 to June 30, 1982, inclusive, and 18% per annum for such sale occurring on or after July 1, 1982; P.A. 84-146 included a reference to posting of notice on a place other than a signpost; P.A. 95-228 divided the section into Subsecs., substantially revised existing provisions, and added provisions designated as Subsecs.

Greeting: By authority of the state of Connecticut you are hereby commanded to collect forthwith from .... of .... the sum of .... dollars, the same being the amount of a tax or water or sanitation charges, with interest or penalty and charges which have accumulated thereon, which tax was levied or which water or sanitation charges were imposed by (insert name of town, city or municipality laying the tax or imposing the water or sanitation charges) upon (insert the real estate, personal property, or both, as the case may be,) of said .... as of the .... day of .....

Any state marshal or constable, authorized as provided in this section, who executes such warrant and collects any delinquent municipal taxes or water or sanitation charges as a result thereof shall receive, in addition to expenses otherwise allowed, a percentage of the taxes or the water or sanitation charges collected pursuant to such warrant, calculated at the rate applicable for the levy of an execution as provided in section 52-261. Any officer unable to serve such warrant shall, within sixty days after the date of issuance, return such warrant to the collector and in writing state the reason it was not served.\n\n(d) With regard to warrants served upon financial institutions, a collector of taxes or serving officer shall not serve alias tax warrants relating to one taxpayer on more than one financial institution at a time, including copies thereof, and after service on one financial institution, shall not serve the same alias tax warrants or copies thereof upon another financial institution until receiving confirmation from the preceding financial institution that the taxpayer had no funds at the preceding financial institution available for collection. If the collector of taxes or serving officer does not receive, not later than twenty days after the service of the warrant or service of a request for information pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, a response from the financial institution that was served indicating whether or not the taxpayer has funds at the financial institution available for collection, the collector of taxes or serving officer may assume that the taxpayer has no funds at that financial institution available for collection and may serve another financial institution in accordance with this subsection.\n\n(e) With regard to warrants to be served upon financial institutions, whenever a tax collector expects to serve, or have an officer serve, more than fifteen tax warrants upon a particular financial institution on a given day, prior to such service, the tax collector or serving officer shall serve upon such financial institution a request for information which complies with subsection (f) of this section. No warrant may be served upon a financial institution with respect to a particular taxpayer unless the financial institution, in a recent response to a request for information, has indicated that the financial institution is indebted to such taxpayer. A tax collector or serving officer may, at the collector's or officer's option, serve a request for information pursuant to this subsection even if not required by this subsection. In such a case, the tax collector or serving officer shall comply with the requirements of this section relating to requests for information, and the financial institution shall respond in the same manner as though the request for information is required by this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, a response is considered recent if the warrant is served not later than one hundred eighty days after the date such response is received.\n\n(f) The request for information required by subsection (e) of this section shall be served upon the financial institution in accordance with subsection (g) of this section and shall include (1) the name and last-known address of each taxpayer who is the subject of a warrant desired to be served by the tax collector or serving officer, (2) the address to which the response can be mailed or delivered or a facsimile number to which the response may be transmitted, (3) in the case of a request transmitted via facsimile by a serving officer, the name, address, judicial district, badge number and telephone number of the officer serving the request, and (4) a statement in substantially the following form:\n\n“To (insert name of financial institution): In accordance with Section 12-162 of the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut, you are hereby commanded to report to (insert name of town or serving officer), at the address or facsimile number specified in this request, whether the financial institution is indebted to the taxpayer or taxpayers listed in this request.”\n\n(g) The request for information required by subsection (e) of this section shall be in writing and shall be (1) delivered or mailed, first class postage prepaid, to an office designated and made available by the financial institution pursuant to this subsection, or (2) transmitted by facsimile provided the facsimile message is transmitted to a facsimile number, addressed to the attention of a recipient or department, and designated and made available by the financial institution pursuant to this subsection. A notice received, whether by facsimile or otherwise, after five o'clock p.m., eastern standard time on any day, shall be deemed to have been received by the financial institution on the next business day. Each financial institution with an office in this state shall designate an office, facsimile number and recipient or department for purposes of this subsection and shall make the current designations available to collectors of taxes and serving officers upon request and by mailing or delivering such designations to the State Marshal Commission and the collector of taxes in each municipality in which the financial institution has an office. A financial institution may amend its designations, provided the amended designations are mailed or delivered to the State Marshal Commission and collector of taxes in each municipality in which the financial institution has an office at least fifteen days before becoming effective. If a financial institution fails to make such designations or fails to make such designations available as required by this subsection, the tax collector or serving officer may serve the request for information on any office of the financial institution located in this state.\n\n(h) Upon receipt of a request for information that complies with subsection (f) of this section, the financial institution shall respond to such request by reporting that (1) the financial institution is indebted to one or more of the taxpayers listed on the request and listing the name or names of those taxpayers, or (2) the financial institution is not indebted to any of the taxpayers listed in the request. If the financial institution is unable to make a determination with respect to a particular taxpayer based on the information supplied with the request, the financial institution may respond that additional information will be needed to make a determination with respect to a taxpayer, listing the name of the taxpayer in question, and the financial institution may adjust its response pursuant to subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection to reflect such fact. The financial institution shall mail, deliver or transmit the response, in the case of a request listing fewer than one hundred taxpayers, not later than five business days following the date the request was received, or in the case of a request listing one hundred or more taxpayers, but not more than two hundred fifty taxpayers, not later than ten business days following the date the request was received. No request for information shall include more than two hundred fifty taxpayers. Once a request for information has been served by or on behalf of a particular town, an additional request for information may not be served upon that same financial institution by or on behalf of that same town unless the financial institution has had an opportunity to respond as provided in this subsection. Unless otherwise required by law, a financial institution that has received a request for information shall not disclose to a taxpayer listed on the request that the financial institution has received a request for information relative to such taxpayer, provided nothing in this section shall prevent the disclosure of information that is publicly known or known to the taxpayer or as otherwise may be necessary to protect the interests of the financial institution.\n\n(i) No financial institution or officer, director or employee of a financial institution, and no serving officer, municipality or officer, employee or agent of a municipality, shall be liable to any person with respect to any act done or omitted in good faith or through the commission of a bona fide error that occurs despite reasonable procedures maintained by the financial institution, serving officer, municipality or officer, employee or agent of a municipality, to prevent such errors in complying with the provisions of this section. For purposes of the response required by subsection (h) of this section, the financial institution may select, with respect to each taxpayer listed on the request, a particular day within the time frame allotted by such subsection, for determining the presence or absence of indebtedness, and the financial institution shall not be responsible for reporting upon the presence or absence of indebtedness on any other day.\n\n(j) For the purposes of this section, “water or sanitation charges” means (1) any rates or charges established pursuant to section 7-239, or (2) any charges imposed by a municipality for the collection and disposal of garbage, trash, rubbish, waste material and ashes.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 1843; 1963, P.A. 642, S. 8; 1967, P.A. 123, S. 2; 1969, P.A. 331; 472; P.A. 77-459, S. 1, 2; P.A. 82-161, S. 1, 2; P.A. 83-581, S. 29, 40; P.A. 91-350, S. 1; P.A. 95-228, S. 6, 15; P.A. 96-180, S. 23, 166; P.A. 00-99, S. 41, 154; P.A. 01-195, S. 17, 181; P.A. 05-135, S. 2; P.A. 07-95, S. 4; 07-111, S. 1; P.A. 21-161, S. 2; P.A. 23-23, S. 5.)\n\nHistory: 1963 act changed obsolete reference from keeper of jail to state jail administrator; 1967 act deleted reference to imprisonment for nonpayment of taxes; 1969 acts added provision allowing collector to garnishee wages for nonpayment of taxes and required unserved warrants to be returned to collector within 30 days after issuance with explanation for why it was not served; P.A. 77-459 allowed collection of additional 5% or 10% amounts above other expenses in cases where warrant executed by sheriff, deputy sheriff or constable; P.A. 82-161 amended the alias tax warrant form issued by the tax collector so that the serving officer in the manner prescribed and to the extent necessary shall levy for the delinquent taxes by making demand upon any banking institution indebted to the delinquent taxpayer as if judgment had been entered for the amount due; P.A. 83-581 replaced “as if judgment therefor had been entered, in accordance with section 52-361” with “as if a wage execution had been entered, in accordance with section 52-361a”; P.A. 91-350 added phrase “Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (j) of section 52-252b” and applied 10% figure re allowance for those collecting delinquent taxes in all cases, deleting sliding scale previously in existence, raised minimum fee from $5 to $20 and changed deadline for return of unserved warrants from 30 to 60 days; P.A. 95-228 made technical changes, effective July 6, 1995, and applicable to tax sale notices posted, filed or published on and after said date; P.A. 96-180 added reference to Sec. 52-367b in tax warrant form, effective June 3, 1996; P.A. 00-99 replaced references to sheriff and deputy sheriff with state marshal, effective December 1, 2000; (Revisor's note: In 2001 the reference in this section to the date “19..” was changed editorially by the Revisors to “20..” to reflect the new millennium); P.A. 01-195 made technical changes for the purposes of gender neutrality, effective July 11, 2001; P.A. 05-135 divided section into Subsecs.

He may enforce collection thereof by using any one or more of the methods provided in sections 12-155, 12-161 and 12-162, or in any other section of the general statutes relating to the enforced collection of taxes. If the amount of such tax has been definitely fixed by the rate maker, the collector shall collect such amount. If the assessment of the property represented by such tax has been fixed by the assessors but the tax rate has not been laid, the collector shall, subject to the provisions of this section, enforce collection of a tax obtained by multiplying the assessment so fixed by the tax rate of the year next preceding. If neither the assessment of the property nor the tax rate has been fixed, the tax collector shall make application to the assessors for a valuation on such property. The assessors shall forthwith assess such property and the assessment placed upon such property by the assessors, together with the tax rate of the year next preceding, shall be used by the collector in determining the amount of tax to be collected. If, after the payment of any tax in conformity with the provisions of this section, it is found that the amount so paid is in excess of the amount which would have been paid on the tax due date or after appeal to the courts, the excess so paid shall be returned to the taxpayer upon written application by him to the treasurer of the municipality. Such written application shall contain a recital of the facts; shall show the amount of rebate to which the applicant believes he is entitled; shall be approved by the tax collector, and shall be made within the period of one year from the date of the definite determination of such tax. The person against whom jeopardy collection proceedings have been begun may obtain a stay of collection of the whole or any part of the amount of the tax so represented by such proceedings by filing with the tax collector a bond in such an amount, not exceeding double the amount as to which the stay is desired, and with such surety as the tax collector deems necessary, conditioned upon the payment of so much of the amount, the collection of which is stayed by the bond, as is found to be due from such person when the grand list has been completed and the tax rate fixed, or as is determined by the board of assessment appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction after appeal to it. The amount of the tax which is stayed by the bond shall be paid on notice and demand of the tax collector, at any time after the tax due date.

The court or judge shall forthwith issue an order to show cause why a receiver should not be appointed, which shall be served upon the owner, agent, lessor, manager, mortgagees, assignees of rent and other parties with an interest in the rents or payments for use and occupancy of the property in a manner most reasonably calculated to give notice to such owner, lessor, manager, mortgagees, assignees of rent and other parties with an interest in the rents or payments for use and occupancy of the property as determined by such court or judge, including, but not limited to, a posting of such order on the premises in question. A hearing shall be had on such order no later than seventy-two hours after its issuance or the first court day thereafter. The sole purpose of such a hearing shall be to determine whether there is an amount due and owing between the owner, agent, lessor or manager and the municipality. The court shall make a determination of any amount due and owing and any amount so determined shall constitute a lien upon the real property of such owner. A certificate of such amount may be recorded in the land records of the town in which such property is located describing the amount of the lien and the name of the party who owes the taxes. When the amount due and owing has been paid, the municipality shall issue a certificate discharging the lien and shall file the certificate in the land records of the town in which such lien was recorded. The receiver appointed by the court shall collect all rents or payments for use and occupancy forthcoming from the occupants of the building in question in place of the owner, agent, lessor or manager. The receiver shall make payments from such rents or payments for use and occupancy, first for taxes due on and after the date of his appointment and then for electric, gas, telephone, water or heating oil supplied on and after such date. The owner, agent, lessor or manager shall be liable for such reasonable fees and costs determined by the court to be due the receiver, which fees and costs may be recovered from the rents or payments for use and occupancy under the control of the receiver, provided no such fees or costs shall be recovered until after payment for current taxes, electric, gas, telephone and water service and heating oil deliveries has been made. The owner, agent, lessor or manager shall be liable to the petitioner for reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by the petitioner, provided no such fees or costs shall be recovered until after payment for current taxes, electric, gas, telephone and water service and heating oil deliveries has been made and after payments of reasonable fees and costs to the receiver. Any moneys remaining thereafter shall be used to pay the delinquent real property taxes and any money remaining thereafter shall be paid to such parties as the court may direct after notice to the parties with an interest in the rent or payment for use and occupancy of the property and after a hearing. The court may order an accounting to be made at such times as it determines to be just, reasonable and necessary.\n\n(b) Any receivership established pursuant to subsection (a) shall be terminated by the court upon its finding that the tax delinquency which was the subject of the original petition has been satisfied.\n\n(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the petitioner from pursuing any other action or remedy at law or equity that it may have against the owner, agent, lessor or manager.\n\n(d) Any owner, agent, lessor or manager who collects or attempts to collect any rent or payment for use and occupancy from any occupant of a building subject to an order appointing a receiver shall be found, after due notice and hearing, to be in contempt of court.\n\n(e) If a proceeding is initiated pursuant to sections 47a-14a to 47a-14h, inclusive, or sections 47a-56 to 47a-56i, inclusive, or if a receiver of rents is appointed pursuant to chapter 735a or pursuant to any other action involving the making of repairs to real property under court supervision, rent or use and occupancy payments shall be made pursuant to such proceeding or action without regard to whether such proceeding or action is initiated before or after a receivership is established under this section, and such proceeding or action shall take priority over a receivership established under this section in regard to expenditure of such rent or use and occupancy payments.\n\n(f) If a receiver of rents or payments for use and occupancy is appointed pursuant to section 16-262f prior to the date a receivership is established under this section, rent or use and occupancy payments shall be made pursuant to said section 16-262f and the receivership established pursuant to said section 16-262f shall take priority over a receivership established under this section in regard to expenditure of such rent or use and occupancy payments provided the receiver appointed under said section 16-262f gives notice of such appointment to the chief executive official of the municipality where the residential dwelling is located.\n\n(P.A. 95-353, S. 1.)\n\nSection authorizes a receiver to use legal processes to collect rent due prior to the date of the receiver's appointment, but does not authorize a receiver to evict a tenant or enter into a lease with a new tenant; the term “all rents” suggests multiple kinds of sources, type or temporal, of rent, thus authorizing a receiver to collect past and presently due rent in place of the owner. 316 C. 851. A receiver appointed under section is not statutorily authorized to impose or collect rent or use and occupancy payments when the property has been abandoned by the owner prior to the appointment of the receiver and there is no existing obligation for the receiver to enforce. 340 C. 115.\n\nThe court had authority to appoint a receiver but did not have authority to broaden the scope of the receiver's duties under section; the receiver may collect only those rents that are forthcoming on or after the date of the receiver's appointment, not rents allegedly overdue. 145 CA 438; judgment reversed in part, see 316 C. 851. The receiver is mandated to pay only utility bills that are the obligation of the owner, not those incurred by tenants of the subject property. 188 CA 36.",
