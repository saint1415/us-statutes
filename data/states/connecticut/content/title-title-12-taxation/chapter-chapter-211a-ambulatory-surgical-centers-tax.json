(1) to exclude children's general hospitals, effective the later of October 1, 1997, or upon the date of federal approval or federal determination that no approval is required pursuant to Sec. 19a-670a (actual effective date was October 1, 1997); P.A. 99-173 amended Subdiv.

(2) to provide that term “patient care services” included tangible personal property transferred in connection with rendering of such services; legislative history indicated that relevant provisions of act were intended to be clarifying and nonsubstantive, therefore court affirmed applicability of such clarification to pending case determining that tax on hospital's gross earnings applied to charges for tangible personal property used in the course of providing patient care services. 265 C. 511.",
