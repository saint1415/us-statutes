The commissioner shall not require such filing more than once a year, except that the commissioner may require additional filings or additional information to ensure the integrity of legalized gambling. All information gathered by the department under this chapter and section 12-562 may be transmitted by the department to any agency or department of the state and shall be made available for public dissemination or inspection, except that any state or federal tax returns gathered by the department pursuant to this section shall only be open to inspection by the department, its staff and such other state agencies or departments which require return information to perform their official duties.\n\n(c) Failure by any licensee to comply with the requirements of this section shall constitute grounds for the commissioner: (1) To suspend or revoke such license; (2) to impose a fine of not more than two thousand five hundred dollars or, if the licensee is licensed to conduct a meeting or operate an off-track betting system under subsection (a) of section 12-575, to impose a fine of not more than seventy-five thousand dollars; (3) to rescind the applicable contract; or (4) to impose any combination of such penalties.\n\n(d) Failure by any person, business organization or shareholder identified in subsection (b) of this section to comply with the requirements of this section shall constitute grounds for the commissioner: (1) To suspend or revoke such license; (2) to impose a fine of not more than two thousand five hundred dollars on such licensee or, if the licensee is licensed to conduct a meeting or operate an off-track betting system under subsection (a) of section 12-575, a fine of not more than seventy-five thousand dollars on such licensee; or (3) to impose any combination of such penalties. In the case of a shareholder who fails to comply with the requirements of this section, the department shall notify the shareholder and the licensee which issued the shares of such failure. Upon receipt of such notice the shareholder shall immediately offer such shares to the licensee for purchase. The licensee shall purchase the shares not later than sixty days after they are so offered.

(c) and (d) to substitute “commissioner” for references to licensing authority and add provisions re licenses to conduct meeting or operate off-track betting system, and made technical changes, effective July 1, 2013.",
