The property so added shall be assessed at the percentage of the actual valuation thereof, as determined by the assessor or board of assessors in accordance with the provisions of sections 12-63 and 12-71, from the best information the assessor or board of assessors can obtain, and twenty-five per cent of the assessment of such omitted property shall be added thereto.

Each such grand list shall contain the assessed values of all property in the town, reflecting the statutory exemption or exemptions to which each property or property owner is entitled, and including, where applicable, any assessment penalty added in accordance with section 12-41 or 12-57a for the assessment year commencing on the October first immediately preceding. The assessor or board of assessors shall lodge the grand list for public inspection, in the office of the assessor on or before said thirty-first day of January, or on or before the day otherwise specifically provided by law for the completion of such grand list. The town's assessor or board of assessors shall take and subscribe to the oath, pursuant to section 1-25, which shall be certified by the officer administering the same and endorsed upon or attached to such grand list. For the grand list of October 1, 2000, and each grand list thereafter, each assessor or member of a board of assessors who signs the grand list shall be certified in accordance with the provisions of section 12-40a.\n\n(b) Prior to taking and subscribing to the oath upon the grand list, the assessor or board of assessors shall equalize the assessments of property in the town, if necessary, and make any assessment omitted by mistake or required by law. The assessor or board of assessors may increase or decrease the valuation of any property as reflected in the last-preceding grand list, or the valuation as stated in any personal property declaration or report received pursuant to this chapter. In each case of any increase in valuation of a property above the valuation of such property in the last-preceding grand list, or the valuation, if any, stated by the person filing such declaration or report, the assessor or board of assessors shall mail a written notice of assessment increase to the last-known address of the owner of the property the valuation of which has increased. All such notices shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a notice of increase shall not be required in any year with respect to a registered motor vehicle the valuation of which has increased. In the year of a revaluation, the notice of increase sent in accordance with subsection (f) of section 12-62 shall be in lieu of the notice required by this section.\n\n(c) Each notice of assessment increase sent pursuant to this section shall include: (1) The gross valuation, net valuation and any exempt amounts prior to and after such increase; and (2) information describing the manner in which an appeal may be filed with the board of assessment appeals. If a notice of assessment increase affects the value of personal property and the assessor or board of assessors used a methodology to determine such value that differs from the methodology previously used, such notice shall include a statement concerning such change in methodology, which shall indicate the current methodology and the one that the assessor or assessors used for the valuation prior to such increase. Each such notice shall be mailed not earlier than the assessment date and not later than the tenth calendar day immediately following the date on which the assessor or board of assessors signs and attests to the grand list. If any such assessment increase notice is sent later than the time period prescribed in this subsection, such increase shall become effective on the next succeeding grand list.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 1734; 1957, P.A. 324; P.A. 79-149, S. 1, 2; P.A. 87-95, S. 1, 2; 87-245, S. 5, 10; P.A. 95-283, S. 2, 68; P.A. 96-171, S. 4, 16; P.A. 97-68, S. 1, 3; 97-254, S. 5, 6; P.A. 99-189, S. 7, 20; P.A. 03-269, S. 1; P.A. 22-74, S. 9.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 79-149 made notice of increased assessment mandatory at all times, rather than dependent upon request of person in cases where valuation higher than that stated by person filing, and detailed the contents of the notice, effective May 16, 1979, and applicable to the assessment list in any town for 1979 and any assessment list thereafter; P.A. 87-95 added Subsec.

(a) to require assessors who sign grand list of October 1, 2000, and thereafter, to be certified and Subsec. (b) to replace on or before the tenth day with no earlier than the assessment date and no later than the tenth calendar day, effective July 6, 1995; P.A. 96-171 amended Subsec. (a) to add provision requiring the notice to include information describing the manner in which an appeal may be filed with the board of assessment appeals, effective May 31, 1996; P.A. 97-68 amended Subsec. (a) to eliminate the notice under Sec. 12-55 in any year that a notice is sent under Sec. 12-62(f), effective May 27, 1997, and applicable to assessment years commencing on and after October 1, 1997; P.A. 97-254 amended Subsec. (a) to add provision re notice sent in accordance with Sec. 12-62(f) in year of revaluation and deleted “or any improvement thereon” with respect to increase, effective June 27, 1997; P.A. 99-189 amended Subsec. (a) to provide that grand lists be kept in the assessor's office instead of town clerks office and that assessor required to notify taxpayer when methodology changes, effective June 23, 1999, and applicable to assessment years of municipalities commencing on or after October 1, 1999; P.A. 03-269 substantially revised section, deleting former Subsecs. (a) and (b) and adding new Subsecs. (a) to (c), inclusive, re publication of grand lists, changes in property valuation and notices of assessment increases, effective July 1, 2003; P.A. 22-74 amended Subsec. (c)(1) by substituting “gross valuation, net valuation and any exempt amounts prior to” for “valuation prior to”.\n\nSee Sec. 12-117 re extension of time for assessors and boards of tax review to complete their duties.\n\nThe law must be strictly complied with. 7 C. 550; 67 C. 528. Every article on an assessment list must appear to be legally taxable. 10 C. 127; 14 C. 72; 30 C. 394; 39 C. 176; 43 C. 309; 44 C. 477. Omissions and mistakes can be taken advantage of only by those in whose lists they occur. 15 C. 447; 65 C. 456. Agency of a majority of board of assessors necessary to a valid assessment. 18 C. 189. Assessors liable for altering assessment list after lodgment with town clerk. 28 C. 201. Assessment list is not a record. 30 C. 395. Assessors may consult special committee as to valuations, provided they themselves actually determine value. 83 C. 499. Power of assessors to alter lists under section ceases when they are lodged with town clerk. 102 C. 210. List is not best evidence of existence of assessment, but if admitted without objection it may be given such weight as trial court reasonably thinks it deserves. 107 C. 134. Power of assessors exists to alter assessment during lawful period for performance of duties. 108 C. 258. Requirement that assessors be sworn is mandatory; but exact form of oath is merely directory; a substantial compliance is sufficient. 104 C. 583. Legislature may constitutionally validate abstract where assessors were not sworn. Id., 585. Cited. 117 C. 393. Failure to give notices of increase to individual taxpayers does not invalidate the grand list as a whole. 122 C. 228. Cited. Id., 403; 128 C. 649; 136 C. 32. If portion of parcel of land is sold, such portion becomes separate parcel and subsequent valuation of it is an original valuation; therefore no duty to give written notice to owner. 147 C. 262. Since tax assessments are a matter of public record, they are subject to best evidence rule. 171 C. 372. Cited. 179 C. 111; Id., 712; 201 C. 1; 203 C. 425; 210 C. 233; 232 C. 335; 240 C. 422; 241 C. 382. Section cannot be used by taxpayer to compel an interim revaluation of property. 249 C. 63. Sec. 1-217 applies to motor vehicle grand lists promulgated pursuant to section, and grand lists and their component data are subject to redaction in accordance with Sec. 1-217. 301 C. 323. Under 2007 revision, section permits, but does not require, an interim assessment to equalize the grand list, while Sec. 12-53a, revised to 2007, mandates assessment of “completed” new construction within 90 days. 309 C. 85.\n\nCited. 3 CA 393. Statute authorizes but does not compel municipal tax assessor to conduct interim revaluations of property to achieve a fair and equal assessment for all taxpayers; thus, assessor may increase real property assessment between decennial revaluations when a sale of property in question demonstrates that the property has greatly increased in value in relation to other properties in the municipality. 70 CA 442. Subsec. (b): The imposition of the late filing penalties constitutes an assessment required by law under Subsec. and, as such, it was required to be made by the assessor prior to taking and subscribing the oath upon the grand list; tax assessor improperly added late filing penalties pursuant to Sec. 12-63(b) against property owners 3 months after taking and subscribing to the oath on the grand list. 191 CA 712; judgment affirmed, see 339 C. 157.\n\nDoes not limit public inspection to completed grand lists. 32 CS 583. Imposes only an affirmative duty to make completed grand lists available for public inspection and is not inconsistent with Secs. 1-19 and 1-20. Id., 590.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\nPenalty under Sec. 12-63c(d) is an “assessment… required by law” within the meaning of Subsec., and as Sec. 12-63c(d) contains no express extension of assessor's statutory authority, the deadline for imposing penalties under Sec. 12-63c(d) must be the deadline articulated in Subsec., i.e. imposed before assessor signs grand list for applicable assessment year. 339 C. 157.",

The town shall use assessments derived from each such revaluation for the purpose of levying property taxes for the assessment year in which such revaluation is effective and for each assessment year that follows until the ensuing revaluation becomes effective.\n\n(B) Commencing October 1, 2023, (i) each town shall implement a revaluation not later than the first day of October that follows, by five years, an October first assessment date set in accordance with a revaluation date schedule prescribed by the secretary for each revaluation zone, (ii) any town's required revaluation subsequent to any delayed revaluation implemented pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this subdivision shall be implemented in accordance with this section, and (iii) any such revaluation subsequent to any delayed revaluation or revaluation implemented prior to such scheduled date shall recommence on the date set in such revaluation date schedule prescribed for the revaluation zone in which such town is located, which revaluation date schedule applied to such town prior to such delay or scheduled date. The town shall use assessments derived from each such revaluation for the purpose of levying property taxes for the assessment year in which such revaluation is effective and for each assessment year that follows until the ensuing revaluation becomes effective.\n\n(2) When conducting a revaluation, an assessor shall use generally accepted mass appraisal methods which may include, but need not be limited to, the market sales comparison approach to value, the cost approach to value and the income approach to value. Prior to the completion of each revaluation, the assessor shall conduct a field review. Except in a town that has a single assessor, the members of the board of assessors shall approve, by majority vote, all valuations established for a revaluation.\n\n(3) An assessor, member of an assessor's staff or person designated by an assessor may, at any time, fully inspect any parcel of improved real property in order to ascertain or verify the accuracy of data listed on the assessor's property record for such parcel. Except as provided in subdivision (4) of this subsection, the assessor shall fully inspect each such parcel once in every ten assessment years, provided, if the full inspection of any such parcel occurred in an assessment year preceding that commencing October 1, 1996, the assessor shall fully inspect such parcel not later than the first day of October of 2009, and shall thereafter fully inspect such parcel in accordance with this section. Nothing in this subsection shall require the assessor to fully inspect all of a town's improved real property parcels in the same assessment year and in no case shall an assessor be required to fully inspect any such parcel more than once during every ten assessment years.\n\n(4) An assessor may, at any time during the period in which a full inspection of each improved parcel of real property is required, send a questionnaire to the owner of such parcel to (A) obtain information concerning the property's acquisition, and (B) obtain verification of the accuracy of data listed on the assessor's property record for such parcel. An assessor shall develop and institute a quality assurance program with respect to responses received to such questionnaires. If satisfied with the results of said program concerning such questionnaires, the assessor may fully inspect only those parcels of improved real property for which satisfactory verification of data listed on the assessor's property record has not been obtained and is otherwise unavailable. The full inspection requirement in subdivision (3) of this subsection shall not apply to any parcel of improved real property for which the assessor obtains satisfactory verification of data listed on the assessor's property record.\n\n(c) The following shall be available for public inspection in the assessor's office, in the manner provided for access to public records in subsection (a) of section 1-210, not later than the date written notices of real property valuations are mailed in accordance with subsection (f) of this section: (1) Any criteria, guidelines, price schedules or statement of procedures used in such revaluation by the assessor or by any revaluation company that the assessor designates to perform mass appraisal or field review functions, all of which shall continue to be available for public inspection until the town's next revaluation becomes effective; and (2) a compilation of all real property sales in each neighborhood for the twelve months preceding the date on which each revaluation is effective, the selling prices of which are representative of the fair market values of the properties sold, which compilation shall continue to be available for public inspection for a period of not less than twelve months immediately following a revaluation's effective date. If the assessor changes any property valuation as determined by the revaluation company, the assessor shall document, in writing, the reason for such change and shall append such written explanation to the property card for the real estate parcel whose revaluation was changed. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit the assessor to post a plan or drawing of a dwelling unit of a residential property's interior on the Internet or to otherwise publish such plan or drawing.\n\n(d) (1) The chief executive officer of a town shall notify the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management that the town is effecting a revaluation by sending a written notice to the secretary not later than thirty days after the date on which such town's assessor signs a grand list that reflects assessments of real property derived from a revaluation. Any town that fails to effect a revaluation for the assessment date required by this section shall be subject to a penalty effective for the fiscal year commencing on the first day of July following such assessment date, and continuing for each successive fiscal year in which the town fails to levy taxes on the basis of such revaluation, provided the secretary shall not impose such penalty with respect to any assessment year in which the provisions of subsection (b) of section 12-117 are applicable. Such penalty shall be the forfeit of the amount otherwise allocable to such town pursuant to section 7-536, and the loss of fifty per cent of the amount of the grant that is payable to such town pursuant to sections 3-55i, 3-55j and 3-55k. Upon imposing said penalty, the secretary shall notify the chief executive officer of the amount of the town's forfeiture for said fiscal year and that the secretary's certification to the State Comptroller for the payments of such grant in said year shall reflect the required reduction.\n\n(2) The secretary may waive such penalty if, in the secretary's opinion, there appears to be reasonable cause for the town not having implemented a revaluation for the required assessment date, provided the chief executive officer of the town submits a written request for such waiver. Reasonable cause shall include: (A) An extraordinary circumstance or an act of God, (B) the failure on the part of any revaluation company to complete its contractual duties in a time and manner allowing for the implementation of such revaluation, and provided the town imposed the sanctions for such failure provided in a contract executed with said company, (C) the assessor's death or incapacitation during the conduct of a revaluation, which results in a delay of its implementation, or (D) an order by the superior court for the judicial district in which the town is located postponing such revaluation, or the potential for such an order with respect to a proceeding brought before said court. The chief executive officer shall submit such written request to the secretary not earlier than thirty business days after the date on which the assessor signs a grand list that does not reflect real property assessments based on values established for such required revaluation, and not later than thirty days preceding the July first commencement date of the fiscal year in which said penalty is applicable. Such request shall include the reason for the failure of the town to comply with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section. The chief executive officer of such town shall promptly provide any additional information regarding such failure that the secretary may require. Not later than sixty days after receiving such request and any such additional information, the secretary shall notify the chief executive officer of the secretary's decision to grant or deny the waiver requested, provided the secretary may delay a decision regarding a waiver related to a potential court order until not later than sixty days after the date such court renders the decision. The secretary shall not grant a penalty waiver under the provisions of this subsection with respect to consecutive years unless the General Assembly approves such action.\n\n(e) When conducting a revaluation, an assessor may designate a revaluation company certified in accordance with section 12-2b to perform parcel data collection, analysis of such data and any mass appraisal valuation or field review functions, pursuant to a method or methods the assessor approves, and may require such company to prepare and mail the valuation notices required by subsection (f) of this section, provided nothing in this subsection shall relieve any assessor of any other requirement relating to such revaluation imposed by any provisions of the general statutes, any public or special act, the provisions of any municipal charter that are not inconsistent with the requirements of this section, or any regulations adopted pursuant to subsection (g) of this section.\n\n(f) Not earlier than the assessment date that is the effective date of a revaluation and not later than the tenth calendar day immediately following the date on which the grand list for said assessment date is signed, the assessor shall mail a written notice to the last-known address of the owner of each parcel of real property that was revalued. Such notice shall include the valuation of such parcel as of said assessment date and the valuation of such parcel in the last-preceding assessment year, and shall provide information describing the property owner's rights to appeal the valuation established for said assessment date, including the manner in which an appeal may be filed with the board of assessment appeals.\n\n(g) The secretary shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, which an assessor shall use when conducting a revaluation. Such regulations shall include (1) provisions governing the management of the revaluation process, including, but not limited to, the method of compiling and maintaining property records, documenting the assessment year during which a full inspection of each parcel of improved real property occurs, and the method of determining real property sales data in support of the mass appraisal process, and (2) provisions establishing criteria for measuring the level and uniformity of assessments generated from a revaluation, provided such criteria shall be applicable to different classes of real property with respect to which a sufficient number of property sales exist. Certification of compliance with not less than one of said regulatory provisions shall be required for each revaluation and the assessor shall, not later than the date on which the grand list reflecting assessments of real property derived from a revaluation is signed, certify to the secretary and the chief executive officer, in writing, that the revaluation was conducted in accordance with said regulatory requirement. Any town effecting a revaluation with respect to which an assessor is unable to certify such compliance shall be subject to the penalty provided in subsection (d) of this section. In the event the assessor designates a revaluation company to perform mass appraisal valuation or field review functions with respect to a revaluation, the assessor and the employee of said company responsible for such function or functions shall jointly sign such certification. The assessor shall retain a copy of such certification and any data in support thereof in the assessor's office. The provisions of subsection (c) of this section concerning the public inspection of criteria, guidelines, price schedules or statement of procedures used in a revaluation shall be applicable to such certification and supporting data.\n\n(h) This section shall require the revaluation of real property (1) designated within the 1983 Settlement boundary and taken into trust by the federal government for the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation before June 8, 1999, or (2) taken into trust by the federal government for the Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut.\n\n(i) Each assessor shall file with the secretary parcel data from each revaluation implemented pursuant to this section upon forms prescribed and furnished by the secretary, which forms shall be so prescribed and furnished not later than thirty days prior to the date set by such secretary for such filing.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 1737; 1949, 1951, S. 1046d; P.A. 74-253; P.A. 79-28, S. 1, 2; 79-485; P.A. 89-251, S. 190, 203; P.A. 91-296, S. 1, 5; P.A. 92-197, S. 1, 3; 92-221, S. 1, 3; P.A. 93-373; P.A. 95-283, S. 3, 68; P.A. 96-171, S. 5–7, 16; 96-218, S. 1, 5, 6; P.A. 97-68, S. 2, 3; 97-254, S. 1, 6; P.A. 98-242, S. 4, 9; P.A. 99-108, S. 1, 2; 99-189, S. 18, 20; P.A. 00-229, S. 3, 7; P.A. 02-49, S. 1, 2; May Sp.

      "text": "(a)(1) A town implementing a revaluation of all real property may phase in a real property assessment increase, or a portion of such increase resulting from such revaluation, by requiring the assessor to gradually increase the assessment or the rate of assessment applicable to such property in the assessment year preceding that in which the revaluation is implemented, in accordance with one of the methods set forth in subsection (b) of this section. The legislative body of the town shall approve the decision to provide for such phase-in, the method by which it is accomplished and its term, provided the number of assessment years over which such gradual increases are reflected shall not exceed five assessment years, including the assessment year for which the revaluation is effective. If a town chooses to phase in a portion of the increase in the assessment of each parcel of real property resulting from said revaluation, said legislative body shall establish a factor, which shall be not less than twenty-five per cent in any assessment year commencing prior to October 1, 2024, or twenty per cent in any assessment year commencing on or after October 1, 2024, and shall apply such factor to such increases for all parcels of real property, regardless of property classification. A town choosing to phase in a portion of assessment increase shall multiply such factor by the total assessment increase for each such parcel to determine the amount of such increase that shall not be subject to the phase-in. The assessment increase for each parcel that shall be subject to the gradual increases in amounts or rates of assessment, as provided in subsection (b) of this section, shall be (A) the difference between the result of said multiplication and the total assessment increase for any such parcel, or (B) the result derived when such factor is subtracted from the actual percentage by which the assessment of each such parcel increased as a result of such revaluation, over the assessment of such parcel in the preceding assessment year and said result is multiplied by such parcel's total assessment increase.\n\n(2) The legislative body may approve the discontinuance of a phase-in of real property assessment increases resulting from the implementation of a revaluation, at any time prior to the completion of the phase-in term originally approved, provided such approval shall be made on or before the assessment date that is the commencement of the assessment year in which such discontinuance is effective. In the assessment year following the completion or discontinuance of the phase-in, assessments shall reflect the valuation of real property established for such revaluation, subject to additions for new construction and reductions for demolitions occurring subsequent to the date of revaluation and on or prior to the date of its completion or discontinuance, and the rate of assessment applicable in such year, as required by section 12-62a.\n\n(b) A town shall use one of the following methods to determine the phase-in of real property assessment increases or the phase-in of a portion of such increases resulting from the implementation of a revaluation:\n\n(1) The assessment of each parcel of real property for the assessment year preceding that in which such revaluation is effective shall be subtracted from the assessment of each such parcel in the effective year of said revaluation, and the annual amount of incremental assessment increase for each such parcel shall be the total of such subtraction divided by the number of years of the phase-in term, provided if a town chooses to phase in a portion of the assessment increase for each real property parcel, the amount of such increase that is not subject to the phase-in shall not be reflected in said calculation; or\n\n(2) The ratio of the total assessed value of all taxable real property for the assessment year preceding that in which a revaluation is effective and the total fair market value of such property as determined from records of actual sales in said year, shall be subtracted from the rate of assessment set forth in section 12-62a, and the annual incremental rate of assessment increase applicable to all parcels of real property shall be the result of such subtraction divided by the number of years of the phase-in term. Prior to determining such annual incremental rate of assessment increase, a town that chooses to phase in a portion of the assessment increase for each real property parcel shall multiply the result of said subtraction by the factor established in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, to determine the rate of assessment that shall not be subject to such phase-in; or\n\n(3) The ratio of the total assessed value of all taxable real property in each of the following property classes for the assessment year preceding that in which a revaluation is effective and the total fair market value of such property in each class as determined from records of actual sales in said year, shall be subtracted from the rate of assessment set forth in section 12-62a, and the annual incremental rate of assessment increase applicable to all parcels of real property in each such class shall be the result of such subtraction divided by the number of years of the phase-in term, where such property classes are: (A) Residential property; (B) commercial property, including apartments containing five or more dwelling units, industrial property and public utility property; and (C) vacant land. In the event the assessor determines that there are no records of actual sales of real property in any such property class in said year or that the number of such actual sales is insufficient for purposes of determining a rate of increase under this subdivision, the annual incremental rate of assessment increase determined under subdivision (2) of this subsection shall be used for said property class.\n\n(c) The assessment of any new construction that first becomes subject to taxation pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 12-53a during an assessment year encompassed within the term of a phase-in shall be determined in the same manner as the assessment of all other comparable real property in said assessment year, such that the total of incremental increases applicable to such other comparable real property are reflected in the assessment of such new construction prior to the proration of such assessment pursuant to section 12-53a.\n\n(d) Not later than thirty business days after the date a town's legislative body votes to phase in real property assessment increases resulting from such revaluation, or votes to discontinue such a phase-in, the chief executive officer of the town shall notify the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, in writing, of the action taken.

If such property or any portion thereof is leased to any organization which, if the property were owned by or held in trust for such organization, would not be liable for taxes with respect to such property under any of the subdivisions of section 12-81, such organization shall be entitled to exemption from property taxes as the lessee under such lease, provided such property is used exclusively for the purposes of such organization as stated in the applicable subdivision of section 12-81 and the portion of such property so leased to such exempt organization shall be eligible for a grant in lieu of taxes pursuant to section 12-18b. Whenever the lessee of such property is required to pay property taxes to the town in which such property is situated as provided in this subsection, the assessed valuation of such property subject to the interest of the lessee shall not be included in the annual list of assessed values of state-owned real property in such town as prepared for purposes of state grants in accordance with section 12-18b and the amount of grant to such town under section 12-18b shall be determined without consideration of such assessed value.\n\n(c) The provisions of subsection (b) of this section shall not be applicable to (1) any land, building or easement belonging to or held in trust for the state of Connecticut or the Connecticut Airport Authority at Bradley International Airport or any general aviation airport or other airport, as such terms are defined in section 15-120aa, and (2) any restaurant, gasoline station or other service facility or public convenience as may be deemed appropriate by the Commissioner of Transportation for state highway, mass transit, marine or aviation purposes. In the event a lessee of property, belonging to or held in trust for the state or a constituent unit of the state system of higher education, who is subject to taxation pursuant to the provisions of this subsection or pursuant to subsection (g) of section 4b-38 is delinquent in the payment of such tax, a municipal tax collector may enforce the collection of said tax by all legal means available, except for the filing of a lien on such property.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 1738; 1957, P.A. 673, S. 6; 1961, P.A. 347; 1967, P.A. 829; 1969, P.A. 139, S. 1; P.A. 75-321, S. 1, 2; P.A. 81-58, S. 2, 4; P.A. 85-448, S. 1, 2; P.A. 93-64, S. 1, 2; P.A. 97-282, S. 3, 6; P.A. 03-269, S. 2; P.A. 12-157, S. 3; P.A. 13-277, S. 61; P.A. 14-122, S. 87; P.A. 15-244, S. 191.)\n\nHistory: 1961 act added “agricultural lands” to list; 1967 act added provisions re assessments of easements to use air space; 1969 act added provision re assessment and taxation of land, buildings and easements within highway rights-of-way leased by state to nonexempt lessees; P.A. 75-321 added provisions re separate assessment of structures and improvements erected by lessee; P.A. 81-58 made provisions of section applicable to a lessee applicable also in the case of a sublessee, effective April 28, 1981, and applicable in any municipality to the assessment year commencing October 1, 1981, and each assessment year thereafter; P.A. 85-448 deleted provision in Subsec.

Each such taxpayer shall also submit such list to each municipality in which such taxpayer owns property, provided the list submitted to a municipality shall contain only the personal property owned by such taxpayer that is located in, or allocated pursuant to this subsection to, such municipality. If the records of a taxpayer subject to the requirements of this subsection do not contain the data necessary to develop the list as required without undue cost, the taxpayer may, for purposes of requirements under this subsection, petition the Commissioner of Revenue Services for approval of an alternate method of determining the value of the plant used solely and exclusively to render telecommunications services, but not including central office or switching equipment of that taxpayer, located in each town in the state. If the commissioner finds that the alternative method proposed results in a reasonable approximation of the value of the property of the taxpayer located in each town and used solely and exclusively for rendering telecommunications service, the commissioner shall notify the taxpayer that the proposed alternate method is acceptable and the taxpayer shall be permitted to use the alternate method in developing the list required under this subsection.\n\n(b) (1) Not later than the first day of February immediately following the end of such tax year, the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management shall determine, with respect to such company, a value for personal property equivalent to seventy per cent of the value of personal property included in the list of such property prepared and certified in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.

The total taxes levied by the town and all cities or boroughs located within such town shall be added together, and the sum shall be the denominator of the fraction. Any such city or borough may, by vote of its legislative body, direct the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management to reallocate all or a portion of the share of such city or borough to the town in which it is located.\n\n(2) The person responsible for the collection of taxes for each town, city or borough owed taxes under this subsection may, at such time as such tax becomes delinquent as provided in sections 12-146 and 12-169, subject such tax to interest at the rate of one and one-half per cent of such tax for each month or fraction thereof which elapses from the time when such tax becomes due and payable until the same is paid.\n\n(c) With respect to tangible personal property included in the list of such property submitted to the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management as provided in subsection (a) of this section, any taxpayer subject to the tax imposed under this section for any tax year shall not be subject to property tax in any town applicable to such personal property for the assessment year in such town commencing on the first day of October immediately preceding the date on which the tax determined with respect to such property in accordance with this section becomes due and payable.\n\n(d) Any taxpayer that, on or after January 1, 1990, is subject to tax under chapter 219 for rendering telecommunications service but that, prior to January 1, 1990, was not subject to tax under chapter 211 for rendering telecommunications service may elect to have personal property taxed in the manner specified in this section. Such election shall be made in writing and filed with the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and a copy thereof shall be filed with the assessor of each town in which personal property affected by such election is located.

Surviving spouse's rights.

Such citation shall be signed by the same authority and such appeal shall be returnable at the same time and served and returned in the same manner as is required in case of a summons in a civil action.

Such appraisal shall be completed by an individual or a company licensed to perform real estate appraisals in the state. The court may extend the one-hundred-twenty-day period for good cause.

Allegations of certain violations of public policy, such as a person's entering into an invalid contract or unauthorized practice of law, do not bar the person from a property tax appeal. 253 C. 255. Trial court rejected plaintiff's appeal of assessment for lack of credible evidence to establish aggrievement, and not because the going concern income capitalization approach to valuation is not permitted or recognized. 308 C. 87. Issue of city's wrongdoing is a proper consideration in property tax appeal pursuant to section; evidence of wrongdoing is not irrelevant as a matter of law as to the issue of an award of interest. 320 C. 332. Plaintiff property owner and taxpayer aggrieved by decision of the board of assessment appeals, but who was not a party to the proceedings before the board, has standing under section to bring an appeal to the trial court.

Sec. 22a-45 does not limit property owner's remedy pursuant to this section. 80 CA 630. Plaintiff may not limit parameters of the court's valuation determination by challenging only one portion of the assessment because court determinations under section are de novo and court must arrive at its own conclusions by weighing all the evidence regardless of any alleged judicial admission as to scope of review; defendant town is not required to file a special defense under section; plaintiff who attempted to limit court's review to only one portion of an assessment was not deprived of due process when entire assessment was reviewed because Connecticut law has consistently held that trial court exercises de novo review. 84 CA 473. Statute allows taxpayer to challenge an illegal assessment outside prior statutorily mandated revaluation period and such appeal does not constitute impermissible request for interim revaluation. 85 CA 480.

Such application may be made within one year from the date as of which the property was last evaluated for purposes of taxation and shall be served and returned in the same manner as is required in the case of a summons in a civil action, and the pendency of such application shall not suspend action upon the tax against the applicant. In all such actions, the Superior Court shall have power to grant such relief upon such terms and in such manner and form as to justice and equity appertains, and costs may be taxed at the discretion of the court. If such assessment is reduced by said court, the applicant shall be reimbursed by the town or city for any overpayment of taxes in accordance with the judgment of said court.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 1801; February, 1965, P.A. 65, S. 3; P.A. 76-436, S. 306, 681; P.A. 78-280, S. 1, 127; P.A. 81-472, S. 126, 159.)\n\nHistory: 1965 act allowed applications for relief by lessees who, according to terms of lease, are responsible for property tax payments; P.A. 76-436 substituted superior court for court of common pleas and included reference to judicial districts, effective July 1, 1978; P.A. 78-280 deleted reference to counties; P.A. 81-472 made technical changes.\n\nCodifies common law rule; applies to unpaid taxes existing at time of passage even though time to appeal from doings of board had expired. 101 C. 390, 392. Methods of valuation. 122 C. 230. In action against him to collect tax, taxpayer cannot contest valuation; must seek relief under this section or Sec. 12-111 et seq. 123 C. 548. “Laid” means “imposed”. 124 C. 407. Section is for relief against illegal tax; procedure differs from appeal to board of tax review which is designed to act directly on valuations on grand list. 128 C. 649. What constitutes “manifestly excessive”; cannot enjoin assessors from raising assessment in future. Id., 674. Mere fact of overvaluation is not ground for relief under section; it is intended to take place of remedy in equity for illegal overvaluation and precludes resort to equity generally. 130 C. 703. Under section, function of court not limited to determining whether assessors acted illegally, arbitrarily or in abuse of discretion; statute designed to meet situations where there was misfeasance or nonfeasance, or assessment was arbitrary or so excessive or discriminatory as to show disregard for duty. 131 C. 273. Cited. 133 C. 22. “Owner” does not mean only owner on assessment date; possibility that he might become unduly enriched does not preclude right to test validity of assessment. Id., 238.

Burden of proof on question whether property acquires tax situs within certain town is on plaintiff. Id., 308. Cited. 165 C. 211. The 1-year limitation on application to the Court of Common Pleas is procedural and may be waived by the town's failing to plead it. 167 C. 509. Cited. 168 C. 514. Judgment of assessor, not his employee, is focus of section; section does not remedy dispute over credibility of conflicting expert testimony. 169 C. 663. Cited. 170 C. 67; Id., 477. Whether or not the taxpayer was required to claim his exemption before the assessor under Sec. 12-89 would have no evidential significance in the proceeding under this statute; burden of proving the exemption is on the taxpayer. 192 C. 434.

Subsequent title holder has no greater rights to challenge prior assessment than were possessed by its immediate assignor or by any prior assignee from the owner of a property at the time of assessment. 249 C. 1. Trial court's finding that floating docks and finger piers were fixtures and thus taxable property affirmed; determination re fixtures is a finding of fact and will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous. 253 C. 371. Section does not apply to a claim for reimbursement of property taxes paid by a charitable organization pursuant to Sec. 12-81b and Sec. 18-20 of the Danbury Code. Id., 531. Statute does not authorize a challenge to imposition of a conveyance tax; rather, statute clearly relates to taxes “laid on property”. 260 C. 406. Claims that an assessor has misclassified property and, consequently, overvalued it, comprise a category of appeals frequently pursued under section; trial court's determination that assessor had illegally removed property's open space classification necessarily incorporated implicit finding that resultant assessment was manifestly excessive. 289 C. 723. Plaintiff failed to establish that town assessor's reliance on hypothetical condition in reaching valuation was illegal, and therefore cannot prevail on its claim of misfeasance or malfeasance of assessor's duty resulting in overvaluation of property. 308 C. 87.\n\nCited. 6 CA 330; 7 CA 496; 15 CA 513; Id., 752; 21 CA 275; 26 CA 545; 35 CA 269; 40 CA 64; 43 CA 169; 44 CA 494; Id., 517. Statute applies to owners of easements including flowage rights. 53 CA 142. Declaratory judgment action predicated on section is subject to section's 1-year statute of limitations. 54 CA 284. Statute allows taxpayer to challenge illegal assessment outside prior statutorily mandated revaluation period and such appeal does not constitute impermissible request for interim revaluation. 85 CA 480. Section creates cause of action for taxpayer aggrieved by excessive and wrongful valuation of property, but there is no private right of action for taxpayer against municipal officials in individual capacities for alleged wrongdoing in tax assessment of property not owned or leased by or directly connected to taxpayer. 119 CA 453. Defendant's counterclaim re stipulated agreement with city was improper as defendant should have sought to enforce its right to an exemption in a statutory action under section. 140 CA 663. Statute is not ambiguous, plain meaning of “the date as of which the property was last evaluated for purposes of taxation” means the assessment date of October first. 168 CA 703. The one year limitation is not subject to a balancing of equities and the remedy provided by the section takes the place of the remedy in equity. Id. Common law unjust enrichment claim unavailable to plaintiff whose property was overtaxed for 25 years as claims are time limited under statutory scheme whether excess taxes are paid due to clerical errors, improper property valuations, or “manifestly excessive'' assessments. 211 CA 441.\n\nFair and actual value is not to be found at depression's bottom nor at prosperity's top. 4 CS 69. Superior Court will not inquire into an assessment in an action to collect unpaid taxes. Id., 391. Assessment is the total of all the taxable items and it does not follow that it is “manifestly excessive” because a single item is overvalued. 5 CS 467. Cited. 8 CS 540. Voluntary payment during pendency of application for relief does not preclude right to refund for excess. Id., 295. Relief from assessment not precluded by payment made before application filed. 9 CS 524. Valuation other than “true and actual” is illegal. 11 CS 480. Remedy different than that under Sec. 12-118; it is directed against the collection of an illegal tax. 12 CS 382. Declaratory judgment is one of the other “remedies”. 14 CS 119. Equitable remedy for overvaluation in assessment is precluded. 16 CS 48. Taxpayer claiming to be aggrieved by assessment of tax under Sec. 12-58 may seek relief as provided by this section or Sec. 12-118 or may pay the tax, under proper protest, and sue to recover such money as was illegally paid. He may not, in an action to collect the tax, contest the valuation placed on his property. 25 CS 467. Cited. 32 CS 82. Discussed. Id., 139. Cited. 39 CS 142; 43 CS 297.",

      "text": "(a) As used in this section:\n\n(1) “Claimant” means a person, company, limited liability company, firm, association, corporation or other business entity having received approval for financial assistance from a town's assessor or a municipal official;\n\n(2) “Financial assistance” means a property tax exemption, property tax credit or rental rebate for which the state of Connecticut provides direct or indirect reimbursement; and\n\n(3) “Program” means (A) property tax exemptions under section 12-81g or subdivision (55), (59), (60) or (70) of section 12-81, (B) tax relief pursuant to section 12-129d or 12-170aa, and (C) grants under section 12-170d.\n\n(b) A claimant negatively affected by a decision of the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management with respect to any program may appeal such decision in the manner set forth in subsection (d) of this section. Any notice the secretary issues pursuant to this section shall be sent by first class United States mail to a claimant at the address entered on the application for financial assistance as filed unless, subsequent to the date of said filing, the claimant sends the secretary a written request that any correspondence regarding said financial assistance be sent to another name or address. The date of any notice sent by the secretary pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be the date the notice is delivered to the claimant.\n\n(c) The secretary may review any application for financial assistance submitted by a claimant in conjunction with a program. The secretary may exclude from reimbursement any property included in an application that, in the secretary's judgment, does not qualify for financial assistance or may modify the amount of any financial assistance approved by an assessor or municipal official in the event the secretary finds it to be mathematically incorrect, not supported by the application, not in conformance with law or if the secretary believes that additional information is needed to justify its approval.\n\n(d) (1) If the secretary modifies the amount of financial assistance approved by an assessor or municipal official under a program, or makes a preliminary determination that the claimant who filed written application for such financial assistance is ineligible therefor, the secretary shall send a written notice of preliminary modification or denial to said claimant and shall concurrently forward a copy to the office of the assessor or municipal official who approved said financial assistance. The notice shall include plain language setting forth the reason for the preliminary modification or denial, the name and telephone number of a member of the secretary's staff to whom questions regarding the notice may be addressed, a request for any additional information or documentation that the secretary believes is needed in order to justify the approval of such financial assistance, the manner by which the claimant may request reconsideration of the secretary's preliminary determination and the time frame for doing so. Not later than ninety days after the date an assessor receives a copy of such preliminary notice, the assessor shall determine whether an increase to the taxable grand list of the town is required to be made as a result of such modification or denial, unless, in the interim, the assessor has received written notification from the secretary that a request for a hearing with respect to such financial assistance has been approved pursuant to subparagraph (B) of subdivision (2) of this subsection. If an assessment increase is warranted, the assessor shall promptly issue a certificate of correction adding the value of such property to the taxable grand list for the appropriate assessment year and shall forward a copy thereof to the tax collector, who shall, not later than thirty days following, issue a bill for the amount of the additional tax due as a result of such increase. Such additional tax shall become due and payable not later than thirty days from the date such bill is sent and shall be subject to interest for delinquent taxes as provided in section 12-146. With respect to the preliminary modification or denial of financial assistance for which a hearing is held, the assessor shall not issue a certificate of correction until the assessor receives written notice of the secretary's final determination following such hearing.\n\n(2) (A) Any claimant aggrieved by the secretary's notice of preliminary modification or denial of financial assistance under a program may, not later than thirty business days after receiving said notice, request a reconsideration of the secretary's decision for any factual reason, provided the claimant states the reason for the reconsideration request in writing and concurrently provides any additional information or documentation that the secretary may have requested in the preliminary notice of modification or denial. The secretary may grant an extension of the date by which a claimant's additional information or documentation must be submitted, upon receipt of proof that the claimant has requested such data from another governmental agency or if the secretary determines there is good cause for doing so.\n\n(B) Not later than thirty business days after receiving a claimant's request for reconsideration and any additional information or documentation the claimant has provided, the secretary shall reconsider the preliminary decision to modify or deny said financial assistance and shall send the claimant a written notice of the secretary's determination regarding such reconsideration. If aggrieved by the secretary's notice of determination with respect to the reconsideration of said financial assistance, the claimant may, not later than thirty business days after receiving said notice, make application for a hearing before said secretary, or the secretary's designee. Such application shall be in writing and shall set forth the reason why the financial assistance in question should not be modified or denied. Not later than thirty business days after receiving an application for a hearing, the secretary shall grant or deny such hearing request by written notice to the claimant. If the secretary denies the claimant's request for a hearing, such notice shall state the reason for said denial. If the secretary grants the claimant's request for a hearing, the secretary shall send written notice of the date, time and place of the hearing, which shall be held not later than thirty business days after the date of the secretary's notice granting the claimant a hearing. Such hearing may, at the secretary's discretion, be held in the judicial district in which the claimant or the claimant's property is located. Not later than thirty business days after the date on which a hearing is held, a written notice of the secretary's determination with respect to such hearing shall be sent to the claimant and a copy thereof shall be concurrently sent to the assessor or municipal official who approved the financial assistance in question.\n\n(3) If any claimant is aggrieved by the secretary's determination concerning the hearing regarding the claimant's financial assistance or the secretary's decision not to hold a hearing, such claimant may, not later than thirty business days after receiving the secretary's notice related thereto, appeal to the superior court of the judicial district in which the claimant resides or in which the claimant's property that is the subject of the appeal is located. Such appeal shall be accompanied by a citation to the secretary to appear before said court, and shall be served and returned in the same manner as is required in the case of a summons in a civil action. The pendency of such appeal shall not suspend any action by a municipality to collect property taxes from the applicant on the property that is the subject of the appeal. The authority issuing the citation shall take from the applicant a bond or recognizance to the state of Connecticut, with surety, to prosecute the application in effect and to comply with the orders and decrees of the court in the premises. Such applications shall be preferred cases, to be heard, unless cause appears to the contrary, at the first session, by the court or by a committee appointed by the court. Said court may grant such relief as may be equitable and, if the application is without probable cause, may tax double or triple costs, as the case demands; and, upon all applications which are denied, costs may be taxed against the applicant at the discretion of the court, but no costs shall be taxed against the state.\n\n(4) The secretary shall notify each claimant of the final modification or denial of financial assistance as claimed, in accordance with the procedure set forth in this subsection. A copy of the notice of final modification or denial shall be sent concurrently to the assessor or municipal official who approved such financial assistance. With respect to property tax exemptions under section 12-81g or subdivision (55), (59), (60) or (70) of section 12-81, and tax relief pursuant to section 12-129d or 12-170aa, the notice pursuant to this subdivision shall be sent not later than one year after the date claims for financial assistance for each such program are filed with the secretary. For grants under section 12-170d, such notice shall be sent not later than the date by which the secretary certifies the amounts of payment to the Comptroller.\n\n(June Sp. Sess.
