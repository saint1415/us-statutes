Any such credit shall be calculated in a manner consistent with the provisions of section 12-704.\n\n(g) Upon the failure of any affected business entity to pay the tax due under this section within thirty days of the due date, the provisions of section 12-35 shall apply with respect to the enforcement of this section and the collection of such tax. The warrant therein provided for shall be signed by the commissioner or an authorized agent of the commissioner. The amount of any such tax, penalty and interest shall be a lien, from the last day of the last month of the taxable year next preceding the due date of such tax until discharged by payment, against all real estate of the taxpayer within the state, and a certificate of such lien signed by the commissioner may be recorded in the office of the clerk of any town in which such real estate is situated, provided no such lien shall be effective as against any bona fide purchaser or qualified encumbrancer of any interest in any such property.

Any action for the foreclosure of such lien shall be brought by the Attorney General in the name of the state in the superior court for the judicial district in which the property subject to such lien is situated, or, if such property is located in two or more judicial districts, in the superior court for any one such judicial district, and the court may limit the time for redemption or order the sale of such property or make such other or further decree as it judges equitable.\n\n(h) If any tax is not paid when due as provided in this section, there shall be added to the amount of the tax interest at the rate of one per cent per month or fraction thereof from the date the tax became due until it is paid.\n\n(i) The provisions of sections 12-723, 12-725 and 12-728 to 12-737, inclusive, shall apply to the provisions of this section in the same manner and with the same force and effect as if the language of said sections had been incorporated in full into this section and had expressly referred to the tax under this section, except to the extent that any such provision is inconsistent with a provision of this section.\n\n(P.A. 18-49, S. 1; P.A. 19-117, S. 333; 19-186, S. 1; P.A. 22-117, S. 15; P.A. 23-204, S. 360.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 18-49 effective May 31, 2018, and applicable to taxable years commencing on or after January 1, 2018; P.A. 19-117 amended Subsec.
