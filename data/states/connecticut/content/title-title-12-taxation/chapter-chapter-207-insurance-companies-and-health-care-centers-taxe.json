No taxpayer shall be subject to more than one penalty under this section in relation to the same tax period.\n\n(3) Not later than thirty days after the mailing of such notice, the taxpayer shall pay to the commissioner, in cash or by check, draft or money order drawn to the order of the Commissioner of Revenue Services, any additional amount of tax shown to be due by the examination or reexamination, or shall be paid by the State Treasurer, upon order of the Comptroller, any amount shown to be due it by such examination or reexamination. The failure of the taxpayer to receive any notice required by this section shall not relieve the taxpayer of the obligation to pay the tax or any interest or penalties thereon.\n\n(4) If, before the expiration of the time prescribed by this section for the examination or reexamination of the return or the assessment or reassessment of the tax, both the commissioner and the taxpayer consent in writing to such examination, reexamination, assessment or reassessment after such time, the return may be examined or reexamined and the tax may be assessed or reassessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon.
