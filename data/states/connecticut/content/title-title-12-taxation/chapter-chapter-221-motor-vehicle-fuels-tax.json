Distributors permitted to file such reports shall maintain records that shall detail (A) the persons from whom the fuel was purchased, (B) the persons to whom, the quantities in which and the dates on which such fuel was sold, and (C) any other information deemed necessary by the commissioner.\n\n(b) The commissioner shall, within three years after the due date for the filing of a return or, in the case of a completed return filed after such due date, within three years after the date of which such return was received by him, examine it and, in case any error is disclosed by such examination, shall, within thirty days after such disclosure, notify the taxpayer thereof. When it appears that any part of the deficiency for which a deficiency assessment is made is due to negligence or intentional disregard of the provisions of this chapter or regulations promulgated thereunder, there shall be imposed a penalty equal to ten per cent of the amount of such deficiency assessment, or fifty dollars, whichever is greater. When it appears that any part of the deficiency for which a deficiency assessment is made is due to fraud or intent to evade the provisions of this chapter or regulations promulgated thereunder, there shall be imposed a penalty equal to twenty-five per cent of the amount of such deficiency assessment. No taxpayer shall be subject to more than one penalty under this subsection in relation to the same tax period. Within thirty days of the mailing of such notice, the taxpayer shall pay to the commissioner, in cash or by check, draft or money order drawn to the order of the Commissioner of Revenue Services, any additional amount of tax shown to be due by the corrected return or shall be paid by the State Treasurer, upon order of the Comptroller, any amount shown to be due such taxpayer by such corrected return. The failure of such taxpayer to receive any notice required by this section shall not relieve such taxpayer of the obligation to pay the tax or any interest or penalties thereon. When, before the expiration of the time prescribed in this section for the examination of the return or the assessment of said tax, both the commissioner and such taxpayer have consented in writing to such examination or assessment after such time, the return may be examined and said tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. The commissioner may also in such a case waive the statute of limitations against a claim for refund by such taxpayer. To any taxes that are assessed under this subsection, there shall be added interest at the rate of one per cent per month or fraction thereof from the date when the original tax became due and payable.\n\n(c) Any person who owns or operates a vehicle that runs only upon rails or tracks and that is properly registered with the federal government, in accordance with the provisions of Section 4222 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time, shall be exempt from paying to a distributor the motor fuels tax imposed pursuant to this section for use in such vehicle.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 2552, 2554; November, 1949, June, 1955, S. 1414d; November, 1955, S.
