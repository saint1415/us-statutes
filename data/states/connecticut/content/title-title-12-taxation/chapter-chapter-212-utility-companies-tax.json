Id; 131 C. 1. Corporation operating a system of dams and gates for conservation of water for benefit of lower riparian stockholders, but not owning the water, is not taxable under section. 92 C. 38. Cited. 106 C. 580; 134 C. 299. History of statute discussed. 150 C. 578. Where plaintiff received 75 per cent of its gross earnings from furnishing steam for heat, this was its principal business and it was subject to the tax imposed by section rather than to the corporate business tax on net income imposed by Sec. 12-214. 151 C. 688. Where public utility water company which also sold produce and nursery stock claimed expenses of its orchard and nursery operations should be deducted from its gross earnings by virtue of a system of accounts prescribed by the public utilities commission, held that statute may not be modified by a regulation of the commission and the company was not entitled to such deduction. 152 C. 674, 675. Amendments to uniform system of accounts after 1945 have no effect on tax base stated in statute; “gross earnings from operations” are all items contemplated by sections 600 through 615 of 1941 uniform system of accounts prescribed for electrical utilities and other receipts which fall under any of listed categories. 161 C. 145. Since “transmission receipts” are not classified as “operating revenues” in the uniform system of accounts, or in any other accounts enumerated in section, they are not taxable under chapter. 169 C. 58.
