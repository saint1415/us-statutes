      "text": "(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the rendering of telecommunications service shall be subject to tax under this chapter as a sale, for purposes of subparagraph (K) of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 12-407, when such service is (1) (A) originated in this state and terminated in this state, (B) originated in this state and terminated outside this state and with respect to which such service is charged to a telephone number, customer or account located in this state or to the account of any transmission instrument in this state, or (C) originated outside this state and terminated in this state and with respect to which such service is charged to a telephone number, customer or account located in this state or to the account of any transmission instrument in this state, or (2) rendered by providing a private interstate telecommunications line on which the customer for such line has two or more locations connected to such line and the charges for which are related to (A) the number of customer locations connected to such line in this state, (B) the distance between customer locations connected to such line in this state, and (C) a portion of such line determined by a ratio, the numerator of which is the number of air miles between the state border and the denominator of which is the number of air miles between said closest connection to the state border in this state and the customer location connected to such line which is closest to the state border outside this state.\n\n(b) For purposes of determining the application of tax under this chapter to cellular mobile telecommunications service in accordance with subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of this section, (A) a call originated from a cellular mobile telephone shall be deemed to have originated in this state if the first site in a cellular telephone system, at which messages to or from cellular mobile telephones are transmitted or received, to establish a completed call is located in this state, (B) a call terminated at a cellular mobile telephone shall be deemed to have terminated in this state if the first such site to transmit the call to such telephone is located in this state, (C) a call originated in this state as described in subparagraph (A) of this subsection shall be deemed to have originated and terminated in this state if the call terminates in this state, and (D) a call terminated in this state as described in subparagraph (B) of this subsection shall be deemed to have originated and terminated in this state if the call originates in this state. This subsection shall apply to services that are rendered prior to August 2, 2002, provided, if a court of competent jurisdiction enters a final judgment on the merits that is based on federal law, that is no longer subject to appeal, and that substantially limits or impairs the essential elements of Sections 116 to 126, inclusive, of Title 4 of the United States Code, this subsection shall also apply to services that are rendered on or after the date of entry of such judgment.\n\n(c) (1) For purposes of this subsection:\n\n(A) “Mobile telecommunications service” means mobile telecommunications service, as defined in 4 USC 124;\n\n(B) “Charges for mobile telecommunications services” means charges for mobile telecommunications services, as defined in 4 USC 124;\n\n(C) “Home service provider” means home service provider, as defined in 4 USC 124;\n\n(D) “Customer” means customer, as defined in 4 USC 124;\n\n(E) “Place of primary use” means place of primary use, as defined in 4 USC 124; and\n\n(F) “Taxing jurisdiction” means taxing jurisdiction, as defined in 4 USC 124.\n\n(2) (A) For purposes of determining the application of tax under this chapter to mobile telecommunications service, mobile telecommunications services provided in any taxing jurisdiction to a customer, the charges for which are billed by or for the customer's home service provider, shall be deemed to be provided by the customer's home service provider.\n\n(B) Subject to the specific exceptions described in 4 USC 116(c), all charges for mobile telecommunications services that are deemed to be provided by the customer's home service provider are subject to tax under this chapter if the customer's place of primary use is in this state regardless of where the mobile telecommunications services originate, terminate or pass through.\n\n(3) (A) A home service provider shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining a record of the customer's place of primary use. Except as provided in subdivision (4) of this subsection, if the home service provider's reliance on the information provided by its customer is in good faith: (i) The home service provider may rely on the applicable residential or business street address supplied by the home service provider's customer; and (ii) the home service provider shall not be held liable for any additional taxes under this chapter based on a different determination of the place of primary use.\n\n(B) Except as provided in subdivision (4) of this subsection, a home service provider may treat the address used by the home service provider for purposes of this chapter, for any customer under a service contract or agreement in effect on July 28, 2002, as that customer's place of primary use for the remaining term of such service contract or agreement, excluding any extension or renewal of such service contract or agreement.\n\n(4) (A) If the commissioner determines that the address used by a home service provider as a customer's place of primary use is not, in fact, the customer's place of primary use, the commissioner shall notify such customer of such determination and provide such customer an opportunity to demonstrate that the address used by a home service provider as a customer's place of primary use is, in fact, the customer's place of primary use.\n\n(B) If the customer fails to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the commissioner, that the address is, in fact, the customer's place of primary use, the commissioner shall provide the home service provider with notice of the proper address to be used as such customer's place of primary use, and the home service provider shall begin using the address provided by the commissioner as such customer's place of primary use on a prospective basis from the date the commissioner provides notice of such address.\n\n(5) (A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commissioner may provide an electronic database, as described in 4 USC 119, and any revisions to such database, to a home service provider.\n\n(B) If the commissioner does not provide an electronic database, as described in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, to a home service provider, the home service provider shall be held harmless from tax under this chapter that otherwise would be due solely as a result of an assignment of a street address to an incorrect taxing jurisdiction if, subject to subdivision (4) of this subsection, the home service provider employs an enhanced zip code to assign each street address to a specific taxing jurisdiction for each level of taxing jurisdiction and exercises due diligence at each level of taxing jurisdiction to ensure that each such street address is assigned to the correct taxing jurisdiction.\n\n(6) (A) If a customer believes that an amount of tax or an assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction included on a billing is erroneous, the customer shall notify the home service provider in writing. The customer shall include in such written notification the street address for the customer's place of primary use, the account name and number for which the customer requests a correction, a description of the error asserted by the customer and any other information that the home service provider reasonably requires to process the request. No later than sixty days after the date of receiving a notice under this subdivision, the home service provider shall review its records. If such review establishes that the amount of tax, or the assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction is erroneous, then the home service provider shall correct the error and refund or credit the amount of tax erroneously collected from the customer for a period of up to two years from the date of the customer's written notification. If such review establishes that the amount of tax, or the assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction is correct, then the home service provider shall provide a written explanation to the customer.\n\n(B) If the customer is not satisfied with the explanation of the home service provider under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, the customer may claim a refund from the taxing jurisdiction affected, provided the customer has first exhausted the remedy available to customers under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, and, if the customer has done so and if the taxing jurisdiction affected is this state, the claim is made within the time prescribed in section 12-425.\n\n(7) This subsection shall apply to services that are rendered on or after August 2, 2002, provided, if a court of competent jurisdiction enters a final judgment on the merits that is based on federal law, that is no longer subject to appeal, and that substantially limits or impairs the essential elements of Sections 116 to 126, inclusive, of Title 4 of the United States Code, this subsection shall be invalid and have no legal effect as of the date of entry of such judgment.\n\n(d) If nontaxable charges are aggregated with and not separately stated from taxable charges for telecommunications services, then the nontaxable charges may be subject to tax unless the provider can reasonably identify charges not subject to tax under this chapter from its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business. A customer may not rely upon the nontaxability of charges for services unless the customer's provider separately states the charges for nontaxable services from taxable charges for telecommunications services or the provider elects, after receiving written request from the customer in the form required by the provider, to provide verifiable data based upon the provider's books and records that are kept in the regular course of business that reasonably identifies the nontaxable charges.\n\n(P.A. 89-251, S. 3, 203; June Sp.

Such tax shall be a debt from the consumer to the retailer, when so added to the original sales price, and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as other debts except as provided in section 12-432a. The amount of tax reimbursement, when so collected, shall be deemed to be a special fund in trust for the state of Connecticut.\n\n(B) Whenever such tax, payable by the consumer (i) with respect to a charge account or credit sale, is remitted by the retailer to the commissioner and such sale as an account receivable is determined to be worthless and is actually written off as uncollectible for federal income tax purposes, or (ii) to a retailer who computes taxable income, for purposes of taxation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time, on the cash basis method of accounting with respect to a sale, is remitted by the retailer to the commissioner and such sale as an account receivable is determined to be worthless, the amount of such tax remitted may be credited against the tax due on the sales tax return filed by the retailer for the monthly or quarterly period, whichever is applicable, next following the period in which such amount is actually so written off, but in no event shall such credit be allowed later than three years following the date such tax is remitted, unless the credit relates to a period for which a waiver is given pursuant to subsection (g) of section 12-415.

If any payment is made by a consumer with respect to an account, such payment shall be applied first toward the sales tax, and if any account with respect to which such credit is allowed is thereafter collected by the retailer in whole or in part, the amount so collected, up to the amount of the sales tax for which the credit was claimed, shall be included in the sales tax return covering the period in which such collection occurs. The tax applicable in any such case shall be determined in accordance with the rate of sales tax in effect at the time of the original sale.\n\n(C) (i) Any person required to collect tax in accordance with this subsection who demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Revenue Services by July first of any year that, in any two quarterly periods as described in section 12-414, within the most recent four consecutive quarterly periods, such person was a materialman as such term is used in chapter 847, who has at least fifty per cent of such person's sales of building materials to contractors, subcontractors or repairmen for the improvement of real property, and is authorized by said chapter to file a mechanic's lien upon such real property and improvement shall, with respect to such sales made through the quarterly period ending the succeeding June thirtieth, collect tax due on such sales, and on sales to such contractors, subcontractors or repairmen of services described in subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 12-407 with respect to such building materials, for such purpose and made during such July first through June thirtieth period, at the time and to the extent that such person receives the receipts from, or consideration for, such sales from such contractors, subcontractors or repairmen, provided if such person receives a portion of such receipts or consideration, such person shall collect the tax due on such portion at the time the portion is received. The taxes imposed by this chapter on such receipts and consideration shall be deemed imposed, solely for purposes of determining when such person is required to collect and pay over such taxes to the commissioner under section 12-414, when such person has received payment of such receipts or consideration in money, or money's worth, from such contractor, subcontractor or repairman. A contractor, subcontractor or repairman who purchases building materials or services from such person pursuant to this subparagraph shall, at the time such contractor, subcontractor or repairman pays any portion of the purchase price, pay to the person the tax due on the portion of the purchase price so paid.\n\n(ii) In the event that a materialman described in this subparagraph factors any portion of such materialman's receivables, such materialman shall be deemed to have received payment of such receipts or consideration in money or money's worth, from the contractor, subcontractor or repairman and shall be required to pay over tax on such sale with the next return due, with a credit against such tax for any tax already paid over with respect to such sale. Any such amount of tax paid over shall be on account of the tax required to be collected on the sale to which it relates and such materialman may take a credit against any tax paid by such contractor, subcontractor or repairman in the future on such sale, to ensure that tax paid over with respect to such sale does not exceed the amount of tax imposed on such sale as if the entire purchase price had been paid at the time of sale.\n\n(iii) A materialman described in this subparagraph who has not collected the tax due on the full purchase price for a sale described in this subparagraph from a contractor, subcontractor or repairman within one year from the date of such sale, shall pay over to the commissioner the tax due on any balance of such full purchase price with such materialman's return for the period which includes the date which is one year after the date of such sale.\n\n(iv) The commissioner may assess additional tax due with respect to a sale described in this subparagraph not later than three years from the date the tax is required to be paid over to the commissioner pursuant to this subparagraph, and in the case of a wilfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, or where no return has been filed such taxpayer shall be subject to the provisions of section 12-428.\n\n(D) In the case of a sale by a producer or wholesaler of newspapers to a vendor who is not otherwise required to obtain a permit under this chapter, such producer or wholesaler shall collect the sales tax on such newspapers at the point of transfer to such vendor. Such tax shall be based on the stated retail price of such newspapers. Such vendor may add an amount to the price of the newspapers equal to the amount paid as sales tax to the producer or wholesaler and such vendor shall not be required to remit such amount to the state.\n\n(3) Bracket system for adding and collecting tax. For the purpose of adding and collecting the tax imposed by this chapter, or an amount equal as nearly as possible or practicable to the average equivalent thereof, by the retailer from the consumer the following bracket system shall be in force and effect as follows:\n\nAmount of SaleAmount of Tax$0.00 to $0.07 inclusiveNo Tax.08 to .23 inclusive1 cent.24 to .39 inclusive2 cents.40 to .55 inclusive3 cents.56 to .70 inclusive4 cents.71 to .86 inclusive5 cents.87 to 1.02 inclusive6 cents1.03 to 1.18 inclusive7 cents\n\nOn all sales above $1.18, the tax shall be computed at the rate of six and thirty-five-hundredths per cent.\n\n(4) Unlawful advertising. No retailer shall advertise or hold out or state to the public or to any consumer, directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the retailer or that it will not be added to the sales price of the property sold or that, if added, it or any part thereof will be refunded. Under the provisions of this section, however, a retailer may advertise the sale of tangible personal property by any of the following methods: By stating the sales price alone without reference to the tax; by stating separately the sales price and the amount of tax to be collected thereon; by stating the sales price “plus tax” or “exclusive of tax” or by stating a sales price which includes the tax, together with the words “tax included” or “tax incl.”; provided the retailer in the case of all such sales shall maintain his records to show separately the actual price of such sales and the amount of the tax paid thereon; and provided such retailer, if requested, shall furnish the consumer with a sales slip or other like evidence of the sale, showing the tax separately computed thereon. Any person violating any provision of this subsection shall be fined five hundred dollars for each offense.\n\n(5) Notices, signs or advertisements subject to approval. No retailer shall exhibit or display on his premises any notice, sign or other advertising matter tending to mislead the public in connection with the imposition or collection of the tax. The Commissioner of Revenue Services may approve a form of notice for the purpose of explaining the operation of the tax.\n\n(6) Regulations related to sales of motor vehicles to certain members of the armed forces. The Commissioner of Revenue Services shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, establishing a procedure for determination of qualifications with respect to the reduced rate of sales tax in the case of certain sales of motor vehicles to members of the armed forces as provided in subsection (1) of this section.\n\n(7) Computation of tax for purposes of toll telephone service in coin-operated telephones. For purposes of the tax imposed by this chapter, with respect to toll telephone service paid by inserting coins in coin-operated telephones, the tax shall be computed to the nearest multiple of five cents, except if the tax is midway between multiples of five cents, the next higher multiple shall apply.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 2092; 1951, 1953, June, 1955, S. 1163d, 1164d; November, 1955, S.

The burden of proving that a sale of tangible personal property or service constituting a sale in accordance with subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 12-407 is not a sale at retail is upon the person who makes the sale unless such person takes in good faith from the purchaser a certificate to the effect that the property or service is purchased for resale.\n\n(b)Effect of certificate.The certificate relieves the seller from the burden of proof only if taken in good faith from a person who is engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property or services constituting a sale in accordance with subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 12-407 and who holds the permit provided for in section 12-409 and who, at the time of purchasing the tangible personal property or service: (1) Intends to sell it in the regular course of business; (2) intends to utilize such personal property in the delivery of landscaping or horticulture services, provided the total sale price of all such landscaping and horticulture services are taxable under this chapter; or (3) is unable to ascertain at the time of purchase whether the property or service will be sold or will be used for some other purpose.

The purchaser of the software for resale shall maintain, in such form as the commissioner requires, records that substantiate: (A) From whom the software was purchased and to whom the software was sold, licensed or leased, (B) the purchase price of the software, and (C) the nature of the transaction with the ultimate consumer to demonstrate that the same software was provided unaltered to the ultimate consumer.\n\n(4) For purposes of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the sale of digital goods shall be considered a sale for resale if the digital goods are subsequently sold, licensed, leased, broadcast, transmitted, or distributed, in whole or in part, as an integral, inseparable component part of a digital good or service described in subdivision (26), (27), (37) or (39) of subsection (a) of section 12-407 by the purchaser of the digital goods to an ultimate consumer.

Such written consent shall constitute authorization for the disclosure of financial records under section 36a-42. For the purposes of this subparagraph, “account-related information” includes account balance information and information identifying the dates and amounts of debits and credits to such account, and may include such other nonpublic personal information pertaining to such account the commissioner may require.\n\n(ii) Upon the establishment of such account, such person shall deposit into such account the tax collected or received by such person, not later than two business days after such collection or receipt. The taxes deposited in such account shall constitute a fund in trust for the state of Connecticut and deemed to be the property of the state, payable only to the Department of Revenue Services, and no liens shall be placed on the taxes deposited in such account. No other funds shall be deposited into such account for any reason except for maintenance of the account.\n\n(iii) If, without the prior authorization of the commissioner, a person withdraws funds from such account for any purpose other than to remit tax due to the commissioner, such person shall be guilty of larceny, as defined in section 53a-119. Each unauthorized withdrawal shall constitute a separate offense.\n\n(iv) The commissioner may request at any time from a financial institution account-related information pertaining to any account established pursuant to clause (i) of this subparagraph that is maintained by such institution. The commissioner shall identify, in consultation with representatives from the banking industry, acceptable methods for the provision of such account-related information.\n\n(F) If a person elects under subparagraph (D) of this subdivision to remit tax through a certified service provider, such person shall, not later than thirty days after making such election, contract with a certified service provider and begin remitting tax through such provider. Such person shall provide to the commissioner, upon request, a copy of the executed contract, a written authorization for the commissioner to contact the certified service provider regarding such person and any other information with respect to the arrangement between such person and such provider that the commissioner may require. Each certified service provider remitting tax on behalf of any person required to remit tax for a weekly period shall do so in the manner and method prescribed in subparagraph (C) of this subdivision.\n\n(G) (i) If any person who elects or is otherwise required to establish an account under subparagraph (D) of this subdivision fails to remit tax as provided in this subdivision and the commissioner determines that collection of such tax will be jeopardized by delay, the commissioner may serve notice on the financial institution where such account was established and order the payment of such tax from such account. The commissioner shall determine, in consultation with representatives from the banking industry, acceptable methods for the provision of such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the financial institution shall remove from such account before such institution's midnight deadline, as defined in section 42a-4-104, the available funds in such account or the amount of the tax ordered paid by the commissioner, whichever is less. Any funds so removed by the financial institution shall be paid to the commissioner not later than two business days after such midnight deadline and such payment shall be applied toward the amount of tax due to the commissioner from such person. The commissioner shall not order payment from such account of any penalty or interest that may be owed by such person in connection with such tax. Such penalty or interest may be collected by the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of section 12-35 and chapter 906.\n\n(ii) If the financial institution fails or refuses to pay to the commissioner the amount required under clause (i) of this subparagraph, the Attorney General may, upon request by the commissioner, bring an action in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford to compel the financial institution to pay such amount.\n\n(iii) Contemporaneously with the service of notice on the financial institution, the commissioner shall provide a written notice to the person who established the account pursuant to subparagraph (E)(i) of this subdivision of such person's right to file a claim with the commissioner if such account contains funds other than such taxes that constitute the property of the state. Such notice shall be provided in person, left at the person's dwelling or usual place of business, sent by first-class mail to such person's last-known address or sent by electronic mail or facsimile machine to such person. Such person shall have ten business days after receipt of such notice to file such claim on a form prescribed by the commissioner. Failure to file a claim within the time period prescribed shall constitute a waiver of any demand against the state.\n\n(iv) Not later than ten business days after receipt of a claim filed pursuant to clause (iii) of this subparagraph, the commissioner shall determine whether such claim is valid. If the commissioner determines the claim is valid, the commissioner shall return to such person only those funds that are not the property of the state and such funds shall not be subject to offset by the state. If the commissioner determines the claim is not valid in whole or in part, the commissioner shall provide written notice of denial to such person.\n\n(v) Not later than five business days after the date of mailing of a notice of denial, such person may file with the commissioner a written protest of the denial, setting forth the grounds on which the protest is based. If a protest is filed, the commissioner shall, not later than ten business days after receipt of such protest, reconsider the denial. The commissioner shall provide written notice to such person of the commissioner's determination of reconsideration, setting forth briefly the commissioner's findings of fact and the basis for the commissioner's decision in each case decided adversely in whole or in part to such person.\n\n(vi) Any person aggrieved by a determination of the commissioner under this subsection may appeal to the superior court for the judicial district of New Britain, in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183. Such appeal shall not constitute an appeal from the Commissioner of Revenue Services for purposes of section 4-186.\n\n(vii) Nothing in this subdivision shall affect the rights afforded to a financial institution with respect to uncollected funds that are credited to an account established pursuant to subparagraph (E) of this subdivision, including the right to remove funds as a charge-back to recover uncollected funds.\n\n(H) (i) Any person who fails to remit tax as provided in this subdivision shall be subject to all penalties imposed under this chapter, including revocation of such person's permit.\n\n(ii) Any penalty imposed under this subdivision shall not be subject to waiver.\n\n(3) (A) Nothing in this subsection shall affect the rights afforded under chapter 219 to persons subject to the provisions of this subsection, including the ability to file a claim for refund under section 12-425.\n\n(B) Except as otherwise provided, no action taken by the commissioner under this subsection shall constitute collection actions for purposes of section 12-35 or chapter 906.\n\n(f)Extension of time.Except for returns and payments required to be made under subdivision (2) of subsection (e) of this section, the commissioner for good cause may extend the time for making any return and paying any amount required to be paid under this chapter, if a written request therefor is filed with the commissioner together with a tentative return which must be accompanied by a payment of the tax, which shall be estimated in such tentative return, on or before the last day for filing the return. Any person to whom an extension is granted shall pay, in addition to the tax, interest at the rate of one per cent per month or fraction thereof from the date on which the tax would have been due without the extension until the date of payment.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 2098; 1951, 1953, June, 1955, S. 1170d; November, 1955, S.
