If the rental company charges a lessee a vehicle cost recovery fee for a passenger motor vehicle or rental truck, such fee shall (A) represent the rental company's estimate of the annual costs for any required licensing, titling, registration, tax or inspection of, or number plates for, such vehicle or truck, prorated to a daily rate, and (B) be described in the terms and conditions of the rental agreement as the estimated average per day cost incurred by the rental company to license, title, register, obtain number plates and inspect its passenger motor vehicle or rental truck and to pay any taxes owed on such vehicle or truck.\n\n(2) If the total amount of the vehicle cost recovery fees collected by a rental company under this subsection in any calendar year exceeds such company's actual costs to license, title, register, obtain number plates and inspect its passenger motor vehicles or rental trucks and pay any taxes owed on such vehicles or trucks, the rental company shall retain the excess amount and reduce its estimated costs to license, title, register, obtain number plates and inspect each passenger motor vehicle or rental truck and to pay any taxes owed on such vehicle or truck the following calendar year, by an amount equivalent to the excess amount.

Subject to the provisions of section 12-3a, the commissioner may waive all or any part of the penalties provided under this section when it is proven to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the failure to pay any amount required to be paid to the commissioner was due to reasonable cause and was not intentional or due to neglect.\n\n(h) The Commissioner of Revenue Services for good cause may extend the time for making any report and paying any amount required to be paid to the commissioner under this section if a written request therefor is filed with the commissioner together with a tentative report which shall be accompanied by a payment of any amount tentatively believed to be due to the commissioner, on or before the last day for filing the report. Any person to whom an extension is granted shall pay, in addition to the amount required to be paid, interest at the rate of one per cent per month or fraction thereof from the date on which such amount would have been due without the extension until the date of payment.\n\n(i) The provisions of sections 12-548 to 12-554, inclusive, and section 12-555a shall apply to the provisions of this section in the same manner and with the same force and effect as if the language of said sections 12-548 to 12-554, inclusive, and section 12-555a had been incorporated in full into this section, except to the extent that any provision is inconsistent with a provision in this section, and except that the term “tax” shall be read as “charge, fee or rental surcharge”.\n\n(P.A. 95-294, S. 1, 2; P.A. 96-129, S. 1, 2; June 18 Sp.
