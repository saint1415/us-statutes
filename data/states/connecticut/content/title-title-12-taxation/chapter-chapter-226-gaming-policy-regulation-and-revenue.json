The commissioner shall complete his investigation of an applicant for an occupational license and notify such applicant of his decision to approve or deny the application within one year after its receipt, or, if the commissioner determines good cause exists for extending such period of investigation and gives the applicant a reasonable opportunity for a hearing, by the date prescribed by the commissioner.\n\n(2) Upon petition by the holder of an association, vendor, totalizator or affiliate license, the commissioner may authorize an applicant for an occupational license under subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 12-578 to provisionally perform the work permitted under the occupational license applied for, if:\n\n(A) The applicant has filed a completed application for such occupational license in the form and manner required by the commissioner, and\n\n(B) Such association, vendor, totalizator or affiliate licensee attests that the provisional authorization is necessary to continue the efficient operation of pari-mutuel wagering, and is based on circumstances that are extraordinary and not designed to circumvent the otherwise applicable licensing procedures.\n\n(3) The commissioner may issue a provisional authorization to an applicant for an occupational license under subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 12-578 in advance of issuance or denial of such occupational license for such applicant for a period not to exceed six months. Provisional authorization shall permit such applicant to perform the functions and require the applicant to comply with the requirements of the occupational license applied for as set forth in the provisions of this chapter and regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter. Provisional authorization shall not constitute approval for an occupational license under subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 12-578. During the period of time that any provisional authorization is in effect, the applicant granted such authorization shall be subject to and comply with all applicable statutes and regulations. Any provisional authorization issued by the commissioner shall expire immediately upon the earlier of: (A) The date of issuance of written notice from the commissioner that the occupational license has been approved or denied, or (B) six months after the date the provisional authorization was issued.\n\n(4) An individual whose occupational license application is denied after a period of provisional authorization shall not reapply for an occupational license under subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 12-578 for a period of one year from the date of the denial.\n\n(5) An individual whose provisional authorization expires pursuant to subparagraph (B) of subdivision (3) of this subsection may apply for an additional provisional authorization.

If any affiliate licensee fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter, the commissioner, after a hearing held in accordance with chapter 54, may revoke or suspend the license of any one or more of the following related licensees: Concessionaire, vendor or totalizator, and may fine any one or more of such licensees in an amount not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars. In addition, if any affiliate licensee fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter, the commissioner, after a hearing held in accordance with chapter 54, may revoke or suspend the license of the related association licensee and may fine the related association licensee in an amount not to exceed seventy-five thousand dollars or both. If any license is suspended or revoked, the commissioner shall state the reasons for such suspension or revocation and cause an entry of such reasons to be made on the record books of the department.

The commissioner may delegate to the stewards and judges of a meeting the power to suspend the license of any occupational licensee employed in this state by an association licensee for a period not to exceed sixty days for any violation of such regulations. If any license is suspended, such stewards and judges of a meeting shall state the reasons therefor in writing.

The burden of proving that an exemption should be granted rests solely with the applicant. The commissioner may limit or condition the terms of an exemption and such determination shall be final.\n\n(m)Penalty for aiding operation of off-track betting system or meeting without license.Any person aiding or abetting in the operation of an off-track betting system or the conduct of any meeting within this state at which racing or the exhibition of the game of jai alai shall be permitted for any stake, purse or reward, except in accordance with a license duly issued and unsuspended or unrevoked by the commissioner, shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor.\n\n(n)Residency requirement.The majority of the membership of the board of directors of any corporation licensed to operate the off-track betting system or to hold or conduct any meeting within the state of Connecticut at which racing or the exhibition of the game of jai alai shall be permitted for any stake, purse or reward, shall be residents of the state of Connecticut.\n\n(o)License application and renewal.Any license granted under this section, other than an association license authorizing the licensee to conduct a meeting or operate the off-track betting system, as described in subsection (a) of this section, or an affiliate license authorizing the licensee to exercise control in or over an association licensee, as described in subsection (e) of this section, shall be effective for not more than one year from the date of issuance.
