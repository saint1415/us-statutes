      "heading": "Dry cleaning gross receipts tax",
      "text": "(a) As used in this section: (1) “Eligible dry cleaning establishment” means any place of business engaged in the cleaning of clothing or other fabrics using tetrachlorethylene, Stoddard solvent or other chemicals, (2) “gross receipts at retail” means the total amount accruing from dry cleaning services, valued in money, without any deduction for the cost of the materials used, labor or service cost or any other expense, and (3) “eligible applicant” means (A) a business owner or operator of an eligible dry cleaning establishment, (B) an owner of property that is or that was occupied by an eligible dry cleaning establishment, or (C) a certifying party, as defined in section 22a-134, of property that is or that was occupied by an eligible dry cleaning establishment.\n\n(b) (1) There shall be paid to the Commissioner of Revenue Services by each dry cleaning establishment a surcharge of one per cent of its gross receipts at retail for any dry cleaning service performed on or after January 1, 1995. Each dry cleaning establishment shall register with the Commissioner of Revenue Services on forms prescribed by the commissioner. Each dry cleaning establishment that is registered with the commissioner shall renew its registration with the commissioner on October 1, 2015, and annually thereafter, in such manner as the commissioner may prescribe. The commissioner shall send a nonrenewal notice by first class mail to each dry cleaning establishment that fails to renew its registration in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. No dry cleaning establishment may engage in or transact business as a dry cleaning establishment unless it is registered with the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(2) (A) Any dry cleaning establishment that fails to register with the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of this subsection shall pay a penalty of one thousand dollars, which penalty shall not be subject to waiver.\n\n(B) Any dry cleaning establishment that fails to renew its registration within forty-five days after a nonrenewal notice was sent pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection shall pay a penalty of two hundred dollars, which the commissioner may waive in the manner set forth in section 12-3a, when it is proven to the commissioner's satisfaction that the failure to register was due to reasonable cause and was not intentional or due to neglect. No penalty may be assessed under this subparagraph more than once during any registration period.\n\n(3) Each dry cleaning establishment shall submit a return quarterly to the Commissioner of Revenue Services, applicable with respect to the calendar quarter beginning January 1, 1995, and each calendar quarter thereafter, on or before the last day of the month immediately following the end of each such calendar quarter, on a form prescribed by the commissioner, together with payment of the quarterly surcharge determined and payable in accordance with the provisions of this section. Whenever such surcharge is not paid when due, a penalty of ten per cent of the amount due or fifty dollars, whichever is greater, shall be imposed, and such surcharge shall bear interest at the rate of one per cent per month or fraction thereof until the same is paid. The Commissioner of Revenue Services shall cause copies of a form prescribed for submitting returns as required under this section to be distributed to persons subject to the surcharge. Failure to receive such form shall not be construed to relieve anyone subject to the surcharge under this section from the obligations of submitting a return, together with payment of such surcharge within the time required. The provisions of sections 12-548 to 12-554, inclusive, and sections 12-555a and 12-555b shall apply to the provisions of this section in the same manner and with the same force and effect as if the language of said sections 12-548 to 12-554, inclusive, and sections 12-555a and 12-555b had been incorporated in full into this section and had expressly referred to the surcharge imposed under this section, except to the extent that any such provision is inconsistent with a provision of this section and except that the term “tax” shall be read as “dry cleaning establishment surcharge”.\n\n(4) Any moneys received by the state pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the account established pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(c) There is established an account within the General Fund to be known as the “dry cleaning establishment remediation account”. Said account shall contain any moneys required by law to be deposited in the account. Any balance remaining in the account at the end of any fiscal year shall be carried forward in the account for the fiscal year next succeeding. The account shall be used by the Department of Economic and Community Development for grants made to (1) owners or operators of eligible dry cleaning establishments, (2) owners of property on which an eligible dry cleaning establishment has been in operation for at least a year prior to the submission of the application or was previously operated for at least a year prior to such submission, or (3) certifying parties of property on which an eligible dry cleaning establishment has been in operation for at least one year prior to the submission of the application or was previously operated for at least one year prior to such submission.\n\n(d) The state, acting through the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development, shall use the dry cleaning establishment remediation account to provide grants to eligible applicants for the purposes of the containment and removal or mitigation of environmental pollution resulting from the discharge, spillage, uncontrolled loss, seepage or filtration of chemical liquids or solid, liquid or gaseous products or hazardous wastes on or at the site of an eligible dry cleaning establishment, environmental site assessments relating to such pollution or for measures undertaken to prevent such pollution which are approved by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection. In order to qualify for a grant under the provisions of this section an eligible applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development that (1) the eligible dry cleaning establishment is using or previously used, tetrachlorethylene or Stoddard solvent or other chemicals for the purpose of cleaning clothes or other fabrics, (2) the eligible dry cleaning establishment has been doing business or did business at the site for a period of at least one year prior to the submission date or approval date of the application for assistance under this section, (3) the eligible dry cleaning establishment or owner of property is not in arrears with regard to any tax levied by the state or any political subdivision of the state and the dry cleaning surcharge imposed by subsection (b) of this section, and (4) the eligible applicant is not in arrears with regard to any tax levied by the state or any political subdivision of the state. Any funds disbursed as a grant under this section shall not be subject to attachment in the satisfaction of any judgment against the recipient of such grant in any civil action.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding the terms of any grant made under this section, an eligible applicant shall bear all the costs of such pollution that are less than ten thousand dollars. Each eligible applicant that submits an application on or after October 1, 2021, shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development that such applicant can match any grant provided by said commissioner, up to ten thousand dollars, before such applicant receives any grant. The Commissioner of Economic and Community Development may provide a grant of up to three hundred thousand dollars to the eligible applicant where the eligible applicant has provided said commissioner with documentation satisfactory to said commissioner that the services for which payment is sought have been completed. No eligible applicant shall receive more than three hundred thousand dollars per eligible dry cleaning establishment. In addition, the dry cleaning establishment remediation account may be used (1) to provide grants to the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection for expenditures made investigating dry cleaning establishments, (2) to provide potable water whenever necessary, (3) to conduct environmental site assessments, and (4) for legal services relating to the disbursement of funds from the account.\n\n(f) Requests for grants shall be made to the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development when the commissioner announces a request for applications. The frequency of requests for applications shall be at the discretion of the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development. Any eligible applicant seeking a grant shall provide documentation supporting the need for the grant.\n\n(g) Any dry cleaning establishment which unlawfully or intentionally discharges or spills any chemical liquids or solid, liquid or gaseous products or hazardous wastes shall not be eligible for a grant from the account.\n\n(h) The Commissioner of Economic and Community Development shall establish procedures for distribution of the grants and shall adopt criteria to carry out the provisions of this section. Such criteria shall specify (1) who may apply for grants; (2) how establishments, whether owned or leased, will be determined to be eligible for grants; (3) the costs for which grants may be made; and (4) a method for ensuring timely payment of funds to grant recipients.\n\n(May Sp.
