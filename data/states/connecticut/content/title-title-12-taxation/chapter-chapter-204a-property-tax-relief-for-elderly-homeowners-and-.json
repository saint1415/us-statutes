The municipal tax collector shall determine the maximum amount of the tax due with respect to such homeowner's residence and thereafter the property tax with respect to such homeowner's residence shall not exceed such amount.

Any such lien shall have a priority in the settlement of such person's estate.\n\n(d) Any such property tax relief granted to any such resident in accordance with the provisions of section 12-170v and this section shall not disqualify such resident with respect to any benefits for which such resident shall be eligible under the provisions of sections 12-129b to 12-129d, inclusive, 12-129n and 12-170aa and any such property tax relief provided under this section shall be in addition to any such benefits for which such resident shall be eligible under sections 12-129b to 12-129d, inclusive, 12-129n and 12-170aa.\n\n(P.A. 06-176, S. 2; P.A. 10-32, S. 35; P.A. 12-197, S. 29; P.A. 16-143, S. 2; P.A. 21-196, S. 11; June Sp.

The amount of tax reduction approved shall be applied to the real property tax payable by the homeowner for the assessment year in which such application is submitted and approved. If any such homeowner has qualified for tax reduction under this section, the tax reduction determined shall, when possible, be applied and prorated uniformly over the number of installments in which the real property tax is due and payable to the municipality in which such homeowner resides. In the case of any homeowner who is eligible for tax reduction under this section as a result of increases in qualifying income, under the schedule of qualifying income and tax reduction in subsection (c) of this section, exclusive of any such increases related to Social Security adjustments in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, the total amount of tax reduction to which such homeowner is entitled shall be credited and uniformly prorated against property tax installment payments applicable to such homeowner's residence that become due after such homeowner's application for tax reduction under this section is accepted.

A duplicate of such certificate shall be delivered to the applicant and the tax collector of the municipality and the assessor shall keep the fourth copy of such certificate and a copy of the application. Any homeowner who, for the purpose of obtaining a tax reduction under this section, wilfully fails to disclose all matters related thereto or with intent to defraud makes false statement shall refund all property tax credits improperly taken and shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars.\n\n(3) Applications filed under this section shall not be open for public inspection.\n\n(g)State reimbursement for loss of property tax.(1) On or before July first, annually, each municipality shall submit to the secretary a claim for the tax reductions approved under this section in relation to the assessment list of October first immediately preceding.

If such conveyance occurs in the month of October the grantor shall be disqualified for tax credit in such assessment year. The grantee shall be required within a period not exceeding ten days immediately following the date of such conveyance to notify the assessor thereof by mail or electronic mail, in a manner prescribed by the assessor, or in the absence of such notice, upon determination by the assessor that such transfer, assignment, grant or conveyance has occurred, the assessor shall (A) determine the amount of tax reduction to which the grantor is entitled for such assessment year with respect to the interest in real property conveyed and notify the tax collector of the reduced amount of tax reduction applicable to such interest, and (B) notify the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management on or before the October first immediately following the end of the assessment year in which such conveyance occurs of the reduction in such tax reduction for purposes of a corresponding adjustment in the amount of state payment to the municipality next following as reimbursement for the revenue loss related to such tax reductions. On or after December first, annually, any municipality that neglects to transmit to the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management the claim as required by this section shall forfeit two hundred fifty dollars to the state except that the secretary may waive such forfeiture in accordance with procedures and standards established by regulations adopted in accordance with chapter 54.\n\n(2) Upon receipt of such notice from the assessor, the tax collector shall, if such notice is received after the tax due date in the municipality, not later than thirty days after such receipt, mail, hand or deliver by electronic mail, at the grantee's option, a bill to the grantee stating the additional amount of tax due as determined by the assessor. Such tax shall be due and payable and collectible as other property taxes and subject to the same liens and processes of collection, provided such tax shall be due and payable in an initial or single installment not sooner than thirty days after the date such bill is mailed or handed to the grantee and in equal amounts in any remaining, regular installments as the same are due and payable.\n\n(j)Benefits for persons without ownership or leasehold interest in real property who reside in multiple-dwelling complex.(1) Notwithstanding the intent in subsections (a) to (i), inclusive, of this section to provide for benefits in the form of property tax reduction applicable to persons liable for payment of such property tax and qualified in accordance with requirements related to age and income as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a certain annual benefit, determined in amount under the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section but payable in a manner as prescribed in this subsection, shall be provided with respect to any person who (A) is qualified in accordance with said requirements related to age and income as provided in subsection (b) of this section, including provisions concerning such person's spouse, and (B) is a resident of a dwelling unit within a multiple-dwelling complex containing dwelling units for occupancy by certain elderly persons under terms of a contract between such resident and the owner of such complex, in accordance with which contract such resident occupies a certain dwelling unit subject to the express provision that such resident has no legal title, interest or leasehold estate in the real or personal property of such complex, and under the terms of which contract such resident agrees to pay the owner of the complex a fee, as a condition precedent to occupancy and a monthly or other such periodic fee thereafter as a condition of continued occupancy. In no event shall any such resident be qualified for benefits payable in accordance with this subsection if, as determined by the assessor in the municipality in which such complex is situated, such resident's contract with the owner of such complex, or occupancy by such resident (i) confers upon such resident any ownership interest in the dwelling unit occupied or in such complex, or (ii) establishes a contract of lease of any type for the dwelling unit occupied by such resident.\n\n(2) The amount of annual benefit payable in accordance with this subsection to any such resident, qualified as provided in subdivision (1) of this subsection, shall be determined in relation to an assumed amount of property tax liability applicable to the assessed value for the dwelling unit which such resident occupies, as determined by the assessor in the municipality in which such complex is situated. Annually, not later than the first day of June, the assessor in such municipality, upon receipt of an application for such benefit submitted in accordance with this subsection by mail or electronic mail, in a manner prescribed by the assessor, by any such resident, shall determine, with respect to the assessment list in such municipality for the assessment year commencing October first immediately preceding, the portion of the assessed value of the entire complex, as included in such assessment list, attributable to the dwelling unit occupied by such resident. The assumed property tax liability for purposes of this subsection shall be the product of such assessed value and the mill rate in such municipality as determined for purposes of property tax imposed on said assessment list for the assessment year commencing October first immediately preceding. The amount of benefit to which such resident shall be entitled for such assessment year shall be equivalent to the amount of tax reduction for which such resident would qualify, considering such assumed property tax liability to be the actual property tax applicable to such resident's dwelling unit and such resident as liable for the payment of such tax, in accordance with the schedule of qualifying income and tax reduction as provided in subsection (c) of this section, subject to provisions concerning maximum allowable benefit for any assessment year under subsections (c) and (d) of this section. The amount of benefit as determined for such resident in respect to any assessment year shall be payable by the state as a grant to such resident equivalent to the amount of property tax reduction to which such resident would be entitled under subsections (a) to (i), inclusive, of this section if such resident were the owner of such dwelling unit and qualified for tax reduction benefits under said subsections (a) to (i), inclusive.\n\n(3) Any such resident entitled to a grant as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection shall be required to submit an application to the assessor in the municipality in which such resident resides for such grant by mail or electronic mail, in a manner prescribed by the assessor, at any time from February first to and including the fifteenth day of May in the year in which such grant is claimed, on a form prescribed and furnished for such purpose by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management.

Not later than the first day of July in such year, the assessor shall submit to the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management (A) a copy of the application prepared by such resident, together with such resident's federal income tax return, if required to file such a return, and any other information submitted in relation thereto, (B) determinations of the assessor concerning the assessed value of the dwelling unit in such complex occupied by such resident, and (C) the amount of such grant approved by the assessor. Said secretary, upon approving such grant, shall certify the amount thereof and not later than the fifteenth day of September immediately following submit approval for payment of such grant to the State Comptroller. Not later than five business days immediately following receipt of such approval for payment, the State Comptroller shall draw an order on the State Treasurer and the Treasurer shall pay the amount of the grant to such resident not later than the first day of October immediately following.\n\n(k)Adjustments.If the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management makes any adjustments to the grants for tax reductions or assumed amounts of property tax liability claimed under this section subsequent to the State Comptroller's order of payment of grants in any year, the amount of such adjustment shall be reflected in the next payment the Treasurer shall make to such municipality pursuant to this section.\n\n(June Sp.
