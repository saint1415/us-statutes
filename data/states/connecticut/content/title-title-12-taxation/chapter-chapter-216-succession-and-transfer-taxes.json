Succession tax on transfers made according to Subdiv. is imposed on privilege of succeeding to right of possession or enjoyment of property from a former owner at his death, even though the shifting of enjoyment follows from a prior transfer of title inter vivos, or as a result of a contractual obligation. Id., 336. Where a trust is involved, intangibles are treated as being owned by a settlor at death and as having their situs, for purposes of the succession tax, in the state of the settlor's domicile. Id., 336, 337. In order for a transfer to be subject to the succession tax under Subdiv., there must be a causal relationship between the settlor's intent and the taking effect in possession or enjoyment; the taking effect must be caused by an intentional act of the transferor, not by an independent act of someone else.

If such amounts payable after the death of the decedent under a plan above described are attributable to any extent to payments or contributions made by the decedent, no exclusion shall be allowed for that part of the value of such amounts in the proportion that the total payments or contributions made by the decedent bears to the total payments or contributions made. For purposes of the preceding sentence, contributions or payments made by the decedent's employer or former employer shall not be considered to be contributed by the decedent, if made to or in respect to a trust, plan or annuity exempt from federal income taxation under the United States Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(c)Exclusion from estate for value of payments receivable after decedent's death under Social Security, Railroad Retirement and certain survivor benefits for retired servicemen.There shall be excluded from the gross taxable estate the value of any payments receivable after the death of the decedent by other persons under the provisions of the Federal Social Security Act and the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, as the same have been and may be amended from time to time, and with respect to persons dying on or after June 8, 1978, the value of any annuity payments receivable by an eligible survivor, upon the death of a retired serviceman, under the “Retired Serviceman's Family Protection Plan” or the “Survivor Benefit Plan” for retired servicemen as provided in Chapter 73 of Title 10 of the United States Code, irrespective of whether such annuity payments are attributable to any extent to payments or contributions made by the decedent.\n\n(d)Exclusion from gross estate for value of payments receivable after decedent's death under self-employed pension plan established in accordance with Internal Revenue Code requirements.There shall be excluded from the gross taxable estate the value of any payments receivable after the death of the decedent by any beneficiary, other than the decedent's estate, under a pension plan for self-employed individuals as may be established pursuant to Section 401(c) of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations related thereto, and with respect to which payments to the credit of such plan were exempt from federal income tax.\n\n(e)Imposition of tax when farm land in gross estate, valued on basis of farm use for purposes of gross taxable estate, is sold or converted to other use within ten years after decedent's death.(1) If, within ten years immediately following the death of the decedent, real property in the gross estate of the decedent, classified as farm land in accordance with section 12-107c and the value of which, for purposes of the tax imposed under this chapter, was determined in accordance with provisions applicable to farm land in section 12-63 as provided in subsection (a) of this section, is transferred to anyone other than a beneficiary or distributee in class AA, A or B as provided in section 12-344 or is no longer classified as farm land in accordance with section 12-107c, such beneficiary or distributee shall be liable for a tax applicable to such transfer or change in classification. Said tax shall be in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of tax paid under this chapter with respect to such farm land and the amount of tax which would have been paid if such farm land had been assessed at fair market value for purposes of determining the amount of tax under this chapter, and accordingly, the succession tax return of the decedent shall include, in such manner as required by the Commissioner of Revenue Services for purposes of this section, a declaration, prescribed as to form by the Commissioner of Revenue Services and bearing notice to the effect that false statements made in such declaration are punishable, as to the fair market value of such farm land, based on its highest and best use value, as of the date of death of the decedent. Said tax shall be paid to the Commissioner of Revenue Services within sixty days following the date of such transfer or change in classification, and if not so paid shall bear interest at the rate of twelve per cent per annum, commencing at the expiration of such sixty days, until paid. The Commissioner of Revenue Services may, for cause shown, on written application of the beneficiary or distributee, filed with said commissioner at or before the expiration of such sixty days, extend the time for payment of said tax or any part thereof.\n\n(2) Said tax imposed under the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be a lien in favor of the state of Connecticut upon such real property so valued as farm land for purposes of determining the gross estate of the decedent as provided in subsection (a) of this section and, following the death of the decedent, transferred or changed in respect to use, resulting in a change in the classification of such property as farm land so as to be subject to said tax, from the date on which such transfer or change in classification becomes effective until (A) the expiration of ten years immediately following the death of the decedent, if there has been no such transfer or change in classification during said period of ten years or (B) in the event of such a transfer or change in classification resulting in the imposition of tax as provided in said subdivision (1), payment of any tax due in accordance with this subdivision plus interest and costs that may accrue in addition thereto, provided such lien shall not be valid as against any lienor, mortgagee, judgment creditor or bona fide purchaser, when they have no notice, unless and until notice of such lien is filed or recorded in the town clerk's office or place where mortgages, liens and conveyances of such property are required by statute to be filed or recorded.\n\n(3) Where real property classified at the time of the decedent's death as farm land in accordance with section 12-107c is owned by a partnership, corporation or trust engaged in farming or agricultural operations, and, at the time of the decedent's death, the sole partners, shareholders or beneficiaries, as the case may be, of such partnership, corporation or trust, are the decedent and any persons who would be classified as transferees under class AA, A or B as provided in section 12-344, whether or not such persons are in fact beneficiaries or distributees of the decedent, any transfer of an interest in such partnership, corporation or trust to anyone other than a beneficiary or distributee in class AA, A or B as provided in section 12-344 shall be treated in the same manner for purposes of this chapter as a transfer of real property in the gross estate classified as farm land in accordance with section 12-107c to anyone other than a beneficiary or distributee in class AA, A or B as provided in section 12-344. Any change in the use of such farm land, by such partnership, corporation or trust, so that it is no longer classified as farm land in accordance with section 12-107c shall be treated in the same manner for purposes of this chapter as a change in the use of real property in the gross estate classified as farm land in accordance with section 12-107c, by the decedent's beneficiaries or distributees in class AA, A or B as provided in section 12-344, so that it is no longer so classified.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 2029; 1961, P.A. 511, S. 1; February, 1965, P.A. 312, S. 1; 1972, P.A. 265, S. 8; P.A. 78-267, S. 1, 3; 78-303, S. 85, 136; 78-371, S. 1, 6; P.A. 87-459, S. 1, 2; P.A. 98-244, S. 14, 35; P.A. 00-174, S. 59, 83.)\n\nHistory: 1961 act added provisions regarding exclusion of certain annuities from gross estate; 1965 act excluded value of payments receivable after decedent's death by other persons under Social Security Act or Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, as amended, applicable to estates of persons dying on or after July 1, 1975 (all estates not within provisions of section are subject to succession or inheritance tax laws applicable before that date and continued in effect for that purpose); 1972 act deleted inclusion, in case of resident transferor, of “all gains made ... in reducing to possession choses in action, including notes and mortgages but not including corporate or governmental stock or bonds nor including income accruing after death”, effective May 18, 1972, but retroactive to January 1, 1972, and applicable to estates of persons dying on or after that date (all estates of persons dying before January 1, 1972, are subject to succession tax laws applicable before that date and continued in force for that purpose); P.A. 78-267 excluded, on or after June 8, 1978, value of annuity payments receivable by eligible survivor under retired servicemen plans listed; P.A. 78-303 allowed substitution of commissioner of revenue services for tax commissioner pursuant to provisions of P.A. 77-614; P.A. 78-371 included provisions for determining tax on farm land and added Subsecs.

Copies of such computation shall be filed, and further proceedings taken in connection therewith, in accordance with the provisions of section 12-367. If, after such first computation and upon the determination of any of the contingencies, any part of the estate so passes as to lead to a lower tax, and if the fiduciary, within two years of such determination, notifies the Commissioner of Revenue Services thereof, the Commissioner of Revenue Services shall forthwith recompute the whole tax in the same manner as would have been done originally had the outcome of the contingencies in question been known. Copies of such recomputation shall be filed, and further proceedings taken in connection therewith, in accordance with the provisions of section 12-367. Upon the final determination of the amount of tax due on the recomputation the commissioner shall certify to the Comptroller that a refund is due in an amount equal to the difference between the tax paid at the highest rate and the tax actually due as shown by the recomputation. Before certifying to the Comptroller that a refund is due, the commissioner shall determine whether any additional estate tax is due under section 12-391 on account of such recomputation, and, if the commissioner so determines, the commissioner shall reduce, but not below zero, the amount of the refund otherwise due by the amount of such additional estate tax. Such refund, as so reduced, shall bear interest at the rate of five per cent compounded annually from the date of payment of the original tax to the date of the determination of the contingencies and shall be paid by the Treasurer, on the order of the Comptroller, to the trustee or other proper fiduciary, who shall distribute it ratably among the several beneficiaries equitably entitled to it.

Unless such fiduciary or transferee concedes the correctness of the Commissioner of Revenue Services' opinion or the Commissioner of Revenue Services withdraws his objection, the Commissioner of Revenue Services, fiduciary or transferee may file in the court of probate for the district within which the transferor resided at the date of his death or, if the transferor died a nonresident of this state, in the court of probate for the district within which the real estate or tangible personal property is situated, an application for a hearing upon those items set out in such return as to which the Commissioner of Revenue Services objects. Such court shall assign a time and place for a hearing upon the Commissioner of Revenue Services' objections to the return or amendment thereto and shall cause a copy of the order of hearing to be sent to the Commissioner of Revenue Services, such fiduciary or transferee and all other parties in interest at least fifteen days before the time of such hearing. The commissioner or any other party in interest may appear before such court at such hearing and be heard concerning the objections of the Commissioner of Revenue Services. If there is no appearance on behalf of the commissioner and it appears to the court that his position with respect to any matter in dispute ought not to be sustained, such hearing shall be adjourned for not less than ten days and notice of the time and place of such adjourned hearing shall be given to the commissioner, who may appear and be heard thereon. At such hearing, or adjournment thereof, the court shall hear such objections and determine the fair market value of any property, the reported value of which has been objected to, and the taxability of any transfer objected to and shall enter upon its records a decree determining the fair market value of property the value of which has been objected to and the taxability of any transfer which has been objected to. The decree of such court shall be conclusive upon the state and all other parties in interest unless an appeal is taken as provided for appeals from other decrees and orders of such court. A copy of such decree shall be forwarded forthwith to the commissioner and to the fiduciary or transferee by the judge or clerk of such court.

Such application shall set forth the extension desired and the reasons therefor and a copy thereof shall be filed in the court of probate for the district within which the transferor resided at the date of his death or, if the transferor died a nonresident of this state, in the court of probate for the district within which the real estate or tangible personal property is situated. Unless, not later than sixty days after his receipt of such application, the Commissioner of Revenue Services files in the court of probate, a copy of his order denying or modifying the extension requested, the extension requested shall be deemed granted. If the extension request is denied or modified, the fiduciary may not later than thirty days of the receipt of such order from the Commissioner of Revenue Services, file in such court of probate an application for an extension of time to file the return setting forth the extension desired and the reasons therefor. The court of probate shall assign a time and place for a hearing upon such application not less than two nor more than four weeks after the filing thereof and shall cause a copy of the order of hearing to be sent to the commissioner and to the fiduciary or transferee at least ten days before the time of such hearing.

Such court, after such hearing, shall forthwith send to the Commissioner of Revenue Services and the fiduciary or transferee a copy of any order extending or denying extension of the time for filing such return. Further extensions may be granted by the Commissioner of Revenue Services or probate court if the foregoing provisions are complied with and if written application for such further extension is filed before the expiration of the preceding extension. Failure on the part of any fiduciary to file such return within the time herein prescribed therefor shall be sufficient cause for the summary removal of such fiduciary upon the application of the Commissioner of Revenue Services or any interested person.\n\n(d)Transferee defined.As used in this chapter the word transferee shall include, but not be limited to, a donee and a beneficiary under a will, trust or power of appointment or under the laws of this state relating to descent and distribution.\n\n(e)Applicability.The provisions of this section shall not apply to estates of decedents dying on or after January 1, 2005.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 2040; 1953, S. 1147d; 1967, P.A. 558, S. 48; 1969, P.A. 676; 1971, P.A. 863, S. 5; June, 1971, P.A. 5, S. 118; 1972, P.A. 265, S. 3–5; P.A. 74-338, S. 40, 94; P.A. 77-614, S. 139, 610; P.A. 78-195, S. 1, 4; P.A. 90-148, S. 15, 34; P.A. 95-298, S. 2, 3; P.A. 00-174, S. 60, 83; June Sp.

If the Commissioner of Revenue Services has not filed an objection to the valuations or concessions of taxability appearing on the return as provided in section 12-359, he shall, within one hundred twenty days of his receipt of the return required by the provisions of said section 12-359, if such return is correctly made out, or if he has filed such objection, within sixty days of his withdrawal of such objection or within sixty days of a final determination by the Probate Court of such objection, prepare a computation of the tax and, if the tax due is found to be ten dollars or more, file a copy thereof with the Court of Probate and mail a copy to the fiduciary or transferee, as the case may be.\n\n(b) Within sixty days after the mailing of the computation by the Commissioner of Revenue Services, the fiduciary or transferee or any other party in interest may make written application to the Probate Court for a hearing upon the determination of the tax or the computation thereof. Such application shall set forth in detail the objection to the determination or computation of the tax and a copy of same shall be mailed to the commissioner at the time of filing. The Probate Court shall assign a time and place for a hearing upon such application not less than two nor more than four weeks after receipt thereof and shall cause a copy of the order of hearing to be sent to the Commissioner of Revenue Services and to the fiduciary or transferee and to all other parties in interest at least ten days before the time of such hearing. The commissioner or any person interested may appear before such court at such hearing and be heard on any matter involved in the determination of the tax or the computation thereof, including, if no hearing has been held previously under the provisions of subsection (b) of section 12-359, any matter which could have been heard at such a hearing. If there is no appearance on behalf of the commissioner and it appears to the court that such computation ought to be modified, such hearing shall be adjourned for not less than ten days and notice of the time and place of such adjourned hearing and of any proposed change in such computation shall be given to the commissioner, who may appear and be heard thereon. At such hearing, or adjournment thereof, the court shall determine all matters properly before it, including the amount of such tax and shall enter upon its records a decree for such amount. A copy of the decree of the Probate Court shall be forwarded forthwith to the commissioner and the fiduciary or transferee by the judge or clerk of such court. Subject only to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section, the computation of the tax by the Commissioner of Revenue Services shall be conclusive upon the state and all persons interested unless a hearing is held thereon as herein provided, in which case the decree of the Probate Court shall be conclusive upon the state and all persons interested unless an appeal is taken as provided for appeals from other decrees and orders of such court.\n\n(c) If the fiduciary or transferee fails to file the return required by the provisions of section 12-359 within the time prescribed therefor, the Commissioner of Revenue Services may assess and compute the tax upon the best information obtainable, and file a copy of such computation with the Probate Court and mail a copy thereof to the fiduciary or transferee, as the case may be. Further proceedings upon such computation shall be taken in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section and section 12-359.\n\n(d) The Commissioner of Revenue Services may authorize a refund of an overpayment of such tax made because (1) property was incorrectly included in the gross taxable estate because of a mistake or error or (2) an item in an amount exceeding five hundred dollars which would have been allowed as a deduction, in the determination of net estate for purposes of the tax imposed under this chapter, is discovered after the tax computation in accordance with this section has been made and the appeal period provided for in chapter 796 has run, if a claim for refund is filed with the Commissioner of Revenue Services and the Probate Court by the fiduciary or a transferee who has paid the tax within two years after the computation or the decree provided for in subsection (b) of this section determining the amount of the tax in which the overpayment is included or within two years of the date of the computation rendered by the Commissioner of Revenue Services pursuant to a compromise agreement as provided for in section 12-355, determining the tax in which the overpayment is included. Within ninety days of his receipt of such claim for refund the Commissioner of Revenue Services shall file with the Court of Probate and mail to the fiduciary or transferee a revised computation of the tax or a notice of the rejection of the claim for refund. Further proceedings upon such revised computation or rejection shall be taken in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section. If upon a recomputation of the tax a refund is found due by the Commissioner of Revenue Services or by the Probate Court upon a hearing as hereinbefore provided, the Commissioner of Revenue Services shall certify to the Comptroller that a refund is due in an amount equal to the difference between the tax paid and the tax actually due as shown by the recomputation, including any interest that may be payable as provided by section 12-376. Such refund shall be paid by the Treasurer, on the order of the Comptroller, to the fiduciary or transferee who shall distribute it ratably among the several beneficiaries equitably entitled to it.\n\n(e) In any case in which property of the decedent is discovered after the tax computation has been made and the appeal period provided for in sections 45a186 to 45a193, inclusive, has run, the fiduciary shall not be required to file an amendment to its tax return or to pay any additional tax that would be attributable to such afterdiscovered assets unless such additional tax equals or exceeds one hundred dollars.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 2044; 1955, S. 1150d; February, 1965, P.A. 410, S. 1; 1971, P.A. 863, S. 7; 1972, P.A. 265, S. 6.; P.A. 77-614, S. 139, 610; P.A. 78-167, S. 6, 7; 78-195, S. 2, 4; P.A. 85-356, S. 6, 9; P.A. 86-10, S. 1, 3; 86-116, S. 1, 3; P.A. 88-295, S. 1, 2; P.A. 99-121, S. 10, 28.)\n\nHistory: 1965 act added Subsec.
