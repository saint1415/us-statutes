      "text": "(a) The surcharge imposed by section 12-665 shall be at a rate of one dollar for each day, or portion thereof, up to thirty days, for which the lessor charges the lessee for the rental or lease of such a motor vehicle.\n\n(b) Reimbursement for the surcharge imposed by section 12-665 shall be collected by the lessor from the lessee and such surcharge reimbursement, termed “surcharge” in this subsection, shall be paid by the consumer to the retailer and each retailer shall collect from the consumer the full amount of the surcharge imposed by section 12-665. Such surcharge shall be a debt from the lessee to the lessor, when so added to the original lease or rental price, and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as other debts. Whenever such surcharge, payable by the consumer with respect to a charge account or credit sale is remitted by the retailer to the commissioner and such sale as an account receivable is determined to be worthless and is actually written off as uncollectible for federal income tax purposes, the amount of such surcharge remitted may be credited against the surcharge due on the surcharge return filed by the retailer for the monthly or quarterly period, whichever is applicable, next following the period in which such amount is actually so written off, but in no event shall such credit be allowed later than three years following the date such surcharge is remitted. The commissioner shall, by regulations adopted in accordance with chapter 54, provide standards for proving any such claim for credit. If any account with respect to which such credit is allowed is thereafter collected by the retailer in whole or in part, the amount so collected shall be included in the surcharge return covering the period in which such collection occurs.\n\n(P.A. 92-184, S. 6, 19; P.A. 93-166, S. 1, 2.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 92-184, S. 6 effective July 1, 1992, and applicable to rentals or leases of motor vehicles entered into on or after that date; P.A. 93-166 amended description of “day, or portion thereof,” in Subsec.

      "text": "(a) The surcharge imposed by this chapter is due and payable to the commissioner monthly on or before the last day of the month next succeeding each monthly period except that every person whose total surcharge liability for the twelve-month period ended on the preceding September thirtieth was less than four thousand dollars shall file returns and pay the surcharge on a quarterly basis. “Quarterly” means a period of three calendar months commencing on the first day of January, April, July or October of each year or, if any seller commences business on a date other than the first day of January, April, July or October, a period beginning on the date of commencement of business and ending on March thirty-first, June thirtieth, September thirtieth or December thirty-first, respectively.\n\n(b) On or before the last day of the month following each monthly or quarterly period, as the case may be, a return for the preceding period shall be filed with the commissioner in such form as the commissioner may prescribe. Returns shall be signed by the person required to file the return or by his authorized agent but need not be verified by oath, provided a return required to be filed by a corporation shall be signed by an officer of such corporation.\n\n(c) The return shall show the number and rental period of all vehicles leased by the lessor during the preceding reporting period. The return shall also show the amount of the surcharges for the period covered by the return in such manner as the commissioner may require and such other information as the commissioner deems necessary for the proper administration of this chapter.\n\n(d) Any person who fails to pay the surcharge imposed by this chapter to the state or any amount of surcharge required to be collected and paid to the state within the time required shall pay a penalty of fifteen per cent of the surcharge or fifty dollars, whichever amount is greater, in addition to the surcharge or amount of the surcharge, plus interest at the rate of one per cent per month or fraction thereof from the due date of such surcharge or amount of surcharge required to be collected to the date of payment. Subject to the provisions of section 12-3a, the commissioner may waive all or any part of the penalties provided under this chapter when it is proven to the satisfaction of the commissioner that failure to pay any surcharge was due to reasonable cause and was not intentional or due to neglect.\n\n(e) The commissioner, if the commissioner deems it necessary in order to ensure payment to or facilitate the collection by the state of the amount of surcharges, may permit or require returns and payment of the amount of surcharges for other than monthly or quarterly periods.\n\n(f) The commissioner for good cause may extend the time for making any return and paying any amount required to be paid under this chapter if a written request therefor is filed with the commissioner together with a tentative return which must be accompanied by a payment of the surcharge, which shall be estimated in such tentative return, on or before the last day for filing the return. Any person to whom an extension is granted shall pay, in addition to the surcharge, interest at the rate of one per cent per month or fraction thereof from the date on which the surcharge would have been due without the extension until the date of payment.\n\n(g) The proceeds from the surcharge imposed by this chapter shall be deposited in the General Fund.\n\n(P.A. 92-184, S. 7, 19; P.A. 94-95, S. 16; P.A. 95-26, S. 37, 52; June 30 Sp.
