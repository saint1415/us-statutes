      "text": "(a) As used in this section: (1) “Trading stamp” means any stamp or similar device issued in connection with the retail sale of merchandise or service, as a cash discount or for any other marketing purpose, which entitles the rightful holder, on its presentation for redemption, to receive merchandise, service or cash. “Trading stamp” shall not mean any redeemable device used by the manufacturer or packer of an article, in advertising or selling it, or any redeemable device issued and redeemed by a newspaper, magazine or other publication; (2) “trading stamp company” means any person engaged in distributing trading stamps for retail issuance by others, or in redeeming trading stamps for retailers, in any manner; and (3) “person” means any individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, association or other organization.\n\n(b) No trading stamp company shall distribute or redeem trading stamps issued after October 1, 1959, in this state unless (1) each stamp has legibly printed upon its face in cents or any fraction thereof a cash value determined by the company and (2) the holders may, at their option, redeem the stamps in cash when duly presented to the company for redemption in a number having an aggregate cash value of not less than twenty-five cents.\n\n(c) No trading stamp company shall distribute trading stamps in this state or shall redeem trading stamps issued after October 1, 1959, therein until it has, on or before January first annually, paid to the Secretary of the State a license fee of one per cent of the principal sum of the bond required to be filed under subdivision (2) of this subsection and has filed with said secretary: (1) A statement of registration accompanied by representative samples of its stamps, stamp collection books, stamp redemption catalogs and stamp distribution and redemption agreement forms, currently used in this state. Each such statement shall provide the following information: (A) The name and principal address of the company; (B) the state of its incorporation or origin; (C) the names and addresses of its principal officers, partners or proprietors; (D) the address of its principal office in this state; (E) the name and address of its principal officer, employee or agent therein; (F) the addresses of the places where its stamps are redeemable therein; (G) a short form of its balance sheet as of the end of its last fiscal year prior to such filing, certified by an independent public accountant; and (H) unless the principal sum of the bond required by subdivision (2) of this subsection to be filed by the company is the maximum amount required under subsection (d), a statement of its gross income from its business in this state as a trading stamp company during such last fiscal year, certified by an independent public accountant; and (2) a bond payable to this state and executed by the company and a corporate surety qualified to do business in this state, which is conditioned upon the performance by the company of its obligation to redeem trading stamps issued by retailers in this state, when they are presented for redemption by the rightful holders. Each trading stamp company shall notify the Secretary of the State of any change in the addresses of the places where its stamps are redeemable in this state within ten days of any such change. If the company defaults in performing such obligations, all rightful holders of trading stamps of such company, including retailers in possession of such stamps for issuance to customers, shall be entitled to make claim against said bond. Any such holder may, within three months after such default, file a complaint with the Secretary of the State, who shall forthwith make a determination whether there has been a default. If said secretary determines that there has been such a default, he shall give notice of such determination to the company and, if such default is not corrected within ten days, he shall publish notice of such default in three consecutive publications of one or more newspapers having general circulation throughout this state and therein require that proof of all claims for redemption of the trading stamps of such company be filed with him, together with the trading stamps upon which the claim is based, within three months after the date of the first such publication. Said secretary promptly after the expiration of such period shall determine the validity of all claims so filed. Thereupon said secretary shall be paid by the surety such amount, not exceeding in the aggregate the principal sum of the bond, as is necessary to satisfy all valid claims so filed together with reasonable administrative expenses incident to the determination and payment of such claims. Said secretary shall promptly thereafter make an equitable distribution of the proceeds of the bond, less such reasonable administrative expenses, to such claimants and shall destroy the trading stamps so surrendered. If the amount paid by the surety is not sufficient to satisfy in full all valid claims and administrative expenses, the secretary may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the trading stamp company to recover, on behalf of the claimants, the difference between the aggregate value of such claims, including such administrative expenses, and the amount paid by the surety.\n\n(d) The principal sum of the bond to be filed shall be as follows: If the company has not previously done business as a trading stamp company in this state, or if the company's gross income from such business in this state during its last fiscal year was not in excess of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, thirty-five thousand dollars; if such gross income exceeded two hundred and fifty thousand dollars but did not exceed five hundred thousand dollars, fifty thousand dollars; if such gross income exceeded five hundred thousand dollars but was not in excess of seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars, seventy-five thousand dollars; and if such gross income exceeded seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars, one hundred thousand dollars. On the effective date of each new bond, any and all liability on all bonds previously filed under the provision of subsection (c) shall terminate, and all rightful holders of trading stamps who prosecute their claims under said subsection shall prosecute such claims solely against the new bond and only by filing proofs of claim with the Secretary of the State in the manner provided in said subsection.\n\n(e) No trading stamp company shall cease or suspend the redemption of trading stamps in this state without filing with the Secretary of the State at least ninety days' prior written notice of its intention so to do and concurrently mailing a copy of such notice to each retailer within this state which has at any time theretofore within one year issued trading stamps which the company is obligated to redeem.\n\n(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b), a trading stamp company may redeem trading stamps if issued within the state prior to October 1, 1959, notwithstanding the fact that any such trading stamp does not have legibly printed upon its face in cents or any fraction thereof a cash value as determined by such trading stamp company.\n\n(g) No person shall issue to his customers in connection with the sale of merchandise any trading stamp, coupon or similar device which has previously been issued in such connection by any other person responsible for the redemption thereof, unless the consent of the latter has been first obtained.\n\n(h) The Secretary of the State shall investigate compliance with this section and shall notify the Attorney General of any violations of which he may have knowledge. Any trading stamp company which violates any provision of this section shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars, and the Superior Court shall have jurisdiction in equity on the complaint of any interested person to restrain and enjoin the violation of any of said provisions.\n\n(1959, P.A. 528, S. 1–8; 1961, P.A. 320; 1967, P.A. 640; 747; P.A. 95-79, S. 160, 189.)\n\nHistory: 1961 act amended Subsec. (c) re payment of administrative expenses from bond proceeds and added provision re court action against trading stamp company to recover claims not paid by surety; 1967 acts raised bond for companies which have not previously done business in state or which had gross income of $250,000 or less from $25,000 to $35,000 in Subsec. (d), required that trading stamp company notify secretary of the state of change in address of any redemption location within ten days in Subsec. (c) and added provision in Subsec. (h) re secretary of the state's duty to investigate compliance and notify attorney general of violations; P.A. 95-79 amended Subsec. (a) to redefine “person” to include a limited liability company, effective May 31, 1995.\n\nCited. 153 C. 213.",

In order to promote the public interest and public welfare, to avoid undue control of the dealer by suppliers, to foster and keep alive vigorous and healthy competition for the benefit of the public by prohibiting practices through which fair and honest competition is destroyed or prevented, to promote the public safety, to prevent deterioration of facilities for servicing motor vehicles on the highways of the state, to prevent dealers from unnecessarily going out of business thereby resulting in unemployment with loss of tax revenue to the state and its resultant undesirable consequences, and to offset evident abuses within the petroleum industry as a result of inequitable economic power, it is necessary to legislate standards pursuant to the exercise of the police power of this state governing the relationship between suppliers and distributors of gasoline and petroleum products and the dealers within the state who sell those products to the public.\n\n(b) In recognition of the factors set forth in subsection (a) of this section, it is provided that all provisions of sections 42-133j to 42-133n, inclusive, to the extent permitted by law, shall be deemed effective as to those presently existing franchise agreements involving gasoline dealers within the state of Connecticut as of October 1, 1977.\n\n(c) The legislature further finds and declares that the distribution and sales of motor vehicle fuels and oils in the state of Connecticut affects the general economy of the state, the public interest and the public welfare. Competition, freedom from unreasonable restraints on alienation and competitive pricing are essential to the functioning of a fair and efficient free market economy within the petroleum industry. The legislature finds and declares that existing petroleum franchise agreements as defined and regulated within sections 42-133e to 42-133h, inclusive, uniformly prohibit assignment of franchise interests without the consent of the franchisor, which consent may be unreasonably and arbitrarily withheld. Also, existing petroleum franchise agreements provide for their automatic termination upon the death of the franchisee. The legislature finds and declares that such provisions constitute unreasonable restraints on alienation and inhibit the fair and efficient functioning of a free market economy within the petroleum industry. Therefore, it is provided that the provisions of any franchise agreement which prohibit assignment without the consent of the franchisor and permit such consent to be unreasonably withheld are void and without effect as contrary to public policy. It is further provided that the provisions of any franchise agreement which terminate the franchise automatically upon the death of the franchisee are void and ineffective as contrary to public policy. The legislature finds and declares that provisions in certain existing petroleum franchise agreements prohibit gasoline retailers or distributors from offering a discount to a buyer based upon the method of payment by such buyer for gasoline. The legislature finds and declares that such provisions constitute unreasonable restraints on competitive pricing and inhibit the fair and efficient functioning of a free market economy within the petroleum industry. Therefore, it is provided that the provisions of any franchise agreement that prohibit gasoline retailers or distributors from offering a discount to a buyer based upon the method of payment by such buyer for gasoline are void and without effect as contrary to public policy.\n\n(P.A. 77-493, S. 1; June 11 Sp.

Compensation for labor used in warranty service shall be fair and reasonable, as determined by methods described in subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(b) The retail rate customarily charged by the dealer for parts shall be established by the dealer submitting to the manufacturer or distributor one hundred sequential nonwarranty customer-paid service repair orders which contain warranty-like parts, or sixty consecutive days of nonwarranty customer-paid service repair orders which contain warranty-like parts, whichever is less, covering repairs made no more than one hundred eighty days before the submission and declaring the average percentage markup. The average of the markup rates shall be presumed to be fair and reasonable, however, a manufacturer or distributor may, not later than thirty days after submission, rebut that presumption by reasonably substantiating that the rate is unfair and unreasonable in light of the practices of all other franchised motor vehicle dealers in the vicinity offering the same line-make vehicles.

If the dealer does not agree with the proposed average percentage markup, the dealer may file a protest with the commissioner not later than thirty days after receipt of that proposal by the manufacturer or distributor. If such a protest is filed, the commissioner shall inform the manufacturer or distributor that a timely protest has been filed and that a hearing will be held on such protest. In any hearing held pursuant to this subsection, the manufacturer or distributor shall have the burden of proving that the rate declared by the dealer was unfair and unreasonable as described in this subsection and that the proposed adjustment of the average percentage markup is fair and reasonable pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(c) The retail rate customarily charged by the dealer for labor may be established by submitting to the manufacturer or distributor all nonwarranty customer-paid service repair orders covering repairs made during the month prior to the submission and dividing the amount of the dealer's total labor sales by the number of total labor hours that generated those sales. The average labor rate shall be presumed to be fair and reasonable, provided a manufacturer or distributor may, not later than thirty days after submission, rebut such presumption by reasonably substantiating that such rate is unfair and unreasonable in light of the practices of all other franchised motor vehicle dealers in the vicinity offering the same line-make vehicles.

The manufacturer or distributor shall allow the dealer to resubmit such claim according to reasonable manufacturer or distributor guidelines not later than thirty days after the initial claim denial or charge-back. If there is evidence of fraud, the provisions of this subsection shall not limit the right of a manufacturer or distributor to audit a dealer for longer periods of time and charge-back the dealer for any fraudulent claim. Dealers shall be required to maintain defective parts for a period of not longer than ninety days following submission of claims. All such claims shall be either approved or disapproved not later than thirty days after their receipt on forms, and in the manner specified by, the manufacturer or distributor.

      "text": "(a) In the event that a manufacturer or distributor seeks to enter into a franchise establishing a new dealer or relocating an existing dealer within or into a relevant market area where the same line make is then represented, the manufacturer or distributor shall in writing, by certified mail, first notify the commissioner and each dealer in such line make in the relevant market area of its intention to establish a new dealer or to relocate an existing dealer within or into that market area. Within twenty days of receiving such notice or within twenty days after the end of any appeal procedure provided by the manufacturer or distributor, any such dealer may file with the commissioner a protest concerning the proposed establishment or relocation of such new or existing dealer. When such a protest is filed, the commissioner shall inform the manufacturer or distributor that a timely protest has been filed, and that the manufacturer or distributor shall not establish or relocate the proposed dealer until the commissioner has held a hearing, nor thereafter, if the commissioner determines that there is good cause for denying the establishment or relocation of such dealer. In any hearing held pursuant to this section, the manufacturer or distributor has the burden of proving that good cause exists for permitting the proposed establishment or relocation. This section shall not apply to the sale, lease or transfer of ownership of an active, existing dealer, nor shall any provision of this section prohibit a manufacturer from entering into a franchise arrangement with a successor dealer at the same location.\n\n(b) This section shall not apply to (1) the relocation of an existing dealer within that dealer's area of responsibility under its franchise, provided that the relocation shall not be at a site within six miles of a licensed dealer for the same line make of motor vehicle, (2) the appointment of a dealer in the same relevant market area, within one year, at either the same location or within a two-mile radius from a predecessor dealer who ceased operations, or (3) the sale of new or used motor vehicles by a licensed new motor vehicle dealer at a public display of motor vehicles sponsored by an association of licensed new motor vehicle dealers representing more than seventy-five per cent of such dealers in the state. Such display shall be permitted annually, for a period not exceeding four consecutive days.\n\n(c) In determining whether good cause has been established for not entering into a franchise establishing a new dealer or relocating an existing dealer for the same line make, the commissioner shall take into consideration the existing circumstances, including, but not limited to: (1) The permanency and size of investment made and the reasonable obligations incurred by the existing new motor vehicle dealers in the relevant market area; (2) growth or decline in population and new car registrations in the relevant market area; (3) effect on the consuming public in the relevant market area; (4) whether it is injurious or beneficial to the public welfare for a new dealer to be established; (5) whether the dealers of the same line make in that relevant market area are providing adequate competition and convenient customer care for the motor vehicles of the line make in the market area including the adequacy of motor vehicle sales and service facilities, equipment, supply of motor vehicle parts, and qualified service personnel; (6) whether the establishment of a new dealer would increase or decrease competition; (7) the effect on the relocating dealer of a denial of its relocation into the relevant market area; (8) whether the establishment or relocation of the proposed dealership appears to be warranted and justified based on economic and marketing conditions pertinent to dealers competing in the community or territory, including anticipated future changes; (9) the reasonably expected market penetration of the line-maker motor vehicle for the community or territory involved, after consideration of all factors which may affect said penetration, including, but not limited to, demographic factors such as age, income, education, size class preference, product popularity, retail lease transactions, or other factors affecting sales to consumers of the community or territory; (10) the economic impact of an additional franchise or relocated motor vehicle dealership upon the existing motor vehicle dealers of the same line make in the relevant market area to be served by the additional franchisee or relocated motor vehicle dealership; and (11) the retail sales and service business transacted by the existing dealers of the same line make in the market area to be served by the proposed new or relocated dealer as compared to the business available to them during the three-year period immediately preceding notice.\n\n(d) The commissioner shall conduct the hearing and render his final determination within one hundred eighty days after a protest is filed. Unless waived by the parties, failure to do so shall be deemed a determination that good cause does not exist for refusing to permit the proposed new or relocated dealer, unless such delay is caused by acts of the manufacturer or distributor or the relocating or new dealer.\n\n(e) Any parties to a hearing by the commissioner concerning the establishing or relocating of a dealer may appeal any decision or order of the commissioner in accordance with section 4-183.\n\n(P.A. 82-445, S. 13, 15; P.A. 83-198, S. 10, 11; P.A. 84-463; P.A. 93-234, S. 2; P.A. 02-70, S. 45; P.A. 10-110, S. 32.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 83-198 subjected distributors to the provisions of this section; P.A. 84-463 changed reference from additional dealerships to new dealerships and excluded franchise agreements and transfers of existing dealerships from the provisions of this section; P.A. 93-234 made technical changes, required that notice requirement in Subsec.
