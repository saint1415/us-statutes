No person shall be entitled to receive a greater number of rain checks per item than is allowed under the retailer's advertised limit. If a rain check is not redeemed by the retailer within sixty days after its issuance, the retailer shall offer the holder of a rain check similar or comparable merchandise at or below the advertised sale price of the merchandise which was the subject of the sale. If the holder of a rain check wishes to purchase such similar or comparable merchandise, he shall do so within ten days of the retailer's offer to substitute comparable merchandise.\n\n(P.A. 86-302, S. 2.)",
