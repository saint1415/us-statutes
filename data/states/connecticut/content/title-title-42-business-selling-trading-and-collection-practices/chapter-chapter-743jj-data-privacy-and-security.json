A consumer may designate an authorized agent in accordance with section 42-519 to exercise the rights of such consumer to opt out of the processing of such consumer's personal data for purposes of subdivision (5) of subsection (a) of this section on behalf of the consumer. In the case of processing personal data of a known child, the parent or legal guardian may exercise such consumer rights on the child's behalf.

If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive, the controller may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or decline to act on the request. The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive nature of the request.\n\n(4) If a controller is unable to authenticate a request to exercise any of the rights afforded under subdivisions (1) to (4), inclusive, of subsection (a) of this section using commercially reasonable efforts, the controller shall not be required to comply with a request to initiate an action pursuant to this section and shall provide notice to the consumer that the controller is unable to authenticate the request to exercise such right or rights until such consumer provides additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate such consumer and such consumer's request to exercise such right or rights. A controller shall not be required to authenticate an opt-out request, but a controller may deny an opt-out request if the controller has a good faith, reasonable and documented belief that such request is fraudulent. If a controller denies an opt-out request because the controller believes such request is fraudulent, the controller shall send a notice to the person who made such request disclosing that such controller believes such request is fraudulent, why such controller believes such request is fraudulent and that such controller shall not comply with such request.\n\n(5) A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other than the consumer shall be deemed in compliance with a consumer's request to delete such data pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section by (A) retaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary for the purpose of ensuring the consumer's personal data remains deleted from the controller's records and not using such retained data for any other purpose pursuant to the provisions of sections 42-515 to 42-525, inclusive, or (B) opting the consumer out of the processing of such personal data for any purpose except for those exempted pursuant to the provisions of sections 42-515 to 42-525, inclusive.\n\n(d) A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the controller's refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after the consumer's receipt of the decision. The appeal process shall be conspicuously available and similar to the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to this section. Not later than sixty days after receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or other method through which the consumer may contact the Attorney General to submit a complaint.\n\n(P.A. 22-15, S. 4.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 22-15 effective July 1, 2023.",

A controller shall not discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights contained in sections 42-515 to 42-525, inclusive, including denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services or providing a different level of quality of goods or services to the consumer.\n\n(b) Nothing in subsection (a) of this section shall be construed to require a controller to provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer which the controller does not collect or maintain, or prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if the offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts or club card program.\n\n(c) A controller shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible, clear and meaningful privacy notice that includes: (1) The categories of personal data processed by the controller; (2) the purpose for processing personal data; (3) how consumers may exercise their consumer rights, including how a consumer may appeal a controller's decision with regard to the consumer's request; (4) the categories of personal data that the controller shares with third parties, if any; (5) the categories of third parties, if any, with which the controller shares personal data; and (6) an active electronic mail address or other online mechanism that the consumer may use to contact the controller.\n\n(d) If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal data for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose such processing, as well as the manner in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt out of such processing.\n\n(e) (1) A controller shall establish, and shall describe in a privacy notice, one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a request to exercise their consumer rights pursuant to sections 42-515 to 42-525, inclusive. Such means shall take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of such requests and the ability of the controller to verify the identity of the consumer making the request. A controller shall not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise consumer rights, but may require a consumer to use an existing account. Any such means shall include:\n\n(A) (i) Providing a clear and conspicuous link on the controller's Internet web site to an Internet web page that enables a consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to opt out of the targeted advertising or sale of the consumer's personal data; and\n\n(ii) Not later than January 1, 2025, allowing a consumer to opt out of any processing of the consumer's personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, or any sale of such personal data, through an opt-out preference signal sent, with such consumer's consent, by a platform, technology or mechanism to the controller indicating such consumer's intent to opt out of any such processing or sale. Such platform, technology or mechanism shall:\n\n(I) Not unfairly disadvantage another controller;\n\n(II) Not make use of a default setting, but, rather, require the consumer to make an affirmative, freely given and unambiguous choice to opt out of any processing of such consumer's personal data pursuant to sections 42-515 to 42-525, inclusive;\n\n(III) Be consumer-friendly and easy to use by the average consumer;\n\n(IV) Be as consistent as possible with any other similar platform, technology or mechanism required by any federal or state law or regulation; and\n\n(V) Enable the controller to accurately determine whether the consumer is a resident of this state and whether the consumer has made a legitimate request to opt out of any sale of such consumer's personal data or targeted advertising.\n\n(B) If a consumer's decision to opt out of any processing of the consumer's personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, or any sale of such personal data, through an opt-out preference signal sent in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision conflicts with the consumer's existing controller-specific privacy setting or voluntary participation in a controller's bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts or club card program, the controller shall comply with such consumer's opt-out preference signal but may notify such consumer of such conflict and provide to such consumer the choice to confirm such controller-specific privacy setting or participation in such program.\n\n(2) If a controller responds to consumer opt-out requests received pursuant to subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of this subsection by informing the consumer of a charge for the use of any product or service, the controller shall present the terms of any financial incentive offered pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for the retention, use, sale or sharing of the consumer's personal data.\n\n(P.A. 22-15, S. 6; P.A. 23-56, S. 4; 23-98, S. 6; 23-204, S. 207.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 22-15 effective July 1, 2023; P.A. 23-56 amended Subsec.

Such assistance shall include: (1) Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as is reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to consumer rights requests; (2) taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notification of a breach of security, as defined in section 36a-701b, of the system of the processor, in order to meet the controller's obligations; and (3) providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document data protection assessments.\n\n(b) A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the processor's data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller. The contract shall be binding and clearly set forth instructions for processing data, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing and the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract shall also require that the processor: (1) Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the data; (2) at the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law; (3) upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's compliance with the obligations in sections 42-515 to 42-525, inclusive; (4) after providing the controller an opportunity to object, engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data; and (5) allow, and cooperate with, reasonable assessments by the controller or the controller's designated assessor, or the processor may arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the processor's policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations under sections 42-515 to 42-525, inclusive, using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for such assessments. The processor shall provide a report of such assessment to the controller upon request.\n\n(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a controller or processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by virtue of such controller's or processor's role in the processing relationship, as described in sections 42-515 to 42-525, inclusive.\n\n(d) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed. A person who is not limited in such person's processing of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or who fails to adhere to such instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to a specific processing of data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a controller with respect to such processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under section 42-525.\n\n(P.A. 22-15, S. 7.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 22-15 effective July 1, 2023.",

For the purposes of this section, processing that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer includes: (1) The processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising; (2) the sale of personal data; (3) the processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, where such profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of (A) unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers, (B) financial, physical or reputational injury to consumers, (C) a physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs or concerns, of consumers, where such intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable person, or (D) other substantial injury to consumers; and (4) the processing of sensitive data.\n\n(b) Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with such processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce such risks. The controller shall factor into any such data protection assessment the use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data will be processed.\n\n(c) The Attorney General may require that a controller disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the Attorney General, and the controller shall make the data protection assessment available to the Attorney General. The Attorney General may evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in sections 42-515 to 42-525, inclusive. Data protection assessments shall be confidential and shall be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, as defined in section 1-200.
