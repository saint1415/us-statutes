No person shall be excused from attending and testifying or from producing books, records, correspondence, documents or other evidence in obedience to the subpoena of the commissioner, on the ground that the testimony or evidence required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture; but no individual shall be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter or thing concerning which he is compelled, after having claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce evidence, except that such individual so testifying shall not be exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying. Complaints, orders and other processes and papers of the commissioner may be served personally, by registered or certified mail, by telegraph or by leaving a copy thereof at the principal office or place of business of the person required to be served. The verified return of service shall be proof of such service. Witnesses summoned by the commissioner shall be paid the same fees and mileage allowances that are paid witnesses in the courts of this state, and witnesses whose depositions are taken and the person taking the same shall severally be entitled to the same fees as are paid for like services in the courts of this state. All processes of any court to which an application or petition may be made under this chapter may be served in the judicial district wherein the person or persons required to be served reside or may be found.\n\n(c) Any person who, without just cause, fails to attend and testify or to answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, correspondence, documents or other evidence, if it is within his power to do so, in obedience to a subpoena issued to him under this section, shall be fined not more than two hundred dollars and imprisoned not more than six months or both.\n\n(P.A. 73-493, S. 4; P.A. 78-280, S. 2, 127.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 78-280 substituted “judicial district” for “county” in Subsec.
