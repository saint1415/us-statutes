If such reserves are in excess of one-half of a provider's net worth, the reserves shall be held in trust by an independent trustee and certified annually as adequate by an actuary.\n\n(2) The extended warranty reimbursement insurance policy shall cover the obligations under the extended warranty sold by the extended warranty provider during the period of time that such provider's insurance policy is in force.\n\n(3) An insurer authorized to issue an extended warranty reimbursement insurance policy in this state shall, at the time the policy is filed with the Insurance Commissioner as set forth in subsection (c) of section 38a-676 and continuously thereafter: (A) Maintain a surplus as to policyholders and paid-in capital of not less than fifteen million dollars; (B) demonstrate to the satisfaction of said commissioner that the company maintains a ratio of net written premiums, wherever written, to a surplus as to policyholders and paid-in capital of not greater than three to one; and (C) annually file with the Insurance Commissioner copies of such insurer's audited financial statements, its National Association of Insurance Commissioners' Annual Statement and the actuarial certification required by and filed in such insurer's state of domicile.\n\n(e) An extended warranty provider shall submit to the Insurance Commissioner: (1) A copy of the extended warranty form issued by said provider; and (2) a copy of said provider's extended warranty reimbursement insurance policy form issued by an insurer authorized to do business in this state or a certification by a certified public accountant attesting to the adequacy of the reserves for claims reported on said provider's financial statements or contained in said provider's trust account.\n\n(f) (1) An extended warranty shall contain the name and address of the insurers insuring the obligations and liabilities of such warranty and instructions on how the buyer, or successor to the buyer's rights, of the product may file a claim with the insurer if the extended warranty provider fails to perform according to the terms of the extended warranty.\n\n(2) An insurer of an extended warranty shall not refuse to renew any policy unless such insurer or its agent shall send, by registered or certified mail or by mail evidenced by a certificate of mailing or delivery to the Insurance Commissioner, at least sixty days' advance notice of its intention not to renew.
