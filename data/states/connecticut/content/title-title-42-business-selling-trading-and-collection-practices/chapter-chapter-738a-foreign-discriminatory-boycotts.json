      "text": "It is the policy of the state of Connecticut to oppose restraints of trade and unfair trade practices in the form of discriminatory boycotts which are not specifically authorized by the law of the United States and which are fostered or imposed by foreign persons, foreign governments or international organizations against any domestic individual on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, sex, gender identity or expression, nationality or national origin. It is also the policy of the state to oppose any actions, including the formation or continuance of agreements, understandings or contractual arrangements, expressed or implied, which have the effect of furthering such discriminatory boycotts, in order that the peace, health, safety, prosperity and general welfare of all the inhabitants of the state may be protected and ensured. This chapter shall be deemed an exercise of the police power of the state for the protection of the people of this state and shall be administered and principally enforced by the Attorney General. The provisions of this chapter shall be construed liberally so as to effectuate this declaration of policy and the laws and Constitution of the United States, but nothing in this chapter shall be construed to infringe upon the right of the United States government to regulate interstate and foreign commerce.\n\n(P.A. 77-596, S. 1, 15; P.A. 11-55, S. 20.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 11-55 included in state policy opposing foreign discriminatory boycotts those boycotts against any domestic individual on basis of gender identity or expression.",
