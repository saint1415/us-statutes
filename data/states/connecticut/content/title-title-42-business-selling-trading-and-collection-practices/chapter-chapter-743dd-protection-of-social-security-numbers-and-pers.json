The application shall be made on forms provided by the commissioner and shall be accompanied by a certified copy of the court judgment obtained against the person or entity, together with a notarized affidavit, signed and sworn to by the individual, affirming that the individual: (1) Has complied with all the requirements of this subsection; (2) has obtained a judgment stating the amount thereof and the amount owing thereon at the date of application; and (3) except for a judgment obtained by the individual in small claims court, has caused to be issued a writ of execution upon such judgment, and the officer executing the same has made a return showing that no bank accounts or real property of the person or entity liable to be levied upon in satisfaction of the judgment could be found, or that the amount realized on the sale of them or of such of them as were found, under the execution, was insufficient to satisfy the actual damage portion of the judgment, or stating the amount realized and the balance remaining due on the judgment after application thereon of the amount realized. A true and attested copy of such executing officer's return, when required, shall be attached to such application and affidavit.\n\n(d) Upon receipt of such application together with such certified copy of the court judgment, notarized affidavit and true and attested copy of the executing officer's return, when required, the commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall inspect such documents for their veracity and upon a determination that such documents are complete and authentic, and a determination that the individual has not been paid, the commissioner shall order payment out of said account of the amount unpaid upon the judgment for actual damages and costs taxed by the court against the person or entity, exclusive of punitive damages.\n\n(e) Whenever an individual is awarded an order of restitution against any person or entity for loss or damages sustained by reason of a violation of section 42-470, 42-471a or 42-472b or any regulation adopted pursuant to section 42-472d in a proceeding brought by the Attorney General at the request of the commissioner pursuant to section 42-470 or 42-471 or in a proceeding brought by the Attorney General, such individual may, upon the final determination of, or expiration of time for appeal in connection with any such order of restitution, apply to the commissioner for an order directing payment out of said account of the amount unpaid upon the order of restitution. The commissioner may issue such order upon a determination that the individual has not been paid.\n\n(f) Before the commissioner shall issue any order directing payment out of the account to an individual pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall first notify the person or entity of the individual's application for an order directing payment out of the account and of the person or entity's right to a hearing to contest the disbursement in the event that the person or entity has already paid the individual. Such notice shall be given to the person or entity not later than fifteen days after the receipt by the commissioner of the individual's application for an order directing payment out of said account. If the person or entity requests a hearing in writing by certified mail not later than fifteen days after receipt of the notice from the commissioner, the commissioner shall grant such request and shall conduct a hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54. If the commissioner receives no written request by certified mail from the person or entity for a hearing not later than fifteen days after the person's or entity's receipt of such notice, the commissioner shall determine that the individual has not been paid, and the commissioner shall issue an order directing payment out of said account for the amount unpaid upon the judgment for actual damages and costs taxed by the court against the person or entity, exclusive of punitive damages, or for the amount unpaid upon the order of restitution.\n\n(g) The commissioner or the commissioner's designee may proceed against any person or entity for an order of restitution arising from loss or damages sustained by any individual by reason of such person's or entity's violation of any of the provisions of section 42-470, 42-471, 42-471a or 42-472b or any regulation adopted pursuant to section 42-472d. Any such proceeding shall be held in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54. In the course of such proceeding, the commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall decide whether to order restitution arising from such loss or damages, and whether to order payment out of said account. The commissioner or the commissioner's designee may hear complaints of all individuals submitting claims against a single person or entity in one proceeding.\n\n(h) No application for an order directing payment out of said account shall be made later than three years from the final determination of or expiration of time for appeal in connection with any judgment or order of restitution.\n\n(i) Whenever an individual satisfies the commissioner or the commissioner's designee that it is not practicable to comply with the requirements of subdivision (3) of subsection (c) of this section and that the individual has taken all reasonable steps to collect the amount of the judgment or the unsatisfied part thereof and has been unable to collect the same, said commissioner or said designee may, in his or her discretion, dispense with the necessity for complying with such requirement.\n\n(j) In order to preserve the integrity of said account, the commissioner, in his or her sole discretion, may order payment out of said account of an amount less than the actual loss or damages incurred by the individual or less than the order of restitution awarded by the commissioner or the Superior Court.\n\n(k) If the money deposited in said account is insufficient to satisfy any duly authorized claim or portion thereof, the commissioner shall, when sufficient money has been deposited in the account, satisfy such unpaid claims or portions thereof, in the order that such claims or portions thereof were originally determined.\n\n(l) When the commissioner has caused any sum to be paid from said account to an individual, the commissioner shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the individual up to the amount paid plus reasonable interest, and prior to receipt of any payment from said account, the individual shall assign all of this right, title and interest in the claim up to such amount to the commissioner, and any amount and interest recovered by the commissioner on the claim shall be deposited in said account.\n\n(m) If the commissioner orders the payment of any amount as a result of a claim against any party, said commissioner shall determine if the person or entity is possessed of assets liable to be sold or applied in satisfaction of the claim on said account. If the commissioner discovers any such assets, the Attorney General shall take any action necessary for the reimbursement of said account.\n\n(n) If the commissioner orders the payment of an amount as a result of a claim against any party, said commissioner may enter into an agreement with the party whereby the party agrees to repay said account in full in the form of periodic payments over a set period of time.\n\n(P.A. 09-239, S. 16.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 09-239 effective July 9, 2009.",
