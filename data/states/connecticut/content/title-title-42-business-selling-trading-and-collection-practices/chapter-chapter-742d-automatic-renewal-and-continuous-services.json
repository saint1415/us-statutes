For the purposes of subparagraphs (E) and (F) of this subdivision, “free gift” does not include a free promotional item or gift that a business gives to a consumer if such item or gift differs from the consumer goods or consumer services that are the subject of the consumer agreement between the business and the consumer.\n\n(2) Each business that is required to make any disclosure under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall:\n\n(A) If the consumer agreement is offered, or entered into, electronically or in writing, make such disclosure (i) in a manner that may be retained by the consumer, and (ii) in text that is (I) larger than the size of any surrounding text, or (II) the same size as the surrounding text but in a typeface, font or color that contrasts with such surrounding text or is set off from such surrounding text by symbols or other marks that draw the consumer's attention to such disclosure; or\n\n(B) If the consumer agreement is offered, or entered into, verbally or telephonically, make such disclosure in a volume and cadence that is readily audible to, and understandable by, the consumer.\n\n(c) No business that enters into, or offers to enter into, a consumer agreement that includes an automatic renewal provision or a continuous services provision shall charge the consumer's credit card, debit card or third-party payment account for any automatic renewal or continuous consumer services, regardless of whether such renewal or continuous consumer services are offered or provided at a promotional or discounted price, unless such business has obtained such consumer's affirmative consent to such renewal or continuous consumer services.\n\n(d) (1) Each business that enters into a consumer agreement online shall, if such agreement includes an automatic renewal provision or continuous services provision, allow the consumer to take any action necessary to prevent such automatic renewal or prevent or terminate such continuous consumer services online and without requiring such consumer to take any offline action to prevent such automatic renewal or prevent or terminate such continuous consumer services. No business that is subject to the provisions of this subdivision shall take any action to obstruct or delay a consumer's efforts to prevent automatic renewal of, or prevent or terminate provision of continuous consumer services under, a consumer agreement pursuant to this subdivision. Each business that is subject to the provisions of this subdivision shall enable a consumer to prevent automatic renewal of, or prevent or terminate provision of continuous consumer services under, a consumer agreement pursuant to this subdivision by way of:\n\n(A) A prominently displayed direct link or button, which may be located within the consumer's (i) account or profile, or (ii) device or user settings; or\n\n(B) An electronic mail message from the business to the consumer, which is immediately accessible by the consumer and to which the consumer may reply without obtaining any additional information.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding subdivision (1) of this subsection, a business may require a consumer who maintains an account with the business to enter the consumer's account information, or otherwise authenticate such consumer's identity, online before such consumer may take any action to prevent automatic renewal of, or prevent or terminate provision of continuous consumer services under, a consumer agreement pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection. No consumer who is unwilling or unable to enter the consumer's account information, or otherwise authenticate such consumer's identity, online under this subdivision shall be precluded from authenticating such consumer's identity, or taking action to prevent such automatic renewal or prevent or terminate provision of continuous consumer services, offline by any other method set forth in subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to create a private right of action.\n\n(P.A. 23-191, S. 1; 23-205, S. 156.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 23-205 amended Subsec.
