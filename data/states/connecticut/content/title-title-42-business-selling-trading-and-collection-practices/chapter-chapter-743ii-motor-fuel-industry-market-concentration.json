      "text": "(a) Any person conducting business in the motor fuel industry in this state that files merger, acquisition or any other information regarding market concentration in the motor fuel industry in this state with the Federal Trade Commission or the United States Department of Justice, in compliance with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, 15 USC 18a, shall simultaneously file a copy of the same information with the Attorney General of this state. For purposes of this section, “motor fuel” has the same meaning as provided in section 14-327a, and “person” has the same meaning as provided in subsection (k) of section 1-1.\n\n(b) After reviewing information filed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Attorney General may measure the market concentration and changes in market concentration in the motor fuel industry in this state due to such merger, acquisition or any other information. Such measurement shall include the use of the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index.\n\n(c) If the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index score determined pursuant to subsection (b) of this section is: (1) Between one thousand and one thousand eight hundred points and increases by more than one hundred points due to information disclosed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, or (2) equal to or greater than one thousand eight hundred points and increases by more than fifty points due to information disclosed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Attorney General may issue in writing and cause to be served upon any person, by subpoena duces tecum, a demand requiring such person to submit to him or her documentary material relevant to the scope of the Attorney General's investigation. For the purposes of this section, “documentary material” includes, but is not limited to, any information in a written, recorded or electronic form. In the event that the Federal Trade Commission or the United States Department of Justice utilize different Herfindahl-Hirshman Index scores than the specific scores cited in this subsection to measure market concentration and changes in market concentration in the motor fuel industry, the Attorney General shall utilize such different scores when determining if he or she will issue a written demand requiring the submission of documentary material pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(d) Such demand shall (1) state the nature of the investigation, (2) describe the class or classes of documentary material to be reproduced with such definiteness and certainty as to be accurately identified, and (3) prescribe a date that allows a reasonable time to assemble such documentary material for compliance.\n\n(e) (1) All documentary material furnished to the Attorney General, his or her deputy or any assistant attorney general designated by the Attorney General, pursuant to a demand issued under subsection (c) of this section, shall be held in the custody of the Attorney General, or the Attorney General's designee, and shall not be available to the public. Such documentary material shall be returned to the person furnishing such documentary material upon the termination of the Attorney General's investigation or final determination of any action or proceeding commenced thereunder.\n\n(2) All documentary material or other information furnished voluntarily to the Attorney General, his or her deputy or any assistant attorney general designated by the Attorney General that relates to an investigation of the Attorney General pursuant to this section and the identity of the person furnishing such documentary material or other information shall be held in the custody of the Attorney General, or the Attorney General's designee, and shall not be available to the public. Such documentary material or other information shall be returned to the person furnishing such documentary material or other information upon the termination of the Attorney General's investigation or final determination of any action or proceeding commenced thereunder.\n\n(f) No such demand shall require the submission of any documentary material, the contents of which would be privileged or precluded from disclosure if demanded in a grand jury investigation.\n\n(g) The Attorney General, his or her deputy or any assistant attorney general designated by the Attorney General may, during the course of an investigation of any antitrust violations by any person, (1) issue in writing and cause to be served upon any person, by subpoena, a demand that such person appear before him or her and give testimony as to any matters relevant to the scope of the alleged violations. Such appearance shall be under oath and a written transcript made of the same, a copy of which shall be furnished to such person appearing and shall not be available for public disclosure; and (2) issue written interrogatories prescribing a return date that allows a reasonable time to respond, which responses shall be under oath and shall not be available for public disclosure.\n\n(h) In the event any person fails to comply with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section or subsections (c) to (g), inclusive, of this section, (1) the Attorney General, his or her deputy or any assistant attorney general designated by the Attorney General may apply to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford for compliance, which court may, upon notice to such person, issue an order requiring such compliance, which shall be served upon such person; and (2) the Attorney General, his or her deputy or any assistant attorney general designated by the Attorney General may also apply to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford for an order, which court may, after notice to such person and hearing thereon, issue an order requiring the payment of civil penalties to the state in an amount not to exceed two thousand dollars.\n\n(i) The Attorney General shall cooperate with officials of the federal government and the several states, including, but not limited to, the sharing and disclosure of information and evidence obtained under the purview of this section.\n\n(j) Service of subpoenas ad testificandum, subpoenas duces tecum, notices of deposition and written interrogatories, as provided in this section, may be made by: (1) Personal service or service at the usual place of abode; or (2) registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, a duly executed copy thereof addressed to the person to be served at such person's principal place of business in this state or, if such person has no principal place of business in this state, at such person's principal office or such person's residence.\n\n(P.A. 10-176, S. 1; P.A. 14-122, S. 177.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 10-176 effective July 1, 2010; P.A. 14-122 made technical changes in Subsec.
