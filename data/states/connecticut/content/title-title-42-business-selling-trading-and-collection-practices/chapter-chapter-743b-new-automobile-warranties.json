      "heading": "New motor vehicle warranties. Leased vehicles",
      "text": "(a) As used in this chapter:\n\n(1) “Consumer” means the purchaser, other than for purposes of resale, of a motor vehicle, a lessee of a motor vehicle, any person to whom such motor vehicle is transferred during the duration of an express warranty applicable to such motor vehicle, and any person entitled by the terms of such warranty to enforce the obligations of the warranty; and\n\n(2) “Motor vehicle” means a passenger motor vehicle, a passenger and commercial motor vehicle or a motorcycle, as defined in section 14-1, which is sold or leased in this state.\n\n(b) If a new motor vehicle does not conform to all applicable express warranties, and the consumer reports the nonconformity to the manufacturer, its agent or its authorized dealer during the period of two years following the date of original delivery of the motor vehicle to a consumer or during the period of the first twenty-four thousand miles of operation, whichever period ends first, the manufacturer, its agent or its authorized dealer shall make such repairs as are necessary to conform the vehicle to such express warranties, notwithstanding the fact that such repairs are made after the expiration of the applicable period.\n\n(c) No consumer shall be required to notify the manufacturer of a claim under this section and sections 42-181 to 42-184, inclusive, unless the manufacturer has clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the consumer, in the warranty or owner's manual, that written notification of the nonconformity is required before the consumer may be eligible for a refund or replacement of the vehicle. The manufacturer shall include with the warranty or owner's manual the name and address to which the consumer shall send such written notification.\n\n(d) (1) If the manufacturer or its agents or authorized dealers are unable to conform the motor vehicle to any applicable express warranty by repairing or correcting any defect or condition which substantially impairs the use, safety or value of the motor vehicle to the consumer after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer shall replace the motor vehicle with a new motor vehicle acceptable to the consumer, or accept return of the vehicle from the consumer and refund to the consumer, lessor and lienholder, if any, as their interests may appear, the following: (A) The full contract price, including, but not limited to, charges for undercoating, dealer preparation and transportation and installed options; (B) all collateral charges, including but not limited to, sales tax, license and registration fees, and similar government charges; (C) all finance charges incurred by the consumer after he first reports the nonconformity to the manufacturer, agent or dealer and during any subsequent period when the vehicle is out of service by reason of repair; and (D) all incidental damages, if applicable, less a reasonable allowance for the consumer's use of the vehicle.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this subsection, incidental damages include, but are not limited to, compensation for any commercially reasonable charges or expenses with respect to: (A) Inspection, receipt, transportation, care or custody of the motor vehicle; (B) covering, returning or disposing of the motor vehicle; (C) reasonable efforts to minimize or avoid the consequences of financial default related to the motor vehicle; and (D) effectuating other remedies after a defect or condition that substantially impaired the motor vehicle has been reported to a dealership or manufacturer.\n\n(3) No authorized dealer shall be held liable by the manufacturer for any refunds or vehicle replacements in the absence of evidence indicating that dealership repairs have been carried out in a manner inconsistent with the manufacturers' instructions. Refunds or replacements shall be made to the consumer, lessor and lienholder if any, as their interests may appear. A reasonable allowance for use shall be that amount obtained by multiplying the total contract price of the vehicle by a fraction having as its denominator one hundred twenty thousand and having as its numerator the number of miles that the vehicle traveled prior to the manufacturer's acceptance of its return.\n\n(4) It shall be an affirmative defense to any claim under this section that: (A) An alleged nonconformity does not substantially impair such use, safety or value; or (B) a nonconformity is the result of abuse, neglect or unauthorized modifications or alterations of a motor vehicle by a consumer.\n\n(e) (1) It shall be presumed that a reasonable number of attempts have been undertaken to conform a motor vehicle to the applicable express warranties, if: (A) The same nonconformity has been subject to repair four or more times by the manufacturer or its agents or authorized dealers during the period of two years following the date of original delivery of the motor vehicle to a consumer or during the period of the first twenty-four thousand miles of operation, whichever period ends first, but such nonconformity continues to exist; or (B) the vehicle is out of service by reason of repair for a cumulative total of thirty or more calendar days during the applicable period, determined pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this subdivision.\n\n(2) The two-year period and thirty-day period set forth in subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be extended by any period of time during which repair services are not available to the consumer because of a war, invasion, strike or fire, flood or other natural disaster.\n\n(3) No claim shall be made under this section unless at least one attempt to repair a nonconformity has been made by the manufacturer or its agent or an authorized dealer or unless such manufacturer, its agent or an authorized dealer has refused to attempt to repair such nonconformity.\n\n(f) If a motor vehicle has a nonconformity which results in a condition which is likely to cause death or serious bodily injury if the vehicle is driven, it shall be presumed that a reasonable number of attempts have been undertaken to conform such vehicle to the applicable express warranties if the nonconformity has been subject to repair at least twice by the manufacturer or its agents or authorized dealers within the express warranty term or during the period of one year following the date of the original delivery of the motor vehicle to a consumer, whichever period ends first, but such nonconformity continues to exist. The term of an express warranty and such one-year period shall be extended by any period of time during which repair services are not available to the consumer because of war, invasion, strike or fire, flood or other natural disaster.\n\n(g) (1) No motor vehicle which is returned to any person pursuant to any provision of this chapter or in settlement of any dispute related to any complaint made under the provisions of this chapter and which requires replacement or refund shall be resold, transferred or leased in the state without clear and conspicuous written disclosure of the fact that such motor vehicle was so returned prior to resale or lease. Such disclosure shall be affixed to the motor vehicle and shall be included in any contract for sale or lease. The Commissioner of Motor Vehicles shall, by regulations adopted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, prescribe the form and content of any such disclosure statement and establish provisions by which the commissioner may remove such written disclosure after such time as the commissioner may determine that such motor vehicle is no longer defective.\n\n(2) For any motor vehicle subject to a complaint made under the provisions of this chapter, if a manufacturer accepts the return of a motor vehicle or compensates any person who accepts the return of a motor vehicle, whether the return is pursuant to an arbitration award or settlement, such manufacturer shall stamp the words “MANUFACTURER BUYBACK-LEMON” clearly and conspicuously on the face of the original title in letters at least one-quarter inch high and, not later than thirty days after receipt of the title, shall submit a copy of the stamped title to the Department of Motor Vehicles. The Department of Motor Vehicles shall maintain a listing of such buyback vehicles and in the case of any request for a title for a buyback vehicle, shall cause the words “MANUFACTURER BUYBACK-LEMON” to appear clearly and conspicuously on the face of the new title in letters which are at least one-quarter inch high. Any person who applies for a title shall disclose to the department the fact that such vehicle was returned as set forth in this subsection.\n\n(3) If a manufacturer accepts the return of a motor vehicle from a consumer due to a nonconformity or defect, in exchange for a refund or a replacement vehicle, whether as a result of an administrative or judicial determination, an arbitration proceeding or a voluntary settlement, the manufacturer shall notify the Department of Motor Vehicles and shall provide the department with all relevant information, including the year, make, model, vehicle identification number and prior title number of the vehicle. Such manufacturer shall stamp the words “MANUFACTURER BUYBACK-LEMON” clearly and conspicuously on the face of the original title in letters at least one-quarter-inch high, and, not later than thirty days after receipt of the title, shall submit a copy of the stamped title to the Department of Motor Vehicles. The Commissioner of Motor Vehicles shall adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 specifying the format and time period in which such information shall be provided and the nature of any additional information which the commissioner may require.\n\n(4) The provisions of this subsection shall apply to motor vehicles originally returned in another state from a consumer due to a nonconformity or defect in exchange for a refund or replacement vehicle and which a lessor or transferor with actual knowledge subsequently sells, transfers or leases in this state.\n\n(5) If a manufacturer fails to stamp a title as required by this subsection within thirty days of receipt of the title, the Department of Consumer Protection may impose a fine not to exceed ten thousand dollars on the manufacturer. Any such fine shall be deposited into the new automobile warranties account established pursuant to section 42-190. A manufacturer that is aggrieved by a fine imposed pursuant to this subsection may, within ten days of receipt of written notice of such fine from the department, request, in writing, a hearing. The department shall, upon the receipt of all documentation necessary to evaluate the request, determine whether circumstances beyond the manufacturer's control prevented performance, and may conduct a hearing pursuant to chapter 54, if appropriate.\n\n(h) All express and implied warranties arising from the sale of a new motor vehicle shall be subject to the provisions of part 3 of article 2 of title 42a.\n\n(i) Nothing in this section shall in any way limit the rights or remedies which are otherwise available to a consumer under any other law.\n\n(j) If a manufacturer has established an informal dispute settlement procedure which is certified by the Attorney General as complying in all respects with the provisions of Title 16 Code of Federal Regulations Part 703, as in effect on October 1, 1982, and with the provisions of subsection (b) of section 42-182, the provisions of subsection (d) of this section concerning refunds or replacement shall not apply to any consumer who has not first resorted to such procedure.\n\n(k) The Commissioner of Consumer Protection may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to implement the provisions of this section.\n\n(P.A. 82-287; P.A. 83-351, S. 1; 83-458; P.A. 84-338, S. 3, 8; 84-429, S. 75; P.A. 85-331, S. 1, 6; 85-613, S. 132, 154; P.A. 87-342, S. 1, 5; 87-522, S. 2, 6; P.A. 89-173, S. 1, 2; P.A. 92-190; P.A. 93-435, S. 14, 95; P.A. 97-6; P.A. 98-211, S. 2; P.A. 21-37, S. 41; P.A. 22-70, S. 14.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 83-351 amended Subsec.

(2) which, among other things, provided for the stamping of the words “manufacturer buyback” on the original title of any buyback vehicle and added Subdiv. (4) specifying applicability to vehicles returned in another state because of nonconformity or defect and subsequently sold in this state; P.A. 93-435 reinstated language last printed in the 1991 revision, but dropped in the 1993 revision due to a clerical error, effective June 28, 1993; P.A. 97-6 amended the definition of “motor vehicle” in Subsec.

      "text": "(a) The Department of Consumer Protection shall provide an independent arbitration procedure for the settlement of disputes between consumers and manufacturers of motor vehicles which do not conform to all applicable warranties under the terms of section 42-179. The Commissioner of Consumer Protection shall appoint as arbitrators individuals who shall not be employees or independent contractors with any business involved in the manufacture, distribution, sale or service of any motor vehicle. The arbitrator shall be a member of an arbitration organization and shall serve with compensation. The Department of Consumer Protection may refer an arbitration dispute to the American Arbitration Association or other arbitration organization in accordance with regulations adopted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, provided such organization and any arbitrators appointed by such organization to hear cases shall not be affiliated with any motor vehicle manufacturer, distributor, dealer or repairer. Such arbitration organizations shall comply with the provisions of subsections (b) and (d) of this section.\n\n(b) If any motor vehicle purchased at any time on or after October 1, 1984, or leased at any time on or after June 17, 1987, fails to conform to such applicable warranties as defined in section 42-179, a consumer may bring a grievance to an arbitrator if the manufacturer of the vehicle has not established an informal dispute settlement procedure which the Attorney General has certified as complying in all respects with the requirements of section 42-179. The consumer may initiate a request for arbitration by calling a toll-free telephone number designated by the commissioner or by requesting an arbitration hearing in writing. The consumer shall file, on forms prescribed by the commissioner, any information deemed relevant to the resolution of the dispute and shall return the form accompanied by a filing fee of fifty dollars. Prior to submitting the complaint to an arbitrator, the Department of Consumer Protection shall conduct an initial review of the complaint. The department shall determine whether the complaint should be accepted or rejected for arbitration based on whether it alleges that the manufacturer has failed to comply with section 42-179. The filing fee shall be refunded if the department determines that a complaint does not allege a violation of any applicable warranty under the requirements of section 42-179. Upon acceptance of the complaint, the commissioner shall notify the manufacturer of the filing of a request for arbitration and shall obtain from the manufacturer, in writing on a form prescribed by the commissioner, any information deemed relevant to the resolution of the dispute. The manufacturer shall return the form within fifteen days of receipt, together with a filing fee of two hundred fifty dollars. Upon written agreement of the parties, signed after the consumer has initiated a request for arbitration, the case may be presented to the arbitrator solely based on the written documents submitted by such parties. A lessee who brings a grievance to an arbitrator under this section shall, upon filing the complaint form provided for in this section, provide the lessor with notice by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and the lessor may petition the arbitrator to be made a party to the arbitration proceedings. Initial determinations to reject a complaint for arbitration shall be submitted to an arbitrator for a final decision upon receipt of a written request from the consumer for a review of the initial eligibility determination and a filing fee of fifty dollars. If a complaint is accepted for arbitration, an arbitrator may determine that a complaint does not allege that the manufacturer has failed to comply with section 42-179 at any time before such arbitrator renders its decision on the merits of the dispute. The fee accompanying the consumer's complaint form shall be refunded to the consumer and the fee accompanying the form filed by the manufacturer shall be refunded to the manufacturer if the arbitrator determines that a complaint does not allege a violation of the provisions of section 42-179.\n\n(c) After a consumer submits the forms and fee pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and until such time that a decision or settlement is rendered, the consumer shall notify any individual or entity to whom he or she sells the motor vehicle that an action is pending with the department pursuant to this section. Such notice shall be given prior to the buyer's execution of the bill of sale, and shall include any case number or reference number provided by the department to the consumer. The consumer shall (1) notify the department not later than five days after the buyer's execution of the bill of sale that the motor vehicle has been sold, (2) provide the department with the name and contact information of the buyer, and (3) attest that notice of the pending action was given to the buyer prior to the buyer's execution of the bill of sale.\n\n(d) The Department of Consumer Protection shall investigate, gather and organize all information necessary for a fair and timely decision in each dispute. The commissioner may issue subpoenas on behalf of any arbitrator to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents, papers and records relevant to the dispute. The department shall forward a copy of all written testimony, including all documentary evidence, to an independent technical expert certified by the National Institute of Automotive Service Excellence or having a degree or other credentials from a nationally recognized organization or institution attesting to automotive expertise, who shall review such material and be available to advise and consult with the arbitrator. An arbitrator shall, as expeditiously as possible, but not later than sixty days after the time the consumer files the complaint form together with the filing fee, render a fair decision based on the information gathered and disclose his or her findings and the reasons therefor to the parties involved. The failure of the arbitrator to render a decision within sixty days shall not void any subsequent decision or otherwise limit the powers of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall base his or her determination of liability solely on whether the manufacturer has failed to comply with section 42-179. The arbitration decision shall be final and binding as to the rights of the parties pursuant to section 42-179, subject only to judicial review as set forth in this subsection. The decision shall provide appropriate remedies, including, but not limited to, one or more of the following:\n\n(1) Replacement of the vehicle with an identical or comparable new vehicle acceptable to the consumer;\n\n(2) Refund of the full contract price, plus collateral charges as specified in subsection (d) of section 42-179;\n\n(3) Reimbursement for expenses and compensation for incidental damages as specified in subsection (d) of section 42-179;\n\n(4) Any other remedies available under the applicable warranties, section 42-179, this section and sections 42-182 to 42-184, inclusive, or the Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act, 88 Stat. 2183 (1975), 15 USC 2301 et seq., as in effect on October 1, 1982, other than repair of the vehicle. The decision shall specify a date for performance and completion of all awarded remedies.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, the Department of Consumer Protection shall not amend, reverse, rescind or revoke any decision or action of an arbitrator. The department shall contact the consumer, not later than ten business days after the date for performance, to determine whether performance has occurred. The manufacturer shall act in good faith in abiding by any arbitration decision. In addition, either party to the arbitration may apply to the superior court for the judicial district in which one of the parties resides or, when the court is not in session, any judge thereof for an order confirming, vacating, modifying or correcting any award, in accordance with the provisions of this section and sections 52-417, 52-418, 52-419 and 52-420. Upon filing such application, the moving party shall mail a copy of the application to the Attorney General and, upon entry of any judgment or decree, shall mail a copy of such judgment or decree to the Attorney General. A review of such application shall be confined to the record of the proceedings before the arbitrator. The court shall conduct a de novo review of the questions of law raised in the application. In addition to the grounds set forth in sections 52-418 and 52-419, the court shall consider questions of fact raised in the application. In reviewing questions of fact, the court shall uphold the award unless it determines that the factual findings of the arbitrator are not supported by substantial evidence in the record and that the substantial rights of the moving party have been prejudiced. If the arbitrator fails to state findings or reasons for the award, or the stated findings or reasons are inadequate, the court shall search the record to determine whether a basis exists to uphold the award. If it is determined by the court that the manufacturer has acted without good cause in bringing an appeal of an award, the court, in its discretion, may grant to the consumer his costs and reasonable attorney's fees. If the manufacturer fails to perform all awarded remedies by the date for performance specified by the arbitrator, and the enforcement of the award has not been stayed pursuant to subsection (c) of section 52-420, then each additional day the manufacturer wilfully fails to comply shall be deemed a separate violation for purposes of section 42-184. If the manufacturer fails to perform regarding all awarded remedies by the applicable date of performance specified by the arbitrator, and enforcement of the award has not been stayed pursuant to subsection (c) of section 52-240 or otherwise modified by the arbitrator, the department may impose a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars per day until the manufacturer fully performs as specified by the award. Any such fines shall be deposited into the new automobile warranties account established pursuant to section 42-190. A manufacturer that is aggrieved by a fine imposed pursuant to this subsection may, not later than ten days of receipt of written notice of such fine from the department, request, in writing, a hearing. The department shall, upon the receipt of all documentation necessary to evaluate the request, determine whether circumstances beyond the manufacturer's control prevented performance, and may conduct a hearing pursuant to chapter 54, if appropriate.\n\n(f) The department shall maintain such records of each dispute as the commissioner may require, including an index of disputes by brand name and model. The department shall annually compile and maintain statistics indicating the record of manufacturer compliance with arbitration decisions and the number of refunds or replacements awarded. A copy of the statistical summary shall be filed with the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles and shall be considered a factor in determining the issuance of any manufacturer license as required under section 14-67a.
