A commercial unit may be a single article, as a machine, or a set of articles, as a suite or furniture or an assortment of sizes, or a quantity, as a bale, gross, or carload, or any other unit treated in use or in the relevant market as a single whole.\n\n(1959, P.A. 133, S. 2-105.)\n\nCited. 165 C. 300; 212 C. 167.\n\nUse of products involved in a beauty treatment does not amount to a sale of goods but to a rendition of services. 25 CS 114.

A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor's due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise.\n\n(3) The creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of a security interest in the seller's interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyer's chance of obtaining return performance within the purview of subsection (2) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the seller. Even in that event, the creation, attachment, perfection and enforcement of the security interest remain effective, but (i) the seller is liable to the buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the buyer, and (ii) a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the enforcement.\n\n(4) Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of “the contract” is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor's performance.\n\n(5) An assignment of “the contract” or of “all my rights under the contract” or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances, as in an assignment for security, indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by him to perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract.\n\n(6) The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee as provided by section 42a-2-609.\n\n(1959, P.A. 133, S. 2-210; P.A. 01-132, S. 139.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 01-132 amended Subsec.

A person in the position of a seller, as defined by section 42a-2-707, or a buyer who has rightfully rejected or justifiably revoked acceptance must account for any excess over the amount of his security interest, as defined by subsection (3) of section 42a-2-711.\n\n(1959, P.A. 133, S. 2-706.)",
