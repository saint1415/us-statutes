If an instrument falls within the definition of both “note” and “draft”, a person entitled to enforce the instrument may treat it as either.\n\n(f) “Check” means (i) a draft, other than a documentary draft, payable on demand and drawn on a bank or (ii) a cashier's check or teller's check. An instrument may be a check even though it is described on its face by another term, such as “money order”.\n\n(g) “Cashier's check” means a draft with respect to which the drawer and drawee are the same bank or branches of the same bank.\n\n(h) “Teller's check” means a draft drawn by a bank (i) on another bank, or (ii) payable at or through a bank.\n\n(i) “Traveler's check” means an instrument that (i) is payable on demand, (ii) is drawn on or payable at or through a bank, (iii) is designated by the term “traveler's check” or by a substantially similar term, and (iv) requires, as a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature appears on the instrument.\n\n(j) “Certificate of deposit” means an instrument containing an acknowledgment by a bank that a sum of money has been received by the bank and a promise by the bank to repay the sum of money.

If an instrument is payable to two or more persons not alternatively, it is payable to all of them and may be negotiated, discharged, or enforced only by all of them.
