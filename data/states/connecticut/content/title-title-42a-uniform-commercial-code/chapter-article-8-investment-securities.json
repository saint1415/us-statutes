Investment company security does not include an insurance policy or endowment policy or annuity contract issued by an insurance company.\n\n(c) An interest in a partnership or limited liability company is not a security unless it is dealt in or traded on securities exchanges or in securities markets, its terms expressly provide that it is a security governed by this article or it is an investment company security. However, an interest in a partnership or limited liability company is a financial asset if it is held in a securities account.\n\n(d) A writing that is a security certificate is governed by this article and not by article 3, even though it also meets the requirements of that article. However, a negotiable instrument governed by article 3 is a financial asset if it is held in a securities account.\n\n(e) An option or similar obligation issued by a clearing corporation to its participants is not a security, but is a financial asset.\n\n(f) A commodity contract, as defined in section 42a-9-102(a)(15), is not a security or a financial asset.\n\n(g) A document of title is not a financial asset unless subdivision (10)(iii) of subsection (a) of section 42a-8-102 applies.\n\n(1959, P.A. 133, S. 8-103; P.A. 79-435, S. 2; P.A. 97-182, S. 3; P.A. 01-132, S. 146; P.A. 04-64, S. 59.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 79-435 amended section to distinguish between certificated and uncertificated securities, applying former provision to certificated securities and adding provision re uncertificated securities; P.A. 97-182 entirely replaced former provisions re issuer's lien with provisions re rules for determining whether certain obligations and interests are securities or financial assets; P.A. 01-132 amended Subsec.

However, a person who knows that a representative has transferred a financial asset or interest therein in a transaction that is, or whose proceeds are being used, for the individual benefit of the representative or otherwise in breach of duty has notice of an adverse claim.\n\n(c) An act or event that creates a right to immediate performance of the principal obligation represented by a security certificate or sets a date on or after which the certificate is to be presented or surrendered for redemption or exchange does not itself constitute notice of an adverse claim except in the case of a transfer more than:\n\n(1) One year after a date set for presentment or surrender for redemption or exchange; or\n\n(2) Six months after a date set for payment of money against presentation or surrender of the certificate, if money was available for payment on that date.\n\n(d) A purchaser of a certificated security has notice of an adverse claim if the security certificate:\n\n(1) Whether in bearer or registered form, has been endorsed “for collection” or “for surrender” or for some other purpose not involving transfer; or\n\n(2) Is in bearer form and has on it an unambiguous statement that it is the property of a person other than the transferor, but the mere writing of a name on the certificate is not such a statement.\n\n(e) Filing of a financing statement under article 9 is not notice of an adverse claim to a financial asset.\n\n(1959, P.A. 133, S. 8-105; P.A. 79-435, S. 4; P.A. 97-182, S. 5.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 79-435 specified “certificated” securities in Subsec.
