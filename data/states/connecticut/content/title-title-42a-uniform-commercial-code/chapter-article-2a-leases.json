However, a failure to give timely notice bars the lessee from a remedy only to the extent that the party entitled to notice establishes that the party was prejudiced by the failure.\n\n(2) Except in the case of a consumer lease, if a claim for infringement or the like is made against a lessee for which a lessor or supplier is answerable over and the lessee is sued as a result of such claim, the lessee shall notify the lessor or supplier within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the litigation or be barred from any remedy over for liability established by the litigation.\n\n(d) A lessee has the burden of establishing a default with respect to goods accepted. A person entitled to enforce a warranty obligation under section 42a-2A-508 has the burden of establishing that the warranty was breached.\n\n(e) In a claim for breach of a warranty, indemnity or other obligation against the lessee for which another party is answerable over, the following rules apply:\n\n(1) The lessee may give notice of the litigation to the other party in a record, and the person notified may then give similar notice of the litigation to any other person that is answerable over. If the notice invites the person notified to intervene in the litigation and defend and states that failure to do so will bind the person notified in any action later brought by the lessor as to any determination of fact common to the two actions, the person notified is so bound, unless, after seasonable receipt of the notice, the person notified intervenes in the litigation and defends.\n\n(2) If the claim is one for infringement or the like, the original lessor or supplier may demand in a record that its lessee turn over control of the litigation, including settlement, or otherwise be barred from any remedy over. If the lessor or supplier also agrees to bear all expense and to satisfy any adverse judgment, the lessee is so barred unless, after seasonable receipt of the demand, control is turned over to the lessor or supplier.\n\n(f) Subsections (c), (d) and (e) of this section apply to an obligation of a lessee to hold the lessor or the supplier harmless against infringement or the like.\n\n(P.A. 02-131, S. 85.)",
