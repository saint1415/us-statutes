Such application shall include a statement of the reasons why such agency is unable to comply with said subsection and any other information the commissioner deems necessary. The commissioner, at least thirty days before approving, approving with conditions or denying any such application, shall publish once in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the affected area notice of: (A) The name of the applicant; (B) the location and nature of the requested exemption; (C) the tentative decision on the application; and (D) additional information the commissioner deems necessary to support the decision to approve, approve with conditions or deny the application.

After the comment period, the commissioner shall make a final determination to either approve the application, approve the application with conditions or deny the application.\n\n(2) The commissioner may hold a public hearing prior to approving, approving with conditions or denying any application if in the discretion of the commissioner the public interest will be best served thereby, and the commissioner shall hold a public hearing upon receipt of a petition signed by at least twenty-five persons, unless the activity or critical activity is a transportation capital project subject to the provisions of subdivisions (3) and (4) of this subsection. Notice of such hearing shall be published at least thirty days before the hearing in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the area affected.
