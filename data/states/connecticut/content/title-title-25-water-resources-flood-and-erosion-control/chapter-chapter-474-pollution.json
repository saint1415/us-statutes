The commissioner shall not grant: (1) A permit for the sale of class I land, except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, (2) a permit for the lease of class I land except as provided in subsection (p) of this section, or (3) a permit for a change in use of class I land unless the applicant demonstrates that such change will not have a significant adverse impact upon the present and future purity and adequacy of the public drinking water supply and is consistent with any water supply plan filed and approved pursuant to section 25-32d. The commissioner may reclassify class I land only upon determination that such land no longer meets the criteria established by subsection (a) of section 25-37c because of abandonment of a water supply source or a physical change in the watershed boundary. Not more than fifteen days before filing an application for a permit under this section, the applicant shall provide notice of such intent, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the chief executive officer and the chief elected official of each municipality in which the land is situated.\n\n(c) The commissioner may grant a permit for the sale, lease, assignment or change in use of any land in class II subject to any conditions or restrictions in use which the commissioner may deem necessary to maintain the purity and adequacy of the public drinking water supply, giving due consideration to: (1) The creation and control of point or nonpoint sources of contamination; (2) the disturbance of ground vegetation; (3) the creation and control of subsurface sewage disposal systems; (4) the degree of water treatment provided; (5) the control of watershed land by the applicant through ownership, easements or use restrictions or other water supply source protection measures; (6) the effect of development of any such land; and (7) any other significant potential source of contamination of the public drinking water supply. The commissioner may grant a permit for the sale, lease or assignment of class II land to another water company, municipality or nonprofit land conservation organization provided, as a condition of approval, a permanent conservation easement on the land is entered into to preserve the land in perpetuity predominantly in its natural scenic and open condition for the protection of natural resources and public water supplies while allowing for recreation consistent with such protection and improvements necessary for the protection or provision of safe and adequate potable water. Preservation in perpetuity shall not include permission for the land to be developed for any commercial, residential or industrial uses, nor shall it include permission for recreational purposes requiring intense development, including, but not limited to, golf courses, driving ranges, tennis courts, ballfields, swimming pools and uses by motorized vehicles other than vehicles needed by water companies to carry out their purposes, provided trails or pathways for pedestrians, motorized wheelchairs or nonmotorized vehicles shall not be considered intense development. The commissioner may reclassify class II land only upon determination that such land no longer meets the criteria established by subsection (b) of section 25-37c because of abandonment of a water supply source or a physical change in the watershed boundary.\n\n(d) The commissioner may grant a permit for (1) the sale of class I or II land to another water company, to a state agency or to a municipality, (2) the sale of class II land or the sale or assignment of a conservation restriction or a public access easement on class I or class II land to a private, nonprofit land-holding conservation organization, or (3) the sale of class I land to a private nonprofit land-holding conservation organization if the water company is denied a permit to abandon a source not in current use or needed by the water company pursuant to subsection (c) of section 25-33k, if the purchasing entity agrees to maintain the land subject to the provisions of this section, any regulations adopted pursuant to this section and the terms of any permit issued pursuant to this section. Such purchasing entity or assignee may not sell, lease or assign any such land or conservation restriction or public access easement or sell, lease, assign or change the use of such land without obtaining a permit pursuant to this section.\n\n(e) The commissioner shall not grant a permit for the sale, lease, assignment or change in use of any land in class II unless (1) use restrictions applicable to such land will prevent the land from being developed, (2) the applicant demonstrates that the proposed sale, lease, assignment or change in use will not have a significant adverse impact upon the purity and adequacy of the public drinking water supply and that any use restrictions which the commissioner requires as a condition of granting a permit can be enforced against subsequent owners, lessees and assignees, (3) the commissioner determines, after giving effect to any use restrictions which may be required as a condition of granting the permit, that such proposed sale, lease, assignment or change in use will not have a significant adverse effect on the public drinking water supply, whether or not similar permits have been granted, and (4) on or after January 1, 2003, as a condition to the sale, lease or assignment of any class II lands, a permanent conservation easement on the land is entered into to preserve the land in perpetuity predominantly in its natural scenic and open condition for the protection of natural resources and public water supplies while allowing for recreation consistent with such protection and improvements necessary for the protection or provision of safe and adequate potable water, except in cases where the class II land is deemed necessary to provide access or egress to a parcel of class III land, as defined in section 25-37c, that is approved for sale. Preservation in perpetuity shall not include permission for the land to be developed for any commercial, residential or industrial uses, nor shall it include permission for recreational purposes requiring intense development, including, but not limited to, golf courses, driving ranges, tennis courts, ballfields, swimming pools and uses by motorized vehicles other than vehicles needed by water companies to carry out their purposes, provided trails or pathways for pedestrians, motorized wheelchairs or nonmotorized vehicles shall not be considered intense development.\n\n(f) Nothing in this section shall prevent the lease or change in use of water company land to allow for recreational purposes that do not require intense development or improvements for water supply purposes, for leases of existing structures, or for radio towers or telecommunications antennas on existing structures. For purposes of this subsection, intense development includes golf courses, driving ranges, tennis courts, ballfields, swimming pools and uses by motorized vehicles, provided trails or pathways for pedestrians, motorized wheelchairs or nonmotorized vehicles shall not be considered intense development.\n\n(g) As used in this section, (1) “water supply source” includes all springs, streams, watercourses, brooks, rivers, lakes, ponds, wells or underground waters from which water is or, on and after July 1, 2024, may be, taken, and all springs, streams, watercourses, brooks, rivers, lakes, ponds, wells or aquifer protection areas, as defined in section 22a-354h, thereto and all lands drained thereby; and (2) “watershed land” means land from which water drains into a public drinking water supply.\n\n(h) The commissioner shall adopt and from time to time may amend the following: (1) Physical, chemical, radiological and microbiological standards for the quality of public drinking water; (2) minimum treatment methods, taking into account the costs of such methods, required for all sources of drinking water, including guidelines for the design and operation of treatment works and water sources, which guidelines shall serve as the basis for approval of local water supply plans by the commissioner; (3) minimum standards to assure the long-term purity and adequacy of the public drinking water supply to all residents of this state; and (4) classifications of water treatment plants and water distribution systems which treat or supply water used or intended for use by the public.

The commissioner shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, requiring water companies to report elevated levels of copper in public drinking water.\n\n(i) The department may perform the collection and testing of water samples required by regulations adopted by the commissioner pursuant to this section, in accordance with chapter 54, when requested to do so by a water company. The department shall collect a fee equal to the cost of such collection and testing. Water companies serving one thousand or more persons shall not request routine bacteriological or physical tests under this subsection.\n\n(j) The condemnation by a state department, institution or agency of any land owned by a water company shall be subject to the provisions of this section.\n\n(k) The commissioner may issue an order declaring a moratorium on the expansion or addition to any existing public water system that the commissioner deems incapable of providing new services with a pure and adequate water supply.\n\n(l) The commissioner may issue, modify or revoke orders as needed to carry out the provisions of this part. Except as otherwise provided in this part, such order shall be issued, modified or revoked in accordance with procedures set forth in subsection (b) of section 25-34.\n\n(m) The commissioner shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to include local health departments in the notification process when a water utility reports a water quality problem.\n\n(n) (1) On and after the effective date of regulations adopted under this subsection, no person may operate any water treatment plant, water distribution system or small water system that treats or supplies water used or intended for use by the public, test any backflow prevention device, or perform a cross connection survey without a certificate issued by the commissioner under this subsection. The commissioner shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to provide: (A) Standards for the operation of such water treatment plants, water distribution systems and small water systems; (B) standards and procedures for the issuance of certificates to operators of such water treatment plants, water distribution systems and small water systems, including, but not limited to, standards and procedures for the department's approval of third parties to administer certification examinations to such operators; (C) procedures for the renewal of such certificates every three years; (D) standards for training required for the issuance or renewal of a certificate; (E) standards and procedures for the department's approval of course providers and courses of study as they relate to certified operators of water treatment plants, water distribution systems and small water systems and certified persons who test backflow prevention devices or perform cross connection surveys for initial and renewal applications; and (F) standards and procedures for the issuance and renewal of certificates to persons who test backflow prevention devices or perform cross connection surveys. Such regulations shall be consistent with applicable federal law and guidelines for operator certification programs promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. For purposes of this subsection, “small water system” means a public water system, as defined in section 25-33d, that serves less than one thousand persons and has no treatment or has only treatment that does not require any chemical treatment, process adjustment, backwashing or media regeneration by an operator.\n\n(2) The commissioner may take any disciplinary action set forth in section 19a-17, except for the assessment of a civil penalty under subdivision (7) of subsection (a) of section 19a-17, against an operator, a person who tests backflow prevention devices or a person who performs cross connection surveys holding a certificate issued under this subsection for any of the following reasons: (A) Fraud or material deception in procuring a certificate, the renewal of a certificate or the reinstatement of a certificate; (B) fraud or material deception in the performance of the certified operator's professional activities; (C) incompetent, negligent or illegal performance of the certified operator's professional activities; (D) conviction of the certified operator for a felony; or (E) failure of the certified operator to complete the training required under subdivision (1) of this subsection.\n\n(3) The commissioner may issue an initial certificate to perform a function set forth in subdivision (1) of this subsection upon receipt of a completed application, in a form prescribed by the commissioner, together with an application fee as follows: (A) For a water treatment plant, water distribution system or small water system operator certificate, two hundred twenty-four dollars, except there shall be no such application fee required for a student enrolled in an accredited high school small water system operator certification course; (B) for a backflow prevention device tester certificate, one hundred fifty-four dollars; and (C) for a cross-connection survey inspector certificate, one hundred fifty-four dollars. A certificate issued pursuant to this subdivision shall expire three years from the date of issuance unless renewed by the certificate holder prior to such expiration date.

Parts 141 and 142, promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, provided such regulations (1) are consistent with other regulations adopted pursuant to this section, and (2) explicitly incorporate any future amendments to said federal regulations.\n\n(p) The commissioner may grant a permit for the lease of class I land associated with a groundwater source for use for public drinking water purposes to another water company that serves one thousand or more persons or two hundred fifty or more customers and maintains an approved water supply plan pursuant to section 25-32d, provided a water company acquiring such interest in the property demonstrates that such lease will improve conditions for the existing public drinking water system and will not have a significant adverse impact upon the present and future purity and adequacy of the public drinking water supply. Any water company requesting a permit under this subsection may be required to convey an easement that provides for the protection of the public water supply source and shall submit such easement and any provisions of the lease that pertain to the protection of the public water supply to the commissioner for approval.\n\n(q) Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the commissioner may grant a permit for the lease or change in use of water company land to allow for telecommunications antennas, telecommunications towers, ancillary equipment, related access drives or utilities, used in the provision of personal wireless services, as defined in 47 USC 332(c)(7), if the commissioner determines such lease or change in use will not have an adverse impact on the purity and adequacy of the public drinking water supply and that any use restrictions which the commissioner requires as a condition of granting a permit can be enforced against subsequent owners, lessees and assignees. The permit application shall include, but not be limited to, documentation on the extent of other alternative sites considered unsuitable by the provider of wireless services and a finding by the commissioner that such lease or change in use of water company land will not have a significant adverse impact upon the purity and adequacy of the public drinking supply.

      "text": "(a) If, upon review, investigation or inspection, the Commissioner of Public Health determines that a water company has violated any provision of section 25-32, section 25-32d or any regulation adopted under section 25-32d, or any provision of this title or title 19 or any regulation promulgated pursuant to said titles that relate to the purity and adequacy of water supplies or to the testing of water supplies or any report of such testing, the commissioner may impose a civil penalty not to exceed five thousand dollars per violation per day upon such water company. Governmental immunity shall not be a defense against the imposition of any civil penalty imposed pursuant to this section. In establishing a schedule or schedules of the amounts, or the ranges of amounts, of civil penalties which may be imposed under this section, the commissioner shall consider the size of or the number of persons served by the water company, the level of assessment necessary to insure immediate and continued compliance with such provision, and the character and degree of injury or impairment to or interference with or threat thereof to: (1) The purity of drinking water supplies; (2) the adequacy of drinking water supplies; and (3) the public health, safety or welfare. The commissioner shall publish annually, or as the commissioner deems necessary in response to any guidelines or ruling promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, a schedule of the amounts, or ranges of amounts, of civil penalties that may be imposed under this section on the Department of Public Health's Internet web site if the civil penalty for a violation under this section has not been established by statute. Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 54, the commissioner shall not be required to adopt or revise any regulations regarding the imposition of civil penalties when publishing such schedule. Not less than six months prior to publishing such schedule, the commissioner shall publish notice in the Connecticut Law Journal of his or her intention to publish such schedule on the department's Internet web site. Such notice shall include such schedule and the date on which the commissioner intends to hold a public hearing on such schedule and indicate that public comment on such schedule shall be provided to the commissioner not later than thirty days after the date of publication of such notice. The commissioner shall hold the public hearing on such schedule not later than thirty days after the date of publishing such notice. The commissioner shall take any public comments received under this subsection into consideration in establishing such schedule. The commissioner shall publish a document responding to such comments on the department's Internet web site not less than one month prior to publishing such schedule.\n\n(b) In setting a civil penalty in a particular case, where the civil penalty has not been established by statute or pursuant to the schedule in subsection (a) of this section, the commissioner shall consider all factors which the commissioner deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the following: (1) The amount of assessment necessary to ensure immediate and continued compliance with such provision; (2) the character and degree of impact of the violation on the purity and adequacy of drinking water supplies; (3) whether the water company incurring the civil penalty is taking all feasible steps or procedures necessary or appropriate to comply with such provisions or to correct the violation; (4) any prior violations by such water company of statutes, regulations, orders or permits administered, adopted or issued by the commissioner; (5) the character and degree of injury to, or interference with, public health, safety or welfare which has been or may be caused by such violation; and (6) whether the consumers of the water company have been notified of such violation pursuant to section 19-13-B102 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies.\n\n(c) If the commissioner has reason to believe that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may impose a penalty if compliance is not achieved by a specified date and send to the suspected violator, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or personal service at the address filed with the department by the water company as required under subsection (a) of section 25-33 or, if the water company did not file an address as required under said subsection, to the last known address of the water company on file at the department, a notice which shall include: (1) A reference to the sections of the statute or regulation involved; (2) a short and plain statement of the violation; (3) a statement of the amount of the civil penalty or penalties imposed; (4) the initial date of the imposition of the penalty when the penalty is imposed for a continuing violation, or the date for which the penalty is imposed when the penalty is imposed for an isolated violation; and (5) a statement of the water company's right to a hearing. The commissioner shall send a copy of such notice to the local director of health in the municipality or municipalities in which such violation occurred or that utilize such water.\n\n(d) The civil penalty shall be payable for noncompliance on the date specified in subsection (c) of this section and for each day thereafter until the water company against which the penalty was issued demonstrates to the commissioner that the violation has been corrected.\n\n(e) The water company to which the notice is addressed shall have twenty days from the date of mailing of the notice to make written application to the commissioner for a hearing to contest the imposition of the penalty. The application shall include a detailed statement of all of the grounds for contesting the imposition of the penalty. The water company shall send a copy of such application to the local director of health in the municipality or municipalities in which such violation occurred or that utilize such water. All hearings under this section shall be conducted pursuant to sections 4-176e to 4-184, inclusive, except that the presiding officer shall automatically grant each local director of health in the municipality or municipalities in which such violation occurred or that utilize such water the right to be heard in the proceeding. Any civil penalty may be mitigated by the commissioner upon such terms and conditions as the commissioner, in the commissioner's discretion, deems proper or necessary upon consideration of the factors set forth in subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(f) A final order of the commissioner assessing a civil penalty shall be subject to appeal as set forth in section 4-183 after a hearing before the commissioner pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, except that any such appeal shall be taken to the superior court for the judicial district of New Britain and shall have precedence in the order of trial as provided in section 52-191. Such final order shall not be subject to appeal under any other provision of the general statutes. No challenge to any such final order shall be allowed as to any issue which could have been raised by an appeal of an earlier order, notice, permit, denial or other final decision by the commissioner. The local director of health in the municipality or municipalities in which such violation occurred or that utilize such water for which the order was assessed shall have the right to be heard on such appeal.\n\n(g) If any water company fails to pay any civil penalty, the Attorney General, upon request of the commissioner, may bring an action in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford to obtain enforcement of the penalty by the court. All actions brought by the Attorney General pursuant to the provisions of this section shall have precedence in the order of trial as provided in section 52-191.\n\n(h) The provisions of this section are in addition to and not in derogation of any other enforcement provisions of any statute administered by the commissioner. The powers, duties and remedies provided in such other statutes, and the existence of or exercise of any powers, duties or remedies under this section or under such other statute shall not prevent the commissioner from exercising any other powers, duties or remedies available to the commissioner at law or in equity.\n\n(P.A. 85-450, S. 1; P.A. 88-230, S. 1, 12; 88-317, S. 86, 107; P.A. 90-98, S. 1, 2; P.A. 93-142, S. 4, 7, 8; 93-381, S. 9, 39; P.A. 95-220, S. 4–6; 95-257, S. 12, 21, 58; 95-329, S. 6, 31; P.A. 99-215, S. 24, 29; P.A. 00-90, S. 2, 3; P.A. 01-185, S. 1; P.A. 18-168, S. 62.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 88-230 replaced “judicial district of Hartford-New Britain” with “judicial district of Hartford”, effective September 1, 1991; P.A. 88-317 amended reference to Secs. 4-177 to 4-184 in Subsec.

The municipality or water company, by its officers or agents duly appointed, or the local director of health, or the local director's agents may, at all reasonable times, enter upon and inspect any premises within the watershed tributary to, or aquifer protection area of, such water supply and, if any nuisance likely to pollute such water is found therein, the local director of health or the local director's agent may abate such nuisance after reasonable notice to the owners or occupants of such premises and their refusal or neglect to abate the same, and the municipality or water company shall be liable for all unnecessary or unreasonable damage done to such premises.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 4026; P.A. 78-280, S. 1, 127; June Sp.
