Said states share ownership and stewardship of Long Island Sound. Decisions of one state may impact directly or indirectly on the residents of the other state. Significant projects may require approval from state or local agencies in both states. Proposed projects to address energy supply and energy demand of both states potentially affect Long Island Sound. Cooperative planning to address such energy supply and demand would greatly reduce the impact of such proposed projects on Long Island Sound. The waters and industrial uses of the lower Hudson River Valley similarly affect the quality of Long Island Sound.\n\n(b) There is established a Bi-State Long Island Sound Commission which shall consist of the Governors of the states of Connecticut and New York, or their designees, and in addition, seven members who are residents of Connecticut and seven members who are residents of New York. The seven Connecticut members shall be appointed to two-year terms as follows: (1) One appointed by the Governor, (2) one appointed by the president pro tempore of the Senate, (3) one appointed by the majority leader of the Senate, (4) one appointed by the minority leader of the Senate, (5) one appointed by the speaker of the House of Representatives, (6) one appointed by the majority leader of the House of Representatives, and (7) one appointed by the minority leader of the House of Representatives. The Governors of the states of Connecticut and New York, or their designees, shall serve as cochairpersons of said commission, ex officio, unless the commission members select other chairpersons by majority vote. In no event shall the cochairpersons be from the same state.\n\n(c) Said commission shall (1) review and consider major environmental, ecological and energy issues involving Long Island Sound and the lower Hudson River Valley, provided the commission's review and consideration of issues involving the valley shall be limited to issues in the valley that affect Long Island Sound, (2) seek consensus on strategies and policies concerning such issues, and (3) make recommendations for administrative and legislative action to implement such strategies and policies. Said commission shall meet not later than October 1, 2009, and not less than quarterly thereafter, at a time, date and place to be determined by the cochairpersons.\n\n(d) Said commission shall be within the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection for administrative purposes only, and the expenses for said commission shall be borne equally by the states of Connecticut and New York.\n\n(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to supplant or supersede any statutory or regulatory authority of any state or municipal agency concerning projects, policies or activities of said commission.\n\n(f) The provisions of this section shall take effect upon enactment by the state of New York of legislation having like effect.\n\n(P.A. 09-151, S. 1; P.A. 11-80, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 09-151 effective July 1, 2009; pursuant to P.A. 11-80, “Department of Environmental Protection” was changed editorially by the Revisors to “Department of Energy and Environmental Protection” in Subsec.
