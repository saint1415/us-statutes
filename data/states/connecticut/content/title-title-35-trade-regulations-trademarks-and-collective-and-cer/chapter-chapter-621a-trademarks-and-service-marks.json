Titles, character names used by a person, and other distinctive features of radio or television programs may be registered as service marks notwithstanding that they, or the programs, may advertise the goods of the sponsor.\n\n(3) The term “mark” includes any trademark or service mark entitled to registration under this chapter whether registered or not.\n\n(4) The term “trade name” includes words and names lawfully adopted and used by any person engaged in any business, trade, occupation or vocation to identify such business, trade, occupation or vocation whether or not registered, filed or recorded under any law of the state of Connecticut, or of any other state, or of the United States.\n\n(5) The term “person” means any individual, firm, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, association, union, governmental body or agency or other organization capable of suing or being sued in a court of law.\n\n(6) The term “applicant” embraces the person filing an application for registration of a mark under this chapter, and the legal representatives, successors or assigns of such person.\n\n(7) The term “registrant” embraces the person to whom the registration of a mark under this chapter is issued, and the legal representatives, successors or assigns of such person.\n\n(8) The term “use” means the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade, and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark. For the purposes of this chapter, a mark shall be deemed to be in use (a) on goods when it is placed in any manner on the goods or their containers, or the displays associated therewith, or on the tags or labels affixed thereto, or if the nature of the goods makes such placement impracticable, then on documents associated with the goods or their sale, and such goods are sold or otherwise distributed in this state, and (B) on services when it is used or displayed in the sale or advertising of services and the services are rendered in this state.\n\n(9) A mark shall be deemed to be “abandoned” (a) when its use has been discontinued with intent not to resume such use. Intent not to resume may be inferred from circumstances. Nonuse for two consecutive years shall be prima facie evidence of abandonment; (B) when any course of conduct of the registrant, including acts of omission as well as commission, causes the mark to lose its significance as an indication of origin.\n\n(10) The term “related company” means any person whose use of a mark is controlled by the owner of the mark with respect to the nature and quality of the goods or services on or in connection with which the mark is used.\n\n(11) The term “dilution” means the lessening of the capacity of the registrant's mark to identify and distinguish goods or services, through use of the mark by another person, regardless of the presence or absence of (a) competition between the users of the mark, or (B) likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception arising from that use.\n\n(1963, P.A. 51, S. 1; P.A. 93-152, S. 1; May 25 Sp. Sess. P.A. 94-1, S. 90, 130; P.A. 95-79, S. 131, 189.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 93-152 replaced alphabetic with numeric Subdiv. indicators, revised definitions of “trademark” and “service mark”, amended definition of “person” to include any “governmental body or agency”, amended definitions of “applicant” and “registrant” to delete “predecessors” of such person, replaced separate definitions of when a trademark and a service mark shall be deemed to be used in this state with a definition of the term “use” and a provision specifying when a mark shall be deemed to be in use on goods and on services, made technical changes to definition of “abandoned” and added definitions of “related company” and “dilution”; May 25 Sp. Sess. P.A. 94-1 amended Subdiv. (8) substituting “mark” for “trademark”, effective July 1, 1994; P.A. 95-79 redefined “person” to include a limited liability company, effective May 31, 1995.\n\nCited. 180 C. 720.",

      "text": "(a) Subject to the provisions of section 35-11k, any person who (1) uses in Connecticut, without the consent of the registrant, any reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation of a mark registered under this chapter in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive as to the source or origin of such goods or services or (2) reproduces, counterfeits, copies or colorably imitates any such mark and applies such reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation to labels, signs, prints, packages, wrappers, receptacles or advertisements intended to be used in commerce upon or in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution or advertising of goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive purchasers, shall be liable in a civil action by the registrant for any or all of the remedies provided in subsection (b) of this section, except that under subdivision (2) of this subsection the registrant shall not be entitled to recover profits or damages unless the acts have been committed with the intent to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive.\n\n(b) Any registrant of a mark registered under this chapter may proceed by suit to enjoin the wrongful manufacture, use, display or sale of any reproduction, counterfeit or imitation thereof and any court of competent jurisdiction may grant injunctions to restrain such manufacture, use, display or sale as may be deemed just and reasonable, and may require the defendants to pay to such registrant all profits derived from, or all damages suffered by reason of, such wrongful manufacture, use, display or sale or both such profits and damages; and such court may also order that any such reproduction, counterfeit or imitation in the possession or under the control of any defendant be delivered to an officer of the court to be destroyed, or to the complainant. The court, in its discretion, may enter judgment for an amount not to exceed three times such profits and damages and a reasonable attorney's fee of the prevailing party in such cases where the court finds the other party committed such wrongful acts with knowledge or in bad faith or otherwise as according to the circumstances of the case. The enumeration of any right or remedy herein shall not affect a registrant's right to prosecute under any penal law of this state.\n\n(c) The registrant of a mark which is famous in this state shall be entitled, subject to the principles of equity, to an injunction against another's use of a mark, commencing after the registrant's mark becomes famous, which causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the registrant's mark, and to obtain such other relief as is provided in this subsection. In determining whether a mark is famous, a court may consider factors including, but not limited to the following: (1) The degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the mark in this state; (2) the duration and extent of use of the mark in connection with the goods and services; (3) the duration and extent of advertising and publicity of the mark in this state; (4) the geographical extent of the trading area in which the mark is used; (5) the channels of trade for the goods or services with which the registrant's mark is used; (6) the degree of recognition of the registrant's mark in its and in the other's trading areas and channels of trade in this state; and (7) the nature and extent of use of the same or similar mark by third parties. The registrant shall be entitled only to injunctive relief in this state in an action brought under this section, unless the subsequent user wilfully intended to trade on the registrant's reputation or to cause dilution of the registrant's mark. If such wilful intent is proven, the registrant shall also be entitled to the remedies set forth in this chapter, subject to the discretion of the court and the principles of equity.\n\n(1963, P.A. 51, S. 9; P.A. 93-152, S. 9.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 93-152 amended Subsec. (a) to replace “likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive purchasers” with “likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive as to the source or origin of such goods or services”, replace “owner of such registered mark” with “registrant” and replace “committed with knowledge that such imitation is intended to be used to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive purchasers” with “committed with the intent to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive”, amended Subsec. (b) to replace “owner” with “registrant”, rephrase provision re granting of injunctions and add provision authorizing the court to enter judgment for an amount not to exceed three times such profits and damages and a reasonable attorney's fee when it makes certain findings, and deleted former Subsec. (c) re likelihood of injury to business reputation or of dilution of the distinctive quality of a mark or trade name as a ground for injunctive relief for unauthorized use of such mark or trade name and inserted new Subsec. (c) to entitle the registrant of a mark which is famous to an injunction and other relief against another's use of a mark that causes dilution, set forth the factors a court may consider in determining whether a mark is famous and specify remedies available to a registrant when the subsequent user wilfully intended to trade on the registrant's reputation or to cause dilution.\n\nCited. 173 C. 261.\n\nHeld not applicable in action for injunction against use of similar name by new business firm. 27 CS 200.
