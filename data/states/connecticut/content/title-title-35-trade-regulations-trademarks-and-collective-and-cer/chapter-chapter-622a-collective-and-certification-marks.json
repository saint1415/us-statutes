For the purposes of this chapter, a certification mark shall be deemed to be in use in commerce (a) on goods when it is placed in any manner on the goods or their containers or the displays associated therewith or on the tags or labels affixed thereto, or if the nature of the goods make such placement impracticable, then on documents associated with the goods or their sale, and such goods are sold or otherwise distributed in this state, and (B) on services when it is used or displayed in the sale or advertising of services and the services are rendered in this state.\n\n(8) A collective mark is deemed used in this state when used in public or in commerce in the state by one or more members.\n\n(9) A mark shall be deemed to be abandoned (a) when its use has been discontinued with intent not to resume. Intent not to resume may be inferred from circumstances. Nonuse for two consecutive years shall be prima facie abandonment; (B) when any course of conduct of the registrant, including acts of omission as well as commission, causes the mark to lose its significance as an indication of the registrant and persons belonging to or affiliated with the registrant, or operating in accordance with conditions prescribed by the registrant.\n\n(1967, P.A. 689, S. 1; P.A. 93-152, S. 12; P.A. 95-79, S. 132, 189.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 93-152 replaced alphabetic with numeric Subdiv. indicators, amended the definition of “person” to include any “governmental body or agency”, amended definitions of “applicant” and “registrant” to delete the “predecessors” of the person, replaced the definition of when a certification mark shall be deemed to be used in this state with a definition of the term “use” and a provision specifying when a certification mark shall be deemed to be in use in commerce on goods and on services and amended Subdiv. (9) to replace numeric with alphabetic Subpara. indicators; P.A. 95-79 redefined “person” to include a limited liability company, effective May 31, 1995.",
