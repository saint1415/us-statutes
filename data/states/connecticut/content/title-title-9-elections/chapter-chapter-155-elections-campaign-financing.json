(b) by dividing existing provisions into Subdivs. (1) to (4), amending Subdiv. (1) to increase late filing fee from $55 to $100 and apply said fee to a candidate failing to file either a statement for formation of candidate committee or a certification that candidate is exempt from forming candidate committee, amending Subdivs. (2), (3) and (4) to modify the notification procedure and deadlines for late filings and to make conforming changes, and amending Subdiv. (4) to substitute fine of not less than $200 nor more than $2,000 for fine of not more than $1,000, effective July 1, 2005; Oct. 25 Sp. Sess. P.A. 05-5 amended Subsec.
