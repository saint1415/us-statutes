      "text": "(a) If a party's chairman did not certify (1) a formula pursuant to section 9-473, or (2) a requirement that all delegates shall be allocated to the candidate receiving the greatest number of votes notwithstanding such candidate's percentage of the total votes cast for all candidates, the secretary shall determine the number of delegates to be so allocated to each candidate of each such party in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(b) Such determination shall be made separately for delegates to be selected at large and delegates to be selected from each district. Any percentage required to be determined, in accordance with the provisions of this section, shall be rounded off to the nearest one-tenth of one per cent. As used in this section, “minimum percentage” means the ratio, expressed as a percentage, that the number one bears to the total number of delegates to be selected, but in no event shall such percentage exceed twenty-five per cent.\n\n(c) The secretary shall calculate the minimum percentage, as defined in subsection (b) of this section, using the number of delegates to be selected at large and, if applicable, the number of delegates to be selected from each district respectively. Except as provided in this subsection, a candidate's percentage of the total votes cast for all candidates in the state or in a district must equal or exceed such minimum percentage in order for such candidate to be allocated any at large delegates or any delegates from such district, as the case may be. The secretary shall determine each candidate's percentage of the total votes cast for all candidates in the state and in each district. In the event two or more candidates have received a percentage of such total votes cast equal to or greater than the minimum percentage, the secretary shall calculate an adjusted percentage, which shall be each such candidate's percentage of the total votes cast for all such candidates, excluding the votes cast for all other candidates. The secretary shall then calculate the product of each such candidate's adjusted percentage and the total number of delegates to be selected, rounding off such product to the nearest integer. Such product shall be the number of delegates allocated to each such candidate except as hereinafter provided. (1) If the rounding off of such products to the nearest integers causes the sum of all delegates so allocated to be greater than the total number of delegates to be selected at large or from the district, then one delegate shall be subtracted from the number allocated to the candidate who received the greatest mathematical gain from such rounding off, and if necessary one delegate shall also be subtracted from the number allocated to the candidate who received the next greatest gain, and so on until the sum of all delegates allocated to candidates equals the total number of delegates to be so selected. (2) If the rounding off of such products to the nearest integers causes the sum of all delegates so allocated to be fewer than the total number of delegates to be selected at large or from the district, then one delegate shall be added to the number allocated to the candidate who suffered the greatest mathematical loss from such rounding off, and if necessary one delegate shall also be added to the number allocated to the candidate who suffered the next greatest such loss, and so on until the sum of all delegates allocated to candidates equals the total number of delegates to be so selected.\n\n(d) In the event one or no candidate has received a percentage of the total number of votes cast for all candidates equal to or greater than the minimum percentage, the secretary shall calculate an adjusted percentage for each of the candidates receiving the greatest and second greatest number of votes cast for all candidates. The adjusted percentage shall be such candidate's percentage of the total number of votes cast for both such candidates, excluding the total number of votes cast for all other candidates. The secretary shall determine the number of delegates allocated to each candidate by using the same procedure as prescribed in subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(P.A. 79-481, S. 15; P.A. 83-475, S. 40, 43; P.A. 95-95, S. 3.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 83-475 amended Subsec. (c) to establish new method for allocation of delegates among districts; P.A. 95-95 inserted Subdiv. indicators in Subsec. (a) and revised wording; (Revisor's note: In 1999 the words “did not certify (1)” were substituted for the words “did not (1) certify” in Subsec. (a) to conform text to P.A. 95-95).",

      "text": "(a) Forthwith upon completion of the procedures prescribed by section 9-483 or 9-484, as the case may be, the secretary shall certify to the chairman, each candidate and the national committee of the party, the number of such party's at large and district delegates allocated to each candidate in accordance with the provisions of said sections. Each party shall select a number of delegates, both at large and from each district, pursuant to its rules and in accordance with such certification, provided it shall select a number of delegates committed to support each candidate which is not less than the number so allocated to such candidate. If, prior to a party's selection of delegates, a candidate to whom one or more of such party's delegates are allocated files with the secretary a written statement, by him signed, to the effect that he has released all Connecticut delegates allocated to him, delegates committed to such candidate shall not be selected by such party. Forthwith upon the selection of delegates, the chairman shall certify to the secretary the name and address of each delegate, the district from which he was selected or that he was selected at large, and the name of the candidate to whom he is committed or that he is uncommitted, as the case may be. If, as a consequence of any such candidate's release of delegates, the number of delegates differs from the number so allocated in accordance with the secretary's certification, the chairman shall include in his certification a statement to such effect and an accounting of the differences.\n\n(b) The secretary shall forward a copy of such certification to the national committee of the party and to each candidate to whom at least one delegate is committed. If such certification indicates that the party has not complied with the provisions of this section in its selection of delegates, the secretary shall so inform the chairman, each such candidate and the national committee of the party. If any such candidate files with the secretary a written objection to any delegate committed to him according to the chairman's certification, the secretary shall inform the chairman and the national committee of the party of such objection. Any dispute over the selection of delegates by a party shall be resolved in such manner as its rules may prescribe.\n\n(c) If, subsequent to the primary, a candidate to whom one or more of such party's delegates are allocated either dies or files with the secretary a written statement, by him signed, to the effect that he has released all Connecticut delegates committed to him, the commitment of any such delegate to the candidate shall be deemed to have been released.\n\n(P.A. 79-481, S. 16.)",
