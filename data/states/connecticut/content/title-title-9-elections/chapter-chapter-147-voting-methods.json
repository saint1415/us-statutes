The board of selectmen of each town, the common council of each city and the warden and burgesses of each borough shall purchase or lease, or otherwise provide, for use at elections in each such municipality a number of voting tabulators approved by the Secretary of the State. Different voting tabulators may be provided for different voting districts in the same municipality. Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection to the contrary, the registrars of voters of a municipality may determine the number of voting tabulators that shall be provided for use at any special election in such municipality, provided the registrars shall provide at least one voting tabulator in the municipality or, in a municipality divided into voting districts, at least one voting tabulator in each such district.\n\n(b) Upon the purchase or lease of a voting tabulator for use in any municipality, the officials of such municipality purchasing or leasing the same shall forthwith send notification in writing to the Secretary of the State of the name or make of such tabulator, the name of the person who manufactured the same, the name of the person from whom it was purchased or leased and the date on which it was purchased or leased. No voting tabulator shall be used in an election which, in the opinion of the Secretary of the State, does not conform to the requirements of law, is unsuitable for use in such election or does not comply with the voluntary performance and test standards for voting systems adopted by the Election Assistance Commission pursuant to the Help America Vote Act, P.L. 107-252, 43 USC 15481. When in any municipality the use of a voting tabulator at elections is discontinued because of its age or condition or because it is sold, or for any other reason, such officials shall send written notification to the Secretary of the discontinuance of such tabulator, of the time of and reason for such discontinuance and of the information required in connection with notification of original purchasing or leasing.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 1192, 1193, 1194; 1951, S. 259b; 1953, 1955, S. 715d; 1957, P.A. 561, S. 1; 1969, P.A. 32; 355, S. 1; P.A. 80-339, S. 1; P.A. 91-7; 91-351, S. 26, 28; P.A. 94-203, S. 3, 12; P.A. 07-194, S. 38; P.A. 11-20, S. 6.)\n\n*Note: On and after July 1, 2025, subsection (a) of this section, as amended by section 3 of public act 23-1 of the September 26 special session, is to read as follows:\n\n“(a) Except as provided in section 9-272, voting tabulators shall be used at all elections held in any municipality, or in any part thereof, for voting and registering and counting votes cast at such elections for officers, and upon all questions or amendments submitted at such elections. The board of selectmen of each town, the common council of each city and the warden and burgesses of each borough shall purchase or lease, or otherwise provide, for use at elections in each such municipality a number of voting tabulators approved by the Secretary of the State. Different voting tabulators may be provided for different voting districts in the same municipality. Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection, the registrars of voters of a municipality shall ensure that each voting district at any such election uses a dedicated voting tabulator or tabulators that only registers and counts votes cast for such voting district. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the counting of ballots at a central location designated for such purpose or to the conduct of a recanvass.”\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 1192, 1193, 1194; 1951, S. 259b; 1953, 1955, S. 715d; 1957, P.A. 561, S. 1; 1969, P.A. 32; 355, S. 1; P.A. 80-339, S. 1; P.A. 91-7; 91-351, S. 26, 28; P.A. 94-203, S. 3, 12; P.A. 07-194, S. 38; P.A. 11-20, S. 6; Sept. 26 Sp.

It shall permit voting in absolute secrecy. It shall be provided with a lock by means of which any illegal movement of the voting or registering mechanism is absolutely prevented. Such tabulator shall be so constructed that an elector cannot vote for a candidate or on a proposition for whom or on which the elector is not lawfully entitled to vote.\n\n(b) It shall be so constructed as to prevent an elector from voting for more than one person for the same office, except when the elector is lawfully entitled to vote for more than one person for that office, and it shall afford the elector an opportunity to vote for only as many persons for that office as the elector is by law entitled to vote for, at the same time preventing the elector from voting for the same person twice. It shall be so constructed that all votes cast will be registered or recorded by the tabulator. In the event that a candidate is cross endorsed and an elector casts more than one vote for such candidate, such vote shall be attributed by the head moderator to the endorsing parties as provided for in this subsection. The head moderator shall (1) determine the percentage of all attributable votes the candidate received that are attributable to each endorsing party, (2) determine the number of ballots upon which an elector voted for the candidate more than once, and (3) apply the percentage determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection for an endorsing party to the total determined under subdivision (2) of this subsection. The resulting number from the calculation under subdivision (3) of this subsection shall be the number of votes the head moderator attributes to the endorsing party associated with the percentage used in the calculation under subdivision (3) of this subsection. The head moderator shall repeat the calculation in subdivision (3) of this subsection for each endorsing party. For any result under subdivision (3) of this subsection that is a fractional number, the head moderator shall round such result to the nearest whole number, provided a half number shall be rounded to the next highest whole number, and provided further that each such endorsing party with a percentage greater than zero under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall receive at least one such vote, with the remaining parties receiving a proportional reduction in votes, if necessary. If any vote remains that can not be evenly attributed to such parties, such vote shall be attributed to the endorsing party with the most votes.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary of the State may approve a voting tabulator which requires the elector in the polls to place the elector's ballot into the recording device and which meets the voluntary performance and test standards for voting systems adopted by (1) the Federal Election Commission on January 25, 1990, as amended from time to time, or (2) the Election Assistance Commission pursuant to the Help America Vote Act of 2002, P.L. 107-252, 42 USC 15481-85, as amended from time to time, whichever standards are most current at the time of the Secretary of the State's approval, and regulations which the Secretary of the State may adopt in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, provided the voting tabulator shall (A) warn the elector of overvotes, (B) not record overvotes, and (C) not record more than one vote of an elector for the same person for an office. In the event that a candidate is cross endorsed and an elector casts more than one vote for such candidate, such vote shall be attributed by the head moderator to the endorsing parties as provided for in this subsection. The head moderator shall (i) determine the percentage of all attributable votes the candidate received that are attributable to each endorsing party, (ii) determine the number of ballots upon which an elector voted for the candidate more than once, and (iii) apply the percentage determined under subparagraph (C)(i) of this subsection for an endorsing party to the total determined under subparagraph (C)(ii) of this subsection. The resulting number from the calculation under subparagraph (C)(iii) of this subsection shall be the number of votes the head moderator attributes to the endorsing party associated with the percentage used in the calculation under subparagraph (C)(iii) of this subsection. The head moderator shall repeat the calculation in subparagraph (C)(iii) of this subsection for each endorsing party. For any result under subparagraph (C)(iii) of this subsection that is a fractional number, the head moderator shall round such result to the nearest whole number, provided a half number shall be rounded to the next highest whole number, and provided further that each such endorsing party with a percentage greater than zero under subparagraph (C)(i) of this subsection shall receive at least one such vote, with the remaining parties receiving a proportional reduction in votes, if necessary. If any vote remains that can not be evenly attributed to such parties, such vote shall be attributed to the endorsing party with the most votes.\n\n(d) Any direct recording electronic voting tabulator approved by the Secretary of the State for an election or primary held on or after July 1, 2005, shall be so constructed as to:\n\n(1) (A) Contemporaneously produce an individual, permanent, paper record containing all of the elector's selections of ballot preferences for candidates and questions or proposals, if any, prior to the elector's casting a ballot, as set forth in this subsection, and (B) produce at any time after the close of the polls a voting tabulator generated, individual, permanent, paper record of each such elector's selections of ballot preferences for candidates and questions or proposals, if any. Both the contemporaneously produced paper record and the voting tabulator generated paper record of each elector's selections of ballot preferences shall include a voting tabulator generated unique identifier that can be matched against each other and which preserves the secrecy of the elector's ballot as set forth in subdivision (4) of this subsection;\n\n(2) Provide each elector with an opportunity to verify that the contemporaneously produced, individual, permanent, paper record accurately conforms to such elector's selection of ballot preferences, as reflected on the electronic summary screen, and to hear, if desired, an audio description of such electronic summary screen, for the purpose of having an opportunity to make any corrections or changes prior to casting the ballot. If an elector makes corrections or changes prior to casting the ballot, the voting tabulator shall void such contemporaneously produced paper record, contemporaneously produce another paper record containing such corrections or changes and provide the elector with another opportunity to verify ballot preferences in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision. As used in this section, “electronic summary screen” means a screen generated by a direct recording electronic voting tabulator that displays a summary of an elector's selections of ballot preferences for candidates and questions or proposals, if any, at an election or primary;\n\n(3) Provide that a ballot shall be deemed cast on the voting tabulator at the time that an elector's contemporaneously produced, individual, permanent, voter-verified paper record, containing all of the elector's final selections of ballot preferences, is (A) deposited inside a receptacle designed to store all such paper records produced by such voting tabulator on the day of the election or primary, and (B) the elector's selection of ballot preferences is simultaneously electronically recorded inside the voting tabulator for the purpose of (i) being electronically tabulated immediately after the polls are closed on the day of the election or primary, and (ii) producing, on such other day as required under section 9-242b, a voting tabulator generated, individual, permanent, paper record of each such elector's selections of ballot preferences for candidates and questions or proposals, if any;\n\n(4) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (1) of section 9-242b, secure the secrecy of each such elector's ballot by making it impossible for any other individual to identify the elector in relationship to such elector's selection of ballot preferences at the time that the elector (A) selects ballot preferences; (B) verifies the accuracy of the electronic summary screen by comparing it to the contemporaneously produced, individual, permanent, paper record or the audio description of such electronic summary screen, prior to casting a ballot; (C) makes corrections or changes by reselecting ballot preferences and verifies the accuracy of such preferences in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection prior to casting a ballot; and (D) casts the ballot; and at the time that all electors' ballots are canvassed, recanvassed or otherwise tallied to produce a final count of the vote for candidates and questions or proposals, if any, whether through the electronic vote tabulation process or through the manual count process of each elector's contemporaneously produced, individual, permanent, voter-verified paper record, as set forth in section 9-242b; and\n\n(5) (A) Be accessible to blind or visually impaired persons by providing each elector, if desired by the elector, an audio description of the contemporaneously produced individual, permanent, paper record containing all of the elector's selections of ballot preferences, in addition to an audio description of the electronic summary screen and comply with such additional standards of accessibility included in regulations that the Secretary of the State may adopt in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54.\n\n(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, on or before June 30, 2007, the Secretary of the State may approve an electronic voting tabulator that does not comply with the provisions of said subparagraph if (i) the Secretary determines that there are no electronic voting tabulators available for purchase or lease at the time of such approval that are capable of complying with said subparagraph (A), (ii) the electronic voting tabulator complies with the provisions of subdivisions (1) to (4), inclusive, of this subsection, and (iii) the person applying to the Secretary for approval of the electronic voting tabulator agrees to include a provision in any contract for the sale or lease of such voting tabulators that requires such person, upon notification by the Secretary that modifications to such tabulators that would bring the tabulators into compliance with said subparagraph (A) are available, to (I) so modify any electronic voting tabulators previously sold or leased under such contract in order to comply with said subparagraph (A), and (II) provide that any electronic voting tabulators sold or leased after receipt of such notice comply with said subparagraph (A). No voting tabulator approved under this subparagraph shall be used on or after July 1, 2007, unless it has been modified to comply with the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 1191; 1953, S. 719d; 1957, P.A. 561, S. 4; 1967, P.A. 893; P.A. 84-319, S. 35, 49; P.A. 87-382, S. 22, 55; P.A. 93-384, S. 17; P.A. 05-188, S. 7; 05-235, S. 29; P.A. 11-20, S. 10; 11-173, S. 39.)\n\nHistory: 1967 act provided that voting machines be so constructed that an elector, at his option, may vote for an individual either after operating the straight ticket device or without first operating such device, deleted provision for machines to have bells connected with straight ticket device so as to ring when such device is operated and deleted provision concerning capability of adjustment for use in primaries to permit voting for individuals without first operating a straight ticket device; P.A. 84-319 required approved machines to provide facilities for voting for at least nine parties' candidates, rather than seven, and eliminated requirement that curtain levers have bell attached; P.A. 87-382 repealed provisions re straight ticket device; P.A. 93-384 divided existing section into Subsecs., moved requirement that voting machine be provided with a lock from Subsec.

      "text": "The following procedures shall apply to any election or primary in which one or more direct recording electronic voting tabulators are used:\n\n(1) Any elector who requires assistance by reason of blindness, disability, or inability to read or write shall have the right to request assistance inside the voting booth by a person of the elector's choice in accordance with 42 USC 1973aa-6, as amended from time to time, or section 9-264.\n\n(2) A canvass of the votes shall take place inside the polling place immediately following the close of the polls on the day of the election or primary in accordance with the requirements of chapter 148. With respect to direct recording electronic voting tabulators, any such canvass shall be an electronic vote tabulation of all of the votes cast on each such voting tabulator for each candidate and question or proposal, and the moderator shall attach a printout of such electronic vote tabulation to the tally sheets. The moderator shall then add together all of the votes recorded on each voting tabulator in use at the polling place, whether or not such voting tabulators were direct recording electronic voting tabulators, to produce a cumulative count within the polling place of all candidates and any questions or proposals appearing on the ballot in the election or primary. Any member of the public shall have a right to be present in the polling place to observe the canvass of the votes beginning as soon as the polls are declared closed by the moderator and continuing throughout the canvass of the votes of each voting tabulator until the final canvass of all of the votes cast on all of the voting tabulators in use in the polling place are added together for each candidate and question or proposal and publicly announced and declared by the moderator.\n\n(3) If a recanvass of the votes is required pursuant to chapter 148, the recanvass officials shall, in addition to the other requirements of said chapter, conduct a manual tally of the individual, permanent, voter-verified, paper records contemporaneously produced by each direct recording electronic voting tabulator used within the geographical jurisdiction that is subject to such recanvass. The manual tally conducted for the recanvass shall be limited to the particular candidates and questions or proposals that are subject to recanvass. If the manual tabulation of such contemporaneously produced paper records does not reconcile with the electronic vote tabulation of a particular direct recording electronic voting tabulator or tabulators, such contemporaneously produced paper records shall be considered the true and correct record of each elector's vote on such electronic voting tabulator or tabulators and shall be used as the official record for purposes of declaring the official election results or for purposes of any subsequent recanvass, tally or election contest conducted pursuant to chapters 148 to 153, inclusive. If any of the contemporaneously produced individual, permanent, voter-verified paper records are found to have been damaged in such manner as they are unable to be manually tallied with respect to the ballot positions that are the subject of the recanvass, each such damaged record shall be matched against the voting tabulator generated, individual, permanent, paper record produced by the voting tabulator bearing the identical tabulator-generated unique identifier as the damaged record and, in such instance, shall be substituted as the official record for purposes of determining the final election results or for purposes of any subsequent recanvass, tally or election contest.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 9-311, the Secretary of the State may order a discrepancy recanvass under said section of the returns of an election or a primary for a district office, a state office or the office of elector of President and Vice-President of the United States, if the Secretary has reason to believe that discrepancies may have occurred that could affect the outcome of the election or primary. Any such discrepancy recanvass may be conducted of the returns in any or all voting districts in (A) the district in which an election or primary is held, in the case of an election or primary for a district office, or (B) the state, in the case of an election or primary for a state office or the office of elector of President and Vice-President of the United States or a presidential preference primary, whichever is applicable. As used in this subdivision, “district office” and “state office” have the same meanings as provided in section 9-372.\n\n(5) Not later than five business days after each election in which a direct recording electronic voting tabulator is used, the registrars of voters or their designees, representing at least two political parties, shall conduct a manual audit of the votes recorded on at least (A) two direct recording electronic voting tabulators used in each assembly district, or (B) a number of direct recording electronic voting tabulators equal to fifty per cent of the number of voting districts in the municipality, whichever is less. Not later than five business days after a primary in which a direct recording electronic voting tabulator is used, the registrar of voters of the party holding the primary shall conduct such a manual audit by designating two or more individuals, one of whom may be the registrar, representing at least two candidates in the primary. The tabulators audited under this subdivision shall be selected in a random drawing that is announced in advance to the public and is open to the public. All direct recording electronic voting tabulators used within an assembly district shall have an equal chance of being selected for the audit. The Secretary of the State shall determine and publicly announce the method of conducting the random drawing, before the election. The manual audit shall consist of a manual tabulation of the contemporaneously produced, individual, permanent, voter-verified, paper records produced by each voting tabulator subject to the audit and a comparison of such count, with respect to all candidates and any questions or proposals appearing on the ballot, with the electronic vote tabulation reported for such voting tabulator on the day of the election or primary. Such audit shall not be required if a recanvass has been, or will be, conducted on the voting tabulator. Such manual audit shall be noticed in advance and be open to public observation. A reconciliation sheet, on a form prescribed by the Secretary of the State, that reports and compares the manual and electronic vote tabulations of each candidate and question or proposal on each such voting tabulator, along with any discrepancies, shall be prepared by the audit officials, signed and forthwith filed with the town clerk of the municipality and the Secretary of the State. If any contemporaneously produced, individual, permanent, voter-verified, paper record is found to have been damaged, the same procedures described in subdivision (3) of this section for substituting such record with the voting tabulator generated, individual, permanent, paper record produced by the voting tabulator bearing the identical tabulator generated unique identifier as the damaged record shall apply and be utilized by the audit officials to complete the reconciliation. The reconciliation sheet shall be open to public inspection and may be used as prima facie evidence of a discrepancy in any contest arising pursuant to chapter 149. If the audit officials are unable to reconcile the manual count with the electronic vote tabulation and discrepancies, the Secretary of the State shall conduct such further investigation of the voting tabulator malfunction as may be necessary for the purpose of reviewing whether or not to decertify the voting tabulator or tabulators and may order a recanvass in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (4) of this section.\n\n(6) The individual, permanent, voter-verified, paper records contemporaneously produced by any direct recording electronic voting tabulator in use at an election or primary held on or after July 1, 2005, shall be carefully preserved and returned in their designated receptacle in accordance with the requirements of section 9-266 or 9-310, whichever is applicable, and may not be opened or destroyed, except during recanvass or manual audit as set forth in this section, for one hundred eighty days following an election or primary that does not include a federal office, pursuant to section 9-310, or for twenty-two months following an election or primary involving a federal office, pursuant to 42 USC 1974, as amended from time to time.\n\n(7) Nothing in this section shall preclude any candidate or elector from seeking additional remedies pursuant to chapter 149.\n\n(8) After an election or primary, any voting tabulator may be kept locked for a period longer than that prescribed by sections 9-266, 9-310 and 9-447, if such an extended period is ordered by either a court of competent jurisdiction or the State Elections Enforcement Commission. Either the court or said commission may order an audit of such voting tabulators to be conducted by such persons as the court or said commission may designate.\n\n(P.A. 05-188, S. 8; 05-235, S. 30; P.A. 11-20, S. 11.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 05-188 effective July 1, 2005; P.A. 05-235 amended Subdiv.
