The date of such election shall be determined by the board of selectmen of the municipality, and notice of such date shall be filed with the municipal clerk. In determining the date of such election, the board of selectmen shall allow the time specified for holding primaries for municipal office in section 9-423 and the time specified for the selection of party-endorsed candidates for municipal office in section 9-391. On application of twenty electors of the municipality, the date of such election, as determined by the board of selectmen, shall be not later than the one hundred fiftieth day following the filing of such application, provided, if such date of such election is not more than thirty days before a regular election is to be held in such municipality, the Secretary of the State may combine such special municipal election with the regular election. Except as otherwise provided by general statute, the provisions of the general statutes pertaining to elections and primaries shall apply to special municipal elections. No such election may be held unless the municipal clerk first files notice of the office or offices to be filled at such election with the town chairman of the town committee of each major and minor party within the municipality and with the Secretary of the State at least three weeks in advance of the final time specified for the selection of party-endorsed candidates for municipal office in section 9-391.

No such election may be held unless the municipal clerk forthwith upon the occurrence of the vacancy files notice of the office to be filled at the election with the town chairman of the town committee of each major and minor party within the municipality and with the Secretary of the State. Nominations by political parties for such office shall be made as the rules of such parties which are filed with the town clerk provide, in accordance with section 9-390. Such nominations may be made and certified at any time after the vacancy occurs but not later than the thirty-sixth day before the day of the election.

The Secretary of the State shall, on or before the first Monday of October of the year in which such presidential electors are to be elected, transmit blank forms to the several town clerks for the return of the votes; and the lists and returns of the votes shall be made out, certified and directed according to such forms. When an election is to be held for the choice of presidential electors, if any political party has nominated candidates for President and Vice President of the United States, and presidential electors to vote for such presidential and vice presidential candidates have been nominated by a political convention of such party in this state, or in such other manner as entitles the names of such electors to be placed upon the official ballots to be used in such election, the Secretary of the State and any other official charged with the preparation of official ballots to be used in such election, in lieu of placing the names of such presidential electors on such official ballots, shall place on such official ballots a space with the words “Presidential electors for (here insert the last name of the candidate for President, the word‘and’and the last name of the candidate for Vice President)”; and a vote cast therefor shall be counted, and shall be in all respects effective, as a vote for each of the presidential electors representing such candidates for President and Vice President.\n\n(b) In the case of a write-in candidate for President of the United States, such candidate may register his candidacy with the Secretary of the State by submitting his name and the names of a vice presidential candidate and candidates for the office of elector in a number not exceeding the whole number of electors to which the state is then entitled. Such registration shall be on a form prescribed by the Secretary of the State, which form shall include a statement of consent to being a candidate by each proposed candidate for elector and by the candidate for Vice President. Such registration shall not include a designation of political party. A candidate for President may register at any time after January first of the election year and not later than four o'clock p.m. on the fourteenth day preceding the election at which the offices of presidential elector and vice presidential elector are being contested. If a candidate has so registered, a vote may be cast by write-in ballot for such candidate by writing in the last name of the candidate for President and the last name of the candidate for Vice President or only the last name of the candidate for President; such write-in ballot shall be counted, and shall be in all respects effective, as a vote for each of the presidential electors representing such candidates for President and Vice President. No person nominated for the office of President, Vice President, or presidential elector by a major or minor party or by nominating petition shall register as a write-in candidate for such office under the provisions of this section and any such registration of a write-in candidacy filed by such a person shall be void.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 1043, 1103; 1953, S. 658d; 1961, P.A. 374, S. 1; P.A. 77-82, S. 1; P.A. 83-475, S. 17, 43.)\n\nHistory: 1961 act made mandatory rather than directory the use of “Presidential electors for ... and ...” rather than listing the electors by name; P.A. 77-82 added new Subsec.

Other Provisions\n\nThis agreement shall take effect when states cumulatively possessing a majority of the electoral votes have enacted this agreement in substantially the same form and the enactments by such states have taken effect in each state.\n\nAny member state may withdraw from this agreement, except that a withdrawal occurring six months or less before the end of a President's term shall not become effective until a President or Vice President shall have been qualified to serve the next term.\n\nThe chief executive of each member state shall promptly notify the chief executive of all other states of when this agreement has been enacted and has taken effect in that official's state, when the state has withdrawn from this agreement, and when this agreement takes effect generally.\n\nThis agreement shall terminate if the electoral college is abolished.\n\nIf any provision of this agreement is held invalid, the remaining provisions shall not be affected.\n\nARTICLE V. Definitions\n\nFor purposes of this agreement:\n\n“Chief executive” shall mean the Governor of a State of the United States or the Mayor of the District of Columbia;\n\n“Elector slate” shall mean a slate of candidates who have been nominated in a state for the position of presidential elector in association with a presidential slate;\n\n“Chief election official” shall mean the state official or body that is authorized to certify the total number of popular votes for each presidential slate;\n\n“Presidential elector” shall mean an elector for President and Vice President of the United States;\n\n“Presidential elector certifying official” shall mean the state official or body that is authorized to certify the appointment of the state's presidential electors;\n\n“Presidential slate” shall mean a slate of two persons, the first of whom has been nominated as a candidate for President of the United States and the second of whom has been nominated as a candidate for Vice President of the United States, or any legal successors to such persons, regardless of whether both names appear on the ballot presented to the voter in a particular state;\n\n“State” shall mean a State of the United States and the District of Columbia; and\n\n“State-wide popular election” shall mean a general election in which votes are cast for presidential slates by individual voters and counted on a state-wide basis.\n\n(P.A. 18-9, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 18-9 effective May 24, 2018.",
