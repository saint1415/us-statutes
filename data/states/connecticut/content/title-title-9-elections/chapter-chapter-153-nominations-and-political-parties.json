The form shall provide spaces for the names and addresses of the candidates, the offices to which nomination is sought or the positions to which election is sought and the political party holding the primary, and shall provide lines for the signatures, street addresses, dates of birth and the printing of the names of enrolled party members supporting the person or persons on behalf of whose candidacy the petition is used.

Any sheet of a petition filed with the registrar which does not contain such a statement by the circulator as to the authenticity of the signatures thereon, or upon which the statement of the circulator is incomplete in any respect, or which does not contain the certification hereinbefore required by the registrar of the town in which the circulator is an enrolled party member, shall be rejected by the registrar.

(c) to eliminate requirement that each circulator be entitled to vote in primary for which candidacy is being filed, effective January 1, 2004, and applicable to primaries and elections held on or after that date.\n\nSubsec. (c):\n\nSubsec. requires that all petitions obtained by a circulator be invalidated when the circulator is seeking signatures for one mayoral candidate and then, the same circulator, at a later point in time, seeks signatures on a petition for a different candidate to the same office; “candidate” includes placeholder or straw candidates. 284 C. 141. Legislative history that purpose of statute was to prevent candidates from engaging in tactics that had the effect of siphoning votes from a strong rival candidate to a weaker rival supports interpretation that when a person has circulated petition pages for more than the maximum number of candidates to be nominated by a party for the same office or position, the registrar must reject any petition page circulated by that person, regardless of when it was circulated; nothing in Subsec. or other statutes governing election procedures makes any distinction between bona fide candidates and placeholder candidates and the registrar must presume that all candidates who submit candidate consent forms are bona fide candidates and must treat all petitions filed on their behalf the same for purposes of applying Subsec. Id., 554. Because meaning of challenged portion of statute prohibiting person circulating petitions for more than maximum number of candidates to be nominated by a party for same office or position is clear from statute's purpose, practical application and legislative history, it is not unconstitutionally vague, and although it implicates core political speech, burden it imposes is slight and since it furthers important state interests it does not violate right to free speech or association.

      "text": "(a) Voting tabulators shall be used at each primary, provided, (1) if, because of the number of offices and positions to be voted upon at a primary, there is an insufficient number of vertical columns on any ballot to be used in a municipality, the vote in such municipality at such primary for such offices or positions as the Secretary of the State determines shall be taken by paper ballots, and (2) if, because of the number of candidates for any office or position to be voted upon at a primary, there is an insufficient number of horizontal rows with respect to such office or position on any ballot to be used in the municipality, the vote in such municipality at such primary for such office or position shall be taken by paper ballots. More than one voting tabulator may be used in any voting district if the registrar so prescribes. The registrar shall furnish a number of voting booths sufficient to provide a voting booth for each five hundred or fraction of five hundred electors eligible to vote at such primary in the municipality or voting district, as the case may be, and other necessary equipment. In each polling place in which a party has authorized unaffiliated electors, pursuant to section 9-431, to vote for some but not all offices to be contested at the primary, a separate voting tabulator shall be used for such unaffiliated electors and the registrar shall separately furnish one voting booth for each five hundred or fraction of five hundred enrolled party members and one voting booth for each five hundred or fraction of five hundred unaffiliated electors authorized to vote at such primary in such district. In determining such number of electors, enrolled party members or unaffiliated electors, the registrar shall not count the names on the enrollment or registry lists of seventy-five per cent of such electors, unaffiliated electors or enrolled party members who reside in institutions, as defined in section 9-159q. The registrar may provide more than the minimum number of voting booths required by this section.\n\n(b) Each tabulator shall be so arranged that the elector may vote for as many persons for nomination or election to each office or position as there are persons to be nominated or elected, as the case may be, and no more, and so that the elector may vote for individual candidates; provided the vote for justices of the peace shall be by slate, as provided in section 9-443.\n\n(c) The registrar shall appoint from among the enrolled party members in the state, to serve in each polling place, the primary polling place officials, who shall consist of (1) one moderator, (2) at least one but not more than two official checkers, (3) at least one but not more than two ballot clerks, (4) at least one but not more than two voting tabulator tenders for each tabulator in use at such primary, and (5) in towns with two or more voting districts, at least one but not more than two assistant registrars, provided (A) in the case of either a municipality or a political subdivision holding a primary, if no enrolled party member can be found or no such person consents to serve as a moderator, the registrar may appoint any elector who resides in the state and is a certified moderator to be moderator, (B) in the case of a political subdivision holding a primary, if an insufficient number of enrolled party members who reside in the state consent to serve as checkers, voting tabulator tenders or assistant registrars, the registrar may appoint any elector who resides in the state to be a checker, voting tabulator tender or assistant registrar, and (C) in the case of either a municipality or a political subdivision holding more than one primary on the same day for different political parties, one certified moderator may serve as moderator for both primaries, if the registrars of voters so agree. If unaffiliated electors are authorized under section 9-431 to vote for some but not all of the offices to be contested at the primary, the registrar shall appoint two additional checkers to check the list of unaffiliated electors who are authorized to vote on the separate tabulators. If unaffiliated electors are authorized under section 9-431 to vote in the primary of either of two parties in the same polling place, whether for some or for all offices to be contested at the primary, each such registrar shall appoint two additional checkers to check the list of unaffiliated electors who are authorized to vote in either such primary.\n\n(d) The registrar shall designate one of the moderators so appointed by the registrar to be head moderator or shall appoint as head moderator an elector who is not also moderator of a polling place and who shall be deemed a primary official. The registrar may also appoint a deputy head moderator to assist the head moderator in the performance of the head moderator's duties. A deputy head moderator shall also be deemed to be a primary official. Each registrar's appointments of primary polling place officials, except moderators of polling places, and of designees to conduct supervised voting of absentee ballots pursuant to sections 9-159q and 9-159r shall be divided equally, as nearly as may be, between designees of the party-endorsed candidates and designees of one or more of the contestants, provided, if a party-endorsed candidate is a member of a party other than the one holding the primary, such primary officials shall be enrolled party members of the party holding the primary. Names of designees and alternate designees for such positions shall be submitted in writing by party-endorsed candidates and contestants to the registrar not later than twenty-one days before the primary and, if such lists are not so presented, all such appointments shall be made by the registrar but in the above-mentioned proportion. The registrar shall notify all such candidates and contestants of their right to submit a list of designees under this section. The registrars shall train each prospective primary poll worker to perform in the poll worker's designated position. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the registrar shall appoint as moderators only persons who are certified to serve as moderators or alternate moderators pursuant to section 9-229, unless there is an insufficient number of such persons who are enrolled members of the registrar's party holding the primary, in which case the registrar may appoint a new moderator in accordance with section 9-229, but only to the extent of such insufficiency. Primary central counting moderators and absentee ballot counters shall also be deemed primary officials. No primary official shall perform services for any candidate at the primary on primary day.\n\n(e) If paper ballots are required for the vote on any office or position in a municipality, the clerk of the municipality, in consultation with the registrars of voters, shall print a paper ballot for use in such primary for nomination to such office or election to such position. The Secretary of the State shall prescribe the form of such paper ballot. The Secretary of the State may prescribe general rules for the use of paper ballots in any primary, including the duties of officials at the polls with regard to the same, the marking of the same and the counting of the same. The procedure to be followed when paper ballots are so used shall conform, as nearly as may be, to the procedure applicable to voting tabulators provided in this chapter and to the law governing the use of paper ballots in regular elections and such rules shall have the force and effect of law. Chapter 54 shall not apply to rules made pursuant to this section.\n\n(f) The provisions of section 9-258 concerning additional lines of electors at a polling place, and of section 9-258a concerning two shifts of officials at a polling place, shall apply to a primary. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the provisions of the general statutes relating to the use of voting tabulators at regular elections shall apply as nearly as may be to the use of voting tabulators at primaries.\n\n(June, 1955, S. 600d; November, 1955, S.

The name of each candidate for town committee or municipal office, except for the municipal offices of state senator and state representative, shall appear on the ballot as authorized by each candidate.

On the first horizontal line, below the designation of the office or position in each column, shall be placed the name of the party-endorsed candidate for such office or position, such name to be marked with an asterisk; provided, where more than one person may be voted for for any office or position, the names of the party-endorsed candidates shall be arranged in alphabetical order from left to right under the appropriate office or position designation and shall continue, if necessary, from left to right on the next lower line or lines.

(2) If a single certificate or a single petition has been filed under subsection (a) of section 9-400 on behalf of two or more candidates and proposing one candidate for each state office to be contested at such primary, a single row shall be used for the names of such candidates and precedence as to row between such certificates and petitions shall be determined by the Secretary of the State by lot in a ceremony which shall be open to the public.

Vacancies in candidacies thereafter occurring shall not cause the position of any candidate's name on the ballot to be changed to another position. The name of any candidate whose candidacy has been vacated shall not appear on the ballot. If such a vacancy results in the cancellation of a primary for any office, the office column or columns where the names of the candidates and the title of the office would have appeared if the primary for that office had not been cancelled shall be left blank.

The municipal clerk shall have the ballot prepared so that the name of any candidate who has vacated such candidate's candidacy is deleted and so that the name of any candidate chosen to fill a vacancy in candidacy appears in the same position as that in which the vacated candidacy appeared. The municipal clerk may use printed stickers in preparing the ballots if the ballots were printed before the selection of a candidate to fill a vacancy in candidacy. If a vacancy in candidacy is not filled, the municipal clerk shall cause the name of the candidate whose candidacy has been vacated to be obscured in such manner that such name is no longer visible.

The municipal clerk shall prepare a list of the names of all candidates on each slate for election as justices of the peace, including the complete ballot designation of each such slate as provided in this subsection, which shall be posted in the polling places by each moderator for the inspection of the electors prior to voting.\n\n(i) The names of candidates for nomination to any elective office or for election as members of a town committee, as the case may be, shall be separated from each other by a light line, but shall not be separated from each other on the ballot by names of candidates for any other office or position or by columns used for any other office or position; and the column or columns used for each office or position shall be separated from the columns used for other offices or positions by a heavy line.\n\n(j) All ballots used at a primary shall be prepared by the clerk of the municipality in which such primary is held and shall be printed at the expense of the municipality. Each municipality shall provide for all polling places:\n\n(1) At least forty-eight hours before the primary, such clerk shall have sample ballots for general distribution, which shall contain the offices or positions and names of candidates to be voted upon. Each such sample ballot shall also include printed instructions approved by the Secretary of the State concerning the use of the voting tabulator and information concerning the date of the primary and the hours during which polling places will be open. Such clerk shall have available for distribution such number of sample ballots as such clerk deems advisable, but in no event less than three which shall be posted inside the polling place so as to be visible to those within the polling place during the whole day of the primary.
