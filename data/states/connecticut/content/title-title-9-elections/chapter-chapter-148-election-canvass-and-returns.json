      "text": "(a) If, within three days after an election, it appears to the moderator that there is a discrepancy in the returns of any voting district, such moderator shall forthwith within said period summon, by written notice delivered personally, the recanvass officials, consisting of at least two checkers of different political parties and at least two absentee ballot counters of different political parties who served at such election, and the registrars of voters of the municipality in which the election was held and such other officials as may be required to conduct such recanvass. Such written notice shall require the clerk or registrars of voters, as the case may be, to bring with them the depository envelopes required by section 9-150a, the package of write-in ballots provided for in section 9-310, the absentee ballot applications, the list of absentee ballot applications, the registry list and the moderators' returns and shall require such recanvass officials to meet at a specified time not later than the fifth business day after such election to recanvass the returns of a voting tabulator or voting tabulators or absentee ballots or write-in ballots used in such district in such election. If any of such recanvass officials are unavailable at the time of the recanvass, the registrar of voters of the same political party as that of the recanvass official unable to attend shall designate another elector having previous training and experience in the conduct of elections to take his place. Before such recanvass is made, such moderator shall give notice, in writing, to the chairperson of the town committee of each political party which nominated candidates for the election, and, in the case of a state election, not later than twenty-four hours after a determination is made regarding the need for a recanvass to the Secretary of the State, of the time and place where such recanvass is to be made; and each such chairperson may send party representatives to be present at such recanvass. Such party representatives may observe, but no one other than a recanvass official may take part in the recanvass. If any irregularity in the recanvass procedure is noted by such a party representative, he shall be permitted to present evidence of such irregularity in any contest relating to the election.\n\n(b) The moderator shall determine the place or places where the recanvass shall be conducted and, if such recanvass is held before the tabulators are boxed and collected in the manner required by section 9-266, the moderator may either require that such recanvass of such tabulators be conducted in each place where the tabulators are located, or he may require that they be removed to one central place, where such recanvass shall be conducted. All recanvassing procedures shall be open to public observation, subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section. Such recanvass officials shall, in the presence of such moderator and registrars of voters, make a record of the number on the seal and the number on the protective counter, if one is provided, on each voting tabulator specified by such moderator. Such registrars of voters in the presence of such moderator shall turn over the keys of each such tabulator to such recanvass officials, and such recanvass officials, in the presence of such registrars of voters and moderator, shall immediately proceed to recanvass the vote cast thereon, and shall then open the package of absentee ballots and recanvass the vote cast thereon. In the course of the recanvass of the absentee ballot vote the recanvass officials shall check all outer envelopes for absentee ballots against the inner envelopes for such ballots and against the registry list to verify postmarks, addresses and registry list markings and also to determine whether the number of envelopes from which absentee ballots have been removed is the same as the number of persons checked as having voted by absentee ballot. The write-in ballots shall also be recanvassed at this time. Any party representative present shall have a right to view each ballot as it is being recanvassed by the recanvass officials, so as to be able to discern the markings on such ballot. All of the recanvass officials shall use the same forms for tallies and returns as were used at the original canvass and the absentee ballot counters shall also sign the tallies.\n\n(c) The votes shall be announced and recorded in the manner prescribed in section 9-309 on return forms provided by the registrars of voters and appended thereto shall be a statement signed by the moderator indicating the time and place of the recanvass and the names, addresses, titles and party affiliations of the recanvass officials. The write-in ballots shall be replaced in a properly secured sealed package. Upon the completion of such recanvass, any tabulator used in such recanvass shall be locked and sealed, the keys thereof shall immediately be returned to such registrars of voters and such tabulator shall remain so locked until the expiration of fourteen days after such election or for such longer period as is ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. The absentee ballots shall be replaced in their wrappers and be resealed by the moderator in the presence of the recanvass officials. Upon the completion of such recanvass, such moderator and at least two of the recanvass officials of different political parties shall forthwith prepare and sign such return forms which shall contain a written statement giving the result of such recanvass for each tabulator and each package of absentee ballots whose returns were so recanvassed, setting forth whether or not the original canvass was correctly made and stating whether or not the discrepancy still remains unaccounted for. Such return forms containing such statement shall forthwith be filed by the moderator in the office of such clerk. If such recanvass reveals that the original canvass of returns was not correctly made, such return forms containing such statement so filed with the clerk shall constitute a corrected return. In the case of a state election, a recanvass return shall be made in duplicate on a form prescribed and provided by the Secretary of the State, and the moderator shall file one copy with the Secretary of the State and one copy with the town clerk not later than ten days after the election. Such recanvass return shall be substituted for the original return and shall have the same force and effect as an original return.\n\n(d) The moderator may, when any disorder arises that interferes with the conduct of a recanvass, including any attempt by a person other than a recanvass official to take part in such recanvass or by such a person to communicate with a recanvass official other than the moderator, and the offender refuses to submit to the moderator's lawful authority, order that the offender be removed by the recanvass officials from such recanvass until the offender conforms to order or, if need be, until such recanvass is completed.\n\n(e) As used in this section, (1) “moderator” means, in the case of municipalities not divided into voting districts, the moderator of the election and, in the case of municipalities divided into voting districts, the head moderator of the election, and (2) “registrars of voters”, in a municipality where there are different registrars of voters for different voting districts, means the registrars of voters in the voting district in which, at the last-preceding election, the presiding officer for the purpose of declaring the result of the vote of the whole municipality was moderator.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 1214; 1953, S. 789d; 1957, P.A. 526, S. 5; 1959, P.A. 527, S. 1; 1963, P.A. 311, S. 1; 1967, P.A. 885, S. 2; 1971, P.A. 836, S. 2; P.A. 77-239, S. 1; P.A. 85-382, S. 1; P.A. 93-30, S. 9, 14; P.A. 95-88, S. 3; P.A. 11-173, S. 21; July Sp.

Forthwith after a regular or special election for municipal office, or forthwith upon tabulation of the vote for state and district offices by the Secretary of the State, when at any such election the plurality of an elected candidate for an office over the vote for a defeated candidate receiving the next highest number of votes was either (1) less than a vote equivalent to one-half of one per cent of the total number of votes cast for the office but not more than two thousand votes, or (2) less than twenty votes, there shall be a recanvass of the returns of the voting tabulator or voting tabulators and absentee ballots used in such election for such office unless such defeated candidate or defeated candidates, as the case may be, for such office file a written statement waiving this right to such canvass with the municipal clerk in the case of a municipal office, or with the Secretary of the State in the case of a state or district office. In the case of state and district offices, the Secretary of the State upon tabulation of the votes for such offices shall notify the town clerks in the state or district, as the case may be, of the state and district offices which qualify for an automatic recanvass and shall also notify each candidate for any such office. When a recanvass is to be held the municipal clerk shall promptly notify the moderator, as defined in section 9-311, who shall proceed forthwith to cause a recanvass of such returns of the office in question in the same manner as is provided in said section 9-311. In addition to the notice required under section 9-311, the moderator shall before such recanvass is made give notice in writing of the time when, and place where, such recanvass is to be made to each candidate for a municipal office which qualifies for an automatic recanvass under this section. Nothing in this section shall preclude the right to judicial proceedings on behalf of a candidate under any provision of chapter 149. For the purposes of this section, “the total number of votes cast for the office” means in the case of multiple openings for the same office, the total number of electors checked as having voted in the state, district, municipality or political subdivision, as the case may be. When a recanvass of the returns for an office for which there are multiple openings is required by the provisions of this section, the returns for all candidates for all openings for the office shall be recanvassed. No one other than a recanvass official shall take part in the recanvass. If any irregularity in the recanvass procedure is noted by a candidate, he shall be permitted to present evidence of such irregularity in any contest relating to the election.\n\n(1963, P.A. 185, S. 1; 1967, P.A. 885, S. 3; 1971, P.A. 542, S. 1; P.A. 80-281, S. 14, 31; P.A. 84-319, S. 37, 49; P.A. 85-382, S. 2; P.A. 11-20, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: 1967 act provided for adding “of the office in question” to “cause a recanvass of such returns”, also provided for the clerk to notify the secretary of the state upon receipt of application for a recanvass where a state election is involved; 1971 act provided that the definitions contained in Sec. 9-372 would apply for purposes of section to state, district and municipal offices but that office of presidential elector is deemed a state office, deleted provision for application for recanvass and provided that a recanvass would take place where votes were within the limits already specified, immediately, in the case of municipal elections or upon the tabulation of the vote for state and district offices by the secretary of the state, unless a written waiver is filed by defeated candidate(s); P.A. 80-281 provided, in the case of multiple openings for the same office, the total number of votes cast means the total number of electors checked as having voted and provided that a recanvass in that case will result in the returns for all candidates being recanvassed; P.A. 84-319 amended section to provide uniformity in procedures for recanvass after primaries and elections; P.A. 85-382 required only recanvass officials to take part in recanvass and permitted candidates to present evidence of irregularities noted in any contest relating to the election; pursuant to P.A. 11-20, “machine” and “machines” were changed editorially by the Revisors to “tabulator” and “tabulators”, effective May 24, 2011.\n\nInvoking provisions of section does not preclude candidate from obtaining judicial review under Sec. 9-328. 155 C. 68.

After receipt of such report, the Secretary of the State shall file such report with the State Elections Enforcement Commission.\n\n(e) For the purposes of this section, a ballot that has not been properly completed will be deemed to be a ballot on which (1) votes have been marked by the voter outside the vote targets, (2) votes have been marked by the voter using a manual marking device that cannot be read by the voting tabulator, or (3) in the judgment of the registrars of voters, the voter marked the ballot in such a manner that the voting tabulator may not have read the marks as votes cast.\n\n(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 9-311, the Secretary of the State shall order a discrepancy recanvass of the returns of an election or primary for any office if a discrepancy, as defined in subsection (o) of this section, exists where the margin of victory in the race for such office is less than the amount of the discrepancy multiplied by the total number of voting districts where such race appeared on the ballot, provided in a year in which the Secretary of the State is a candidate for an office on the ballot and that office is subject to an audit as provided by this section, the State Elections Enforcement Commission shall order a discrepancy recanvass if a discrepancy, as defined by subsection (o) of this section, has occurred that could affect the outcome of the election or primary for such office.\n\n(g) If The University of Connecticut report described in subsection (d) of this section indicates that a voting tabulator failed to record votes accurately and in the manner provided by the general statutes, the Secretary of the State shall require that the voting tabulator be examined and recertified by the Secretary of the State, or the Secretary's designee. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the Secretary of the State from requiring that a voting tabulator be examined and recertified.\n\n(h) The audit report filed pursuant to subsection (d) of this section shall be open to public inspection and may be used as prima facie evidence of a discrepancy in any contest arising pursuant to chapter 149 or for any other cause of action arising from such election or primary.\n\n(i) If the audit officials are unable to reconcile the manual or electronic count from an audit described in subsection (a) of this section with the electronic vote tabulation and discrepancies from the election or primary, the Secretary of the State shall conduct such further investigation of the voting tabulator malfunction as may be necessary for the purpose of reviewing whether or not to decertify the voting tabulator or tabulators in question or to order the voting tabulator to be examined and recertified pursuant to subsection (g) of this section. Any report produced by the Secretary of the State as a result of such investigation shall be filed with the State Elections Enforcement Commission and the commission may initiate such further investigation in accordance with subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 9-7b as may be required to determine if any violations of the general statutes concerning election law have been committed.\n\n(j) The individual paper ballots used at an election or primary shall be carefully preserved and returned in their designated receptacle in accordance with the requirements of section 9-266 or 9-310, whichever is applicable.\n\n(k) Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude any candidate or elector from seeking additional remedies pursuant to chapter 149.\n\n(l) After an election or primary, any voting tabulator may be kept locked for a period longer than that prescribed by sections 9-266, 9-310 and 9-447, if such an extended period is ordered by either a court of competent jurisdiction, the Secretary of the State or the State Elections Enforcement Commission. Either the court or the Secretary of the State may order an audit of such voting tabulator to be conducted by such persons as the court or the Secretary of the State may designate, provided the State Elections Enforcement Commission may order such an audit under the circumstances prescribed in subsection (f) of this section. If the machine utilized in such election or primary is an optical scan voting system, such order to lock such machine shall include the tabulator, memory card and all other components and processes utilized in the programming of such machine.\n\n(m) The Secretary of the State may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, as may be necessary for the conduct of the manual or electronic tabulation of the paper ballots described in subsection (a) of this section and to establish guidelines for expanded audits when there are differences between the manual or electronic counts from the audit described in subsection (a) of this section and tabulator counts from the election or primary.\n\n(n) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, the Secretary of the State shall have access to the code in any voting machine whenever any problem is discovered as a result of an audit described in subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(o) As used in this section, “discrepancy” means any difference in vote totals between tabulator counts from an election or primary and manual or electronic counts from an audit described in subsection (a) of this section in a voting district that exceeds one-half of one per cent of the lesser amount of the vote totals between such tabulator counts and such manual or electronic counts where such differences cannot be resolved through an accounting of ballots that were not marked properly in accordance with subsection (e) of this section, “state election” means “state election”, as defined in section 9-1, “municipal election” means a municipal election held pursuant to section 9-164, “manual” means by hand and without the assistance of electronic equipment and “electronic” means through the use of equipment described in section 9-320g.\n\n(P.A. 07-194, S. 1; P.A. 11-20, S. 35; P.A. 15-224, S. 29; P.A. 16-76, S. 1; June Sp.
