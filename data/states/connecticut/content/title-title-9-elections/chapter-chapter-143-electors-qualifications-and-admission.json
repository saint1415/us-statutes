An elector shall be deemed to have confirmed in writing that the elector has moved out of the municipality if (1) the elector has submitted a change of address form for purposes of a state motor vehicle operator's license, unless the elector states on the form that the change of address is not for voter registration purposes, (2) the elector has submitted a change of address form to a voter registration agency, as defined in section 9-23n, and such agency has provided such change of address to the registrars of voters, or (3) the registrars of voters have received a cancellation of previous registration from any other election official indicating that such elector has registered as an elector outside such municipality.\n\n(c) Whenever the registrars of voters of a town remove from the registry list the name of an elector who has submitted a change of address to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles or a voter registration agency under subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (b) of this section, indicating that the elector has moved out of such town, the registrars shall send the elector, by forwardable mail to the elector's former address from such list or current address in the new town, (1) a notice of removal, (2) information explaining how to have the elector's name restored to such list, which shall be in a form prescribed by the Secretary of the State, and (3) a mail-in voter registration application which can be used by the elector to apply for admission as an elector in the new town. If such notice, information and application are sent to the elector's former address and are returned undeliverable, the registrars shall mail such documents to the elector's address in the new town.\n\n(d) The registrars shall enter the names on such list by street and number of the house, when the houses are numbered, so that there shall be entered on the list first, the street, avenue or road; second, the number of the house or residence in numerical order or, if the registrars of any town find it more convenient, by odd and even numbers in numerical order; and third, the names of the electors in such house in alphabetical order. The names of any electors who cannot be so listed shall be listed alphabetically in the voting district wherein any such elector is a bona fide resident. The registrars of voters may consecutively number the names on the registry list, may include voter identification numbers for the names on the registry list, and may include a mark, as prescribed by the Secretary of the State, next to the name of each first-time registrant on the system who registers to vote on or after January 1, 2003, and does not provide identification with his or her mail-in voter registration application as provided in the Help America Vote Act, P.L. 107-252, as amended from time to time, provided such list shall comply in all respects with the requirements of law other than for the addition of such numbers and marks. The registrars shall not use Social Security numbers for any such voter identification numbers.\n\n(e) In any case in which the registrars have obtained reliable information of an elector's change of address within the municipality, the registrars shall enter the name of such elector on the registry list at the place where the elector then resides, provided, if such reliable information is the National Change of Address System of the United States Postal Service, the registrar shall change the registry list and send the elector a notice of the change by forwardable mail and a postage prepaid preaddressed return form by which the elector may verify or correct the address information. If during the canvass the registrars determine that an elector has moved out of the municipality and such elector has not confirmed in writing that the elector has moved out of the municipality, the registrars shall, not later than May first, send to the elector, by forwardable mail, a notice required by the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, P.L. 103-31, as amended from time to time, together with a postage prepaid preaddressed return card on which the elector may state the elector's current address. In the year of a presidential preference primary, the registrars shall send such notice not earlier than the date of such primary. If the registrar does not receive the return card within thirty days after it is sent, the elector's name, including the name of an elector who has not voted in two consecutive federal elections, shall be placed on the inactive registry list for four years. At the expiration of such period of time on the inactive registry list, such name shall be removed from the registry list. If such elector applies to restore the elector's name to the active registry list or votes during such period, the elector's name shall be restored to the active registry list. Such registrars shall retain a duplicate copy or record of each such notice in their office or, if the registrars do not have a permanent office, in the office space provided under section 9-5a, and shall note on such duplicate copy or record the date on which such notice was mailed. In each municipality, any elector, upon change of residence within the municipality, may cause the elector's registration to be transferred to the elector's new address by presenting to the registrars a new application for voter registration. The registrars shall thereupon enter the elector's name on the list at the elector's new residence; provided no transfer of registration shall be made on the registry list on election day without the consent of each registrar.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 1001; 1953, 1955, S. 537d; 1961, P.A. 61; 1963, P.A. 174; 645, S. 5; P.A. 75-287, S. 1; P.A. 77-283, S. 1; P.A. 79-189, S. 4, 9; P.A. 83-213, S. 4; 83-391, S. 9, 24; 83-475, S. 6, 43; P.A. 84-146, S. 4; P.A. 88-37, S. 2; 88-48, S. 4, 5; P.A. 89-19, S. 1, 4; P.A. 94-121, S. 23, 33; P.A. 97-154, S. 24, 27; P.A. 98-67, S. 1, 10; P.A. 99-112, S. 5; P.A. 00-66, S. 18; P.A. 02-130, S. 16; June 30 Sp.
