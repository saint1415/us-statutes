A.B.”. If the owner or lessor, or the owner's or lessor's legal representative, attorney-at-law or attorney-in-fact knows of the presence of an occupant but does not know the name of such occupant, the notice for such occupant may be addressed to such occupant as “John Doe”, “Jane Doe” or some other alias which reasonably characterizes the person to be served.\n\n(c) A copy of such notice shall be delivered to each lessee or occupant or left at such lessee's or occupant's place of residence or, if the rental agreement or lease concerns commercial property, at the place of the commercial establishment by a proper officer or indifferent person.

A use and occupancy disclaimer may be included in or combined with such notice, provided that such disclaimer does not take effect until after the date specified in the notice for the lessee or occupant to quit possession or occupancy or the date of the completion of the pretermination process, whichever is later. Such inclusion or combination does not thereby render the notice required pursuant to this section equivocal. Such disclaimer shall be in substantially the following form: “Any payments tendered after the date specified to quit possession or occupancy, or the date of the completion of the pretermination process if that is later, will be accepted for use and occupancy only and not for rent, with full reservation of rights to continue with the eviction action.”\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 8274; 1949, S. 3217d; 1957, P.A. 291, S. 1; 1959, P.A. 28, S. 130; 1969, P.A. 313, S. 1; P.A. 74-183, S. 115, 291; P.A. 76-95, S. 23, 27; 76-435, S. 75, 82; 76-436, S. 102, 681; P.A. 77-451, S. 5; P.A. 78-280, S. 61, 127; P.A. 79-571, S. 46; P.A. 80-399, S. 1; P.A. 81-237; P.A. 82-274, S. 1; P.A. 86-210; 86-286, S. 2; P.A. 87-507, S. 1; P.A. 89-254, S. 8; P.A. 90-230, S. 98, 101; P.A. 91-5; 91-383, S. 18; P.A. 92-171, S. 1; May Sp.

Notice to quit possession equally valid whether served 10 days before termination of the lease or at least 10 days before the time specified in the notice for the lessee to quit possession. 12 CS 264. Cited. 13 CS 441. Nature of summary process discussed. 15 CS 141. Notices to quit which are served on two or more tenants need not be identical; statute merely requires that they be duplicates of their originals; a notice addressed specifically to one tenant and another notice addressed specifically to another tenant met the statutory requirements. 23 CS 291.

Landlord, after withdrawing its complaint in a summary process action, is required to serve a new notice to quit prior to commencing a new summary process action against a tenant under Sec. 47a-23a. 292 C. 459.\n\nCited. 4 CA 162; Id., 627; 5 CA 101; 6 CA 373; 7 CA 301; Id., 639; 9 CA 477; 11 CA 360; 13 CA 150; 16 CA 574; 18 CA 384; 19 CA 483; Id., 564; 20 CA 159; 27 CA 530; 28 CA 684; 31 CA 575. The covenant of quiet enjoyment operates as a shield for the lessee in protecting his possessory interests in his leasehold; it does not serve as a sword of the landlord to terminate a lease agreement. 35 CA 185. Cited. 36 CA 432. Legislature did not intend to give an owner and lessor, but not a sublessor, an expeditious means of obtaining possession of the premises from a commercial tenant for nonpayment of rent; thus, plaintiff, as sublessor, could avail itself of section. 81 CA 486. Property owner may bring summary process action against one who has no right or privilege to occupy the premises without having to allege that the occupier is a tenant; furthermore, because statute requires party seeking summary process only to allege and prove ownership of the subject property and to assert a demand for possession, defendants could not prevail on their claim that plaintiff failed to prove that it was in possession of the premises or that it sought possession. 88 CA 661. Court order restoring tenant to possession in entry and detainer action did not create a new tenancy and plaintiff in summary process action was not required to serve a new notice to quit possession. 121 CA 790. The use of “or” indicates the disjunctive, therefore notice need not reflect both the owner's identity and the identity of the owner's legal representative, attorney-at-law or attorney-in-fact. 128 CA 805. Property manager's statements, including those of wanting to avoid court and attorneys and willingness to forgive 2-months unpaid rent, rendered previous unequivocal notice to quit equivocal, and was contrary to goal of insulating tenant from confusion and uncertainty. 132 CA 582. Although notice to quit did not set out the specific violation of the lease, it stated that defendant had to quit the premises due to violations of the lease and tracked the language of Subsec. (a), which met the requirements of Subsec. (b) re notices to quit. 133 CA 1. Section does not contain any language or provision providing that the trial court is deprived of subject matter jurisdiction over a summary process action unless al owners of the subject property agree with the initiation of the action by a statement in the complaint or some sworn statement. 204 CA 537.\n\nSovereign immunity to action under statute claimed; not waived by entering into lease under former Sec. 4-128; nonpayment of rent not a “taking” in constitutional sense which would nullify defense of sovereign immunity. 35 CS 180. Statute does not require the existence of a landlord-tenant relationship or consistency of ownership for an owner to evict. Id., 233. Defendant to tenant's unsolicited mailing of money order for next month's rent to landlord after issuance of notice to quit and prior to issuance of complaint and plaintiff's mere retention of money order was insufficient to constitute acceptance of rent; to constitute acceptance, retention requires demonstration of ownership such as endorsement or actual cashing of check; issuance of complaint one day after receipt of rental offer was unequivocal manifestation of plaintiff's rejection of tenant's rental offer. Id., 258. Cited. Id., 274; Id., 297. Notice to quit may be signed by duly authorized attorney. Id., 549. Discovery is available in summary process proceedings; summary process deemed and intended by legislature to be civil action. 36 CS 47. Cited. Id., 626; 37 CS 654; 38 CS 1; Id., 8; Id., 70; Id., 341; 40 CS 4; Id., 100.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nWhere notice to quit provided wrong year for date to quit, trial court properly found that defect was circumstantial under Sec. 52-123 and that defendant had received actual notice in accordance with Subsec. 292 C. 381. Notice to quit signed by associate in lead attorney's name followed by associate's initials and with the explicit authorization of lead attorney satisfied requirement that notice to quit be given by owner's legal representative. 315 C. 387.\n\nIf lease is subsequent to mortgage, foreclosure extinguishes lease. 52 CA 37. Reasons for issuing a notice to quit set forth in Subsec. are the only reasons that an owner may rely on for issuing a valid notice to quit; where owner relies on Subdiv. (4) in notice to quit, but fails to show that tenant was member of the class described in Sec. 47a-23c, the notice is invalid; prefatory language in Subdiv. (4) indicates that legislature intended Subdiv. to apply only to summary process actions authorized by Sec. 47a-23c(b) and only to the protected class of tenants described therein. 68 CA 638. Where legal title to real property rested with estate of decedent, it was within executor's power, as fiduciary and legal representative of the estate, to maintain summary process action on behalf of estate. 118 CA 577. Subdiv. (3): Valid notice to quit can occur simultaneously with termination of right or privilege to occupy. 144 CA 188.",

If a minor, who is or will be bound by a summary process judgment under subdivision (1) of this subsection, is named in a summary process complaint, the court, upon motion of any party or upon its own motion, may order the name of such minor to be stricken from the record of the action and the clerk shall remove or arrange for the removal of such minor's name from the record of the case maintained on the Internet web site of the Judicial Branch.\n\n(b) Upon entry of judgment, the clerk shall mail a notice of judgment to all defendants against whom judgment was rendered. Such notice shall be addressed to the named defendants and any other current occupants and shall contain the names of all defendants against whom judgment was entered, the date of judgment and notice of the right to apply for a stay of execution. The notice shall be on a form prescribed by the Office of the Chief Court Administrator, shall be in clear and simple language and in readable format, and shall include a conspicuous notice to all occupants not named in the judgment, in large boldface type, that any such occupant who claims to have a right to continue to occupy the premises should promptly complete and file with the clerk of the court a claim of exemption from the judgment. If no such notice would otherwise be sent to the premises, an additional notice shall be sent to the premises, addressed to the named defendants “or any other current occupants”.\n\n(c) Any occupant not named in the action who claims not to be subject to the summary process action because his occupancy commenced prior to service of the notice to quit or his occupancy commenced or continued with the consent of the plaintiff or under a right to occupy equal or superior to the rights of the plaintiff may, at any time before or after judgment but prior to issuance of an execution, file under oath a claim of exemption from such action. The Office of the Chief Court Administrator shall prescribe a form upon which such claim can be made, which form shall be in clear and simple language and in readable format. Upon the filing of such a claim, the clerk shall schedule a hearing, which shall be held not more than seven days after the date of filing. Execution shall not issue until the court renders its decision on the claim. The claimant shall have the burden of proof to show that his occupancy commenced prior to service of the notice to quit or that his occupancy was commenced or continued with the consent of the plaintiff or under a right to occupy equal or superior to the rights of the plaintiff. The burden of proof shall be upon the plaintiff to show that he did not know of the presence of the occupant or the name of the occupant, as the case may be. For purposes of this chapter, if rent or use and occupancy payments have been made to the plaintiff or his agent by the occupant, the plaintiff shall be deemed to have known of the presence and the name of the occupant. The court shall determine whether the claimant is bound by the action and, if the court finds that the claimant is not bound, it shall declare the claimant to be exempt from the action. In order to obtain a judgment for possession of the premises as part of such action the plaintiff shall serve the previously exempt occupant with a notice to quit possession pursuant to section 47a-23. If the occupant is still in possession after the date to quit possession has passed, the plaintiff shall serve the occupant with an amended writ, summons and complaint adding the occupant as a party defendant to such action of summary process. Any occupant not exempt from the action shall have the same rights and obligations as a named defendant and shall be bound by any judgment. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 47a-42 and 47a-42a, no summary process execution shall be issued or enforced unless valid execution has been issued against all occupants of the premises, except that such execution may be issued and enforced, without issuing or enforcing execution against other occupants, upon a person against whom a judgment has been entered based upon that person's having conducted himself in a manner which constitutes a serious nuisance by using the premises or any area within fifteen hundred feet of any housing authority property in which such person resides for the illegal sale of drugs, as defined in subparagraph (D) of section 47a-15.\n\n(d) Nothing in this section shall in any way limit other remedies available in law or equity to any person, including remedies available after issuance of an execution.\n\n(P.A. 87-507, S. 3; P.A. 89-254, S. 10; P.A. 92-171, S. 6; P.A. 95-247, S. 3; P.A. 97-231, S. 6; P.A. 12-133, S. 5; P.A. 16-67, S. 10.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 89-254 amended Subsec.
