Such person may accept or reject an anatomical gift in whole or in part. Subject to the terms of the document of gift and sections 19a-289 to 19a-289v, inclusive, a person that accepts an anatomical gift of an entire body may allow embalming, burial or cremation, and use of remains in a funeral service.
