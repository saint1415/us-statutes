Any owner or occupant of any property who maintains such property, whether real or personal, or any part thereof, in a manner which violates the provisions of the Public Health Code enacted pursuant to the authority of sections 19a-36 and 19a-37 shall be deemed to be maintaining a nuisance or source of filth injurious to the public health. Any local director of health or a local director of health's authorized agent or an environmental health specialist authorized by such director may enter all places within such director's jurisdiction where there is just cause to suspect any nuisance or source of filth exists, and abate or remediate or cause to be abated or remediated such nuisance and remove or cause to be removed such filth.\n\n(b) When any such nuisance or source of filth is found on private property, such director of health shall order the owner or occupant of such property, or both, to remove, abate or remediate the same within such time as the director directs. If the owner of such property is a registrant, such director may deliver the order in accordance with section 7-148ii, provided nothing in this section shall preclude a director from providing notice in another manner permitted by applicable law. If such order is not complied with within the time fixed by such director: (1) Such director, or any official of such town, city or borough authorized to institute actions on behalf of such town, city or borough, may institute and maintain a civil action for injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to require the abatement or remediation of such nuisance, the removal of such filth and the restraining and prohibiting of acts which caused such nuisance or filth, and such court shall have power to grant such injunctive relief upon notice and hearing; (2) (A) the owner or occupant of such property, or both, shall be subject to a civil penalty of two hundred fifty dollars per day for each day such nuisance is maintained or such filth is allowed to remain after the time fixed by the director in his order has expired, except that the owner or occupant of such property or any part thereof on which a public eating place is conducted shall not be subject to the provisions of this subdivision, but shall be subject to the provisions of subdivision (3) of this subsection, and (B) such civil penalty may be collected in a civil proceeding by the director of health or any official of such town, city or borough authorized to institute civil actions and shall be payable to the treasurer of such city, town or borough; and (3) the owner or occupant of such property, or both, shall be subject to the provisions of sections 19a-36, 19a-220 and 19a-230.\n\n(c) If the director institutes an action for injunctive relief seeking the abatement or remediation of a nuisance or the removal of filth, the maintenance of which is of so serious a nature as to constitute an immediate hazard to the health of persons other than the persons maintaining such nuisance or filth, he may, upon a verified complaint stating the facts which show such immediate hazard, apply for an ex parte injunction requiring the abatement or remediation of such nuisance or the removal of such filth and restraining and prohibiting the acts which caused such nuisance or filth to occur, and for a hearing on an order to show cause why such ex parte injunction should not be continued pending final determination on the merits of such action. If the court finds that an immediate hazard to the health of persons other than those persons maintaining such nuisance or source of filth exists, such ex parte injunction shall be issued, provided a hearing on its continuance pending final judgment is ordered held within seven days thereafter and provided further that any persons so enjoined may make a written request to the court or judge issuing such injunction for a hearing to vacate such injunction, in which event such hearing shall be held within three days after such request is filed.\n\n(d) In each town, except in a town having a city or borough within its limits, the town director of health shall have and exercise all the power for preserving the public health and preventing the spread of diseases; and, in any town within which there exists a city or borough, the limits of which are not coterminous with the limits of such town, such town director of health shall exercise the powers and duties of his office only in such part of such town as is outside the limits of such city or borough, except that when such city or borough has not appointed a director of health, the town director of health shall, for the purposes of this section, exercise the powers and duties of his office throughout the town, including such city or borough, until such city or borough appoints a director of health.\n\n(e) When such nuisance is abated or remediated or the source of filth is removed from private property, such abatement, remediation or removal shall be at the expense of the owner or, where applicable, the occupant of such property, or both, and damages and costs for such abatement, remediation or removal may be recovered against the owner or, where applicable, the occupant, or both, by the town, city or borough in a civil action as provided in subsection (b) of this section or in a separate civil action brought by the director of health or any official of such city, town or borough authorized to institute civil actions.\n\n(f) If the order of a district department of health, formed pursuant to section 19a-241, causes the displacement of any occupant of a residential dwelling unit, the municipality in which such dwelling unit is located shall be responsible for any relocation assistance afforded to such occupant pursuant to chapter 135.

Any person who desires treatment by prayer or spiritual means without the use of any drugs or material remedies, but through the use of the principles, tenets or teachings of any church incorporated under chapter 598, may be so treated during such person's isolation or quarantine in such place.\n\n(d) A person isolated or quarantined under this section shall have the right to a hearing in Probate Court and, if such person or such person's representative requests a hearing in writing, such hearing shall be held not later than seventy-two hours after receipt of such request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays. A request for a hearing shall not stay the order of isolation or quarantine issued by the director of health under this section. The hearing shall be held to determine if (1) the person ordered isolated or quarantined is infected with a communicable disease or is contaminated, (2) the person poses a substantial threat to the public health, and (3) isolation or quarantine of the person is necessary and the least restrictive alternative to protect and preserve the public health. The commissioner shall have the right to be made a party to the proceedings.\n\n(e) Jurisdiction shall be vested in the Probate Court for the district in which such person resides or is isolated or quarantined.\n\n(f) Notice of the hearing shall be given the respondent and shall inform the respondent that his or her representative has a right to be present at the hearing; that the respondent has a right to counsel; that the respondent, if indigent or otherwise unable to pay for or obtain counsel, has a right to have counsel appointed to represent the respondent; and that the respondent has a right to cross-examine witnesses testifying at the hearing. If the court finds such respondent is indigent or otherwise unable to pay for counsel, the court shall appoint counsel for such respondent, unless such respondent refuses counsel and the court finds that the respondent understands the nature of his or her refusal. The court shall provide such respondent a reasonable opportunity to select his or her own counsel to be appointed by the court. If the respondent does not select counsel or if counsel selected by the respondent refuses to represent such respondent or is not available for such representation, the court shall appoint counsel for the respondent from a panel of attorneys admitted to practice in this state provided by the Probate Court Administrator. The reasonable compensation of appointed counsel shall be established by and paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department, but, if funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such purposes, such compensation shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund.\n\n(g) Prior to such hearing, such respondent or respondent's counsel shall be afforded access to all records including, without limitation, hospital records if such respondent is hospitalized. If such respondent is hospitalized at the time of the hearing, the hospital shall make available at such hearing for use by the respondent or the respondent's counsel all records in its possession relating to the condition of the respondent. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent timely objection to the admissibility of evidence in accordance with the rules of civil procedure.\n\n(h) At such hearing, the director of health who ordered the isolation or quarantine of the respondent shall have the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent is infected with a communicable disease or is contaminated and poses a substantial threat to the public health and that isolation or quarantine of the respondent is necessary and the least restrictive alternative to protect and preserve the public health.\n\n(i) If the court, at such hearing, finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent is infected with a communicable disease or is contaminated and poses a substantial threat to the public health and that isolation or quarantine of the respondent is necessary and the least restrictive alternative to protect and preserve the public health, it shall order (1) the continued isolation or quarantine of the respondent under such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate until such time as it is determined that the respondent's release would not constitute a reasonable threat to the public health, or (2) the release of the respondent under such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate to protect the public health.\n\n(j) If the court, at such hearing, fails to find that the conditions required for an order for isolation or quarantine have been proven, it shall order the immediate release of the respondent.\n\n(k) A respondent may, at any time, move the court to terminate or modify an order made under subsection (i) of this section, in which case a hearing shall be held in accordance with this section. The court shall annually, upon its own motion, hold a hearing to determine if the conditions which required the isolation or quarantine of the respondent still exist. If the court, at a hearing held upon motion of the respondent or its own motion, fails to find that the conditions which required isolation or quarantine still exist, it shall order the immediate release of the respondent. If the court finds that such conditions still exist but that a different remedy is appropriate under this section, the court shall modify its order accordingly.\n\n(l) Any person aggrieved by an order of the Probate Court under this section may appeal to the Superior Court.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 3873; 1955, S. 2069d; P.A. 84-336, S. 1; P.A. 93-381, S. 9, 39; P.A. 95-257, S. 12, 21, 58; P.A. 03-236, S. 12; P.A. 15-217, S. 3, 4.)\n\nHistory: Sec. 19-94 transferred to Sec. 19a-221 in 1983; P.A. 84-336 substantially revised section including adding definitions of “communicable disease” and “respondent” and adding provisions re the procedure for the confinement of a person by a director of health, hearing procedures by a three-judge probate court, procedural rights of a respondent, standards for the court to order the continued confinement or release of the respondent, the review and termination or modification of a confinement order and the right to appeal to the superior court; P.A. 93-381 replaced commissioner of health services with commissioner of public health and addiction services, effective July 1, 1993; P.A. 95-257 replaced Commissioner and Department of Public Health and Addiction Services with Commissioner and Department of Public Health, effective July 1, 1995; P.A. 03-236 deleted former Subsec.
