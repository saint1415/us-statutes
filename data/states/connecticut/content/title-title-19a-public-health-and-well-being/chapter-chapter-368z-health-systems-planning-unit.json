Not later than thirty days after receipt of such notice, the transacting parties shall submit to the unit a written response. Such response shall include, but need not be limited to, any information or documents requested by the unit concerning the transfer of ownership of the hospital. The unit shall have the powers with respect to the cost and market impact review as provided in section 19a-633.\n\n(c) The unit shall keep confidential all nonpublic information and documents obtained pursuant to this section and shall not disclose the information or documents to any person without the consent of the person that produced the information or documents, except in a preliminary report or final report issued in accordance with this section if the unit believes that such disclosure should be made in the public interest after taking into account any privacy, trade secret or anti-competitive considerations. Such information and documents shall not be deemed a public record, under section 1-210, and shall be exempt from disclosure.\n\n(d) The cost and market impact review conducted pursuant to this section shall examine factors relating to the businesses and relative market positions of the transacting parties as defined in subsection (d) of section 19a-639 and may include, but need not be limited to: (1) The transacting parties' size and market share within its primary service area, by major service category and within its dispersed service areas; (2) the transacting parties' prices for services, including the transacting parties' relative prices compared to other health care providers for the same services in the same market; (3) the transacting parties' health status adjusted total medical expense, including the transacting parties' health status adjusted total medical expense compared to that of similar health care providers; (4) the quality of the services provided by the transacting parties, including patient experience; (5) the transacting parties' cost and cost trends in comparison to total health care expenditures state wide; (6) the availability and accessibility of services similar to those provided by each transacting party, or proposed to be provided as a result of the transfer of ownership of a hospital within each transacting party's primary service areas and dispersed service areas; (7) the impact of the proposed transfer of ownership of the hospital on competing options for the delivery of health care services within each transacting party's primary service area and dispersed service area including the impact on existing service providers; (8) the methods used by the transacting parties to attract patient volume and to recruit or acquire health care professionals or facilities; (9) the role of each transacting party in serving at-risk, underserved and government payer patient populations, including those with behavioral, substance use disorder and mental health conditions, within each transacting party's primary service area and dispersed service area; (10) the role of each transacting party in providing low margin or negative margin services within each transacting party's primary service area and dispersed service area; (11) consumer concerns, including, but not limited to, complaints or other allegations that a transacting party has engaged in any unfair method of competition or any unfair or deceptive act or practice; and (12) any other factors that the unit determines to be in the public interest.\n\n(e) Not later than ninety days after the unit determines that there is substantial compliance with any request for documents or information issued by the unit in accordance with this section, or a later date set by mutual agreement of the unit and the transacting parties, the unit shall make factual findings and issue a preliminary report on the cost and market impact review. Such preliminary report shall include, but shall not be limited to, an indication as to whether a transacting party meets the following criteria: (1) Currently has or, following the proposed transfer of operations of the hospital, is likely to have a dominant market share for the services the transacting party provides; and (2) (A) currently charges or, following the proposed transfer of operations of the hospital, is likely to charge prices for services that are materially higher than the median prices charged by all other health care providers for the same services in the same market, or (B) currently has or, following the proposed transfer of operations of a hospital, is likely to have a health status adjusted total medical expense that is materially higher than the median total medical expense for all other health care providers for the same service in the same market.\n\n(f) The transacting parties that are the subject of the cost and market impact review may respond in writing to the findings in the preliminary report issued in accordance with subsection (e) of this section not later than thirty days after the issuance of the preliminary report. Not later than sixty days after the issuance of the preliminary report, the unit shall issue a final report of the cost and market impact review. The unit shall refer to the Attorney General any final report on any proposed transfer of ownership that meets the criteria described in subsection (e) of this section.\n\n(g) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a transfer of ownership of a hospital, provided any such proposed transfer shall not be completed (1) less than thirty days after the unit has issued a final report on a cost and market impact review, if such review is required, or (2) while any action brought by the Attorney General pursuant to subsection (h) of this section is pending and before a final judgment on such action is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n(h) After the unit refers a final report on a transfer of ownership of a hospital to the Attorney General under subsection (f) of this section, the Attorney General may: (1) Conduct an investigation to determine whether the transacting parties engaged, or, as a result of completing the transfer of ownership of the hospital, are expected to engage in unfair methods of competition, anti-competitive behavior or other conduct in violation of chapter 624 or 735a or any other state or federal law; and (2) if appropriate, take action under chapter 624 or 735a or any other state law to protect consumers in the health care market. The unit's final report may be evidence in any such action.\n\n(i) For the purposes of this section, the provisions of chapter 735a may be directly enforced by the Attorney General. Nothing in this section shall be construed to modify, impair or supersede the operation of any state antitrust law or otherwise limit the authority of the Attorney General to (1) take any action against a transacting party as authorized by any law, or (2) protect consumers in the health care market under any law. Notwithstanding subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 42-110c, the transacting parties shall be subject to chapter 735a.\n\n(j) The unit shall retain an independent consultant with expertise on the economic analysis of the health care market and health care costs and prices to conduct each cost and market impact review, as described in this section. The unit shall submit bills for such services to the purchaser, as defined in subsection (d) of section 19a-639. Such purchaser shall pay such bills not later than thirty days after receipt. Such bills shall not exceed two hundred thousand dollars per application. The provisions of chapter 57, sections 4-212 to 4-219, inclusive, and section 4e-19 shall not apply to any agreement executed pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(k) Any employee of the unit who directly oversees or assists in conducting a cost and market impact review shall not take part in factual deliberations or the issuance of a preliminary or final decision on the certificate of need application concerning the transfer of ownership of a hospital that is the subject of such cost and market impact review.\n\n(l) The Commissioner of Health Strategy shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, concerning cost and market impact reviews and to administer the provisions of this section. Such regulations shall include definitions of the following terms: “Dispersed service area”, “health status adjusted total medical expense”, “major service category”, “relative prices”, “total health care spending” and “health care services”.
