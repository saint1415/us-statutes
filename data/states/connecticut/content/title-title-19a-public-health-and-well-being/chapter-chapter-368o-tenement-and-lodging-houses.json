Hallway on each floor was a “public hall” within section; Id.; also a stairway leading only to plaintiff's apartment; 117 C. 352. Outside steps were not a “public hall”; 121 C. 261; nor was an open cellar. 111 C. 26. Vacant rooms and testimony warranted finding that building was a “tenement house”. 117 C. 352. If the space falls within definition of a “yard” and is used in common by the tenants, it becomes an element in determining whether the building is a “tenement house”. Id., 353. Definitions indicate a legislative intent to impose obligation to keep building in repair as distinguished from separate apartments in it. Id., 627.
