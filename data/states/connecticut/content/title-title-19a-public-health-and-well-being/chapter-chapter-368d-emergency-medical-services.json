No person shall operate a commercial ambulance service or commercial rescue service without a license issued by the commissioner. A certificate shall be issued to any volunteer or municipal ambulance service or any ambulance service or paramedic intercept service that is operated and maintained by a state agency and that shows proof satisfactory to the commissioner that it meets the minimum standards of the commissioner in the areas of training, equipment and personnel. No license or certificate shall be issued to any volunteer, municipal or commercial ambulance service, paramedic intercept service or rescue service or any ambulance service or paramedic intercept service that is operated and maintained by a state agency, unless it meets the requirements of subsection (e) of section 14-100a. Applicants for a license shall use the forms prescribed by the commissioner and shall submit such application to the commissioner accompanied by an annual fee of two hundred dollars. In considering requests for approval of permits for new or expanded emergency medical services or the establishment of mobile integrated health care programs in any region, the commissioner shall consult with the Office of Emergency Medical Services and the emergency medical services council of such region and shall hold a public hearing to determine the necessity for such services. Written notice of such hearing shall be given to current emergency medical service organizations in the geographic region where such new or expanded services or mobile integrated health care programs would be implemented, provided, any volunteer ambulance service which elects not to levy charges for services rendered under this chapter shall be exempt from the provisions concerning requests for approval of permits for new or expanded emergency medical services set forth in this subsection. A primary service area responder that operates in the service area identified in the application shall, upon request, be granted intervenor status with opportunity for cross-examination. Each applicant for licensure shall furnish proof of financial responsibility which the commissioner deems sufficient to satisfy any claim. The commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to establish satisfactory kinds of coverage and limits of insurance for each applicant for either licensure or certification. Until such regulations are adopted, the following shall be the required limits for licensure: (1) For damages by reason of personal injury to, or the death of, one person on account of any accident, at least five hundred thousand dollars, and more than one person on account of any accident, at least one million dollars, (2) for damage to property at least fifty thousand dollars, and (3) for malpractice in the care of one passenger at least two hundred fifty thousand dollars, and for more than one passenger at least five hundred thousand dollars.

A certificate of such proof shall be filed with the commissioner. Upon determination by the commissioner that an applicant is financially responsible, properly certified and otherwise qualified to operate a commercial ambulance service, paramedic intercept service, rescue service or mobile integrated health care program, the commissioner shall issue the appropriate license effective for one year to such applicant or authorize the establishment of a mobile integrated health care program. If the commissioner determines that an applicant for either a certificate or license is not so qualified, the commissioner shall notify such applicant of the denial of the application with a statement of the reasons for such denial. Such applicant shall have thirty days to request a hearing on the denial of the application.\n\n(b) On or after January 1, 2020, within available appropriations, the commissioner may authorize an emergency medical services organization that furnishes evidence satisfactory to the commissioner that such organization has met the requirements of this section to establish a mobile integrated health care program under the provisions of such organization's current license or certification. Emergency medical services organizations requesting approval to establish such mobile integrated health care program shall use the forms prescribed by the commissioner and shall submit such application to the commissioner. No emergency medical services organization shall provide a mobile integrated health care program unless authorized by the commissioner to provide such program. The commissioner may implement policies and procedures to administer the mobile integrated health care programs established in accordance with this section. The commissioner shall post such policies and procedures to the department's Internet web site and the eRegulations System not later than twenty days after the date of implementation.\n\n(c) Any person or emergency medical service organization that does not maintain standards or violates regulations adopted under any section of this chapter applicable to such person or organization may have such person's or organization's license or certification suspended or revoked or may be subject to any other disciplinary action specified in section 19a-17 after notice by certified mail to such person or organization of the facts or conduct that warrant the intended action. Such person or emergency medical service organization shall have an opportunity to show compliance with all requirements for the retention of such certificate or license. In the conduct of any investigation by the commissioner of alleged violations of the standards or regulations adopted under the provisions of this chapter, the commissioner may issue subpoenas requiring the attendance of witnesses and the production by any medical service organization or person of reports, records, tapes or other documents that concern the allegations under investigation. All records obtained by the commissioner in connection with any such investigation shall not be subject to the provisions of section 1-210 for a period of six months from the date of the petition or other event initiating such investigation, or until such time as the investigation is terminated pursuant to a withdrawal or other informal disposition or until a hearing is convened pursuant to chapter 54, whichever is earlier. A complaint, as defined in subdivision (6) of section 19a-13, shall be subject to the provisions of section 1-210 from the time that it is served or mailed to the respondent. Records that are otherwise public records shall not be deemed confidential merely because they have been obtained in connection with an investigation under this chapter.\n\n(d) Any person or emergency medical service organization aggrieved by an act or decision of the commissioner regarding certification or licensure may appeal in the manner provided by chapter 54.\n\n(e) Any person who commits any of the following acts shall be guilty of a class C misdemeanor: (1) In any application to the commissioner or in any proceeding before or investigation made by the commissioner, knowingly making any false statement or representation, or, with knowledge of its falsity, filing or causing to be filed any false statement or representation in a required application or statement; (2) issuing, circulating or publishing or causing to be issued, circulated or published any form of advertisement or circular for the purpose of soliciting business which contains any statement that is false or misleading, or otherwise likely to deceive a reader thereof, with knowledge that it contains such false, misleading or deceptive statement; (3) giving or offering to give anything of value to any person for the purpose of promoting or securing ambulance, invalid coach, paramedic intercept vehicle or rescue service business or obtaining favors relating thereto; (4) administering or causing to be administered, while serving in the capacity of an employee of any licensed ambulance or rescue service, any alcoholic liquor to any patient in such employee's care, except under the supervision and direction of a licensed physician; (5) in any respect wilfully violating or failing to comply with any provision of this chapter or wilfully violating, failing, omitting or neglecting to obey or comply with any regulation, order, decision or license, or any part or provisions thereof; or (6) with one or more other persons, conspiring to violate any license or order issued by the commissioner or any provision of this chapter.\n\n(f) No person shall place any advertisement or produce any printed matter that holds that person out to be an ambulance service or a mobile integrated health care program provider unless such person is licensed, certified or authorized pursuant to this section. Any such advertisement or printed matter shall include the license or certificate number issued by the commissioner.\n\n(g) Each licensed or certified emergency medical service organization shall: (1) Ensure that its emergency medical personnel, whether such personnel are employees or contracted through an employment agency or personnel pool, are appropriately licensed or certified by the Department of Public Health to perform their job duties and that such licenses or certifications remain valid; (2) ensure that any employment agency or personnel pool, from which the emergency medical service organization obtains personnel meets the required general liability and professional liability insurance limits described in subsection (a) of this section and that all persons performing work or volunteering for the medical service organization are covered by such insurance; and (3) secure and maintain medical oversight, as defined in section 19a-175, by a sponsor hospital, as defined in section 19a-175.\n\n(h) Each applicant whose request for new or expanded emergency medical services or the establishment of a mobile integrated health care program is approved shall, not later than six months after the date of such approval, acquire the necessary resources, equipment and other material necessary to comply with the terms of the approval and operate in the service area identified in the application. If the applicant fails to do so, the approval for new or expanded medical services or the establishment of a mobile integrated health care program shall be void and the commissioner shall rescind the approval.\n\n(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, any emergency medical services organization that is licensed or certified and is a primary service area responder may apply to the commissioner to add one emergency vehicle to its existing fleet every three years, on a short form application prescribed by the commissioner. No such emergency medical services organization operated and maintained by a state agency may add more than one emergency vehicle to its existing fleet pursuant to this subsection regardless of the number of municipalities served by such volunteer, hospital-based or municipal ambulance service. Upon making such application, the applicant shall notify in writing all other primary service area responders in any municipality or abutting municipality in which the applicant proposes to add the additional emergency vehicle. Except in the case where a primary service area responder entitled to receive notification of such application objects, in writing, to the commissioner not later than fifteen calendar days after receiving such notice, the application shall be deemed approved thirty calendar days after filing. If any such primary service area responder files an objection with the commissioner within the fifteen-calendar-day time period and requests a hearing, the applicant shall be required to demonstrate need at a public hearing as required under subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(j) The commissioner shall develop a short form application for primary service area responders seeking to add an emergency vehicle to their existing fleets pursuant to subsection (i) of this section. The application shall require an applicant to provide such information as the commissioner deems necessary, including, but not limited to, (1) the applicant's name and address, (2) the primary service area where the additional vehicle is proposed to be used, (3) an explanation as to why the additional vehicle is necessary and its proposed use, (4) proof of insurance, (5) a list of the emergency medical service organizations to whom notice was sent pursuant to subsection (i) of this section and proof of such notification, and (6) total call volume, response time and calls passed within the primary service area for the one-year period preceding the date of the application.\n\n(k) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, any emergency medical services organization that is licensed or certified and a primary service area responder may apply to the commissioner, on a short form application prescribed by the commissioner, to change the address of a principal or branch location or to add a branch location within its primary service area. Upon making such application, the applicant shall notify in writing all other primary service area responders in any municipality or abutting municipality in which the applicant proposes to change principal or branch locations.

A petition may be made (1) at any time if based on an allegation that a performance crisis exists and that the safety, health and welfare of the citizens of the affected primary service area are jeopardized by the responder's performance, or (2) not more often than once every three years, if based on the unsatisfactory performance of the responder. A responder for whom a municipality seeks removal pursuant to a petition under this section shall not transfer its responsibilities to another responder while the petition is pending. A hearing on a petition under this section shall be deemed to be a contested case and held in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54.\n\n(c) If, after a hearing authorized by this section, the commissioner determines that (1) a performance crisis exists and the safety, health and welfare of the citizens of the affected primary service area are jeopardized by the responder's performance, (2) the responder has demonstrated unsatisfactory performance, or (3) it is in the best interests of patient care, the commissioner may revoke the primary service area responder's primary service area assignment and require the chief administrative official of the municipality in which the primary service area is located to submit a plan acceptable to the commissioner for the alternative provision of primary service area responder responsibilities, or may issue an order for the alternative provision of emergency medical services, or both.\n\n(d) The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall open any petition for the removal of a responder (1) not later than five business days after receipt of a petition where a performance crisis is alleged and shall conclude the investigation on such petition not later than thirty days after receipt of such petition, or (2) not later than fifteen business days after receipt of a petition where unsatisfactory performance is alleged and shall conclude the investigation on such petition not later than ninety days after receipt of such petition.
