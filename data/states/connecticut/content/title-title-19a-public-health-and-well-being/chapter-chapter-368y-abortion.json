The person shall keep a copy for such minor's medical record and shall give the form to the minor or, if the minor requests and if such person is not the attending physician, transmit the form to the minor's attending physician. Such medical record shall be maintained as otherwise provided by law.\n\n(d) The provision of pregnancy information and counseling by a physician or counselor which is evidenced in writing containing the information and statements provided in this section and which is signed by the minor shall be presumed to be evidence of compliance with the requirements of this section.\n\n(e) The requirements of this section shall not apply when, in the best medical judgment of the physician based on the facts of the case before him, a medical emergency exists that so complicates the pregnancy or the health, safety or well-being of the minor as to require an immediate abortion. A physician who does not comply with the requirements of this section by reason of this exception shall state in the medical record of the abortion the medical indications on which his judgment was based.\n\n(P.A. 90-113, S. 2.)\n\nCited. 24 CA 541.",
