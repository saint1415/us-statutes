Not less than fifty per cent of the committee membership shall be composed of nonmanagement employees. The committee shall select a chairperson from among its membership. The committee shall meet not less than quarterly and shall make available meeting minutes and other records from its proceedings to all employees.\n\n(c) On or before October 1, 2011, and annually thereafter, each health care employer shall undertake a risk assessment of the factors that put any health care employee at risk for being a victim of workplace violence. Based on the findings of the risk assessment, on or before January 1, 2012, and on or before each January first thereafter, each health care employer, in collaboration with the workplace safety committee, shall develop and implement a written workplace violence prevention and response plan. A hospital, as defined in section 19a-490, may utilize an existing committee established by such hospital to assist in the preparation of the plan, provided not less than fifty per cent of the membership of such existing committee are nonmanagement employees.

When adjusting patient care assignments, a health care employer shall give due consideration to the employer's obligation to meet the needs of all patients. Patient behavior that is a direct manifestation of the patient's condition or disability, including physical abuse or threatening behavior, shall not be considered intentional physical abuse or threatening of an employee. In situations where a health care employer has determined that an adjustment to a health care employee's patient care assignment is not practicable, any health care employee who has been physically abused or threatened by a patient may request of the employer that a second health care employee be present when treating such patient.\n\n(f) The Labor Commissioner may adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.\n\n(P.A. 11-175, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 11-175 effective July 1, 2011.",

      "text": "(a) For purposes of this section “home health care agency” and “hospice agency” have the same meanings as provided in section 19a-490. Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 378, a registered nurse may delegate the administration of medications that are not administered by injection to home health aides and hospice aides who have obtained (1) certification and recertification every two years thereafter for medication administration in accordance with regulations adopted pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, or (2) a current certification from the Department of Children and Families or the Department of Developmental Services in accordance with section 19a-495a, unless the prescribing practitioner specifies that a medication shall only be administered by a licensed nurse.\n\n(b) (1) The Commissioner of Public Health shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to carry out the provisions of this section. Such regulations shall require each home health care agency or hospice agency that serves clients requiring assistance with medication administration to (A) adopt practices that increase and encourage client choice, dignity and independence; (B) establish policies and procedures to ensure that a registered nurse may delegate allowed tasks of nursing care, to include medication administration, to home health aides or hospice aides when the registered nurse determines that it is in the best interest of the client and the home health aide or hospice aide has been deemed competent to perform the task; (C) designate home health aides and hospice aides to obtain certification and recertification for the administration of medication; and (D) ensure that such home health aides receive such certification and recertification.\n\n(2) The regulations shall establish certification and recertification requirements for medication administration and the criteria to be used by home health care agencies and hospice agencies that provide services for clients requiring assistance with medication administration in determining (A) which home health aides and hospice aides shall obtain such certification and recertification, and (B) education and skill training requirements, including ongoing training requirements for such certification and recertification.\n\n(3) Education and skill training requirements for initial certification and recertification shall include, but not be limited to, initial orientation, training in client rights and identification of the types of medication that may be administered by unlicensed personnel, behavioral management, personal care, nutrition and food safety, and health and safety in general.\n\n(c) Each home health care agency and, on or before January 1, 2022, each hospice agency shall ensure that, on or before January 1, 2013, delegation of nursing care tasks in the home care setting is allowed within such agency and that policies are adopted to employ home health aides or hospice aides for the purposes of allowing nurses to delegate such tasks.\n\n(d) A registered nurse licensed pursuant to the provisions of chapter 378 who delegates the task of medication administration to a home health aide or hospice aide pursuant to this section shall not be subject to disciplinary action based on the performance of the home health aide or hospice aide to whom tasks are delegated, unless the home health aide or hospice aide is acting pursuant to specific instructions from the registered nurse or the registered nurse fails to leave instructions when the nurse should have done so, provided the registered nurse: (1) Documented in the patient's care plan that the medication administration could be properly and safely performed by the home health aide or hospice aide to whom it is delegated, (2) provided initial direction to the home health aide or hospice aide, and (3) provided ongoing supervision of the home health aide or hospice aide, including the periodic assessment and evaluation of the patient's health and safety related to medication administration.\n\n(e) A registered nurse who delegates the provision of nursing care to another person pursuant to this section shall not be subject to an action for civil damages for the performance of the person to whom nursing care is delegated unless the person is acting pursuant to specific instructions from the nurse or the nurse fails to leave instructions when the nurse should have done so.\n\n(f) No person may coerce a registered nurse into compromising patient safety by requiring the nurse to delegate the administration of medication if the nurse's assessment of the patient documents a need for a nurse to administer medication and identifies why the need cannot be safely met through utilization of assistive technology or administration of medication by certified home health aides or hospice aides. No registered nurse who has made a reasonable determination based on such assessment that delegation may compromise patient safety shall be subject to any employer reprisal or disciplinary action pursuant to chapter 378 for refusing to delegate or refusing to provide the required training for such delegation. The Department of Social Services, in consultation with the Department of Public Health, home health care agencies and hospice agencies, shall develop protocols for documentation pursuant to the requirements of this subsection. The Department of Social Services shall notify all licensed home health care agencies and hospice agencies of such protocols prior to the implementation of this section.\n\n(g) The Commissioner of Public Health may implement policies and procedures necessary to administer the provisions of this section while in the process of adopting such policies and procedures as regulations, provided notice of intent to adopt regulations is published in the Connecticut Law Journal not later than twenty days after the date of implementation.

      "text": "(a) For purposes of this section and section 19a-504e:\n\n(1) “Caregiver” means any individual who a patient designates as a caregiver to provide post-discharge assistance to the patient in the patient's home in the community. The term “caregiver” includes, but is not limited to, a relative, spouse, partner, friend or neighbor who has a significant relationship with the patient. For the purposes of this section and section 19a-504e, the term caregiver shall not include any individual who receives compensation for providing post-discharge assistance to the patient.\n\n(2) “Home” means the dwelling that the patient considers to be the patient's home in the community. The term “home” shall not include, and the provisions of this section and section 19a-504e shall not apply to, a discharge to any rehabilitation facility, hospital, nursing home, assisted living facility, group home or any other setting that was not the patient's home in the community immediately preceding the patient's inpatient admission.\n\n(3) “Hospital” has the same meaning as provided in section 19a-490.\n\n(4) “Post-discharge assistance” means nonprofessional care provided by a designated caregiver to a patient following the patient's discharge from an inpatient admission to a hospital in accordance with the written discharge plan of care signed by the patient or the patient's representative, including, but not limited to, assisting with basic activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living and carrying out support tasks, such as assisting with wound care, administration of medications and use of medical equipment.\n\n(b) The Department of Public Health shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to set minimum standards for hospital discharge planning services. Such standards shall include, but need not be limited to, requirements for (1) a written discharge plan prepared in consultation with the patient, or the patient's family or representative, and the patient's physician, including, but not limited to, the date and location of each follow-up medical appointment scheduled prior to the patient's discharge and, to the extent known to the hospital, a list of all medications the patient is currently taking and will continue to take after the patient's discharge, and (2) a procedure for advance notice to the patient of the patient's discharge and provision of a copy of the discharge plan to the patient prior to discharge.\n\n(c) Whenever a hospital refers a patient's name to a nursing home as part of the hospital's discharge planning process, or when a hospital patient requests such a referral, the hospital shall make a copy of the patient's hospital record available to the nursing home and shall allow the nursing home access to the patient for purposes of care planning and consultation.\n\n(d) Whenever a hospital's discharge planning indicates that an inpatient will be discharged to the patient's home, the hospital shall (1) allow the patient to designate a caregiver at, or prior to, the time that a written copy of the discharge plan is provided to the patient, and (2) transmit in an electronic manner to the patient's pharmacy each prescription ordered by a hospital employee for the patient prior to discharge that the patient will need after discharge. A patient is not required to designate any individual as a caregiver and any individual designated as a caregiver under this section is not obligated to perform any post-discharge assistance for the patient.\n\n(e) If an inpatient designates a caregiver pursuant to subsection (d) of this section prior to receiving written discharge instructions, the hospital shall:\n\n(1) Record the patient's designation of caregiver, the relationship of the designated caregiver to the patient, and the name, telephone number and address of the patient's designated caregiver in the discharge plan.\n\n(2) Make reasonable attempts to notify the patient's designated caregiver of the patient's discharge to the patient's home as soon as practicable. In the event the hospital is unable to contact the designated caregiver, the lack of contact shall not interfere with, delay, or otherwise affect the medical care provided to the patient or an appropriate discharge of the patient.\n\n(3) Prior to discharge, provide caregivers with instructions in all post-discharge assistance tasks described in the discharge plan. Training and instructions for caregivers may be conducted in person or through video technology, as determined by the hospital to effectively provide the necessary instruction. Any training or instructions provided to a caregiver shall be provided in nontechnical language, to the extent possible. At a minimum, this instruction shall include: (A) A live or recorded demonstration of the tasks performed by an individual designated by the hospital who is authorized to perform the post-discharge assistance task and is able to perform the demonstration in a culturally competent manner and in accordance with the hospital's requirements to provide language access services under state and federal law; (B) an opportunity for the caregiver to ask questions about the post-discharge assistance tasks; and (C) answers to the caregiver's questions provided in a culturally competent manner and in accordance with the hospital's requirements to provide language access services under state and federal law.\n\n(4) Document in the patient's medical record any training for initial implementation of the discharge plan provided to the patient, the patient's representative or the designated caregiver. Any instruction required under subdivision (3) of this subsection shall be documented in the patient's medical record, including, at a minimum, the date, time and contents of the instruction.\n\n(f) If the patient agrees, the written discharge materials referenced in this section may include electronic-only versions, and acknowledgment of any such written discharge materials may be documented through electronic means.\n\n(P.A. 88-335, S. 2, 5; P.A. 93-381, S. 9, 39; P.A. 95-257, S. 12, 21, 58; P.A. 11-236, S. 4; P.A. 15-32, S. 1; P.A. 21-26, S. 10; P.A. 23-39, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 93-381 replaced department of health services with department of public health and addiction services, effective July 1, 1993; P.A. 95-257 replaced Commissioner and Department of Public Health and Addiction Services with Commissioner and Department of Public Health, effective July 1, 1995; P.A. 11-236 added provision requiring hospital referring a patient to a nursing home to make the patient's hospital record available and to allow the nursing home access to the patient, and made technical changes, effective July 13, 2011; P.A. 15-32 added Subsec.

Except as otherwise provided by law, all applicants for admission to such facility shall be admitted in the order in which such applicants apply for admission as evidenced by the nursing home's acceptance of a substantially completed application for admission. Each nursing home shall (A) provide a receipt to each applicant who substantially completes an application for admission to its facility who requests placement on a waiting list stating the date and time of such substantial completion and acceptance of the application by the nursing home, and (B) maintain a dated list of such applications which shall be available at all times to any applicant, the applicant's bona fide representative, authorized personnel from the Departments of Public Health and Social Services and such other state agencies or other bodies established by state statute whose statutory duties necessitate access to such lists. A nursing home may maintain such waiting list in electronic form. On and after July 1, 2025, a nursing home shall maintain such waiting list in electronic form;\n\n(2) Shall provide applications for admission to prospective residents by mail, electronic transmission or Internet web site posting;\n\n(3) Shall develop and implement policies and procedures related to the waiting list that address (A) what information is required for such application to be considered substantially completed and accepted by the nursing home, (B) what steps the nursing home will take to protect the privacy of information submitted by a prospective resident, and (C) a description of how the integrity of information in the electronic waiting list will be maintained, including steps taken to ensure accuracy in recording of the (i) date and time a prospective resident is placed on the waiting list, and (ii) any dated notification made pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. A nursing home shall not be required to maintain a list of inquiries from prospective residents who have not yet submitted a substantially completed application for admission accepted by the nursing home, nor to provide any such person with a receipt of their inquiry;\n\n(4) May, no sooner than ninety days after initial placement of the person's name on the waiting list, inquire by letter or electronic mail of such applicant and any one person if designated by such applicant whether the applicant desires continuation of the applicant's name on the waiting list. If the applicant does not respond and an additional thirty days pass, the nursing home may remove such applicant's name from its waiting list. A nursing home may annually send a waiting list placement continuation communication by letter or electronic mail to all persons on the waiting list for at least ninety days to inquire as to whether such person desires continuation of the person's name on the waiting list, provided such communication shall also be sent to any one person if designated by such applicant. If such person does not respond and at least thirty days pass, the facility may remove the person's name from its waiting list. Indigent persons shall be placed on any waiting list for admission to a facility and shall be admitted to the facility as vacancies become available, in the same manner as self-pay applicants, except as provided in subsections (f) and (g) of this section;\n\n(5) Shall post in a conspicuous place a notice informing applicants for admission that the facility is prohibited by statute from discriminating against indigent applicants for admission on the basis of source of payment. Such notice shall advise applicants for admission of the remedies available under this section and shall list the name, address and telephone number of the ombudsman who serves the region in which the facility is located;\n\n(6) Shall be prohibited from requiring that an indigent person pay any sum of money or furnish any other consideration, including but not limited to, the furnishing of an agreement by the relative, conservator or other responsible party of an indigent person which obligates such party to pay for care rendered to an indigent person as a condition for admission of such indigent person; and\n\n(7) Shall maintain an electronic record of the number of patients who are Medicare, Medicaid and private pay patients and make such information available, upon request, to the state or regional ombudsman.\n\n(c) Whenever a nursing home passes over the name of an applicant on its waiting list and admits another applicant, the nursing home shall make a dated notation on the waiting list indicating why the applicant who was passed over was not admitted. Upon the receipt of a complaint concerning a violation of this section, the Department of Social Services shall conduct an investigation into such complaint. A nursing home shall provide access to the department and the State Ombudsman to all records requested by the department or State Ombudsman for the purpose of investigating a complaint by or on behalf of an applicant related to the denial of an admission.\n\n(d) The Department of Social Services is authorized to decrease the daily reimbursement rate to a nursing home for one year for a violation of this section which occurred during the twelve-month period covered by the cost report upon which the per diem rate is calculated. The per diem rate shall be reduced by one-quarter of one per cent for an initial violation of this section and one per cent for each additional violation.\n\n(e) Prior to imposing any sanction, the Department of Social Services shall notify the nursing home of the alleged violation and the accompanying sanction, and shall permit such facility to request an administrative hearing, in accordance with sections 4-176e to 4-181a, inclusive. A facility shall request such hearing within fifteen days of receipt of the notice of violation from the Department of Social Services. The department shall stay the imposition of any sanction pending the outcome of the administrative hearing.\n\n(f) A nursing home with a number of self-pay residents equal to or less than thirty per cent of its total number of residents shall not be required to admit an indigent person on a waiting list for admission when a vacancy becomes available during the subsequent six months, provided (1) no bed may be held open for more than thirty days, and (2) the nursing home notifies the Commissioner of Social Services and the regional nursing home ombudsman office on the date on which such six-month period of waiting list exemption began and thereafter on a quarterly basis if the conditions for exemption still apply.\n\n(g) A nursing home shall not be required to admit an indigent person on a waiting list for admission when a vacancy becomes available if the vacancy is in a private room.\n\n(h) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a nursing home shall, without regard to the order of its waiting list, admit an applicant who (1) seeks to transfer from a nursing home that is closing, or (2) seeks to transfer from a nursing home in which the applicant was placed following the closure of the nursing home where such applicant previously resided or, in the case of a nursing home placed in receivership, the anticipated closure of the nursing home where such applicant previously resided, provided (A) the transfer occurs not later than sixty days following the date that such applicant was transferred from the nursing home where he or she previously resided, and (B) except when the nursing home that is closing transferred the resident due to an emergency, the applicant submitted an application to the nursing home to which he or she seeks admission at the time of the applicant's transfer from the nursing home where he or she previously resided. A nursing home that qualifies for a waiting list exemption pursuant to subsection (f) or (g) of this section shall not be required to admit an indigent person under this subsection except when the resident is being transferred from a nursing home that is closing due to an emergency. No nursing home shall be required to admit an applicant pursuant to the provisions of this subsection if the nursing home has determined that (i) the applicant does not have a payor source because the applicant has been denied Medicaid eligibility or the applicant has failed to pay a nursing home that is closing for the three months preceding the date of the application for admittance and has no pending application for Medicaid, (ii) the applicant is subject to a Medicaid penalty period, or (iii) the applicant does not require nursing home level of care as determined in accordance with applicable state and federal requirements.\n\n(P.A. 80-364, S. 1–3; P.A. 84-245; P.A. 88-317, S. 83, 107; June Sp.

      "text": "(a) For the purposes of this section: (1) “Facility” means an entity certified as a nursing facility under the Medicaid program or an entity certified as a skilled nursing facility under the Medicare program or with respect to facilities that do not participate in the Medicaid or Medicare programs, a chronic and convalescent nursing home or a rest home with nursing supervision as defined in section 19a-521; (2) “continuing care facility which guarantees life care for its residents” has the same meaning as provided in section 17b-354; (3) “transfer” means the movement of a resident from one facility to another facility or institution, including, but not limited to, a hospital emergency department, if the resident is admitted to the facility or institution or is under the care of the facility or institution for more than twenty-four hours; (4) “discharge” means the movement of a resident from a facility to a noninstitutional setting; (5) “self-pay resident” means a resident who is not receiving state or municipal assistance to pay for the cost of care at a facility, but shall not include a resident who has filed an application with the Department of Social Services for Medicaid coverage for facility care but has not received an eligibility determination from the department on such application, provided the resident has timely responded to requests by the department for information that is necessary to make such determination; and (6) “emergency” means a situation in which a failure to effect an immediate transfer or discharge of the resident that would endanger the health, safety or welfare of the resident or other residents.\n\n(b) A facility shall not transfer or discharge a resident from the facility except to meet the welfare of the resident which cannot be met in the facility, or unless the resident no longer needs the services of the facility due to improved health, the facility is required to transfer the resident pursuant to section 17b-359 or 17b-360, or the health or safety of individuals in the facility is endangered, or in the case of a self-pay resident, for the resident's nonpayment or arrearage of more than fifteen days of the per diem facility room rate, or the facility ceases to operate. In each case the basis for transfer or discharge shall be documented in the resident's medical record by a physician, a physician assistant or an advanced practice registered nurse. In each case where the welfare, health or safety of the resident is concerned the documentation shall be by the resident's physician, physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse. A facility that is part of a continuing care facility which guarantees life care for its residents may transfer or discharge (1) a self-pay resident who is a member of the continuing care community and who has intentionally transferred assets in a sum that will render the resident unable to pay the costs of facility care in accordance with the contract between the resident and the facility, or (2) a self-pay resident who is not a member of the continuing care community and who has intentionally transferred assets in a sum that will render the resident unable to pay the costs of a total of forty-two months of facility care from the date of initial admission to the facility.\n\n(c) (1) Before effecting any transfer or discharge of a resident from the facility, the facility shall notify, in writing, the resident and the resident's guardian or conservator, if any, or legally liable relative or other responsible party if known, of the proposed transfer or discharge, the reasons therefor, the effective date of the proposed transfer or discharge, the location to which the resident is to be transferred or discharged, the right to appeal the proposed transfer or discharge and the procedures for initiating such an appeal as determined by the Department of Social Services, the date by which an appeal must be initiated in order to preserve the resident's right to an appeal hearing and the date by which an appeal must be initiated in order to stay the proposed transfer or discharge and the possibility of an exception to the date by which an appeal must be initiated in order to stay the proposed transfer or discharge for good cause, that the resident may represent himself or herself or be represented by legal counsel, a relative, a friend or other spokesperson, an affirmation by the facility that notice of the proposed transfer or discharge has been provided to the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman, in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (3) of this subsection, and information as to bed hold and nursing home readmission policy when required in accordance with section 19a-537. The notice shall also include the name, mailing address and telephone number of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman. If the resident is, or the facility alleges a resident is, mentally ill or developmentally disabled, the notice shall include the name, mailing address and telephone number of the nonprofit entity designated by the Governor in accordance with section 46a-10b to serve as the Connecticut protection and advocacy system. The notice shall be given at least thirty days and no more than sixty days prior to the resident's proposed transfer or discharge, except where the health or safety of individuals in the facility are endangered, or where the resident's health improves sufficiently to allow a more immediate transfer or discharge, or where immediate transfer or discharge is necessitated by urgent medical needs or where a resident has not resided in the facility for thirty days, in which cases notice shall be given as many days before the transfer or discharge as practicable.\n\n(2) The resident may initiate an appeal pursuant to this section by submitting a written request to the Commissioner of Social Services not later than sixty calendar days after the facility issues the notice of the proposed transfer or discharge, except as provided in subsection (h) of this section. In order to stay a proposed transfer or discharge, the resident must initiate an appeal not later than twenty days after the date the resident receives the notice of the proposed transfer or discharge from the facility unless the resident demonstrates good cause for failing to initiate such appeal within the twenty-day period.\n\n(3) On the date that the facility provides notice of a proposed involuntary transfer or discharge of a resident pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the facility shall notify the State Ombudsman, appointed pursuant to section 17a-870, in a manner prescribed by the State Ombudsman, of such proposed involuntary transfer or discharge. Failure to provide notice to the State Ombudsman pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision shall invalidate any notice of the proposed involuntary transfer or discharge of a resident submitted pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection.\n\n(d) No resident shall be transferred or discharged from any facility as a result of a change in the resident's status from self-pay or Medicare to Medicaid provided the facility offers services to both categories of residents. Any such resident who wishes to be transferred to another facility that has agreed to accept the resident may do so upon giving at least fifteen days written notice to the administrator of the facility from which the resident is to be transferred and a copy thereof to the appropriate advocate of such resident. The resident's advocate may help the resident complete all administrative procedures relating to a transfer.\n\n(e) Except in an emergency or in the case of transfer to a hospital, no resident shall be transferred or discharged from a facility unless a discharge plan has been developed by the personal physician, physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse of the resident or the medical director in conjunction with the nursing director, social worker or other health care provider. To minimize the disruptive effects of the transfer or discharge on the resident, the person responsible for developing the plan shall consider the feasibility of placement near the resident's relatives, the acceptability of the placement to the resident and the resident's guardian or conservator, if any, or the resident's legally liable relative or other responsible party, if known, and any other relevant factors that affect the resident's adjustment to the move. The plan shall contain a written evaluation of the effects of the transfer or discharge on the resident and a statement of the action taken to minimize such effects. In addition, the plan shall outline the care and kinds of services that the resident shall receive upon transfer or discharge. Not less than thirty days prior to an involuntary transfer or discharge, a copy of the discharge plan shall be provided to the resident's personal physician, physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse if the discharge plan was prepared by the medical director, to the resident and the resident's guardian or conservator, if any, or legally liable relative or other responsible party, if known.\n\n(f) No resident shall be involuntarily transferred or discharged from a facility if such transfer or discharge is medically contraindicated.\n\n(g) The facility shall be responsible for assisting the resident in finding appropriate placement.\n\n(h) (1) Except in the case of an emergency, as provided in subdivision (4) of this subsection, upon receipt of a request for a hearing to appeal any proposed transfer or discharge, the Commissioner of Social Services or the commissioner's designee shall hold a hearing to determine whether the transfer or discharge is being effected in accordance with this section. A hearing shall be convened not less than ten, but not more than thirty days from the date of receipt of such request and a written decision made by the commissioner or the commissioner's designee not later than thirty days after the date of termination of the hearing or not later than sixty days after the date of the hearing request, whichever occurs sooner. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 54. In each case the facility shall prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it has complied with the provisions of this section. Except in the case of an emergency or in circumstances when the resident is not physically present in the facility, whenever the Commissioner of Social Services receives a request for a hearing in response to a notice of proposed transfer or discharge and such notice does not meet the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, the commissioner shall, not later than ten business days after the date of receipt of such notice from the resident or the facility, order the transfer or discharge stayed and return such notice to the facility.

The facility shall have an opportunity to examine during regular business hours at least three business days prior to such a hearing, all documents and records to be used by the resident at the hearing.\n\n(3) If a hearing conducted pursuant to this section involves medical issues, the commissioner or the commissioner's designee may order an independent medical assessment of the resident at the expense of the Department of Social Services that shall be made part of the hearing record.\n\n(4) In an emergency the notice required pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall be provided as soon as practicable.

No facility shall require or request a resident who is a recipient of medical assistance to provide payment for such authorized home leave days, whether or not such payment is available from the department.\n\n(e) If a resident's hospitalization exceeds the period of time that a nursing home is required to reserve the resident's bed or the nursing home is not required to reserve the resident's bed under this section, the nursing home:\n\n(1) Shall, upon receipt of notification from the hospital that a resident is medically ready for discharge, provide the resident with the first bed available in a semiprivate room or a private room, if a private room is medically necessary;\n\n(2) Shall grant the resident priority of admission over applicants for first admission to the nursing home;\n\n(3) May charge a fee to reserve the bed, not exceeding the facility's self-pay rate for the unit in which that resident resided, or not exceeding the per diem Medicaid rate for recipients of medical assistance, whichever charge is applicable, for the number of days which the resident is absent from the facility.\n\n(f) When the Commissioner of Social Services, or the commissioner's designee, makes a finding that a resident has been refused readmission to a nursing home in violation of this section, the resident shall retain the right to be readmitted to the transferring nursing home pursuant to subsection (e) of this section regardless of whether or not the resident has accepted placement in another nursing home while awaiting the availability of a bed in the facility from which the resident was transferred.\n\n(g) Whenever a nursing home has concerns about the readmission of a resident, as required by subsection (e) of this section, based on whether the nursing home has the ability to meet the resident's care needs or the resident presents a danger to himself or herself or to other persons, not later than twenty-four hours after receipt of notification from a hospital that a resident is medically ready for discharge, a nursing home shall request a consultation with the hospital and the resident or the resident's representative. The purpose of the consultation shall be to develop an appropriate care plan to safely meet the resident's nursing home care needs, including a determination of the date for readmission that best meets such needs. The resident's wishes and the hospital's recommendations shall be considered as part of the consultation process. The nursing home shall reserve the resident's bed until completion of the consultation process. The consultation process shall begin as soon as practicable and shall be completed not later than three business days after the date of the nursing home's request for a consultation. The hospital shall participate in the consultation, grant the nursing home access to the resident in the hospital and permit the nursing home to review the resident's hospital records.\n\n(h) A nursing home shall not refuse to readmit a resident unless: (1) The resident's needs cannot be met in the facility; (2) the resident no longer needs the services of the nursing home due to improved health; or (3) the health and safety of individuals in the nursing home would be endangered by readmission of the resident. If a nursing home decides to refuse to readmit a resident either without requesting a consultation or following a consultation conducted in accordance with subsection (g) of this section, the nursing home shall, not later than twenty-four hours after making such decision, notify the hospital, the resident and the resident's guardian or conservator, if any, the resident's legally liable relative or other responsible party, if known, in writing of the following: (A) The determination to refuse to readmit the resident; (B) the reasons for the refusal to readmit the resident; (C) the resident's right to appeal the decision to refuse to readmit the resident; (D) the procedures for initiating such an appeal, as determined by the Commissioner of Social Services; (E) the resident has twenty days from the date of receipt of the notice from the facility to initiate an appeal; (F) the possibility of an extension of the time frame for initiating an appeal for good cause; (G) the contact information, including the name, mailing address and telephone number, for the Long-Term Care Ombudsman; and (H) the resident's right to represent himself or herself at the appeal hearing or to be represented by legal counsel, a relative, a friend or other spokesperson. If a resident is, or the nursing home alleges a resident is, mentally ill or developmentally disabled, the nursing home shall include in the notice to the resident the contact information, including the name, mailing address and telephone number of the nonprofit entity designated by the Governor in accordance with section 46a-10b, to serve as the Connecticut protection and advocacy system. The Commissioner of Social Services, or the commissioner's designee, shall hold a hearing in accordance with chapter 54 to determine whether the nursing home has violated the provisions of this section. The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall convene such hearing not later than fifteen days after the date of receipt of the request. The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall issue a decision not later than thirty days after the date on which the hearing record is closed. The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, may require the nursing home to readmit the resident to a semiprivate room or a private room, if a private room is medically necessary. The Superior Court shall consider an appeal from a decision of the commissioner pursuant to this section as a privileged case in order to dispose of the case with the least possible delay.\n\n(i) If, following a consultation convened pursuant to subsection (g) of this section, a nursing home does not readmit a resident, the resident may file a complaint with the Commissioner of Social Services pursuant to section 19a-537a. If the resident has requested a hearing pursuant to subsection (h) of this section, the commissioner shall stay an investigation of such complaint until the issuance of a determination following the hearing. Each day a nursing home fails to readmit a resident in violation of this section may be considered a separate violation for the purpose of determining a penalty pursuant to section 19a-537a, except no penalty shall accrue during the period of time beginning with the date a consultation is requested until the date a hearing decision is issued, if a hearing is requested, provided the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, finds the nursing home has acted in good faith in refusing to readmit the resident. If the resident does not request a hearing and the resident files a complaint with the commissioner pursuant to section 19a-537a, no penalty shall accrue during the time an investigation is conducted, provided the commissioner finds the facility acted in good faith in refusing to readmit the resident.\n\n(P.A. 80-170, S. 1, 2; P.A. 83-348, S. 1, 3; P.A. 85-453, S. 1, 3; P.A. 87-178, S. 1; P.A. 88-197, S. 1; P.A. 93-262, S. 1, 87; 93-381, S. 9, 39; P.A. 95-160, S. 3, 69; 95-257, S. 12, 21, 58; P.A. 96-81, S. 2; 96-139, S. 12, 13; June Sp.

The consultative process shall determine: (1) What caused consideration of the transfer; (2) whether the cause can be removed; and (3) if not, whether such home has attempted alternatives to transfer. The patient shall be informed of the risks and benefits of the transfer and of any alternatives. If subsequent to the completion of the consultative process a patient still does not wish to be transferred, the patient may be transferred without the patient's consent, unless medically contraindicated, only (A) if necessary to accomplish physical plant repairs or renovations that otherwise could not be accomplished; provided, if practicable, the patient, if the patient wishes, shall be returned to the patient's room when the repairs or renovations are completed; (B) due to irreconcilable incompatibility between or among roommates, which is actually or potentially harmful to the well-being of a patient; (C) if such home has two vacancies available for patients of the same sex in different rooms, there is no applicant of that sex pending admission in accordance with the requirements of section 19a-533 and grouping of patients by the same sex in the same room would allow admission of patients of the opposite sex, that otherwise would not be possible; (D) if necessary to allow access to specialized medical equipment no longer needed by the patient and needed by another patient; or (E) if the patient no longer needs the specialized services or programming that is the focus of the area of such home in which the patient is located.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, a patient may be involuntarily transferred immediately from one room to another within such home to protect the patient or others from physical harm, to control the spread of an infectious disease, to respond to a physical plant or environmental emergency that threatens the patient's health or safety or to respond to a situation that presents a patient with an immediate danger of death or serious physical harm. In such a case, disruption of patients shall be minimized; the required notice shall be provided not later than twenty-four hours after the transfer; if practicable, the patient, if the patient wishes, shall be returned to the patient's room when the threat to health or safety that prompted the transfer has been eliminated; and, in the case of a transfer effected to protect a patient or others from physical harm, the consultative process shall be established on the next business day.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, unless medically contraindicated, a patient who is a Medicaid recipient may be transferred from a private to a nonprivate room. In the case of such a transfer, the nursing home facility shall (1) give not less than thirty days' written notice to the patient and the patient's legally liable relative, guardian or conservator, if any, a person designated by the patient in accordance with section 1-56r or other responsible party, if known, which notice shall include the reason for the transfer, the location to which the patient is being transferred and the name, address and telephone number of the regional long-term care ombudsman; and (2) establish a consultative process to effect the transfer with the least disruption to the patient and assess, monitor and adjust care as needed subsequent to the transfer in accordance with subdivision (10) of subsection (b) of this section. The consultative process shall include the participation of the attending physician or advanced practice registered nurse, a registered nurse with responsibility for the patient and other appropriate staff in disciplines as determined by the patient's needs, and the participation of the patient, the patient's family, a person designated by the patient in accordance with section 1-56r or other representative.\n\n(e) Any nursing home facility, residential care home or chronic disease hospital that negligently deprives a patient of any right or benefit created or established for the well-being of the patient by the provisions of this section shall be liable to such patient in a private cause of action for injuries suffered as a result of such deprivation. Upon a finding that a patient has been deprived of such a right or benefit, and that the patient has been injured as a result of such deprivation, damages shall be assessed in the amount sufficient to compensate such patient for such injury. The rights or benefits specified in subsections (b) to (d), inclusive, of this section may not be reduced, rescinded or abrogated by contract. In addition, where the deprivation of any such right or benefit is found to have been wilful or in reckless disregard of the rights of the patient, punitive damages may be assessed. A patient may also maintain an action pursuant to this section for any other type of relief, including injunctive and declaratory relief, permitted by law. Exhaustion of any available administrative remedies shall not be required prior to commencement of suit under this section.\n\n(f) In addition to the rights specified in subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section, a patient in a nursing home facility is entitled to have the facility manage the patient's funds as provided in section 19a-551.\n\n(P.A. 75-468, S. 12, 17; P.A. 76-331, S. 15, 16; P.A. 79-265, S. 2; 79-378; P.A. 80-80; 80-120; P.A. 86-11; P.A. 89-348, S. 4, 10; P.A. 92-231, S. 3, 10; P.A. 93-262, S. 1, 87; 93-327, S. 3; 93-381, S. 9, 39; P.A. 95-257, S. 12, 21, 58; P.A. 96-81, S. 1; P.A. 97-112, S. 2; P.A. 01-195, S. 161, 181; P.A. 02-105, S. 6; P.A. 04-158, S. 1; P.A. 09-168, S. 1, 2; P.A. 13-208, S. 55; P.A. 14-122, S. 121; P.A. 15-50, S. 1; P.A. 16-39, S. 19; P.A. 21-55, S. 1; 21-196, S. 30; P.A. 22-58, S. 5.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 76-331 rephrased Subdiv.
