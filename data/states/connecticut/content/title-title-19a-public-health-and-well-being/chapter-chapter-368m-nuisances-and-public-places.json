Such show cause hearing shall be scheduled within five business days after service is effected by the state. The affidavit may be ordered sealed by the court or judge upon a finding that the state's interest in nondisclosure substantially outweighs the defendant's right to disclosure. A copy of the state's application and the temporary order to cease and desist shall be posted on any outside door to any building on the real property.\n\n(d) Such a public nuisance proceeding shall be deemed a civil action and venue shall lie in the superior court for the judicial district within which the real property alleged to constitute a public nuisance is located. Service of process shall be made in accordance with chapter 896. In addition, service of process may be made by an inspector of the Division of Criminal Justice or sworn member of a local police department or the Division of State Police.\n\n(e) At the show cause hearing, the court shall determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a public nuisance exists, and that the circumstances demand the temporary relief requested be ordered, or the temporary ex parte order be continued during the pendency of the public nuisance proceeding. The court may, upon motion by the state or any defendant, enter such orders as justice requires. The court shall schedule the evidentiary hearing within ninety days from the show cause hearing.\n\n(f) The record owner of the real property, any person claiming an interest of record pursuant to a bona fide mortgage, assignment of lease or rent, lien or security in the property and any lessee or tenant whose conduct is alleged to have contributed to the public nuisance shall be made a defendant to the action, except that the state shall exempt as a defendant any owner, lienholder, assignee, lessee, tenant or resident who cooperates with the state in making bona fide efforts to abate the nuisance or any tenant or resident who has been factually uninvolved in the conduct contributing to such public nuisance. If the state exempts as a defendant any record owner or any person claiming an interest of record pursuant to a mortgage, assignment of lease or rent, lien or security in the property, notice of the commencement of a nuisance proceeding shall be given by certified mail, return receipt requested, with a copy of such summons and complaint and a notice of exemption and right to be added as a party to any such person at his usual place of abode or business. Any such exempted person may, at his option, enter an appearance and participate in the nuisance proceeding to protect his property rights. Notice of the commencement of such a public nuisance proceeding shall be given by certified mail to the highest elected official of the municipality in which the real property is located.\n\n(g) If the defendant is a financial institution and the record owner of the real property, or if the defendant is a financial institution claiming an interest of record pursuant to a bona fide mortgage, assignment of lease or rent, lien or security in the real property and is not determined to be a principal or an accomplice in the conduct constituting the public nuisance, the court shall not enter any order against such defendant. The state shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that any such defendant claiming an interest of record under this subsection is a principal or an accomplice in the alleged conduct constituting the public nuisance. Any such defendant may offer evidence by way of an affirmative defense that such defendant has taken reasonable steps to abate the public nuisance, but has been unable to abate the nuisance. Any affirmative defense offered by such defendant shall be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. For the purposes of this subsection, “financial institution” means a bank, as defined in section 36a-2, an out-of-state bank, as defined in section 36a-2, an institutional lender or any subsidiary or affiliate of such bank, out-of-state bank or institutional lender that directly or indirectly acquires the real property pursuant to strict foreclosure, foreclosure by sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, and with the intent of ultimately transferring the property, or other lender licensed by the Department of Banking.\n\n(h) For any defendant who fails to appear, the court may enter a default following an evidentiary showing by the state in support of the relief requested, which shall include affidavits or the testimony of witnesses. When the court enters a judgment upon default, the court may enter such orders as appear reasonably necessary to abate the public nuisance.\n\n(i) At the evidentiary hearing upon the public nuisance complaint, the state shall have the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, the existence of a public nuisance upon the real property as provided in section 19a-343. If the state establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that there have been three or more arrests, the issuance of three or more arrest warrants indicating a pattern of criminal activity and not isolated incidents or the issuance of three or more citations for a violation of a municipal ordinance as described in subdivision (14) of subsection (c) of section 19a-343, for conduct on the real property or any portion thereof documented by a law enforcement officer for any of the offenses enumerated in subdivisions (1) to (14), inclusive, of subsection (c) of section 19a-343, within the three hundred sixty-five days preceding commencement of the action, such evidence shall create a rebuttable presumption of the existence of a public nuisance. Any defendant may offer evidence by way of an affirmative defense that such defendant has taken reasonable steps to abate the public nuisance, but has been unable to abate the nuisance.\n\n(P.A. 98-220, S. 2, 10; P.A. 99-115, S. 2, 3; P.A. 02-73, S. 85; P.A. 03-231, S. 8; 03-278, S. 73; P.A. 04-136, S. 39; 04-257, S. 38; P.A. 08-176, S. 68; P.A. 13-174, S. 3.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 98-220 effective July 1, 1998; P.A. 99-115 amended Subsec.

(g), effective July 1, 2008; P.A. 13-174 amended Subsec. (d) by making a technical change, amended Subsec. (g) by substituting “a preponderance of the evidence” for “clear and convincing evidence” re state's burden in proving that a financial institution is a principal or accomplice in the alleged conduct constituting the public nuisance and by adding provisions re financial institution may offer affirmative defense that it has taken reasonable steps to abate the public nuisance, to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, and amended Subsec. (i) by substituting “a preponderance of the evidence” for “clear and convincing evidence” re state's burden of proof in proving existence of a public nuisance, adding provision re state may prove existence of public nuisance by presenting evidence of issuance of 3 or more citations for violation of municipal ordinance as described in Sec. 19a-343(c)(14) and by making a technical change.",

The state shall post a copy of any court order to close the real property or any portion thereof on any outside door of the premises. The order shall include a notice that any person who removes, mutilates or defaces the closing order may be punished, upon conviction, by a fine not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars or by imprisonment of fifteen days, or both.\n\n(b) At any time after entry of an order, any defendant may apply to the court to have any order vacated or modified for good cause. Prior to any decision on a defendant's application to vacate or modify an order, the state shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to inspect the real property or any portion thereof to verify that the public nuisance has been abated, and the court shall provide the state with an opportunity to be heard to contest the defendant's application.\n\n(c) Where the court vacates or modifies any order, it may condition its decision on the posting of a bond in an amount not to exceed the current fair market value of the real property, as stated in an independent appraisal by a certified real estate appraiser, as surety against recurrence of the public nuisance.\n\n(d) Where the court finds that real property or any portion thereof constitutes a public nuisance and enters a final judgment, the state shall record a copy of such judgment and any orders on the land records in the town in which such real property is located.
