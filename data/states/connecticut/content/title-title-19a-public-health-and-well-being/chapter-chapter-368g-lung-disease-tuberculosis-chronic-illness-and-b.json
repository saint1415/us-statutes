A person is considered infectious to others until such time as sputum smears from a pulmonary, laryngeal or other airway source collected on three consecutive days have tested negative for tuberculosis and the person shows significant clinical improvement, such as the resolution of cough or fever.\n\n(3) “Suspected of having active tuberculosis” means a person has signs or symptoms of tuberculosis but diagnostic studies have not been completed.\n\n(4) “Nonadherent” means not taking tuberculosis medications as prescribed or not following the recommendations of the attending physician or health officer for the management of tuberculosis.\n\n(5) “Enablers” means anything that helps the patient to more readily complete therapy including, but not limited to, assistance with transportation.\n\n(6) “Incentive” means anything that motivates the patient to adhere to treatment including, but not limited to, food or coupons.\n\n(7) “Directly observed therapy” means a course of treatment for tuberculosis in which the prescribed antituberculosis medication is administered to the person or ingested by the person under direct observation, as specified by the local director of health.\n\n(b) The health care provider responsible for the treatment of any person with active tuberculosis shall devise, with the assistance and acknowledgment of that person and the approval of the director of health of the municipality in which the person with tuberculosis resides or, in the case of disagreement between the health care provider and the director of health, the Commissioner of Public Health, an appropriate individualized plan of treatment tailored to the person's medical and personal needs and identifying the method for effective treatment and prevention of transmission. The director of health shall provide or ensure the provision of such enablers and incentives as are within his or her means to provide and are reasonably appropriate in the individual situation to help the person to complete his or her course of treatment. In the event that the person with active tuberculosis is hospitalized or in state custody, the director of health shall be notified as required by section 19a-215, and the individualized plan of treatment shall be approved by the director prior to discharge, provided such discharge shall not be delayed more than twenty-four hours, excluding weekends, solely because of delay in obtaining this approval.\n\n(c) If any town, city or borough director of health determines that the public health is substantially and imminently endangered by a person with or suspected of having active tuberculosis, the director of health may take the following actions as reasonably necessary to protect the public health: (1) Issue a warning stating that the person should have a physician's examination for tuberculosis to a person who has active tuberculosis or who is suspected of having active tuberculosis when that person is unable or unwilling voluntarily to submit to such examination despite demonstrated efforts to educate and counsel the person about the need for such examination; (2) issue a warning stating that the person should complete an appropriate prescribed course of medication for tuberculosis when that person has active tuberculosis but is unwilling or unable to adhere to an appropriate prescribed course of medication despite a demonstrated effort to educate and counsel the person about the need to complete the prescribed course of treatment and the offering of such enablers and incentives as are reasonably appropriate to facilitate the completion of treatment by that person; (3) issue a warning stating that the person should follow a course of directly observed therapy for tuberculosis that should be given in such a manner as shall minimize the time and financial burden on the person given that person's individual circumstances, when that person has active tuberculosis, has been nonadherent to treatment for it and is unwilling or unable otherwise to adhere to an appropriate prescribed course of medication for tuberculosis despite a demonstrated effort to educate and counsel the person about the need to complete the course of treatment and the provision of such enablers and incentives to the person as are reasonably appropriate to facilitate the completion of treatment by that person; (4) issue an emergency commitment order which shall extend for no more than ninety-six hours that authorizes the removal to or detention in a hospital or other medically appropriate setting of a person: (A) Who has active tuberculosis that is infectious or who presents a substantial likelihood of having active tuberculosis that is infectious based upon epidemiologic, clinical, radiographic evidence and laboratory test results; (B) who poses a substantial and imminent likelihood of transmitting tuberculosis to others because of his or her inadequate separation from others, based on a physician's professional judgment using recognized infection control principles; (C) who is unwilling or unable to behave so as not to expose others to risk of infection from tuberculosis despite a demonstrated effort to educate and counsel the person about the need to avoid exposing others and required contagion precautions; (D) who has expressed or demonstrated an unwillingness to adhere to the prescribed course of treatment that would render the person noninfectious despite being educated and counseled about the need to do so and being offered such enablers and incentives as are reasonably appropriate to facilitate the completion of treatment; and (E) for whom emergency commitment is the least restrictive alternative to protect the public health. When issuing an emergency commitment order, the director of health may direct a police officer or other designated transport personnel to immediately transport the person with tuberculosis as so ordered by the director of health. The police officer shall take into custody and isolate the person in such a manner as required by the director of health. The director of health shall notify the police officer or other personnel concerning any necessary infection control procedures; (5) petition the Probate Court for a judicial commitment order that authorizes the removal to or detention in a hospital or other medically appropriate setting for the purposes of facilitating completion of a prescribed course of treatment for tuberculosis of a person: (A) Who has active tuberculosis; (B) who is unwilling or unable to adhere to an appropriate prescribed course of treatment for tuberculosis despite a demonstrated effort to educate and counsel the person about the need to complete the course of treatment and to provide such enablers and incentives to the person as are reasonably appropriate to facilitate the completion of treatment by that person; (C) who has demonstrated a pattern of persistent nonadherence to treatment for tuberculosis; (D) for whom commitment for the purposes of completion of the prescribed course of treatment for active tuberculosis is necessary to prevent the development of drug-resistant tuberculosis organisms; and (E) for whom commitment for the purpose of treatment for active tuberculosis is the least restrictive course of action available to protect the public health in that other less restrictive alternatives to encourage that person's adherence to the prescribed course of treatment for tuberculosis have failed.\n\n(d) Any warning or order issued by the director under subdivisions (1) to (4), inclusive, of subsection (c) of this section, or a petition under subdivision (5) of subsection (c) of this section, shall be in writing setting forth: (1) The name of the person who is the subject of the warning, order or petition; (2) the factual basis for the director's professional judgment that the person has active tuberculosis or, in the case of a warning concerning examination, is suspected of having active tuberculosis; (3) in the case of a warning concerning examination under subdivision (1) of subsection (c) of this section, the efforts that have been made to educate and counsel the person about the need for examination, the medical and legal consequences of failing to agree to it and the factual basis for the director's professional judgment that the person is unable or unwilling voluntarily to submit to such examination; (4) in the case of warnings and orders under subdivisions (2) to (4), inclusive, of subsection (c) of this section and a petition under subdivision (5) of subsection (c) of this section, the efforts that have been made to educate and counsel the person about the need to complete the appropriate prescribed course of treatment and the medical and legal consequences of failing to do so, a description of the enablers and incentives that have been offered or provided to the person, and the factual basis for the director's professional judgment that the person is unable or unwilling voluntarily to adhere to the appropriate prescribed course of treatment; (5) in the case of an emergency commitment order under subsection (c) of this section, the factual basis for the director's professional judgment that: (A) The person is infectious or presents a substantial likelihood of being infectious; (B) the person poses a substantial and imminent likelihood of transmitting tuberculosis to others; (C) the person is unable or unwilling to behave so as not to expose others to risk of infection; and (D) emergency commitment is the least restrictive alternative available to protect the public health; (6) in the case of a petition for commitment under subsection (c) of this section, the factual basis for the director's professional judgment that: (A) The person has been persistently nonadherent to treatment for tuberculosis; (B) commitment for the purpose of treatment for active tuberculosis is necessary to prevent the development of drug-resistant tuberculosis organisms; (C) commitment for the purpose of treatment for active tuberculosis is the least restrictive alternative to protect the public health in that other alternatives to encourage that person's adherence to treatment have failed. Any warnings or orders issued pursuant to subsections (c) and (k) of this section shall specify the period of time that the warning or order is to remain effective, provided: (i) Any order authorizing examination for tuberculosis shall not continue beyond the minimum period of time required, with the exercise of all due diligence, to make a medical determination of whether the person who has active tuberculosis is infectious or whether the person who is suspected of having tuberculosis has active tuberculosis; (ii) any warning concerning treatment or directly observed therapy shall not continue beyond the conclusion of the prescribed course of antituberculosis treatment; and (iii) any order authorizing emergency commitment shall not exceed ninety-six hours. Any order for emergency commitment or petition for commitment shall specify the place of confinement, which shall be in a facility approved by the Commissioner of Public Health and which shall not be a prison, jail or other enclosure where those charged with a crime are incarcerated unless the person who is the subject of the order is being held on a criminal charge. Not later than twenty-four hours after the issuance of the order or petition, the director of health shall notify the Commissioner of Public Health that such an order or petition has been issued.\n\n(e) The director of health may petition the Probate Court for the district in which a person subject to a warning issued under subdivision (1) of subsection (c) of this section resides for an enforcement order. A person concerning whom such petition is made shall have the right to a court hearing which shall be held by the Probate Court not later than three days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the date of receipt of such petition. The hearing shall be held to determine: (1) If the person has active tuberculosis or is suspected of having active tuberculosis; (2) if the person is unable or unwilling to be examined voluntarily; (3) if efforts have been made to educate the person about the need for examination; (4) whether the order is necessary and is the least restrictive alternative to protect the public health. The Probate Court may issue a warrant for the apprehension of a person who is the subject of an order for examination, and a police officer for the town in which such court is located, or if there is no such police officer then the state police or such other officer as the court may determine, shall deliver the person to a facility for examination as directed by the health director.\n\n(f) Immediately upon issuance of an emergency commitment order under subdivision (4) of subsection (c) of this section, the director of health shall petition the Probate Court for the district in which the person who is subject to the order resides to determine whether such commitment shall be continued. The hearing shall be held not later than ninety-six hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, after the date of the issuance of such order of emergency commitment and the court shall cause such advanced notice as it directs thereof to be given to the person who is the subject of the order and such other persons as it may direct. The court shall determine: (1) If the person has active tuberculosis that is infectious or presents a substantial likelihood of having active tuberculosis that is infectious based upon epidemiologic, clinical, or radiographic evidence, and laboratory test results; (2) if the person poses a substantial and imminent likelihood of transmitting tuberculosis to others because of inadequate separation from others, based on a physician's professional judgment using recognized infection control principles; (3) if the person is unwilling or unable to behave so as to not expose others to risk of infection from tuberculosis; (4) if efforts have been made to educate and counsel the person about the need to avoid exposing others and required contagion precautions; (5) if the person has expressed or demonstrated an unwillingness to adhere to the prescribed course of treatment that would render the person noninfectious; (6) if efforts have been made to educate and counsel about the need to complete treatment and if reasonably appropriate enablers and incentives have been offered to facilitate the completion of treatment; and (7) whether the order is necessary and is the least restrictive alternative to protect the public health.\n\n(g) A petition by a director of health for a commitment order pursuant to subdivision (5) of subsection (c) of this section shall be heard by the Probate Court for the district in which the subject of such petition resides not later than three business days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the date of receipt of such petition. The court shall cause such advanced notice as it directs thereof to be given to the person who is the subject of the order and such other persons as it may direct. The hearing shall be held to determine: (1) If the person has active tuberculosis; (2) if the person is unwilling or unable to adhere to an appropriate prescribed course of treatment for tuberculosis; (3) if efforts have been made to educate and counsel the person about the need to complete the course of treatment; (4) if reasonably appropriate enablers and incentives have been provided to the person to facilitate the completion of treatment by that person; (5) if the person has a demonstrated pattern of persistent nonadherence to treatment for tuberculosis; (6) if commitment for the purposes of completion of the prescribed course of treatment for active tuberculosis is necessary to prevent the development of drug-resistant tuberculosis organisms; and (7) whether the order is necessary and is the least restrictive available to protect the public health in that other less restrictive alternatives to encourage that person's adherence to the prescribed course of treatment for tuberculosis have failed. The Probate Court may issue a warrant for the apprehension of a person who is the subject of an order for commitment, and a police officer for the town in which such court is located, or if there is no such police officer then the state police or such other officer as the court may determine, shall deliver the person to the place for confinement as determined by the health director and as specified in subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(h) All orders by health directors and all petitions for a hearing under this section shall be hand-delivered to the person subject to the order as quickly as reasonably possible and shall inform such person that: (1) The person or the person's representative has a right to be present at the hearing; (2) the person has a right to counsel and, if indigent or otherwise unable to pay for or to obtain counsel, the person has a right to have counsel appointed to represent him or her; (3) the court shall have the right to appoint and hear additional expert witnesses at the expense of the petitioner; (4) the person has a right to be present and to cross-examine witnesses testifying at the hearing; (5) the proceedings before the Probate Court shall be recorded and shall be transcribed if the person appeals or files a writ of habeas corpus; (6) the proceedings before the court shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed unless the person or the person's legal representative requests, or the Probate Court so orders for good cause shown; (7) the person has a right to appeal an order of the Probate Court to the Superior Court; and (8) the person has a right to petition the Probate Court to terminate or modify an order it has made under subsection (k) of this section, as provided in subsection (l) of this section.

The reasonable compensation of appointed counsel for a person who is indigent or otherwise unable to pay for counsel shall be established by, and paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department, however, if funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such purposes, such compensation shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund.\n\n(i) Prior to any hearing under this section, such person or the person's counsel shall be afforded access to all the person's medical records including, without limitation, hospital records if such person is hospitalized.

If the court, at such hearing, finds that the director of health has failed to meet such burden of proof, the court shall enter no orders, provided, if the person has been subject to an emergency commitment, the court shall order a release from such commitment.\n\n(l) Such person may, at any time, move the court to terminate or modify an order made under subsection (k) of this section, in which case a hearing shall be held not later than five business days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the date of issuance of such order in accordance with this subsection. In addition, the court shall, on its own motion, review at least every six months any order of commitment issued under this section to determine if the conditions that required the commitment or restriction of the person still exist.

At such hearing, the director of health shall bear the burden of proof as specified in subsection (j) of this section.\n\n(m) Any person aggrieved by an order of the Probate Court under this section may take an appeal to the Superior Court. The Probate Court shall cause a recording of any hearing held pursuant to this section to be made, to be transcribed only in the event of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus or an appeal from the decree rendered hereunder.
