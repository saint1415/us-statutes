      "text": "INTERSTATE WILDLIFE VIOLATOR COMPACTADOPTION OF COMPACT\n\nThe Wildlife Violator Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into by the state of Connecticut with any and all states legally joining therein in accordance with its terms. The compact is substantially as follows:\n\nFindings, Declaration of Policy and Purpose\n\n(a) The party states find that:\n\n(1) Wildlife resources are managed in trust by the respective states for the benefit of all residents and visitors.\n\n(2) The protection of their respective wildlife resources may be materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statute or rule relating to the management of those resources.\n\n(3) The preservation, protection, management, and restoration of wildlife contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational, and economic aspects of these natural resources.\n\n(4) Wildlife resources are valuable without regard to political boundaries; therefore, all persons should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management, and restoration statutes, rules, and other law of all party states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap, or possess wildlife.\n\n(5) Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife resources and may endanger the safety of persons and property.\n\n(6) The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communications among the various states.\n\n(7) A person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than the person's home state:\n\n(A) May be required to post collateral or bond to secure appearance for a trial at a later date;\n\n(B) If unable to post collateral or bond, may be taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or\n\n(C) May be taken directly to court for an immediate appearance.\n\n(8) The purpose of the enforcement practices described in subdivision (7) of this subsection is to ensure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the person who, if permitted to continue on the person's way after receiving the citation, could return to the person's home state and disregard the person's duty under the terms of the citation.\n\n(9) A person receiving a wildlife citation in the person's home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to continue immediately on the person's way after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.\n\n(10) The practice described in subdivision (7) of this subsection causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay the fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement can be made.\n\n(11) The enforcement practices described in subdivision (7) of this subsection consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.\n\n(b) It is the policy of the party states to:\n\n(1) Promote compliance with the statutes, rules, and other applicable law relating to management of wildlife resources in their respective states.\n\n(2) Recognize the suspension of wildlife license privileges or rights of any person whose license privileges or rights have been suspended by a party state and treat this suspension as if it had occurred in the person's state.\n\n(3) Allow violators to accept a wildlife citation, except as provided in subsection (b) of Article III of this compact, and be released without delay whether or not the person is a resident in the state in which the citation was issued, provided that the violator's home state is party to this compact.\n\n(4) Report to the appropriate party state any conviction that would subject a person to suspension and that is recorded against any person whose home state was not the issuing state.\n\n(5) Allow the home state to recognize and treat a conviction that would subject a person to suspension and that is recorded for their residents and which occurred in another party state as if the conviction had occurred in the home state.\n\n(6) Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the party states for obtaining compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation issued in one party state to a resident of another party state.\n\n(7) Maximize effective use of law enforcement personnel and information.\n\n(8) Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of wildlife violations.\n\n(c) The purpose of this compact is to:\n\n(1) Provide a means through which the party states may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate policies enumerated in subsection (b) of this article in a uniform and orderly manner.\n\n(2) Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of wildlife violators operating within party states in recognition of the person's right of due process and the sovereign status of a party state.\n\nDefinitions\n\nThe definitions in this article apply throughout this compact and are intended only for the implementation of this compact:\n\n(1) “Citation” means any summons, complaint, ticket, penalty assessment, or other official document issued by a

Such permits may be issued to any qualified person designated by such landowner or lessee. The person to whom such permit is issued shall be held responsible for complying with the conditions under which such permit is issued. The provisions of this section shall not apply to deer.\n\n(b) (1) No person shall engage in the business of controlling nuisance wildlife, other than rats or mice, without obtaining a license from the commissioner. Such license shall be valid for a period of two years and may be renewed in accordance with a schedule established by the commissioner. The fee for such license shall be two hundred fifty dollars.

No person may advertise any services relating to humane capture or relocation of wildlife unless all methods employed in such services conform to such regulations.\n\n(5) Any person licensed under this subsection shall provide all clients with a written statement approved by the commissioner regarding approved lethal and nonlethal options, as provided in this subsection, which are available to the client for resolution of common nuisance problems.

Any such permit issued pursuant to this subsection shall specify the means, methods and times for which such take is allowed and shall only be issued by the commissioner to the: (A) Owner of the subject property on which such excessive damage occurred, (B) agent of such owner, or (C) lessee of such subject property, provided such lessee has the written permission of such owner to take wildlife.

Upon the receipt of an application, on forms provided by the commissioner and containing such information as said commissioner may require, from any landowner who has or whose primary lessee has an actual or potential gross annual income of twenty-five hundred dollars or more from the commercial cultivated production of grain, forage, fruit, vegetables, flowers, ornamental plants or Christmas trees and who is experiencing an actual or potential loss of income because of severe damage by deer, the commissioner shall issue not more than six damage permits without fee to such landowner or the primary lessee of such landowner, or the wife, husband, lineal descendant or designated agent of such landowner or lessee. The application shall be notarized and signed by all landowners or by the landowner or a lessee to whom a farmer tax exemption permit has been issued pursuant to subdivision (63) of section 12-412. Such damage permit shall be valid through October thirty-first of the year in which it is issued and may specify the hunting implement or shot size or both which shall be used to take such deer. The commissioner may at any time revoke such permit for violation of any provision of this section or for violation of any regulation pursuant thereto or upon the request of the applicant. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 26-85, the commissioner may issue a permit to any landowner or primary lessee of land owned by such landowner or the husband or wife or any lineal descendant of such landowner or lessee and to not more than three designated agents of such landowner or lessee to use a jacklight for the purpose of taking deer when it is shown, to the satisfaction of the commissioner, that such deer are causing damage which cannot be reduced during the daylight hours between sunrise and one-half hour after sunset on the land of such landowner. The commissioner may require notification as specified on such permit prior to its use. Any deer killed in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be the property of the owner of the land upon which the same has been killed, but shall not be sold, bartered, traded or offered for sale, and the person who kills any such deer shall tag and report each deer killed, as provided in section 26-86b. Upon receipt of the report required by section 26-86b, the commissioner shall issue an additional damage permit to the person making such report. Any deer killed otherwise than under the conditions provided for in this chapter or regulations adopted pursuant thereto shall remain the property of the state and may be disposed of by the commissioner at the commissioner's discretion to any state institution or may be sold and the proceeds of such sale shall be remitted to the State Treasurer, who shall apply the same to the General Fund, and no person, except the commissioner, shall retail, sell or offer for sale the whole or any part of any such deer. No person shall be a designated agent of more than one landowner or primary lessee in any calendar year. No person shall make, set or use any trap, snare, salt lick, bait or other device for the purpose of taking, injuring or killing any deer, except that deer may be taken over an attractant in areas designated by the commissioner. For the purposes of this section, an attractant means any natural or artificial substance placed, exposed, deposited, distributed or scattered that is used to attract, entice or lure deer to a specific location including, but not limited to, salt, chemicals or minerals, including their residues or any natural or artificial food, hay, grain, fruit or nuts. The commissioner may authorize any municipality, homeowner association or nonprofit land-holding organization approved by the commissioner under the provisions of this section to take deer at any time, other than Sundays, or place using any method consistent with professional wildlife management principles when a severe nuisance or ecological damage can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the commissioner. Any such municipality, homeowner association or nonprofit land-holding organization shall submit to the commissioner, for the commissioner's review and approval, a plan that describes the extent and degree of the nuisance or ecological damage and the proposed methods of taking. Prior to the implementation of any such approved plan, the municipality, homeowner association or nonprofit land-holding organization shall provide notice of such plan to any abutting landowners of such place where the plan will be implemented. Such plan shall not authorize the use of a snare. No person shall hunt, pursue or kill deer being pursued by any dog, whether or not such dog is owned or controlled by such person, except that no person shall be guilty of a violation under this section when such a deer is struck by a motor vehicle operated by such person. No person shall use or allow any dog in such person's charge to hunt, pursue or kill deer. No permit shall be issued when in the opinion of the commissioner the public safety may be jeopardized.\n\n(b) Any person who violates any provision of this section shall be fined not less than two hundred dollars or more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not less than thirty days or more than six months, or shall be both fined and imprisoned, for the first offense, and for each subsequent offense shall be fined not less than two hundred dollars or more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than one year, or shall be both fined and imprisoned.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 4898, 4901; 1949, S. 2493d; 1959, P.A. 398, S. 13; 1963, P.A. 327; 422; February, 1965, P.A. 78; 1969, P.A. 53, S. 1; 1971, P.A. 872, S. 273; P.A. 74-151, S. 2, 7; P.A. 75-192; P.A. 79-445, S. 1, 2; P.A. 80-305; P.A. 84-172; P.A. 90-167; P.A. 97-250, S. 4; P.A. 02-103, S. 34; P.A. 03-123, S. 9; 03-192, S. 6; P.A. 04-109, S. 14; 04-257, S. 44.)\n\nHistory: 1959 act required that proceeds from sale of illegally seized deer be deposited in general fund rather than game fund; 1963 acts clarified definition of “regular employee” by specifying employees “for wages to perform agricultural, management or maintenance duties on the property for which a permit is issued”, by specifying that twelve-month employment period is “prior to killing any deer”, and prohibited taking more than one deer in any year without board's authorization; 1965 act prohibited hunting, pursuing or killing deer which is being pursued by a dog, but exempted persons who strike a deer with a motor vehicle from consideration as violators of provisions; 1969 act excluded references to lessees throughout section, made deer killed except as allowed under “chapter” rather than “section” property of the state; 1971 act replaced references to board of fisheries and game and its director with references to environmental protection commissioner; P.A. 74-151 deleted provisions defining “regular employee” and authorizing such employees to kill deer, referring instead to designated agents of landowners, added provisions re specific crop protection permits, deleted provision which had allowed use of bow and arrow and replaced previous reporting procedure with requirement that kills be tagged and reported as provided in Sec. 26-86b; P.A. 75-192 allowed issuance of three permits rather than one, reducing from two to one the number of kills allowed per permit and set duration of permit at four months rather than one year; P.A. 79-445 changed landowner's qualifications for permit from ownership of ten or more acres used for agricultural purposes to landowners with actual or potential loss of $500 or more from cultivated products, increased number of permits allowed to each landowner from three to six, restored original expiration date of December thirty-first, authorized commissioner to specify weapon or shot size to be used, deleted commissioner's power to allow taking more than one deer with a permit, allowed landowner to designate up to three agents rather than one, authorized issuance of additional permit after commissioner receives required report, prohibited agents from serving more than one landowner in a year and forbade use of bait to take deer; P.A. 80-305 added Subsec.

Such temporary license may only be issued to a member of such license holder's immediate family or to a member of such license holder's crew, as designated by such license holder, for the duration of such license holder's incapacity or exigencies related to medical care of an immediate family member of such license holder. Such temporary license shall be subject to the provisions of section 26-142a. Landings during the period of such temporary license reissue may be used to satisfy the requirements for license transfer in subsection (c) of this section, provided the licensee met all such requirements for transfer at the time of such temporary reissue.\n\n(c) The commissioner may authorize the transfer of an active principal commercial fishing license, general commercial fishing license or commercial lobster pot fishing license, issued pursuant to subsection (f) of section 26-142a, provided: (1) For purposes of an active resident-held principal or general commercial fishing license or commercial lobster pot fishing license: (A) The person receiving the license in such transfer is a resident of this state, and (B) the person transferring the license held the license and landed regulated species or owned a vessel that landed regulated species under the privilege of a quota-managed species endorsement associated with the license in at least five of the eight calendar years preceding the transfer request and such landings were reported to the commissioner, pursuant to section 26-157b, for not less than thirty fishing days in each year, or (2) for purposes of an active nonresident-held principal or general commercial fishing license or commercial lobster pot fishing license: The person transferring the license held the license and landed regulated species or owned a vessel that landed regulated species under the privilege of a quota-managed species endorsement associated with the license in at least five of the eight calendar years preceding the transfer request and such landings were reported to the commissioner, pursuant to section 26-157b, for not less than thirty fishing days in each year.

The commissioner may issue such license to qualified applicants upon the submission of an application, on forms provided by the commissioner, containing such information as prescribed by the commissioner. There shall be an annual fee of one hundred thirty dollars for each such license. Such license shall expire on the last day of December next after the issuance thereof. All legally acquired finfish and crustaceans hatched, reared or held in commercial hatcheries may be taken and sold at any time for the purpose of stocking other waters, for bait or for food, except that lobsters or blue crabs sold for any purpose other than for rearing in another commercial hatchery shall not have ova or spawn attached and must meet the minimum legal length requirements provided in subsection (a) of section 26-157a. Each owner or operator of any such hatchery shall keep such records as are required by the commissioner on forms provided by the commissioner which record shall be open to inspection by said commissioner or the commissioner's authorized agents at any time and a copy of such records shall be furnished to the commissioner by January thirty-first of the year following the year covered by the report. Representatives of the commissioner may enter upon the premises of any such licensed hatchery at any time to inspect any facility, equipment, impoundment or any finfish or crustaceans to determine the presence of disease or parasites. In such case said commissioner, when so requested, may render such technical assistance as is necessary and possible and may charge a reasonable fee for such services. In the event that the presence of disease or parasites is confirmed in finfish or crustaceans hatched, held or reared in such licensed hatchery said commissioner is authorized to suspend or revoke any such commercial hatchery license and issue an order prohibiting the sale, exchange or removal from such premises of such finfish or crustaceans, and direct such disposition of such remaining finfish or crustaceans including the eggs of such finfish or crustaceans as the commissioner determines would be in the public interest. Any person issued a license to operate a commercial finfish hatchery may charge a fee for the privilege of fishing in the waters included under said license and may sell any species of finfish removed therefrom, provided no sport fishing license shall be required. Said commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, governing and prescribing the methods of taking such finfish and the conditions under which such finfish may be sold, removed from the premises, possessed and transported. Said commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, governing and prescribing the method of taking particular species of finfish and the conditions under which such finfish may be removed from the premises, possessed and transported, without a sport fishing license, from artificial facilities at fairs, sportsmen's shows and at such other place as said commissioner authorizes. Persons operating such facilities shall not be required to pay a fee to said commissioner and such persons may charge a fee for the privilege of fishing in such water, provided any such facility and any finfish used in connection therewith may be inspected at any time by any representative of the department to determine the presence of disease or parasites. In the event the presence of disease or parasites is confirmed, any such representative may issue a written order directing that such facility be immediately closed to the public and directing such disposition of such remaining finfish as would be in the public interest.
