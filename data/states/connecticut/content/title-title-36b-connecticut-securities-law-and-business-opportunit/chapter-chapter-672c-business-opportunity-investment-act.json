Upon a proper showing, a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order or writ of mandamus shall be granted and a receiver or conservator may be appointed for the defendant or the defendant's assets. The court shall not require the commissioner to post a bond; (2) seek a court order imposing a fine not to exceed one hundred thousand dollars per violation against any person found to have violated any order issued by the commissioner; or (3) in addition to any other remedies provided by this section, apply to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford for an order of restitution whereby the defendants in such action shall be ordered to make restitution of those sums shown by the commissioner to have been obtained by them in violation of any of the provisions of said sections or any such regulation, rule or order, plus interest at the rate set forth in section 37-3a.
