Such notice of exemption shall be valid until December thirty-first of the calendar year in which it was first filed and may be renewed annually thereafter upon submission of such information as the commissioner may require together with a nonrefundable fee of one hundred seventy-five dollars. If any investment adviser that is exempted from registration pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection fails or refuses to pay any fee required by this subsection, the commissioner may require such investment adviser to register pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. For purposes of this subsection, a delay in the payment of a fee or an underpayment of a fee which is promptly remedied shall not constitute a failure or refusal to pay such fee.\n\n(f) Any broker-dealer or investment adviser ceasing to transact business at any branch office or main office in this state shall, in addition to providing written notice to the commissioner prior to the termination of business activity at that office, (1) provide written notice to each customer or client serviced by such office at least ten business days prior to the termination of business activity at that office, or (2) demonstrate to the commissioner, in writing, the reasons why such notice to customers or clients cannot be provided within the time prescribed.

The commissioner shall determine the time and manner in which notice shall be provided to each customer or client serviced by such office.\n\n(i) (1) A broker-dealer or investment adviser may succeed to the current registration of another broker-dealer or investment adviser or to a notice filing of an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission may succeed to the current registration of an investment adviser or to a notice filing of another investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, by filing as a successor an application for registration pursuant to section 36b-7 or a notice pursuant to subsection (e) of this section for the unexpired portion of the current registration or notice filing and paying the fee required by subsection (a) of section 36b-12.\n\n(2) A broker-dealer or investment adviser that changes its form of organization or state of incorporation or organization may continue its registration by filing an amendment to its registration if the change does not involve a material change in its management. The amendment shall become effective when filed or on a date designated by the registrant in its filing.

but the commissioner may not (I) institute a revocation or suspension proceeding under this subparagraph more than five years from the date of the sanction relied on, and (II) enter an order under this subparagraph on the basis of an order under any other state act unless that order was based on facts which would constitute a ground for an order under this section;

(I) is insolvent, either in the sense that the liabilities of such applicant, registrant or person exceed the assets of such applicant, registrant or person, or in the sense that such applicant, registrant or person cannot meet the obligations of such applicant, registrant or person as they mature; but the commissioner may not enter an order against a broker-dealer or investment adviser under this subparagraph without a finding of insolvency as to the broker-dealer or investment adviser; (J) is not qualified on the basis of such factors as training, experience, and knowledge of the securities business, except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section; (K) has failed reasonably to supervise: (i) The agents or investment adviser agents of such applicant or registrant, if the applicant or registrant is a broker-dealer or investment adviser; or (ii) the agents of a broker-dealer or investment adviser agents of an investment adviser, if such applicant, registrant or other person is or was an agent, investment adviser agent or other person charged with exercising supervisory authority on behalf of a broker-dealer or investment adviser;

(M) has wilfully aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced or procured a violation of any provision of sections 36b-2 to 36b-34, inclusive, or a predecessor statute or any regulation or order under such sections or a predecessor statute; (N) after notice and opportunity for a hearing, has been found within the previous ten years: (i) By a court of competent jurisdiction, to have wilfully violated the laws of a foreign jurisdiction under which the business of securities, commodities, investments, franchises, business opportunities, insurance, banking or finance is regulated; (ii) to have been the subject of an order of a securities regulator of a foreign jurisdiction denying, revoking or suspending the right to engage in the business of securities as a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, investment adviser agent or similar person; or (iii) to have been suspended or expelled from membership by or participation in a securities exchange or securities association operating under the securities laws of a foreign jurisdiction. As used in this subparagraph, “foreign” means a jurisdiction outside of the United States; or (O) has failed to pay the proper filing fee; but the commissioner may enter only a denial order under this subparagraph, and the commissioner shall vacate any such order when the deficiency has been corrected. The commissioner may not institute a suspension or revocation proceeding on the basis of a fact or transaction known to the commissioner when the registration became effective unless the proceeding is instituted within one hundred eighty days of the effective date of such registration.\n\n(b) The following provisions govern the application of subparagraph (J) of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section: (1) The commissioner may not enter an order against a broker-dealer on the basis of the lack of qualification of any person other than (a) the broker-dealer if the broker-dealer is an individual, or (B) an agent of the broker-dealer; (2) the commissioner may not enter an order against an investment adviser on the basis of the lack of qualification of any person other than (a) the investment adviser if the investment adviser is an individual, or (B) any other person who represents the investment adviser in doing any of the acts which make the investment adviser an investment adviser; (3) the commissioner may not enter an order solely on the basis of lack of experience if the applicant or registrant is qualified by training or knowledge or both; (4) the commissioner shall consider that an agent who will work under the supervision of a registered broker-dealer need not have the same qualifications as a broker-dealer; (5) the commissioner shall consider that an investment adviser is not necessarily qualified solely on the basis of experience as a broker-dealer or agent. When the commissioner finds that an applicant for initial or renewal registration as a broker-dealer is not qualified as an investment adviser, the commissioner may by order condition the applicant's registration as a broker-dealer upon the applicant's not transacting business in this state as an investment adviser; (6) the commissioner may by regulation provide for an examination, which may be written or oral or both, to be taken by any class of or all applicants, as well as persons who represent or will represent an investment adviser in doing any of the acts which make the investment adviser an investment adviser.\n\n(c) The commissioner may by order summarily postpone or suspend registration or require a registrant to take or refrain from taking such action that in the opinion of the commissioner will effectuate the purposes of sections 36b-2 to 36b-34, inclusive, pending final determination of any proceeding under this section. Upon the entry of the order, the commissioner shall promptly notify the applicant or registrant, as well as the employer or prospective employer if the applicant or registrant is an agent or an investment adviser agent, that it has been entered and of the reasons therefor and that within fifteen days after the receipt of a written request the matter will be set down for hearing. If no hearing is requested and none is ordered by the commissioner, the order will remain in effect until it is modified or vacated by the commissioner. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the commissioner, after notice of and opportunity for hearing, may modify or vacate the order or extend it until final determination.\n\n(d) If the commissioner finds that any registrant or applicant for registration is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser or investment adviser agent, or is subject to an adjudication of mental incompetence or to the control of a committee, conservator, or guardian, or cannot be located after reasonable search, the commissioner may by order cancel the registration or application.\n\n(e) (1) Withdrawal from registration as a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser or investment adviser agent, or withdrawal of an application for registration as a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser or investment adviser agent, becomes effective ninety days after receipt of an application to withdraw such registration or a notice of intent to withdraw such application for registration or within such shorter period of time as the commissioner may determine, unless a denial, revocation or suspension proceeding is pending when the application or notice is filed or a proceeding to deny, revoke, suspend or impose conditions upon the withdrawal is instituted within ninety days after the application or notice is filed. If a proceeding is pending or instituted, withdrawal becomes effective at such time and upon such conditions as the commissioner by order determines. If no proceeding is pending or instituted and withdrawal automatically becomes effective, the commissioner may nevertheless institute a denial, revocation or suspension proceeding under subsection (a) of this section within one year after withdrawal became effective.\n\n(2) If the registration of a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser or investment adviser agent expires due to the registrant's failure to renew, within one year of such expiration, the commissioner may nevertheless institute a revocation or suspension proceeding or issue an order suspending or revoking the registration under subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(f) No order may be entered under this section except as provided in subsection (c) of this section without (1) appropriate prior notice to the applicant or registrant and to the employer or prospective employer if such applicant or registrant is an agent or investment adviser agent, (2) opportunity for hearing, and (3) written findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the commissioner may deny an application for registration as a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, investment adviser agent or branch office if the applicant fails to respond to any request for information required under sections 36b-2 to 36b-34, inclusive, or the regulations adopted pursuant to said sections. The commissioner shall notify the applicant in writing that if such information is not submitted within sixty days the application shall be deemed abandoned and denied. An application filing fee paid prior to the date an application is denied pursuant to this subsection shall not be refunded. Denial of an application pursuant to this subsection shall not preclude the applicant from submitting a new application for registration under said sections. The hearing requirement provided for in subsection (f) of this section shall not apply to the denial of an application issued pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(P.A. 77-482, S. 15; P.A. 80-88, S. 5, 12; P.A. 82-149, S. 6, 16; P.A. 87-375, S. 4; P.A. 88-208, S. 2; P.A. 89-220, S. 3, 4; P.A. 91-145, S. 4, 5; P.A. 94-178, S. 1; P.A. 96-192, S. 4; P.A. 99-38, S. 2; P.A. 01-48, S. 3; P.A. 03-19, S. 87; 03-259, S. 20; P.A. 04-45, S. 4; P.A. 05-177, S. 5; P.A. 07-91, S. 25; P.A. 09-160, S. 10; P.A. 10-141, S. 10.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 80-88 added references to commodities, commodity futures trading commission and Commodity Exchange Act where appearing in Subsec.

The registrant shall, within one business day after the federal registration statement becomes effective, notify the commissioner in writing of the date and time when the federal registration statement became effective and the content of the price amendment, if any. The registrant shall, within five business days after the federal registration statement becomes effective, file a posteffective amendment containing the information and documents in the price amendment, if any. “Price amendment” means the final federal amendment which includes a statement of the offering price, underwriting and selling discounts or commissions, amount of proceeds, conversion rates, call prices, and other matters dependent upon the offering price. Upon failure to receive the required notification and posteffective amendment with respect to the price amendment, the commissioner may enter a stop order, without notice or hearing, retroactively denying effectiveness to the registration statement or suspending its effectiveness until compliance with this subsection, if he notifies the registrant by telephone or telegram of the issuance of the order by the close of the next business day following the entry of such order. Such notification, if by telephone, shall be followed by a confirmation in writing. If the registrant proves compliance with the requirements of this subsection as to notice and posteffective amendment, the stop order is void as of the time of its entry.

If the federal registration statement becomes effective before all the conditions in this subsection are satisfied and they are not waived, the registration statement automatically becomes effective as soon as all the conditions are satisfied. If the registrant advises the commissioner of the date when the federal registration statement has become effective, the commissioner shall advise the registrant by telephone or telegram, at the registrant's expense, within five business days after such information is received from the registrant, whether all the conditions are satisfied and whether he then contemplates the institution of a proceeding under section 36b-20, provided such advice by the commissioner shall not preclude the institution of such a proceeding at any time.

The commissioner may by regulation or order determine the conditions of any escrow or impounding required hereunder, but he may not reject a depository solely because of location in another state.\n\n(h) The commissioner may by regulation or order require as a condition of registration that any security registered by qualification or coordination be sold only on a specified form of subscription or sale contract and that a signed or conformed copy of each contract be filed with the commissioner or preserved for any period up to three years specified in the regulation or order.\n\n(i) Every registration statement is effective for one year from its effective date, except during the time a stop order is in effect under section 36b-20. All outstanding securities of the same class as a registered security are considered to be registered for the purpose of any nonissuer transaction (1) as long as the registration statement is effective, and (2) between the thirtieth day after the entry of any stop order suspending or revoking the effectiveness of the registration statement under section 36b-20 if the registration statement did not relate in whole or in part to a nonissuer distribution and one year from the effective date of the registration statement. A registration statement may not be withdrawn for one year from its effective date if any securities of the same class are outstanding; provided, if within such one-year period the security or transaction covered by such registration statement becomes eligible for an exemption from registration, the registration statement shall be terminated if the commissioner is notified in writing within such one-year period of the exempt status of the security or transaction. A registration statement may be withdrawn otherwise only in the discretion of the commissioner.\n\n(j) As long as a registration statement is effective, the commissioner may by regulation or order require the person who filed the registration statement to file reports not more often than quarterly, to keep reasonably current the information contained in the registration statement and to disclose the progress of the offering.\n\n(k) When any securities have been sold without compliance with the provisions of section 36b-16, any person may apply in writing on forms designated by the commissioner for the registration by qualification of such securities. If the commissioner finds as the result of an investigation that no person has been defrauded, prejudiced or damaged by the prior failure to effect a registration, the commissioner may permit such securities to be registered upon the payment of fifty dollars plus the fees prescribed in this section. Such registration by qualification under this subsection shall not relieve anyone who has violated any provision of sections 36b-2 to 36b-34, inclusive, from prosecution hereunder.\n\n(P.A. 77-482, S. 19; P.A. 78-34, S. 14, 17; P.A. 81-292, S. 6–9; P.A. 82-149, S. 8–10, 16; P.A. 83-368, S. 7, 11; P.A. 87-375, S. 5; P.A. 92-89, S. 10, 11, 20; P.A. 94-178, S. 2; P.A. 97-220, S. 9, 15; P.A. 99-38, S. 3; P.A. 06-196, S. 269; P.A. 10-141, S. 12, 13.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 78-34 replaced reference to Sec. 36-488 with reference to Sec. 36-489 in Subsec.

Such controlling person or aider shall be liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as the person liable under subdivision (3) of this subsection, unless such controlling person or aider allegedly liable under this subdivision sustains the burden of proof that such person did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist. Such restitution or disgorgement shall, at the option of the court, be payable to the receiver or conservator appointed pursuant to this subsection, or directly to the persons whose assets were obtained in violation of any provision of sections 36b-2 to 36b-34, inclusive, or any such regulation, rule or order.\n\n(f) Any time after the issuance of an order or notice provided for in subsection (a), (b) or (c) or subdivision (1) of subsection (d) of this section, the commissioner may accept an agreement by any respondent named in such order or notice to enter into a written consent order in lieu of an adjudicative hearing.

A radio or television program or other electronic communication is considered as having originated in this state if either the broadcast studio or the originating source of transmission is located in this state, unless: (1) The program or communication is syndicated and distributed from outside this state for redistribution to the general public in this state; (2) the program or communication is supplied by a radio, television or other electronic network with the electronic signal originating from outside this state for redistribution to the general public in this state; (3) the program or communication is an electronic communication that originates outside this state and is captured for redistribution to the general public in this state by a community antenna or cable, radio, cable television or other electronic system; or (4) the program or communication consists of an electronic communication that originates in this state, but which is not intended for distribution to the general public in this state.\n\n(f) Sections 36b-5, 36b-6, 36b-23 and 36b-24, so far as they apply to investment advisers and investment adviser agents, apply when any act instrumental in effecting prohibited conduct is done in this state, whether or not either party is then present in this state.\n\n(g) Every applicant for registration under sections 36b-2 to 36b-34, inclusive, every investment adviser exempt under subsection (e) of section 36b-6, and every issuer, other than the United States, any state, Canada, any other foreign government with which the United States currently maintains diplomatic relations, or any issuer of covered securities under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, which proposes to offer a security in this state through any person acting on an agency basis in the common-law sense shall file with the commissioner, in such form as the commissioner by regulation prescribes, an irrevocable consent appointing the commissioner or the commissioner's successor in office to be his or her attorney to receive service of any lawful process in any noncriminal suit, action, or proceeding against him or her or his or her successor executor or administrator which arises under sections 36b-2 to 36b-34, inclusive, or any regulation or order thereunder after the consent has been filed, with the same force and validity as if served personally on the person filing the consent. A person who has filed such a consent in connection with a previous registration need not file another. Service may be made by leaving a copy of the process in the office of the commissioner, but it is not effective unless (1) the plaintiff, who may be the commissioner in a suit, action, or proceeding instituted by the commissioner, forthwith sends notice of the service and a copy of the process by registered mail, return receipt requested, certified mail, return receipt requested, or any express delivery carrier that provides a dated delivery receipt, to the defendant or respondent at the defendant's or respondent's last address on file with the commissioner, and (2) the plaintiff's affidavit of compliance with this subsection is filed in the case on or before the return day of the process, if any, or within such further time as the court allows.\n\n(h) When any person, including any nonresident of this state, engages in conduct prohibited or made actionable by sections 36b-2 to 36b-34, inclusive, or any regulation or order thereunder, and such person has not filed a consent to service of process under subsection (g) of this section and personal jurisdiction over such person cannot otherwise be obtained in this state, that conduct shall be considered equivalent to such person's appointment of the commissioner or the commissioner's successor in office to be such person's attorney to receive service of any lawful process in any noncriminal suit, action, or proceeding against such person or such person's successor executor or administrator which grows out of that conduct and which is brought under said sections or any regulation or order thereunder, with the same force and validity as if served on such person personally. Service may be made by leaving a copy of the process in the office of the commissioner, and it is not effective unless (1) the plaintiff, who may be the commissioner in a suit, action, or proceeding instituted by the commissioner, forthwith sends notice of the service and a copy of the process by registered mail, return receipt requested, certified mail, return receipt requested, or any express delivery carrier that provides a dated delivery receipt, to the defendant or respondent at the defendant's or respondent's last-known address or takes other steps which are reasonably calculated to give actual notice, and (2) the plaintiff's affidavit of compliance with this subsection is filed in the case on or before the return day of the process, if any, or within such further time as the court allows.\n\n(i) Service pursuant to subsection (g) or (h) of this section may be made by the commissioner in an investigation or administrative proceeding in which the commissioner is the moving party.\n\n(P.A. 77-482, S. 34; P.A. 83-368, S. 10, 11; P.A. 88-208, S. 5; P.A. 97-22, S. 5; 97-220, S. 14, 15; P.A. 01-48, S. 6; P.A. 05-177, S. 13; P.A. 10-141, S. 30; P.A. 14-7, S. 14, 15.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 83-368 amended Subsec.
