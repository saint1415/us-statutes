Publication of descriptions.The systems of plane coordinates which have been established by the National Geodetic Survey created by the National Ocean Service, formerly the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, or its successors, or the Connecticut Geodetic Survey for purposes of defining and stating the geographic positions or locations of points on the surface of the earth within the state of Connecticut shall hereafter be known and designated as the Connecticut Coordinate System of 1927 and the Connecticut Coordinate System of 1983. In any land description in which such system is used, it shall be designated the “Connecticut Coordinate System of 1927” or the “Connecticut Coordinate System of 1983”, whichever is applicable. A detailed description of each system shall be published by the Commissioner of Transportation.\n\n(b)Maintenance.Said systems shall be designated as the Connecticut coordinate systems, and said commissioner shall be responsible for their extension, revision and maintenance.\n\n(c)Definitions.The following definition by the National Ocean Service is adopted: The plane coordinate values for a point on the earth's surface, used to express the geographic position or location of such point, shall consist of two distances expressed in U.S. survey feet and decimals of a foot. One of these distances, to be known as the “N-coordinate”, shall give the position in a north and south direction; the other, to be known as the “E-coordinate”, shall give the position in an east and west direction. These coordinates shall be made to depend upon and conform to plane rectangular coordinate values for the monumented points of the North American Horizontal Geodetic Control Network as published by the National Geodetic Survey created by the National Ocean Service, formerly the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, or its successors, and whose plane coordinates have been computed on the systems defined in this section.\n\n(1) “The Connecticut Coordinate System of 1927” is defined as follows: A Lambert conformal conic projection of the Clarke spheroid of 1866, having standard parallels at north latitudes 41 degrees 52 minutes and 41 degrees 12 minutes along which parallels the scale shall be exact. The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the meridian 72 degrees 45 minutes west of Greenwich and the parallel 40 degrees 50 minutes north latitude. This origin is given the coordinates: X=600,000 and Y=0 feet.\n\n(2) “The Connecticut Coordinate System of 1983” is defined as follows: A Lambert conformal conic projection of the North American datum of 1983, having standard parallels at north latitudes 41 degrees 52 minutes and 41 degrees 12 minutes along which parallels the scale shall be exact. The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the meridian 72 degrees 45 minutes west of Greenwich and the parallel 40 degrees 50 minutes north latitude. This origin is given the coordinates: N=500,000 feet and E=1,000,000 feet.\n\n(d)Use of names.The use of the term “Connecticut Coordinate System of 1927” or “the Connecticut Coordinate System of 1983” on any map, report of survey or other document shall be limited to coordinates based on the Connecticut coordinate systems, as defined in subsection (c).\n\n(e)Description.For the purposes of describing the location of any survey station or land boundary corner in the state of Connecticut, it shall be considered a complete, legal and satisfactory description of such location to give the position of said survey station or land boundary corner on the system of plane coordinates, as defined in this section.\n\n(f)Interpretation.Nothing contained in this section shall require descriptions of real estate to be based only on either of the Connecticut coordinate systems.\n\n(g)Entry upon private property.Said commissioner or his agent or agents may enter upon private property for the purpose of surveying, establishing or maintaining the survey. He shall use care so that no unnecessary damage shall result to any private property and the state shall be liable to the owner of such property for any damage so caused.\n\n(h)Final date for use of 1927 system.The Connecticut Coordinating System of 1927 shall not be used for new mapping after December 31, 1996; the Connecticut Coordinate System of 1983 shall be the sole system for new mapping after said date.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 2212; 1958 Rev., S. 13-97; 1963, P.A. 226, S. 255; 1969, P.A. 768, S. 134; P.A. 86-68; P.A. 91-53; P.A. 03-115, S. 44.)\n\nHistory: 1963 act replaced previous provisions: See title history; 1969 act replaced highway commissioner with commissioner of transportation; P.A. 86-68 amended Subsec.
