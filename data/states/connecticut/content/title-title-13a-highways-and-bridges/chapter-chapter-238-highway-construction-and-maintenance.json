The use of any site acquired for highway maintenance storage area or garage purposes by condemnation shall conform to any zoning ordinance or development plan in effect for the area in which such site is located, provided the commissioner may be granted any variance or special exception as may be made pursuant to the zoning ordinances and regulations of the town in which any such site is to be acquired. The assessment of such damages and of such benefits shall be made by the commissioner and filed by the commissioner with the clerk of the superior court for the judicial district in which the land affected is located. The commissioner shall give notice of such assessment to each person having an interest of record therein, or such person's designated agent for service of process, by mailing to such person a copy of the same, postage prepaid, and, at any time after such assessment has been made by the commissioner, the physical construction of such layout, alteration, extension, widening, maintenance storage area or garage, change of grade or other improvement may be made. If notice cannot be given to any person entitled thereto because such person's whereabouts or existence is unknown, notice may be given by publishing a notice at least twice in a newspaper published in the judicial district and having a daily or weekly circulation in the town in which the property affected is located. Any such published notice shall state that it is a notice to the last owner of record or such owner's surviving spouse, heirs, administrators, assigns, representatives or creditors if he or she is deceased, and shall contain a brief description of the property taken. Notice shall also be given by mailing to such person at his or her last-known address, by registered or certified mail, a copy of such notice. If, after a search of the land and probate records, the address of any interested party cannot be found, an affidavit stating such facts and reciting the steps taken to establish the address of any such person shall be filed with the clerk of the court and accepted in lieu of service of such notice by mailing the same to the last-known address of such person. Upon filing an assessment with the clerk of the court, the commissioner shall forthwith sign and file for record with the town clerk of the town in which such real property is located a certificate setting forth the fact of such taking, a description of the real property so taken and the names and residences of the owners from whom it was taken. Upon the filing of such certificate, title to such real property in fee simple shall vest in the state of Connecticut, except that, if it is so specified in such certificate, a lesser estate, interest or right shall vest in the state. The commissioner shall permit the last owner of record of such real property upon which an owner-occupied residence or owner-operated business is situated to remain in such residence or operate such business, rent free, for a period of ninety days after the filing of such certificate.\n\n(c) The commissioner may purchase any land and take a deed thereof in the name of the state when such land is needed in connection with the layout, construction, repair, reconstruction or maintenance of any state highway or bridge, and any land or buildings or both, necessary, in the commissioner's opinion, for the efficient accomplishment of the foregoing purpose, and may further, when the commissioner determines that it is in the best interests of the state, purchase, lease or otherwise arrange for the acquisition or exchange of land or buildings or both for such purpose. The commissioner, with the advice and consent of the Attorney General, may settle and compromise any claim by any person, firm or corporation claiming to be aggrieved by such layout, construction, reconstruction, repair or maintenance by the payment of money, the transfer of other land acquired for or in connection with highway purposes, or otherwise. The commissioner shall permit the last owner of record of such real property upon which an owner-occupied residence or owner-operated business is situated to remain in such residence or operate such business, rent free, for a period of ninety days from the filing of such deed.\n\n(d) The commissioner may purchase or take in the name of the state any land, buildings, interest in land, easements or other rights he finds necessary for the layout, construction, maintenance or use of roads or bridges authorized by section 13a-5, under the provisions of this title relating to the purchase and taking of land for state highways. Any person aggrieved by any such action of the commissioner shall have the same rights of appeal as provided in this title in relation to the taking of land by the commissioner for highway purposes.\n\n(e) The commissioner may take any land (1) which is necessary for the construction of any ditch, drain, gutter or other structure which is required for the purpose of draining any state highway; or (2) which is required for the purpose of preserving any historical monument or memorial, the removal of which is made necessary by the construction or reconstruction of a state highway. The commissioner may assess benefits and damages caused by any such construction and for the taking of any such land under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section and sections 13a-74, 13a-76, 13a-77 and 13a-78 and any person aggrieved by the assessment of any such benefits or damages shall be entitled to the relief provided for in said sections.\n\n(f) The commissioner may take or purchase rights of access to and egress from land abutting any highway or land taken or purchased as right-of-way therefor, or any other highway for the purpose of protecting the functional characteristics of any state highway or state highway appurtenances or safety of the traveling public to and from any state highway or state highway appurtenances when in his judgment such limitation of access is necessary to permit the convenient, safe and expeditious flow of traffic. Such taking or purchase shall be in the same manner and with like powers as authorized and exercised by said commissioner in taking or purchasing real property for state highway purposes.\n\n(g) When the Commissioner of Transportation finds it necessary that real property, the title to which is in the state of Connecticut and which is under the custody and control of any state department, commission or institution, be taken for the purpose of drainage, construction, alteration, reconstruction, improvement, relocation, widening and change of grade of any highway to be constructed under his supervision, he shall petition the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management that custody of such real property be transferred to him as Commissioner of Transportation. Such petition shall set forth the necessity for such transfer and control. The Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management shall present such petition to the department, commission or institution having custody and control of such real property, and, upon the recommendation of, and subject to such consideration as may be required by, such department, commission or institution and with the approval of the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, such department, commission or institution shall transfer the custody and control of such real property to the Commissioner of Transportation for the purposes required.\n\n(h) All sales or exchanges of surplus property by the Department of Transportation and matters dealing with the initial acquisition of any existing mass transit system or the purchase or sale of real properties acquired in connection with any state highway system or mass transit system shall be subject to review and approval of the State Properties Review Board except that those acquisitions and administrative settlements relating to such properties which involve sums not in excess of ten thousand dollars shall be reported to the board by the Commissioner of Transportation but shall not be subject to such review and approval. The Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management shall be informed for inventory purposes of any transfer effectuated in connection with this section.

If such committee finds that the construction or maintenance of such a bridge without a draw will not materially interfere with the navigation of such water, such committee, after giving at least five days' notice in the manner prescribed for the service of legal process to all persons owning wharves, docks or wharf privileges above such bridge, may assess the damages which the construction of such bridge without a draw will cause to the owners of such wharf or wharf privileges and, if the committee finds that the total amount of such damages, if paid by the town in which such bridge is located, will be more economical for such town than the construction or maintenance of such bridge with a draw, such bridge may be maintained, built or constructed without a draw, after the amount of damages so found has been paid to the parties entitled to the same or has been deposited in the town treasury subject to their order; and the amount of such damages shall be paid by the town in which the bridge is located, as a part of the expense of building or maintaining such highway or bridge. All persons interested in such wharves or wharf privileges shall be entitled to all of the privileges by way of remonstrance and reestimate of damages which are provided in part III of this chapter for persons interested in laying out or altering a highway.

Such equitable share, in the case of or in connection with the construction or reconstruction of any limited access highway, shall be the entire cost, less the deductions provided in this section, and, in the case of or in connection with the construction or reconstruction of any other state highway, shall be such portion or all of the entire cost, less the deductions provided in this section, as may be fair and just under all the circumstances, but shall not be less than fifty per cent of such cost after the deductions provided in this section. In establishing the equitable share of the cost to be borne by the state, there shall be deducted from the cost of the readjusted, relocated or removed facilities a sum based on a consideration of the value of materials salvaged from existing installations, the cost of the original installation, the life expectancy of the original facility and the unexpired term of such life use. When any facility is removed from the right-of-way of a public highway to a private right-of-way, the state shall not pay for such private right-of-way, provided, when a municipally owned facility is thus removed from a municipally owned highway, the state shall pay for the private right-of-way needed by the municipality for such relocation. If the commissioner and the company, corporation or municipality owning or operating such facility cannot agree upon the share of the cost to be borne by the state, either may apply to the superior court for the judicial district within which such highway is situated, or, if said court is not in session, to any judge thereof, for a determination of the cost to be borne by the state, and said court or such judge, after causing notice of the pendency of such application to be given to the other party, shall appoint a state referee to make such determination. Such referee, having given at least ten days' notice to the parties interested of the time and place of the hearing, shall hear both parties, shall view such highway, shall take such testimony as such referee deems material and shall thereupon determine the amount of the cost to be borne by the state and immediately report to the court. If the report is accepted by the court, such determination shall, subject to right of appeal as in civil actions, be conclusive upon both parties.\n\n(1953, 1955, S. 1201d; 1957, P.A. 576, S. 1; 1958 Rev., S. 13-124; 1963, P.A. 226, S. 126; 1967, P.A. 671; P.A. 76-133; P.A. 78-280, S. 2, 127; P.A. 82-472, S. 36, 183; P.A. 94-188, S. 7; P.A. 03-115, S. 33; P.A. 05-210, S. 28; P.A. 06-196, S. 278; P.A. 07-242, S. 56; P.A. 11-80, S. 9.)\n\nHistory: 1963 act replaced previous provisions: See title history; 1967 act clarified provisions by adding references to construction or reconstruction of highways and added proviso re payment of relocation right-of-way costs for municipally-owned facilities removed from municipally-owned highway; P.A. 76-133 included community antenna television companies in definition of “public service facility”; P.A. 78-280 substituted “judicial district” for “county”; P.A. 82-472 corrected reference to superior court; P.A. 94-188 redefined “public service facility”; P.A. 03-115 made technical changes; P.A. 05-210 added exception providing that the state shall not bear any share of cost of project to readjust, relocate or remove facility used for transmitting electricity and that electric distribution company may provide alternatives, and if department does not agree, then department and chairperson of the Department of Public Utility Control shall jointly determine alternative for project, effective July 6, 2005; P.A. 06-196 made a technical change, effective June 7, 2006; P.A. 07-242 amended section to provide that state shall not bear any share of the cost of a project “of an electric distribution company, as defined in section 16-1” re any facility used as an electric “transmission” trunkline, effective June 4, 2007; P.A. 11-80 changed “Department of Public Utility Control” to “Public Utilities Regulatory Authority”, effective July 1, 2011.\n\nCited. 206 C. 65.",

Defective highway claim based on design of Route 44 across Avon Mountain barred by sovereign immunity because it failed to state a cause of action under section. Id., 197. Waiver of sovereign immunity under section extends to the actions of state employees other than those employed by the commissioner, but only to the extent that they are performing duties related to highway maintenance and plaintiff proves that a relationship exists between the commissioner and the state employee such that the commissioner can be found to have breached his statutory duty to keep the highways, bridges, or sidewalks in repair. 330 C. 400.\n\nCited. 4 CA 30; 5 CA 121; Id., 663; Id., 695; 6 CA 300; 7 CA 561; 8 CA 169; 12 CA 449; 18 CA 677; 21 CA 516; Id., 633; 23 CA 198; Id., 735; 25 CA 67; Id., 217; Id., 421; judgment reversed, see 222 C. 299; 26 CA 74; Id., 407; 27 CA 439; judgment reversed, see 225 C. 782; Id., 734; 28 CA 449; 29 CA 565; judgment reversed, see 228 C. 358; Id., 791; 30 CA 594; 31 CA 752; 33 CA 65; 36 CA 211; 37 CA 551; 44 CA 597; Id., 651. Court found that plaintiff's notice sufficiently identified the location of her fall so as to permit commissioner to gather information about the allegedly defective condition and that the issue of adequacy of plaintiff's notice was a question of fact for the jury. 70 CA 21. It is plaintiff's burden to prove each of the elements under statute, and failure to prove any element will preclude a finding of liability under statute. 72 CA 64. Phrase “place of its occurrence” refers to prior phrase “such injury”, and therefore it is the place of injury that must be described in required notice; the legal standard is not the exact geodetic place of injury; however, that standard is not satisfied when the place of injury is described as two distinct places. 78 CA 796; judgment reversed, see 273 C. 1. Plaintiff's notice of claim is insufficient because it fails to specify the precise nature of the claimed defect; it is not enough that defendant knows the exact location of the defect when the precise nature of the defect is unspecified and the complaint cannot be considered in conjunction with the notice because the complaint was filed beyond the 90-day period set forth in section. 132 CA 750. Court lacks jurisdiction to hear claim against state where notice informed commissioner only of suit against town. 142 CA 785. A claim related to an alleged defect in the plan pursuant to which a highway was constructed, rather than a claim that a defect in such plan or design resulted in an otherwise actionable hazard that was in or near the roadway and which actually obstructed travel, is precluded. Id., 826. Plaintiff failed to satisfy statutory requirement where the notice to defendant provided locations of defects that either did not exist or could not have been geographically accurate. 152 CA 560. An assessment of whether defendant's response to notice of highway defect was reasonable is a fact-specific determination and depends on many different factors, some of which may be unique to each case. 168 CA 570; judgment reversed in part, see 330 C. 400. Actual notice to the state police of a highway defect constitutes actual notice to defendant, which occurs when state police first learn of the defect, not the later time when they report that defect to defendant or the department. Id. Section unambiguously waives sovereign immunity for defective highway claims based upon the neglect or default of the commissioner, the state and any state employees, at least when performing duties related to highway maintenance, and it does not limit or restrict its scope to department employees only. Id.\n\nRecovery in action brought under former statute limited to $10,000. 1 CS 136. Responsibility of third person to perform duty of state is no defense in suit against the state; it is only the remedy of the state in a suit against third persons. 5 CS 259. Cited. 7 CS 95.

Commencement of action not an alternative to giving notice. 17 CS 419.

Defect not too slight as matter of law to justify an award of damages; where hole was made and maintained by state, failure of city to repair was not sole proximate cause. Id., 686. Bottle of syrup on walk for 45 minutes does not warrant finding of constructive notice. Id., 694. Whether a condition of highway constitutes defect must be determined in each case upon the basis of its particular circumstances. 135 C. 469.

If certain portions of street are devoted to purpose other than travel, travelers leaving way provided for them and attempting to cross such reserved portions may not assume such portions are free from danger or unusual conditions. 148 C. 349. Ordinarily, the length of time a defect in a sidewalk must exist in order to charge a municipality with notice of its existence is a question of fact; defect must have existed for such a length of time that the city was charged with notice of it and had a reasonable opportunity to remedy the defect. Id., 548. What constitutes defect discussed. 150 C. 514. Where statutory notice relied solely on accumulated water, as distinguished from snow and ice, as the claimed defective condition and cause of the accident, and plaintiff testified that he actually lost control of his car on a film of ice, he cannot recover from the city. 151 C. 343.

Section does not bar an employer from seeking reimbursement under Sec. 31-293(a). 231 C. 370. Cited. 235 C. 408; 240 C. 105. In order for liability to obtain under section, defendant must have notice of an actual defect and not merely notice of potential defects or conditions likely to create a defect. 246 C. 638. Section invoked where plaintiff tripped on a portion of a steel sign post that had been cut off just above ground level while disembarking from bus that had stopped approximately 7 feet from the broken post; section is not void for vagueness as applied to facts of case. 255 C. 330. When town clerk's office is closed on the 90th day on which notice can be filed, it is sufficient to file notice on the next day on which the office is open; a party does not fail to give notice simply because the notice addresses the wrong name as town clerk. Id., 693. Sole proximate case doctrine precludes municipal liability where plaintiff is contributorily negligent and where other tortfeasors or independent nontortious factors contributed to the injury; therefore statute does not provide a right to indemnification. 258 C. 56. Under section, the focus with respect to the element of sole proximate cause is whether any factors other than municipality's breach of its statutory duty caused plaintiff's injury. Id., 574. Inaccurate notice under section is not, by itself, fatal to plaintiff's claim; the savings clause operates to protect plaintiffs from having their claims barred by reason of a vague, indefinite or inaccurate notice of accident location. 262 C. 787. Manner in which defect is created has no bearing on municipal liability under section and municipal liability was imposed where defect in highway created by third-party contractor was sole proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries. 292 C. 364. If injury complained of was caused by a highway defect on town road, plaintiff's only recourse against town is to pursue a claim under this section pursuant to the exclusivity provision of Sec. 52-557n(a)(1)(C), and plaintiff cannot maintain a separate nuisance action against town. 304 C. 298. Whether driveway upon which plaintiff was driving was public, thereby falling within the purview of section, or whether it was a private thoroughfare, thereby falling within the purview of Sec. 52-557n, is a question of fact to be determined by the trial court. 315 C. 606. Given that depressions in a roadway, potholes, are highway defects, it logically follows that an uncovered, open manhole, as a matter of law is also a highway defect. 346 C. 487.\n\nIn action pursuant to section, costs may be taxed against a defendant municipality. 4 CA 30. Savings clause of section must be pleaded and evidence introduced to prove its elements. Id., 315.

Notice provisions discussed. 47 CA 365. Walkway deemed to be road or bridge since it was on public property leading from city street to public school and there was reasonable anticipation that the public would make use of it. Id., 734. Plaintiff could not prevail on claim that because section contains its own limitation period, court improperly relied on Sec. 52-584, which is applicable to negligence cases in general; trial court properly determined statute of limitations was not tolled during plaintiff's illness because this section contains no such tolling provision. 48 CA 60. Notice requirement not met where plaintiff's letter of notice did not arrive at town clerk's office until after the 90th day and where addressee on the letter was not a person employed in clerk's office or known to town clerk. 58 CA 191. Savings clause does not extend time requirement for delivery of notice. 67 CA 464. Plaintiff bears burden of proving delivery and actual receipt of notice. 72 CA 766. Notice by plaintiff's attorney that was received by town clerk more than 90 days from date of claimed injury and e-mail sent from plaintiff's supervisor to supervisor of a community center did not meet notice requirements of highway defect statute in order to invoke subject matter jurisdiction. 96 CA 387. Because there was no factual dispute that access to a transfer station was restricted and was, therefore, not open to the public, the court properly determined plaintiff's claim did not fall within the purview of the defective highway statute. 110 CA 657. Section and Sec. 13a-144 are not irreconcilably in conflict and do not prevent plaintiff from recovering from either state or municipal governmental entity if municipal employees caused a defect on a state highway because liability depends on existence of a defect, not the underlying causes which produced it. 116 CA 28. Failure to comply with Sec. 14-300c(a) demonstrated negligence on the part of plaintiff and precluded recovery under this section. 119 CA 724. Trial court properly concluded that plaintiff's claim fell within the purview of section and granted defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to comply with section's notice requirement because an improperly positioned storm drain cover located on a sidewalk is a defect in the highway and the facts admitted to in the pleadings name the defendant as the party bound to keep the property at issue in repair; highway defect statute is a legislative exception to the immunity of municipalities at common law and must be strictly construed. 125 CA 149. Common-law negligence is not applicable in a highway defect case; notice must be given under section and provide a general description of injuries sustained. 139 CA 487. Allegation that municipal road was unsafe for public travel because of a condition of the road caused by town's construction project is sufficient to satisfy pleading requirements of section, regardless of whether the claim is brought specifically under section. 143 CA 249. Because town defendants can only be held liable pursuant to section, and section requires that town defendants' conduct be sole proximate cause of damages alleged in order for liability to attach, any negligence on the part of third party negates possibility of relief from town defendants on theory of common-law indemnification. 147 CA 650. Where plaintiff exercises due care, failure to see sidewalk defect does not render plaintiff contributorily negligent. 148 CA 186. A public nuisance claim may not be brought independently of section when plaintiff's claim for damages against a municipality resulted from an injury sustained by means of a defective municipal road. 150 CA 805. Whether notice was sufficient under the savings clause was a question of law for the court. 157 CA 528.\n\nWhat is sufficient notice. 2 CS 41; 14 CS 365; 18 CS 330; 19 CS 43.
