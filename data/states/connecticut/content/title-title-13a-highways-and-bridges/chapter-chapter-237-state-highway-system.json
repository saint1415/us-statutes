Connection between local traffic and through traffic lanes shall be provided at intervals in the discretion of the commissioner.\n\n(b) Construction. The commissioner shall, upon direction by the General Assembly, lay out and construct any state highway as a parkway or freeway. Said commissioner, prior to such construction, shall submit to the General Assembly the following information concerning such construction of any parkway or freeway: The approximate cost of the parkway or freeway and a definite route with an official map showing the towns through which it will pass. The commissioner shall not alter the route submitted except with the advice and approval of the Governor and the Attorney General, and changes therein shall not be approved until a public hearing or hearings are held at which the towns affected and their residents may be heard.\n\n(c) Service highways. As an adjunct of any parkway or freeway, the commissioner is authorized to lay out and construct highways and drives, to be designated as service highways, to provide access from areas adjacent to a parkway or freeway and to provide for the restriction or elimination of cross traffic on such parkway or freeway, when he deems the same to be necessary in the public interest.\n\n(d) Acquisition of land. The commissioner may purchase or take any real property or rights in real property necessary or required for the construction, alteration, extension, widening, change of grade or improvement of such parkways, freeways or service highways in the same manner as is provided in the general statutes in the case of state highways. The provisions of the general statutes relating to state highways not inconsistent with the provisions of this section shall apply to parkways, freeways and service highways.\n\n(e) Alteration. The commissioner, with the advice and approval of the Governor and the Attorney General, may alter the layout or construction or use of any such authorized parkway or freeway, or designated portions thereof, when, in their opinion, such change would be in the interests of public convenience, safety and necessity.\n\n(f) Vehicle use of Wilbur Cross Parkway and Merritt Parkway.
