On or before the date of the expiration of the term of each administrative law judge or upon the occurrence of a vacancy in the office of any administrative law judge for any reason, the Governor shall nominate a competent person to fill that office. Subsequent to July 1, 1993, each person nominated by the Governor to serve as an administrative law judge shall have been a member in good standing of the Connecticut bar for at least five years preceding the nomination, provided the Governor shall not be precluded from renominating an individual who has previously served as an administrative law judge. The administrative law judges shall, upon nomination by the Governor, be appointed by the General Assembly as prescribed by law. They shall serve for a term of five years, but may be removed by impeachment. The Governor shall from time to time select one of the sixteen administrative law judges to serve as chairperson of the Workers' Compensation Commission at the pleasure of the Governor. The administrative law judge selected by the Governor to be chairperson shall have previously served as an administrative law judge in this state for at least one year.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, on and after October 1, 1988, any administrative law judge whose term expires on December thirty-first shall continue to serve until the next succeeding March thirty-first.\n\n(c) Each nomination made by the Governor to the General Assembly for an administrative law judge shall be referred, without debate, to the committee on the judiciary, which shall report thereon within thirty legislative days from the time of reference, but no later than seven legislative days before the adjourning of the General Assembly. Each appointment by the General Assembly of an administrative law judge shall be by concurrent resolution. The action on the passage of each such resolution in the House and in the Senate shall be by vote taken on the electrical roll-call device. No resolution shall contain the name of more than one nominee. The Governor shall, within five days after he has notice that any nomination for an administrative law judge made by him has failed to be approved by the affirmative concurrent action of both houses of the General Assembly, make another nomination to such office.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4-19, no vacancy in the position of an administrative law judge shall be filled by the Governor when the General Assembly is not in session unless, prior to such filling, the Governor submits the name of the proposed vacancy appointee to the committee on the judiciary. Within forty-five days, the committee on the judiciary may, upon the call of either chairperson, hold a special meeting for the purpose of approving or disapproving such proposed vacancy appointee by majority vote. The Governor shall not administer the oath of office to such proposed vacancy appointee until the committee has approved such proposed vacancy appointee. If the committee determines that it cannot complete its investigation and act on such proposed vacancy appointee within such forty-five-day period, it may extend such period by an additional fifteen days. The committee shall notify the Governor in writing of any such extension. Failure of the committee to act on such proposed vacancy appointee within such forty-five-day period or any fifteen-day extension period shall be deemed to be an approval.\n\n(e) Each administrative law judge shall be sworn to a faithful performance of his duties. After notice and public hearing the Governor may remove any administrative law judge for cause and the good of the public service. Each administrative law judge shall devote his full time to the duties of his office and shall not be otherwise gainfully employed.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 7435; 1958 Rev., S. 31-140; 1961, P.A. 491, S. 2; April, 1964, P.A. 3, S. 1; February, 1965, P.A. 577, S. 1; 1969, P.A. 662, S. 3; 1971, P.A. 639, S. 2; P.A. 80-414, S. 2; P.A. 83-353, S. 2; P.A. 84-320, S. 2, 6; 84-546, S. 154, 173; P.A. 85-420, S. 2, 4; P.A. 87-301; P.A. 88-125; 88-184, S. 2, 3; P.A. 91-339, S. 2, 55; June Sp.

All rights and claims between an employer who complies with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section and employees, or any representatives or dependents of such employees, arising out of personal injury or death sustained in the course of employment are abolished other than rights and claims given by this chapter, provided nothing in this section shall prohibit any employee from securing, by agreement with his employer, additional compensation from his employer for the injury or from enforcing any agreement for additional compensation.\n\n(b) Each employer who does not furnish to the chairperson of the Workers' Compensation Commission satisfactory proof of his solvency and financial ability to pay directly to injured employees or other beneficiaries compensation provided by this chapter shall insure his full liability under this chapter, other than his liability for assessments pursuant to sections 31-345 and 31-354 in one of the following ways: (1) By filing with the Insurance Commissioner in form acceptable to him security guaranteeing the performance of the obligations of this chapter by the employer; or (2) by insuring his full liability under this part, exclusive of any liability resulting from the terms of section 31-284b, in any stock or mutual companies or associations that are or may be authorized to take such risks in this state; or (3) by any combination of the methods provided in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection as he may choose, subject to the approval of the Insurance Commissioner. If the employer fails to comply with the requirements of this subsection, an employee may bring an action against such employer for damages on account of personal injury sustained by such employee arising out of and in the course of his employment or on account of death resulting from personal injury so sustained, except that there shall be no liability under this section to an individual on the part of the employer if such individual held himself out to the employer as an independent contractor and the employer, in good faith, relied on that representation as well as other indicia of such status and classified such individual as an independent contractor.

The employer shall be required during the ten-year period to insure his full liability under this part, exclusive of any liability resulting from the terms of section 31-284b, in any stock or mutual companies or associations that are or may be authorized to take such risks in this state.

As used in this section, “income” means all forms of remuneration to an individual from his employment, including wages, accident and health insurance coverage, life insurance coverage and employee welfare plan contributions and “employee welfare plan” means any plan established or maintained for employees or their families or dependents, or for both, for medical, surgical or hospital care benefits.\n\n(b) An employer may provide such equivalent accident and health or life insurance coverage or welfare plan payments or contributions by: (1) Insuring his full liability under this section in any stock or mutual companies or associations that are or may be authorized to take such risks in this state; (2) creating an injured employee's plan as an extension of any existing plan for working employees; (3) self-insurance; or (4) by any combination of the methods provided in subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, of this subsection that he may choose.\n\n(c) In the case of an employee welfare plan, an employer may provide equivalent protection by making payments or contributions for such hours of contributions established by the trustees of the employee welfare plan as necessary to maintain continuation of such insurance coverage when the amount is less than the amount of regular hourly or weekly contributions for full-time employees.\n\n(d) In any case where compensation payments to an individual for total incapacity under the provisions of section 31-307 continue for more than one hundred four weeks, the cost of accident and health insurance or life insurance coverage after the one-hundred-fourth week shall be paid out of the Second Injury Fund in accordance with the provisions of section 31-349.\n\n(e) Accident and health insurance coverage may include, but shall not be limited to, coverage provided by insurance or directly by the employer for the following health care services: Medical, surgical, dental, nursing and hospital care and treatment, drugs, diagnosis or treatment of mental conditions or alcoholism, and pregnancy and child care.\n\n(P.A. 82-398, S. 3; P.A. 86-403, S. 99, 132; P.A. 91-32, S. 8, 41; 91-339, S. 12.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 86-403 made technical change in Subsec.

      "text": "(a) When any injury for which compensation is payable under the provisions of this chapter has been sustained under circumstances creating in a person other than an employer who has complied with the requirements of subsection (b) of section 31-284, a legal liability to pay damages for the injury, the injured employee may claim compensation under the provisions of this chapter, but the payment or award of compensation shall not affect the claim or right of action of the injured employee against such person, but the injured employee may proceed at law against such person to recover damages for the injury; and any employer or the custodian of the Second Injury Fund, having paid, or having become obligated to pay, compensation under the provisions of this chapter may bring an action against such person to recover any amount that he has paid or has become obligated to pay as compensation to the injured employee. If the employee, the employer or the custodian of the Second Injury Fund brings an action against such person, he shall immediately notify the others, in writing, by personal presentation or by registered or certified mail, of the action and of the name of the court to which the writ is returnable, and the others may join as parties plaintiff in the action within thirty days after such notification, and, if the others fail to join as parties plaintiff, their right of action against such person shall abate unless the employer, insurance carrier or Second Injury Fund gives written notice of a lien in accordance with this subsection. In any case in which an employee brings an action against a party other than an employer who failed to comply with the requirements of subsection (b) of section 31-284, in accordance with the provisions of this section, and the employer is a party defendant in the action, the employer may join as a party plaintiff in the action. The bringing of any action against an employer shall not constitute notice to the employer within the meaning of this section. If the employer and the employee join as parties plaintiff in the action and any damages are recovered, the damages shall be so apportioned that the claim of the employer, as defined in this section, shall take precedence over that of the injured employee in the proceeds of the recovery, after the deduction of reasonable and necessary expenditures, including attorneys' fees, incurred by the employee in effecting the recovery. If the action has been brought by the employee, the claim of the employer shall be reduced by one-third of the amount of the benefits to be reimbursed to the employer, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, which reduction shall inure solely to the benefit of the employee, except that such reduction shall not apply if the reimbursement is to the state of Connecticut or a political subdivision of the state including a local public agency, as the employer, or the custodian of the Second Injury Fund. The rendition of a judgment in favor of the employee or the employer against the party shall not terminate the employer's obligation to make further compensation which the administrative law judge thereafter deems payable to the injured employee. If the damages, after deducting the employee's expenses as provided in this subsection, are more than sufficient to reimburse the employer, damages shall be assessed in his favor in a sum sufficient to reimburse him for his claim, and the excess shall be assessed in favor of the injured employee. No compromise with the person by either the employer or the employee shall be binding upon or affect the rights of the other, unless assented to by him. For the purposes of this section, the claim of the employer shall consist of (1) the amount of any compensation which he has paid on account of the injury which is the subject of the suit, and (2) an amount equal to the present worth of any probable future payments which he has by award become obligated to pay on account of the injury. The word “compensation”, as used in this section, shall be construed to include incapacity payments to an injured employee, payments to the dependents of a deceased employee, sums paid out for surgical, medical and hospital services to an injured employee, the burial fee provided by subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 31-306, payments made under the provisions of sections 31-312 and 31-313, and payments made under the provisions of section 31-284b in the case of an action brought under this section by the employer or an action brought under this section by the employee in which the employee has alleged and been awarded such payments as damages. Each employee who brings an action against a party in accordance with the provisions of this subsection shall include in his complaint (A) the amount of any compensation paid by the employer or the Second Injury Fund on account of the injury which is the subject of the suit, and (B) the amount equal to the present worth of any probable future payments which the employer or the Second Injury Fund has, by award, become obligated to pay on account of the injury. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, when any injury for which compensation is payable under the provisions of this chapter has been sustained under circumstances creating in a person other than an employer who has complied with the requirements of subsection (b) of section 31-284, a legal liability to pay damages for the injury and the injured employee has received compensation for the injury from such employer, its workers' compensation insurance carrier or the Second Injury Fund pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the employer, insurance carrier or Second Injury Fund shall have a lien upon any judgment received by the employee against the party or any settlement received by the employee from the party, provided the employer, insurance carrier or Second Injury Fund shall give written notice of the lien to the party prior to such judgment or settlement.\n\n(b) When an injury for which compensation is payable under the provisions of this chapter is determined to be the result of a motor vehicle accident or other accident or circumstance in which a third person other than the employer was negligent and the claim is subrogated by the employer or its workers' compensation insurance carrier, the insurance carrier shall provide a rate adjustment to the employer's workers' compensation policy to reflect the recovery of any compensation paid by the insurance carrier prior to subrogation.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, no construction design professional who is retained to perform professional services on a construction project, or any employee of a construction design professional who is assisting or representing the construction design professional in the performance of professional services on the site of the construction project, shall be liable for any injury on the construction project for which compensation is payable under the provisions of this chapter, unless responsibility for safety practices is specifically assumed by contract. The immunity provided by this subsection to any construction design professional shall not apply to the negligent preparation of design plans or specifications. For the purposes of this subsection “construction design professional” means (1) any person licensed as an architect under the provisions of chapter 390, (2) any person licensed, or exempted from licensure, as an engineer under the provisions of chapter 391, or (3) any corporation organized to render professional services through the practice of either or both of such professions in this state.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the furnishing of or the failure to furnish safety inspections or safety advisory services (1) by an insurer incident to providing workers' compensation insurance to an employer, (2) pursuant to a contract providing for safety inspections or safety advisory services between an employer and a self-insurance service organization incident to providing workers' compensation related services or (3) by a union representing employees of the employer, shall not subject the insurer or self-insurance service organization or their agents or employees, or the union, its members or the members of its safety committee, to third party liability for damages for injury, death or loss resulting therefrom unless the liability arises from a breach of a duty of fair representation of its members by a union. The immunity from liability extended under this subsection shall not be extended to any insurer or self-insurance service organization other than where the immunity is incident to the provision of workers' compensation insurance or workers' compensation related services.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 7425; 1949, 1951, S. 3040d; 1958 Rev., S. 31-156; 1961, P.A. 491, S. 15; 1967, P.A. 692, S. 4; 842, S. 27; P.A. 86-266, S. 1; P.A. 90-145; P.A. 91-32, S. 9, 41; 91-191, S. 2, 3; P.A. 93-228, S. 7, 35; P.A. 96-65, S. 2; P.A. 11-205, S. 1; P.A. 21-18, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: 1961 act entirely replaced previous provisions; 1967 acts allowed employer to be party plaintiff in cases where employee brings an action against a third party, specified that bringing action against employer does not constitute notice and increased burial fee from $500 to $1,000; P.A. 86-266 added Subsec.

Notice of claim for compensation may be given to the employer or any administrative law judge and shall state, in simple language, the date and place of the accident and the nature of the injury resulting from the accident, or the date of the first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease and the nature of the disease, as the case may be, and the name and address of the employee and of the person in whose interest compensation is claimed. An employee of the state shall send a copy of the notice to the Commissioner of Administrative Services. An employee of a municipality shall send a copy of the notice to the town clerk of the municipality in which he or she is employed. An employer, other than the state or a municipality, may opt to post a copy of where notice of a claim for compensation shall be sent by an employee in the workplace location where other labor law posters required by the Labor Department are prominently displayed. In addition, an employer, opting to post where notice of a claim for compensation by an employee shall be sent, shall forward the address of where notice of a claim for compensation shall be sent to the Workers' Compensation Commission and the commission shall post such address on its Internet web site. An employer shall be responsible for verifying that information posted at a workplace location is consistent with the information posted on the commission's Internet web site. If an employee, other than an employee of the state or a municipality, opts to mail to his or her employer the written notice of a claim for compensation required under the provisions of this section, such written notice shall be sent by the employee to the employer in accordance with section 31-321. As used in this section, “manifestation of a symptom” means manifestation to an employee claiming compensation, or to some other person standing in such relation to him that the knowledge of the person would be imputed to him, in a manner that is or should be recognized by him as symptomatic of the occupational disease for which compensation is claimed.\n\n(b) Whenever liability to pay compensation is contested by the employer, he shall file with the administrative law judge, on or before the twenty-eighth day after he has received a written notice of claim, a notice in accord with a form prescribed by the chairperson of the Workers' Compensation Commission stating that the right to compensation is contested, the name of the claimant, the name of the employer, the date of the alleged injury or death and the specific grounds on which the right to compensation is contested. The employer shall send a copy of the notice to the employee in accordance with section 31-321. If the employer or his legal representative fails to file the notice contesting liability on or before the twenty-eighth day after he has received the written notice of claim, the employer shall commence payment of compensation for such injury or death on or before the twenty-eighth day after he has received the written notice of claim, but the employer may contest the employee's right to receive compensation on any grounds or the extent of his disability within one year from the receipt of the written notice of claim, provided the employer shall not be required to commence payment of compensation when the written notice of claim has not been properly served in accordance with section 31-321 or when the written notice of claim fails to include a warning that (1) the employer, if he has commenced payment for the alleged injury or death on or before the twenty-eighth day after receiving a written notice of claim, shall be precluded from contesting liability unless a notice contesting liability is filed within one year from the receipt of the written notice of claim, and (2) the employer shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the compensability of the alleged injury or death unless the employer either files a notice contesting liability on or before the twenty-eighth day after receiving a written notice of claim or commences payment for the alleged injury or death on or before such twenty-eighth day. An employer shall be entitled, if he prevails, to reimbursement from the claimant of any compensation paid by the employer on and after the date the administrative law judge receives written notice from the employer or his legal representative, in accordance with the form prescribed by the chairperson of the Workers' Compensation Commission, stating that the right to compensation is contested. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, an employer who fails to contest liability for an alleged injury or death on or before the twenty-eighth day after receiving a written notice of claim and who fails to commence payment for the alleged injury or death on or before such twenty-eighth day, shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the compensability of the alleged injury or death. If an employer has opted to post an address of where notice of a claim for compensation by an employee shall be sent, as described in subsection (a) of this section, the twenty-eight-day period set forth in this subsection shall begin on the date when such employer receives written notice of a claim for compensation at such posted address.\n\n(c) Failure to provide a notice of claim under subsection (a) of this section shall not bar maintenance of the proceedings if there has been a hearing or a written request for a hearing or an assignment for a hearing within a one-year period from the date of the accident or within a three-year period from the first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease, as the case may be, or if a voluntary agreement has been submitted within the applicable period, or if within the applicable period an employee has been furnished, for the injury with respect to which compensation is claimed, with medical or surgical care as provided in section 31-294d. No defect or inaccuracy of notice of claim shall bar maintenance of proceedings unless the employer shows that he was ignorant of the facts concerning the personal injury and was prejudiced by the defect or inaccuracy of the notice. Upon satisfactory showing of ignorance and prejudice, the employer shall receive allowance to the extent of the prejudice.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, a dependent or dependents of a deceased employee seeking compensation under section 31-306 who was barred by a final judgment in a court of law from filing a claim arising out of the death of the deceased employee, whose date of injury was between June 1, 1991, and June 30, 1991, and whose date of death was between November 1, 1992, and November 30, 1992, because of the failure of the dependent to timely file a separate death benefits claim, shall be allowed to file a written notice of claim for compensation not later than one year after July 8, 2005, and the administrative law judge shall have jurisdiction to determine such dependent's claim.\n\n(P.A. 91-32, S. 11, 41; 91-339, S. 47, 55; P.A. 93-228, S. 8, 35; 93-419, S. 8, 9; P.A. 05-230, S. 2; P.A. 16-112, S. 1; P.A. 17-141, S. 1; P.A. 21-18, S. 1; P.A. 22-89, S. 2.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 91-339 amended Subsec.

(b) to add provision re, if employer has opted to post address of where notice of claim shall be sent, 28 day period shall begin when employer receives written notice of claim; pursuant to P.A. 21-18, “commissioner” was changed editorially by the Revisors to “administrative law judge” throughout, effective October 1, 2021; P.A. 22-89 made technical changes in Subsecs. (a) and (b) and in Subsec. (a) deleted “by certified mail” and added reference to Sec. 31-321, effective May 24, 2022.\n\nCited. 228 C. 1; 231 C. 529; 232 C. 780; 237 C. 1; 239 C. 19. Workers' compensation legislation is remedial and should be broadly construed to accomplish its humanitarian purpose; where workers' compensation appeal involves issue of statutory construction that has not been subjected to judicial scrutiny, Supreme Court has plenary power to review the administrative decision. 252 C. 596. HIV is an occupational disease for correction officers who are members of emergency response units which are special teams of correction officers that respond to major disturbances and riots, and, therefore plaintiff's notice of claim was timely filed under statute; HIV is peculiar to and distinctively associated with decedent's occupation as a correction officer in an emergency response unit because of the direct causal connection between the specific duties of his employment, which required him to interact with inmates with a high HIV infection rate and in a manner that greatly increased the risk of contracting HIV and the AIDS the decedent contracted. 268 C. 753. Fact that an occupational disease cannot be qualified as such until a causal connection with exposure at employee's workplace can be established compels the conclusion that such a connection is a prerequisite to commencement of the statute of limitations for making a claim for an occupational disease. 280 C. 723. For purposes of section, commissioner must determine whether plaintiff's repetitive trauma injury more closely resembles “an accidental injury” or “occupational disease”. 296 C. 463. For purposes of determining limitation period, claim brought pursuant to Sec. 7-433c was properly treated as one for accidental injury definitely located in time and place, rather than a repetitive trauma injury, because plaintiff failed to present evidence that hypertension was causally connected to employment; formal diagnosis of hypertension or heart disease, communicated to an employee by his or her physician, constitutes the “injury” that triggers the running of the limitation period. 299 C. 265. Evidence that claimant had elevated blood pressure readings, or had been advised by physician to monitor blood pressure, is insufficient to trigger one year filing period under section, rather there must be evidence that claimant knew he or she suffered from hypertension, ordinarily shown by proof claimant was informed of diagnosis by a medical professional. 302 C. 755. Hypertension diagnosis is sufficient to trigger 1-year filing period and prescription of hypertension medication is not required. Id., 767. Board's imposition of 1-year statute of limitations for filing of survivor's benefits improper when a valid claim has previously been filed by either the employee or a representative; plaintiff was not required to file a separate timely notice of claim for survivor's benefits when decedent, during his lifetime, had filed a timely notice of claims for benefits that was accepted and paid. 320 C. 299. An estate is not a legal representative capable of bringing a claim under this section or any other under this chapter. 323 C. 26.\n\nCited. 38 CA 1; Id., 73; 44 CA 465. Employer's first report of injury form and an attorney's letter taken together meet statutory requirement of written notice of claim. 52 CA 194. Workers' compensation review board properly concluded that, under the totality of the circumstances, completion of accident investigation form by defendant's fire department indicating that plaintiff had been transported to the hospital for high blood pressure, plaintiff's filing of first report of injury for high blood pressure with defendant's workers' compensation division and the employer's investigative report prepared by defendant's workers' compensation division for defendant's controller's office constituted “substantial compliance” with notice requirements. 63 CA 570. Does not require that notice of injury by employee include statutory reference. 70 CA 321. Partially completed form 30C, which was not signed by employee and did not include a description of employee's injury, delivered to supervisor was sufficient to trigger employer's responsibility to file form 43; rule of strict compliance is not supported by either the plain language or legislative history. 127 CA 619.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nCited. 239 C. 408; 240 C. 788; 242 C. 570. Notice of claim for repetitive trauma injury is sufficient to support a motion to preclude if it provides adequate information as to period of time over which the injury is alleged to have occurred sufficient to allow employer to make timely investigation of the claim. 252 C. 596. Service on employer of amended complaint in third party action and employer's acknowledgment that it “may” become obligated to pay benefits to plaintiff are not sufficient to establish that employer had actual notice of plaintiff's intent to seek survivor's benefits as a result of decedent's death. 265 C. 525. Statute of limitations in Subsec. applies to all potential claims of employee's estate or his dependents and requires that a compensable claim be filed within the applicable limitations period, irrespective of whether initial claim is filed by the employee, the employee's estate after his death, or the decedent employee's dependents; proviso is not a condition precedent for commencement of dependents' claims, but rather a modified limitations period for commencement of such claims. 283 C. 813. Statute of limitations implicates commissioner's subject matter jurisdiction, and a subject matter jurisdictional statute of limitations may not be waived and court may address it sua sponte. 299 C. 800.\n\nCited. 40 CA 446; 42 CA 803; 44 CA 465; 45 CA 707. “Accident” and “occupational disease” must be read broadly enough so that even an injury that is defined as stemming from repetitive trauma under Sec. 31-275(8) may be deemed to fall into one of the two categories. 56 CA 90. Without timely written notice of claim, commissioner lacks subject matter jurisdiction over such claim. 68 CA 590. Separate notice of claim not required when dependent pursues derivative claim for death benefit. 71 CA 140. If the employee dies within 2 years of the accident or the first manifestation of symptoms of an occupational disease and the employee's dependent is filing a claim for benefits, the dependent has 2 years to file a claim for benefits or has 1 year from the date of the employee's death, whichever is longer. 137 CA 665. Because it was reasonable for Workers' Compensation Commissioner to determine that form 30c was filed on behalf of decedent's widow and sufficiently put defendants on notice of plaintiff's claim for survivor benefits, and because the savings provision of section cautions against arbitrary dismissal of plaintiff's claim, the claim was timely filed and the commissioner had subject matter jurisdiction over it. 150 CA 699. With respect to the notice of claim requirement, the proper inquiry is not whether defendant had notice of plaintiff's injuries and intent to pursue a claim, but rather whether plaintiff met the statutory requirements to give commission jurisdiction over his claim. 156 CA 700.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\nCited. 241 C. 692. Notice to contest liability must state both date of alleged injury and specific reasons for contesting compensation. 252 C. 596. Compensability, in terms of whether a type of injury falls within scope of act, is a jurisdictional fact that would allow employer to contest liability beyond the time frame allotted by Subsec.; hence, because emotional impairment claimed by plaintiff does not fall within scope of act, commissioner and board initially properly denied plaintiff's motion to preclude defendants from contesting liability. 270 C. 532. P.A. 93-228 did not alter status quo that if employer neither timely pays nor timely contests liability, conclusive presumption of compensability attaches and employer is barred from contesting employee's right to receive compensation on any ground or extent of employee's disability. 286 C. 102. Where payment for claim is not commenced or liability is not contested within the period required by statute, employer cannot challenge proof of claim but commissioner is not barred from further inquiry. 291 C. 537. To afford the word “file” its ordinary meaning under Subsec., it is plain and unambiguous that a notice of intention to contest compensation must be delivered, not just mailed, to the administrative law judge on or before the twenty-eighth day after the employer received written notice of claim. 349 C. 1.\n\nCited. 30 CA 295; 40 CA 446. Employer not precluded from challenging commissioner's subject matter jurisdiction; issue of compensability of an injury does not implicate commissioner's subject matter jurisdiction and, accordingly, statutory presumption of liability cannot be circumvented. 64 CA 1. Does not implicate insurer's right to raise defense of lack of coverage against an employer. 67 CA 361. Conclusive presumption of compensability for a workers' compensation claim under Subsec. is not an unconstitutional denial of employer's right to due process. 127 CA 619. Employer who was making payments for plaintiff's prior injury was precluded from contesting liability on subsequent claim when it failed to file notice to contest liability or commence making payments on subsequent claim for alleged new and separate injury, with a reported date and type of injury different from the earlier claimed injury, and any claim by employer that payment on new claim would result in plaintiff's double recovery should have been raised in a notice to contest liability. 137 CA 324. Sending notice to contest liability to employee by certified mail meets requirements, despite employee's failure to claim it; notice to contest liability stating employee did not suffer an injury which arose out of or in the course of employment is not a general denial and therefore meets requirements for valid notice to contest liability; notice to contest liability form stating date of employee's injury differently than stated by employee on claim form did not render notice insufficient because date of injury stated by employer fell within the time period of claimed repetitive injury stated by employee. 138 CA 826. Employer not deemed conclusively precluded from contesting extent of disability under Subsec. when it was impossible to commence payment of compensation within statutory time period. 145 CA 261. Employer's disclaimer citing “lack of medical evidence” to support causal connection between injury and employment met specific notice requirement. 159 CA 180. The equitable doctrine of laches does not apply to a motion to preclude filed under section and, in the absence of legislative action, there is no recognized time limitation within which an employee must file a motion to preclude. 168 CA 92. “Safe harbor” only applies when employer is contesting extent of employee's injury, and does not apply to employer who is contesting liability; employer contesting liability must strictly comply with filing requirements of Subsec. 190 CA 623. With respect to the commence payment predicate, the initial burden belongs to the employer. 198 CA 854.\n\nSubsec. (c):\n\nMedical care exception does not apply to toll statute of limitations under Sec. 7-433c because plaintiff failed to establish, in keeping with board's time-tested interpretation of Subsec., that employer previously furnished medical care for specific condition or later claimed condition was causally related to timely reported incident for which employer furnished medical care. 304 C. 571.\n\nEmployer's insurer's payment of medical bills during 1-year period constituted the furnishing of medical treatment. 47 CA 530. Employee's claim was not time barred because he failed to file notice of claim that specifically referenced all of his injuries. 48 CA 357.\n\nSubsec. (d):\n\nTrial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction in concluding that Subsec. constitutes a public emolument in violation of Sec. 1. of state constitution. 299 C. 800.",

The administrative law judge shall, as part of the written award, inform the employee or the employee's dependent, as the case may be, of any rights the individual may have to an annual cost-of-living adjustment or to participate in a rehabilitation program administered by the Department of Aging and Disability Services under the provisions of this chapter. The administrative law judge shall retain the original findings and award in said administrative law judge's office. If no appeal from the decision is taken by either party within twenty days thereafter, such award shall be final and may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment of the Superior Court. The court may issue execution upon any uncontested or final award of an administrative law judge in the same manner as in cases of judgments rendered in the Superior Court; and, upon the filing of an application to the court for an execution, the administrative law judge in whose office the award is on file shall, upon the request of the clerk of said court, send to the clerk a certified copy of such findings and award. In cases where, through the fault or neglect of the employer or insurer, adjustments of compensation have been unduly delayed, or where through such fault or neglect, payments have been unduly delayed, the administrative law judge may include in the award interest at the rate prescribed in section 37-3a and a reasonable attorney's fee in the case of undue delay in adjustments of compensation and may include in the award in the case of undue delay in payments of compensation, interest at twelve per cent per annum and a reasonable attorney's fee. Payments not commenced within thirty-five days after the filing of a written notice of claim shall be presumed to be unduly delayed unless a notice to contest the claim is filed in accordance with section 31-297. In cases where there has been delay in either adjustment or payment, which delay has not been due to the fault or neglect of the employer or insurer, whether such delay was caused by appeals or otherwise, the administrative law judge may allow interest at such rate, not to exceed the rate prescribed in section 37-3a, as may be fair and reasonable, taking into account whatever advantage the employer or insurer, as the case may be, may have had from the use of the money, the burden of showing that the rate in such case should be less than the rate prescribed in section 37-3a to be upon the employer or insurer. In cases where the claimant prevails and the administrative law judge finds that the employer or insurer has unreasonably contested liability, the administrative law judge may allow to the claimant a reasonable attorney's fee. No employer or insurer shall discontinue or reduce payment on account of total or partial incapacity under any such award, if it is claimed by or on behalf of the injured person that such person's incapacity still continues, unless such employer or insurer notifies the administrative law judge and the employee of such proposed discontinuance or reduction in the manner prescribed in section 31-296 and the administrative law judge specifically approves such discontinuance or reduction in writing. The administrative law judge shall render the decision within fourteen days of receipt of such notice and shall forward to all parties to the claim a copy of the decision not later than seven days after the decision has been rendered. If the decision of the administrative law judge finds for the employer or insurer, the injured person shall return any wrongful payments received from the day designated by the administrative law judge as the effective date for the discontinuance or reduction of benefits. Any employee whose benefits for total incapacity are discontinued under the provisions of this section and who is entitled to receive benefits for partial incapacity as a result of an award, shall receive those benefits commencing the day following the designated effective date for the discontinuance of benefits for total incapacity. In any case where the administrative law judge finds that the employer or insurer has discontinued or reduced any such payment without having given such notice and without the administrative law judge having approved such discontinuance or reduction in writing, the administrative law judge shall allow the claimant a reasonable attorney's fee together with interest at the rate prescribed in section 37-3a on the discontinued or reduced payments.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 7449; 1951, S. 3049d; 1958 Rev., S. 31-176; 1961, P.A. 491, S. 22; 1967, P.A. 692, S. 1; 842, S. 10; P.A. 75-122; P.A. 79-80; P.A. 83-114, S. 2; P.A. 84-180, S. 2; 84-299, S. 3; P.A. 85-64, S. 1, 2; P.A. 88-106, S. 3; P.A. 89-17; 89-316, S. 1; P.A. 91-339, S. 19; P.A. 93-228, S. 13, 35; P.A. 01-22, S. 3; P.A. 11-44, S. 49; June 12 Sp.

Failure to take an appeal within the 20 day appeal limitation in Subsec. deprives board of subject matter jurisdiction, a defect which may be raised at any time. 299 C. 346. Sec. 31-355(b) is inapplicable for purposes of determining when appeal period begins to run under Subsec. re Second Injury Fund claim because the fund had already been participating in proceedings before Workers' Compensation Commission. Id., 376. Appellate Court improperly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction for lack of a final judgment in matter in which defendant challenged commissioner's initial finding of plaintiff's total disability, but after remand by the board to commissioner, did not challenge commissioner's subsequent findings and award specifying amounts to be paid to plaintiff. 303 C. 238.\n\nCited. 33 CA 495. Proper interpretation of limitation period contained in section is that 10-day period begins to run on day on which party wanting appeal is sent meaningful notice of commissioner's decision. 36 CA 298.

Notice must be sent directly to plaintiff, not plaintiff's attorney, in order for appeal period to commence. 51 CA 92. Appeal taken from a supplemental order directing the Second Injury Fund to compensate plaintiff is not a timely appeal challenging the findings and awards preceding that order if that appeal was taken outside the mandated 20 days from the issuing of the operative finding and award. 114 CA 58. The time limitation on an appeal from the finding and award of commissioner imposed by Subsec. does not deprive the appellate tribunal of subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal. Id., 81; judgment reversed, see 299 C. 346.\n\nSubsec. (c):\n\nIt is implicit in statutory authority to reverse a decision of the trial commissioner that board may remand a case for a new hearing; legislature did not intend to impose unstated limitations on review board's discretion to order appropriately adjudicated new hearings. 251 C. 153.\n\nCited. 34 CA 673.\n\nSubsec.

If there is no one wholly or partially dependent upon the deceased employee, the burial expenses shall be paid to the person who assumes the responsibility of paying the funeral expenses.\n\n(2) To those wholly dependent upon the deceased employee at the date of the deceased employee's injury, a weekly compensation equal to seventy-five per cent of the average weekly earnings of the deceased calculated pursuant to section 31-310, after such earnings have been reduced by any deduction for federal or state taxes, or both, and for the federal Insurance Contributions Act made from such employee's total wages received during the period of calculation of the employee's average weekly wage pursuant to said section 31-310, as of the date of the injury but not more than the maximum weekly compensation rate set forth in section 31-309 for the year in which the injury occurred or less than twenty dollars weekly. (A) The weekly compensation rate of each dependent entitled to receive compensation under this section as a result of death arising from a compensable injury occurring on or after October 1, 1977, shall be adjusted annually as provided in this subdivision as of the following October first, and each subsequent October first, to provide the dependent with a cost-of-living adjustment in the dependent's weekly compensation rate as determined as of the date of the injury under section 31-309.

The difference between the amount of any benefits that would have been paid to such dependent if such benefits had been subject to such recalculation and the actual amount of benefits paid during the period between such injury and such recalculation shall be paid to the dependent not later than December 1, 1997, in a lump-sum payment. The employer or its insurer shall be reimbursed by the Second Injury Fund, as provided in section 31-354, for adjustments, including lump-sum payments, payable under this subparagraph for deaths from compensable injuries occurring on or after July 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1997, upon presentation of any vouchers and information that the Treasurer shall require. No claim for payment of retroactive benefits may be made to the Second Injury Fund more than two years after the date on which the employer or its insurer paid such benefits in accordance with this subparagraph.

As of October 1, 1977, the weekly compensation rate paid prior to October 1, 1977, to the dependent shall be increased by twenty-five per cent. The partial cost-of-living adjustment provided under this subdivision shall be paid by the employer without any order or award from the administrative law judge. In addition, on each October first, the weekly compensation rate of each dependent as of October 1, 1990, shall be increased by the percentage of the increase in the maximum compensation rate over the maximum compensation rate of October 1, 1990, as determined under the provisions of section 31-309 existing on October 1, 1977. The cost of the adjustments shall be paid by the employer or its insurance carrier who shall be reimbursed for such cost from the Second Injury Fund as provided in section 31-354 upon presentation of any vouchers and information that the Treasurer shall require. No claim for payment of retroactive benefits may be made to the Second Injury Fund more than two years after the date on which the employer or its insurance carrier paid such benefits in accordance with this subparagraph.\n\n(3) If the surviving spouse is the sole presumptive dependent, compensation shall be paid until death or remarriage.\n\n(4) If there is a presumptive dependent spouse surviving and also one or more presumptive dependent children, all of which children are either children of the surviving spouse or are living with the surviving spouse, the entire compensation shall be paid to the surviving spouse in the same manner and for the same period as if the surviving spouse were the sole dependent. If, however, any of the presumptive dependent children are neither children of the surviving spouse nor living with the surviving spouse, the compensation shall be divided into as many parts as there are presumptive dependents. The shares of any children having a presumptive dependent parent shall be added to the share of the parent and shall be paid to the parent. The share of any dependent child not having a surviving dependent parent shall be paid to the father or mother of the child with whom the child may be living, or to the legal guardian of the child, or to any other person, for the benefit of the child, as the administrative law judge may direct.\n\n(5) If the compensation being paid to the surviving presumptive dependent spouse terminates for any reason, or if there is no surviving presumptive dependent spouse at the time of the death of the employee, but there is at either time one or more presumptive dependent children, the compensation shall be paid to the children as a class, each child sharing equally with the others. Each child shall receive compensation until the child reaches the age of eighteen or dies before reaching age eighteen, provided the child shall continue to receive compensation up to the attainment of the age of twenty-two if unmarried and a full-time student, except any child who has attained the age of twenty-two while a full-time student but has not completed the requirements for, or received, a degree from a postsecondary educational institution shall be deemed not to have attained age twenty-two until the first day of the first month following the end of the quarter or semester in which the child is enrolled at the time, or if the child is not enrolled in a quarter or semester system, until the first day of the first month following the completion of the course in which the child is enrolled or until the first day of the third month beginning after such time, whichever occurs first. When a child's participation ceases, such child's share shall be divided among the remaining eligible dependent children, provided if any child, when the child reaches the age of eighteen years, is physically or mentally incapacitated from earning, the child's right to compensation shall not terminate but shall continue for the full period of incapacity.\n\n(6) In all cases where there are no presumptive dependents, but where there are one or more persons wholly dependent in fact, the compensation in case of death shall be divided according to the relative degree of their dependence. Compensation payable under this subdivision shall be paid for not more than three hundred and twelve weeks from the date of the death of the employee. The compensation, if paid to those wholly dependent in fact, shall be paid at the full compensation rate. The compensation, if paid to those partially dependent in fact upon the deceased employee as of the date of the injury, shall not, in total, be more than the full compensation rate nor less than twenty dollars weekly, nor, if the average weekly sum contributed by the deceased at the date of the injury to those partially dependent in fact is more than twenty dollars weekly, not more than the sum so contributed.\n\n(7) When the sole presumptive dependents are, at the time of the injury, nonresident aliens and the deceased has in this state some person or persons who are dependent in fact, the administrative law judge may in the administrative law judge's discretion equitably apportion the sums payable as compensation to the dependents.\n\n(b) The dependents of any deceased employee who was injured on or after January 1, 1974, and who subsequently dies shall be paid compensation on account of the death retroactively to the date of the employee's death. The cost of the payment or adjustment shall be paid by the employer or its insurance carrier who shall be reimbursed for such cost from the Second Injury Fund as provided in section 31-354 upon presentation of any vouchers and information that the Treasurer shall require.\n\n(c) (1) The dependents of any deceased employee who was injured between January 1, 1952, and December 31, 1973, and who subsequently dies, shall be paid compensation on account of the death retroactively to the date of the employee's death. The cost of the payment or adjustment shall be paid by the employer or its insurance carrier who shall be reimbursed for such cost from the Second Injury Fund as provided in section 31-354 upon presentation of any vouchers and information that the Treasurer shall require. No claim for payment of retroactive benefits may be made to the Second Injury Fund more than two years after the date on which the employer or its insurance carrier paid such benefits in accordance with this subdivision.\n\n(2) The dependents of any deceased employee who was injured before January 1, 1952, and who died on or before October 1, 1991, shall be paid compensation on account of the death retroactively to the date of the employee's death. The cost of the payment or adjustment shall be paid by the employer or its insurance carrier who shall be reimbursed for such cost from the Second Injury Fund as provided in section 31-354 upon presentation of any vouchers and information that the Treasurer shall require. No claim for payment of retroactive benefits may be made to the Second Injury Fund more than two years after the date on which the employer or its insurance carrier paid such benefits in accordance with this subdivision.\n\n(d) The dependents of any deceased employee who was injured in an accident arising out of and in the course of employment before January 1, 1952, and who died, as a result of those injuries, after October 1, 1991, shall be paid compensation, under the provisions of this section, effective as of the date of death of any such employee. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the weekly compensation rate for such dependents shall equal the amount of compensation the injured employee was receiving prior to death pursuant to section 31-307. Such weekly compensation rate shall hereafter be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section. The cost of such payment or adjustment shall be paid by the employer or the insurance carrier of such employer who shall be reimbursed for such cost from the Second Injury Fund provided for in section 31-354. No claim for payment of retroactive benefits may be made to the Second Injury Fund more than two years after the date on which the employer or its insurance carrier paid such benefits in accordance with this subsection.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 7428, 7429; 1949, 1951, 1953, 1955, S. 3042d; 1957, P.A. 463, S. 1; 1958 Rev., S. 31-159, 31-160; 1959, P.A. 580, S. 5, 22; 1961, P.A. 491, S. 29; 1967, P.A. 842, S. 12, 13; P.A. 77-554, S. 1; P.A. 78-369; P.A. 80-124, S. 2; 80-284, S. 2; 80-329; P.A. 84-453; P.A. 88-92; P.A. 89-68, S. 1; P.A. 91-32, S. 21, 41; 91-339, S. 25; P.A. 92-31, S. 4, 7; May Sp.

(a) and raised weekly compensation allowed in Subsec. (b) from 60% to 66.66% of deceased's average weekly earnings; P.A. 77-554 increased burial payments to $1,500 and deleted requirement that death must have occurred within six years of date of injury or first manifestation of occupational disease symptoms in Subsec.

(c) to allow compensation to widows and widowers on same basis where previously widowers' payments terminated after 312 weeks; P.A. 78-369 reorganized Subsecs., designating former Subsecs.

(c) providing for the payment of compensation to dependents of deceased employees who were injured on or after January 1, 1974, and who died not later than December 31, 1981; P.A. 91-32 deleted existing Subsec. (a) which had detailed persons to be considered wholly dependent on a deceased employee, relettering remaining Subsecs. accordingly and made technical changes; P.A. 91-339 changed the weekly compensation allowed in Subsec. (a)(2) from 66.66% of average weekly earnings to 80% of average weekly earnings reduced by deductions for federal taxes and FICA; P.A. 92-31 amended Subsec. (a)(1) to provide that burial expenses shall be paid in any case where the employee died on or after October 1, 1988, amended Subsec. (a)(2) to provide that cost-of-living increases shall be calculated using a percentage instead of a dollar amount, and amended Subsec. (b) to authorize the payment of compensation to dependents of deceased employees who died not later than November 1, 1991; May Sp. Sess. P.A. 92-11 added Subsec. (c) (Revisor's note: A reference to “second injury and compensation assurance fund” was changed editorially by the Revisors to read “second injury fund” for consistency with section 38 of public act 91-32); P.A. 93-228 amended Subsec. (a)(2) to decrease weekly compensation benefits for dependents of deceased employee from 80% to 75% of deceased's average weekly earnings, to require that state taxes be deducted in calculating such earnings, and to eliminate cost-of-living adjustments for dependents of deceased employees injured on or after July 1, 1993, effective July 1, 1993; P.A. 97-205 amended Subsec.

(c) as Subsec. (d), making a technical change therein, effective July 6, 2001; P.A. 05-199 amended Subsecs. (a), (c) and (d) to require claims for payment of retroactive benefits to be made to Second Injury Fund not more than two years after payment by employer or insurer, effective July 1, 2006; pursuant to P.A. 21-18, “commissioner” and “commissioner's” were changed editorially by the Revisors to “administrative law judge” and “administrative law judge's” respectively in Subsec.(a)(2), (4) and (7), effective October 1, 2021; June Sp. Sess. P.A. 21-2 amended Subsec. (a)(1) to increase compensation for burial expenses for deaths after June 23, 2021, to $12,000, to adjust compensation for burial expenses on January 1, 2022, and thereafter, based on the percentage increase of a certain consumer price index and to delete a reference to $4,000, effective June 23, 2021.\n\nStatus of dependent in fact involves three factual elements: (1) Reliance on contributions of decedent for necessary living expenses, (2) a reasonable expectation that the contributions will continue, (3) an absence of sufficient means at hand for meeting these expenses; the first two are fixed at the time of injury and consequently the measure of dependence in Sec. 31-315 can change from that existing at the time of the injury only if there is a subsequent change in the financial resources of the claimant. 152 C. 481. Where commissioner found claimant was partial dependent at time of injury but subsequently received sufficient funds from other sources to supply her present necessities, commissioner correctly concluded that, although claimant was dependent in fact at time of injury, her “measure of dependence” had changed before the time of the hearing and consequently defendants were relieved from paying compensation to her unless and until she showed a further change in circumstances; an award to a dependent in fact as well as to a presumptive dependent is an award of compensation and subject to modification under Sec. 31-315. Id., 481, 482. Question of dependency is one of fact not subject to review unless ascertained through an illegal standard or based on no evidence. 156 C. 245.

Testimony of even the most persuasive expert witness cannot be credited if it is not based on facts, and therefore decision of board affirming commissioner's award of benefits to widow reversed because there were insufficient subordinate facts to support medical witness's opinion that decedent's death was causally related to the compensable injury or to remove the cause of death from the realm of conjecture. 99 CA 336.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nCited. 206 C. 242. Subdiv. (2)(A) does not require Second Injury Fund to reimburse municipal employer for cost-of-living adjustments paid in connection with a claim for benefits under Heart and Hypertension Act in Sec. 7-433c, which benefits are special compensation and are not workers compensation benefits for purposes of reimbursement, and such a result does not deny employers a protected property interest without due process of law. 269 C. 763. Subdiv. (4): Superseding cause doctrine applies under Workers' Compensation Act, and board properly found that superseding events broke chain of proximate causation between decedent's compensable work injuries and his death. 305 C. 360.\n\nSubdiv. (2)(A): Formula devised in 239 C. 676 for calculating cost of living increases to total disability benefits also applies to calculation of cost of living increases to survivors' benefits under Subdiv. from October 1, 1995, through June 30, 1998. 63 CA 370. Subdiv. (4): Decedent's death, which resulted from an accidental overdose of medication, is not compensable under section because there was no evidence to establish that decedent's depression and subsequent prescription for the medication which caused the overdose were related to his compensable injuries. 123 CA 18; judgment affirmed on alternate grounds, see 305 C. 360. Where decedent was a truck driver who was paid for his work, in material part, on the basis of the miles he drove for his employer, commissioner could not reasonably determine the significance of the state's relationship to or interest in that employment relationship as it relates to dependent benefits under Subsec. without making findings as to and considering the miles decedent drove to, through and back from the state in performing his assigned work; decision re dependent benefits under Subsec. may not be based on facts that are demonstrably irrelevant to the issue of whether the state had a sufficiently significant relationship with decedent's employment relationship with defendant. 145 CA 805.",

If the maximum weekly compensation rate as determined under the provisions of section 31-309, to be effective as of any October first following the date of the injury, is greater than the maximum weekly compensation rate prevailing as of the date of the injury, the weekly compensation rate which the injured employee was entitled to receive at the date of the injury or October 1, 1990, whichever is later, shall be increased by the percentage of the increase in the maximum weekly compensation rate required by the provisions of section 31-309 from the date of the injury or October 1, 1990, whichever is later, to such October first. The cost-of-living increases provided under this subsection shall be paid by the employer without any order or award from the administrative law judge. The adjustments shall apply to each payment made in the next succeeding twelve-month period commencing with the October first next succeeding the date of the injury.\n\n(b) The weekly compensation rate of each employee entitled to receive compensation under section 31-307 as a result of an injury sustained prior to October 1, 1969, which has disabled the employee for a period extending to October 1, 1969, or thereafter shall be adjusted as of October 1, 1969, and annually thereafter, as provided in this subsection to provide the injured employee with a partial cost-of-living adjustment in his or her weekly compensation rate. The weekly compensation rate paid prior to October 1, 1969, to the injured employee shall be increased as of October 1, 1969, by the amount that the maximum weekly compensation rate as determined under section 31-309 to be effective for injuries sustained on or after October 1, 1969, is greater than the maximum weekly compensation rate as determined under section 31-309 to be effective for injuries sustained on or after October 1, 1965, or the date of the injury, whichever is later, but not more than fifteen dollars per week. Thereafter, increases, if any, for cost-of-living as provided in subsection (a) of this section shall be added to the amount of weekly compensation payable as of the date of the injury or October 1, 1990, whichever is later. The partial cost-of-living adjustments provided under this subsection shall be paid by the employer without any order or award from the administrative law judge. The adjustments shall apply to each payment made in the next twelve-month period, on or after October 1, 1969. The cost of the adjustments shall be paid by the employer or the employer's insurance carrier who shall be reimbursed therefor from the Second Injury Fund as provided in section 31-354 upon presentation of any vouchers and information that the Treasurer shall require. No claim for payment of retroactive benefits may be made to the Second Injury Fund more than two years after the date on which the employer or its insurance carrier paid such benefits in accordance with this subsection.\n\n(c) On and after October 1, 1997, the weekly compensation rate of each employee entitled to receive compensation under section 31-307 as a result of an injury sustained on or after July 1, 1993, which totally incapacitates the employee permanently, shall be adjusted as provided in this subsection as of October 1, 1997, or the October first following the injury date, whichever is later, and annually on each subsequent October first, to provide the injured employee with a cost-of-living adjustment in his or her weekly compensation rate as determined as of the date of injury under section 31-309. If the maximum weekly compensation rate, as determined under the provisions of said section 31-309, to be effective as of any October first following the date of the injury, is greater than the maximum weekly compensation rate prevailing as of the date of injury, the weekly compensation rate which the injured employee was entitled to receive as of the date of injury shall be increased by the percentage of the increase in the maximum weekly compensation rate required by the provisions of said section 31-309 from the date of the injury to such October first. The cost-of-living adjustments provided under this subdivision shall be paid by the employer without any order or award from the administrative law judge. The adjustments shall apply to each payment made in the next succeeding twelve-month period commencing with October 1, 1997, or the October first next succeeding the date of injury, whichever is later. With respect to any employee receiving benefits on October 1, 1997, with respect to any such injury occurring on or after July 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1997, or with respect to any employee who was adjudicated to be totally incapacitated permanently subsequent to the date of his or her injury or is totally incapacitated permanently due to the fact that the employee has been totally incapacitated by such an injury for a period of five years or more, such benefit shall be recalculated to October 1, 1997, to the date of such adjudication or to the end of such five-year period, as the case may be, as if such benefits had been subject to recalculation annually under the provisions of this subsection. The difference between the amount of any benefits which would have been paid to such employee if such benefits had been subject to such recalculation and the actual amount of benefits paid during the period between such injury and such recalculation shall be paid to the dependent not later than December 1, 1997, or thirty days after such adjudication or the end of such period, as the case may be, in a lump-sum payment. The employer or the employer's insurer shall be reimbursed by the Second Injury Fund, as provided in section 31-354, for adjustments, including lump-sum payments, payable under this subsection for compensable injuries occurring on or after July 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1997, upon presentation of any vouchers and information that the Treasurer shall require.

I, Sec. 20, of state constitution because it does not involve either a fundamental right or a suspect class, and because rational justification can be found for constructing a statute such that the loss or permanent partial disability of many organs and body parts is compensable, but permanent partial disability of the skin is not. 248 C. 793.

If evidence of exact loss of earnings is not available, such loss may be computed from the proportionate loss of physical ability or earning power caused by the injury. The duration of such additional compensation shall be determined upon a similar basis by the administrative law judge, but in no event shall the duration of such additional compensation exceed the lesser of (1) the duration of the employee's permanent partial disability benefits, or (2) five hundred twenty weeks. Additional benefits provided under this section shall be available only to employees who are willing and able to perform work in this state.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, additional benefits provided under this section shall be available only when the nature of the injury and its effect on the earning capacity of an employee warrant additional compensation.\n\n(1967, P.A. 842, S. 25; 1969, P.A. 696, S. 8; P.A. 79-376, S. 76; June Sp.

Sess. P.A. 91-12 changed the additional compensation allowed under this section to 80% of the difference between wages currently earned in a comparable position prior to injury, reduced by deductions for federal taxes and FICA, and the weekly amount earned after the injury, reduced by deductions for federal tax and FICA, but not more than 100% of the average production wage; P.A. 93-228 designated existing language as Subsec. (a) and decreased amount of additional benefits available for permanent partial disability from 80% to 75% of difference between wages currently earned in a comparable position prior to injury, less deductions for state and federal taxes and FICA, and weekly amount earned after injury, less such deductions, and to place limitations on availability and duration of such additional benefits, and added Subsec. (b) to condition availability of additional benefits on nature of injury and its effect on employee's earning capacity, effective July 1, 1993; pursuant to P.A. 21-18, “commissioner” was changed editorially by the Revisors to “administrative law judge” in Subsec.

It appears that in calculating benefits, legislature was not concerned with a broad all-inclusive definition of “earnings”, but intended the formula to reflect the difference between actual wages claimant had earned from his employer before his injury and wages claimant would be able to earn after his injury. 270 C. 1. Because legislature has explicitly provided for an offset mechanism under either Sec. 5-169(g), which governs Tier I retirees, or Sec. 5-192p(d), which governs Tier II retirees, benefits awarded under this section need not be offset by claimant's receipt of state disability retirement benefits.

      "text": "(a) For the purposes of this chapter, the average weekly wage shall be ascertained by dividing the total wages received by the injured employee from the employer in whose service the employee is injured during the fifty-two calendar weeks immediately preceding the week during which the employee was injured, by the number of calendar weeks during which, or any portion of which, the employee was actually employed by the employer, but, in making the computation, absence for seven consecutive calendar days, although not in the same calendar week, shall be considered as absence for a calendar week. When the employment commenced otherwise than at the beginning of a calendar week, that calendar week and wages earned during that week shall be excluded in making the computation. When the period of employment immediately preceding the injury is computed to be less than a net period of two calendar weeks, the employee's weekly wage shall be considered to be equivalent to the average weekly wage prevailing in the same or similar employment in the same locality at the date of the injury except that, when the employer has agreed to pay a certain hourly wage to the employee, the hourly wage so agreed upon shall be the hourly wage for the injured employee and the employee's average weekly wage shall be computed by multiplying the hourly wage by the regular number of hours that is permitted each week in accordance with the agreement. For the purpose of determining the amount of compensation to be paid in the case of a minor under the age of eighteen who has sustained an injury entitling the employee to compensation for total or partial incapacity for a period of fifty-two or more weeks, or to specific indemnity for any injury under the provisions of section 31-308, the administrative law judge may add fifty per cent to the employee's average weekly wage, except in the case of a minor under the age of sixteen, the administrative law judge may add one hundred per cent to the minor's average weekly wage. When the injured employee is a trainee or apprentice receiving a subsistence allowance from the United States because of war service, the allowance shall be added to the injured employee's actual earnings in determining the average weekly wage. Where the injured employee has worked for more than one employer as of the date of the injury and the average weekly wage received from the employer in whose employ the injured employee was injured, as determined under the provisions of this section, are insufficient to obtain the maximum weekly compensation rate from the employer under section 31-309, prevailing as of the date of the injury, the injured employee's average weekly wages shall be calculated upon the basis of wages earned from all such employers in the period of concurrent employment not in excess of fifty-two weeks prior to the date of the injury, but the employer in whose employ the injury occurred shall be liable for all medical and hospital costs and a portion of the compensation rate equal to seventy-five per cent of the average weekly wage paid by the employer to the injured employee, after such earnings have been reduced by any deduction for federal or state taxes, or both, and for the federal Insurance Contribution Act made from such employee's total wages received from such employer during the period of calculation of such average weekly wage, but not less than an amount equal to the minimum compensation rate prevailing as of the date of the injury. The remaining portion of the applicable compensation rate shall be paid from the Second Injury Fund upon submission to the Treasurer by the employer or the employer's insurer of such vouchers and information as the Treasurer may require. For purposes of this subsection, the Second Injury Fund shall not be deemed an employer or an insurer for any claim brought on behalf of an insolvent insurer and shall be exempt from liability, unless such claim is brought not later than thirty days after a determination of such insurer's bankruptcy. No claim for payment of retroactive benefits may be made to the Second Injury Fund more than two years from the date on which the employer or its insurer paid such benefits in accordance with this subsection. In cases which involve concurrent employment and in which there is a claim against a third party, the injured employee or the employer in whose employ the injury was sustained or the employer's insurer shall advise the custodian of the Second Injury Fund if there is a third party claim, and the employee, employer or employer's insurer shall pursue its subrogation rights as provided for in section 31-293 and shall include in its claim all compensation paid by the Second Injury Fund and shall reimburse the Second Injury Fund for all payments made for compensation in the event of a recovery against the third party.\n\n(b) Each August fifteenth, the chairperson of the Workers' Compensation Commission, in consultation with the advisory board, shall publish tables of the average weekly wage and seventy-five per cent of the average weekly wage after being reduced by any deduction for federal or state taxes, or both, and for the federal Insurance Contributions Act, to be effective the following October first, except that not later than June thirtieth, the chairperson, in consultation with the advisory board, shall publish tables of the average weekly wage and seventy-five per cent of the average weekly wage after being reduced by any deduction for federal or state taxes, or both, and for the federal Insurance Contributions Act, to be effective during the period July 1, 1993, to October 1, 1993. Such tables shall be conclusive for the purpose of determining seventy-five per cent of the average weekly earnings of an injured employee after such earnings have been reduced by any deduction for federal or state taxes, or both, and for the federal Insurance Contributions Act made from such employee's total wages received during the period of calculation of the employee's average weekly wage for purposes of sections 31-306, 31-307 and 31-308.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 7432; 1949, S. 3045d; 1958 Rev., S. 31-163; 1961, P.A. 491, S. 33; 1967, P.A. 842, S. 17; 1969, P.A. 696, S. 11; 1971, P.A. 350, S. 1; P.A. 79-376, S. 77; P.A. 91-32, S. 28, 41; 91-339, S. 30, 55; P.A. 93-228, S. 22, 35; P.A. 95-277, S. 2, 19; P.A. 05-199, S. 7; P.A. 21-18, S. 1; P.A. 22-89, S. 24.)\n\nHistory: 1961 act entirely replaced previous provisions; 1967 act added provisions re calculation of and liability for compensation payments when injured employee worked for more than one employer; 1969 act expanded provisions added in 1967 to specify applicability to cases where wages at time of injury would not enable injured employee to receive maximum benefits, to change basis of calculation in such cases, to require that injured person receive at least minimum prevailing rate from employer and dependency allowance if he is totally incapacitated; 1971 act added provisions re third party claims; P.A. 79-376 substituted “worker” for “workman” and rephrased reference to Sec. 31-308; P.A. 91-32 made technical changes; P.A. 91-339 designated existing section as Subsec.

Status of dependent in fact involves three factual elements: (1) Reliance on contributions of decedent for necessary living expenses, (2) a reasonable expectation that the contributions will continue, (3) an absence of sufficient means at hand for meeting these expenses; the first two are fixed at the time of injury and consequently the measure of dependence in section can change from that existing at the time of injury only if there is a subsequent change in the financial resources of claimant. 152 C. 481. Where commissioner found claimant was partial dependent at time of injury but subsequently received sufficient funds from other sources to supply her present necessities, commissioner correctly concluded that, although claimant was dependent in fact at the time of injury, her “measure of dependence” had changed before the time of the hearing and consequently defendants were relieved from paying compensation to her unless and until she showed a further change in circumstances; award to a dependent in fact as well as to a presumptive dependent is award of compensation and subject to modification. Id., 481, 482.

Authority to modify otherwise final awards does not authorize modifications based on changes of law. 244 C. 1. A motion to open or modify was not required under section because commissioner and parties considered application for total incapacity benefits to be the equivalent of such a motion, commissioner applied the applicable standard, there was no showing of prejudice to defendants, and it would violate public policy to deny benefits because of a failure to frame application for total incapacity benefits as a motion to open or modify. 294 C. 564. Commissioner did not have authority to void agreement pursuant to section; discovery that police department was not organized under Sec. 7-274 was not a changed condition of fact but mistake of law not within scope of this section. 296 C. 352.\n\nCited. 26 CA 194; 28 CA 536; 37 CA 648; 45 CA 324. Commissioner lacked authority to modify award because statute does not authorize modifications based on a new interpretation of law and therefore lacked authority to recalculate plaintiff's benefits. 55 CA 789. Commissioner did not have authority to grant Second Injury Fund equitable relief under section to open approved stipulation and schedule approval hearing because there was no evidence that fund was prevented from making a defense by fraud, accident, mistake, surprise or improper management of opposite party. 66 CA 332. Under section, commissioner has same power as a court to open and modify an award. 75 CA 591.",

Such assessments and expenses shall not exceed the budget estimates submitted in accordance with subsection (c) of section 31-280. For each fiscal year, such assessment shall be reduced pro rata by the amount of any surplus from the assessments of prior fiscal years. Said surplus shall be determined in accordance with subdivision (3) of this subsection.

      "text": "(a) For purposes of this section:\n\n(1) “Insured employer” means an employer who insures its risks incurred under this chapter with an insurance company authorized to issue workers' compensation policies in this state by the Insurance Department, and includes any member of a workers' compensation pool administered by an interlocal risk management agency, and on and after January 1, 2005, an employer mutual association organized prior to June 6, 1996, with a membership composed exclusively of health care providers and whose premium base is derived entirely from health care organizations.\n\n(2) “Self-insured employer” means an employer who is approved to self-insure its liabilities under this chapter by the chairperson of the Workers' Compensation Commission. For the period commencing October 1, 2004, and ending December 31, 2004, “self-insured employer” includes an employer mutual association organized prior to June 6, 1996, with a membership composed exclusively of health care providers and whose premium base is derived entirely from health care organizations.\n\n(3) “Paid losses” means the total indemnity, medical and any other expenses, prior to any credits or deductions being taken, paid on or after January 1, 2006, by or on behalf of an employer to or on behalf of an injured employee. Paid losses includes all legal expenses paid for the benefit of an injured worker in accordance with this chapter and any loss payments within deductible limits on workers' compensation policies.\n\n(4) “Second Injury Fund surcharge base” means direct written premium on policies prior to application of any deductible policy premium credits.\n\n(5) “Direct written premium” includes all endorsements, retrospective adjustments, audits and minimum premium and shall be determined without regard to when or whether the premium on the policy is paid.\n\n(6) “Second Injury Fund surcharge” for insurance companies, interlocal risk management agencies and self-insurance groups means the rate set by the custodian multiplied by the Second Injury Fund surcharge base.\n\n(7) “Self-insurance group” means a not-for-profit association consisting of fifteen or more employers who are engaged in the same or similar type of business, who are members of the same bona fide trade or professional association which has been in existence for not less than five years, and who enter into agreements to pool their liabilities for workers' compensation benefits and employers' liability.\n\n(b) The State Treasurer, in consultation with the Insurance Commissioner, may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, regarding the method of assessing all employers for the liabilities of the Second Injury Fund. The liabilities shall be allocated between self-insured employers and insured employers based on a percentage of paid losses for the preceding calendar year for each group. No credits shall be taken against paid losses, except voided checks in connection with expenses paid under this chapter previously reported as a paid loss, recoveries from third party tortfeasors, reimbursement granted pursuant to section 31-299b and Second Injury Fund reimbursements. The method of assessment for self-insured employers shall be based on paid losses. The method of assessment for insured employers, for policies with effective dates before July 1, 2006, shall be based on the standard premium, and for policies with effective dates on or after July 1, 2006, shall be based on the Second Injury Fund surcharge base. In adopting regulations under this section, the State Treasurer shall consider their effect upon (1) the cost of doing business in this state, (2) the overall cost of the workers' compensation system, (3) the effect of the regulations on insurers, insureds and self-insured employers, and (4) the financial condition and liabilities of the fund.\n\n(c) An employer mutual association organized prior to June 6, 1996, with a membership composed exclusively of health care providers and whose premium base is derived entirely from health care organizations may make payments without penalty or interest over a five-year period for any outstanding assessment due from the association for the period commencing January 1, 1996, and ending December 31, 2004.\n\n(d) (1) For insured employers and self-insurance groups, the Second Injury Fund surcharge base shall initially be reported to the fund in the quarter of the effective date of the policy, regardless of when the policy is billed by the insurance carrier or self-insurance group or paid by the policyholder or member of a self-insurance group. All endorsements, retrospective adjustments and audits shall be reported in the quarter processed by the insurance carrier or group self-insured employer.\n\n(2) The custodian of the fund shall conduct an audit or periodic audits of any self-insured employer, group self-insured employer, insured employer or insurance company acting as collection agent of the Second Injury Fund relative to any information or payment required by the custodian. The employer and insurer shall provide all necessary documents and information in relation to an audit by the custodian in a manner prescribed by the Treasurer. The period of review of an audit shall be not more than three years, except that when the date of the previous audit is less than three years prior to such audit, the period of review shall be to the date of such prior audit. If the audit determines repeated errors or underreporting by an employer or an insurer acting as collection agent of the Second Injury Fund, the fund reserves the right to audit an additional two-year review period. Upon the determination of the Treasurer or the Treasurer's agents, as a result of an audit, that an employer or an insurer acting as collection agent of the Second Injury Fund has not properly reported to the Second Injury Fund and, as a result, has underpaid the assessment or surcharge, the employer or the insurer acting as collection agent of the Second Injury Fund, upon notice from the Treasurer or the Treasurer's agent, shall pay the full amount of the underpaid assessment or surcharge, along with interest and any penalty due not later than thirty days after such notice.\n\n(e) For purposes of collection of the Second Injury Fund surcharge from insureds and payment of such surcharge to the Second Injury Fund, insurance companies shall be deemed to be collection agents of the Second Injury Fund. The insured employer is liable for payment of the surcharge, and the insurance company shall collect such payment and remit it to the Second Injury Fund in accordance with section 31-354.

Each employer, other than the state, shall, within thirty days after notice given by the State Treasurer, pay to the State Treasurer for the use of the state a sum in payment of his liability under this chapter which shall be calculated in accordance with the Second Injury Fund surcharge base, as defined in section 31-349g, sections 31-349g, 31-349h and 31-349i, this section, section 31-354b and sections 8 and 9 of public act 96-242*. Such sum shall be an amount sufficient to (1) pay the debt service on state revenue bond obligations authorized to be issued under and for the purposes set forth in section 31-354b including reserve and covenant coverage requirements, (2) provide for costs and expenses of operating the Second Injury Fund, and (3) pay Second Injury Fund stipulations on claims settled by the custodian or other benefits payable out of the Second Injury Fund and not funded through state revenue bond obligations and shall be determined in accordance with the regulations adopted pursuant to the provisions of section 31-349g. The custodian shall establish a factor for the annual surcharge that caps such surcharge for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1996, 1997 and 1998. In determining such factor the custodian shall consider the funding mechanism authorized by sections 31-349g, 31-349h and 31-349i, this section, section 31-354b and sections 8 and 9 of public act 96-242*, recognize that an acceptable level of employer assessment is important to the vitality of the economy of the state and nevertheless shall assure provision of services to injured workers that enhances their ability to return to work and improve their quality of life. In any event, such factor shall not exceed, with respect to insured employers, a rate of fifteen per cent on the Second Injury Fund surcharge base with respect to workers' compensation and employers' liability policies and, with respect to self-insured employers, a comparable percentage limitation representing their pro rata share of any assessment. Any employer or any insurance company acting as collection agent for the custodian of the Second Injury Fund who fails to pay in accordance with such regulations shall pay a penalty to the State Treasurer of fifteen per cent on the unpaid assessment or surcharge or fifty dollars, whichever is greater. Interest at the rate of six per cent per annum shall be charged on any amounts owed on assessment audits or surcharge audits. For self-insured employers interest shall accrue thirty days after notice from the Second Injury Fund of the unpaid audit assessment. For insurance companies, the interest shall accrue from the date of the notice of audit errors or deficiencies as determined by the date postmarked by the United States Postal Service. The State Treasurer shall notify each employer of the penalty or interest provision with the notice of assessment. Any partial payments made to the fund shall be first applied to any unpaid penalty, then to any unpaid interest and the remainder, if any, to the unpaid assessment or surcharge. Interest or penalties shall be applied if assessment or surcharge reports or payments are postmarked by the United States Postal Service after the designated due date. The sums received shall be accounted for separately and apart from all other state moneys and the faith and credit of the state of Connecticut is pledged for their safekeeping. The State Treasurer shall be the custodian of the fund and all disbursements from the fund shall be made by the Treasurer or the Treasurer's deputies. The moneys of the fund shall be invested by the Treasurer in accordance with applicable law and section 8 of public act 96-242*. Interest, income and dividends from the investments shall be credited to the fund. Each employer, each private insurance carrier acting on behalf of any employer and each interlocal risk management agency acting on behalf of any employer shall annually, on or before April first, report to the State Treasurer, in the form prescribed by the State Treasurer, the amount of money expended by or on behalf of the employer in payments for the preceding calendar year. Each private insurance carrier, each self-insurance group and each interlocal risk management agency shall submit annually, on or before April first, to the State Treasurer, in the form prescribed by the State Treasurer, a report of the total Second Injury Fund surcharge base collected in the preceding calendar year and a report of the projected total Second Injury Fund surcharge base for the current calendar year. The fund shall be used to provide the benefits set forth in section 31-306 for adjustments in the compensation rate and payment of certain death benefits, in section 31-307b for adjustments where there are relapses after a return to work, in section 31-307c for totally disabled persons injured prior to October 1, 1953, in section 31-349 for disabled or handicapped employees and in section 31-355 for the payment of benefits due injured employees whose employers or insurance carriers have failed to pay the compensation, and medical expenses required by this chapter, or any other compensation payable from the fund as may be required by any provision contained in this chapter or any other statute and to reimburse employers or insurance carriers for payments made under subsection (b) of section 31-307a. The assessment required by this section is a condition of doing business in this state and failure to pay the assessment, when due, shall result in the denial of the privilege of doing business in this state or to self-insure under section 31-284. Any administrative or other costs or expenses incurred by the State Treasurer in connection with carrying out the provisions of this part, including the hiring of necessary employees, shall be paid from the fund. The State Treasurer may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, prescribing the practices, policies and procedures to be followed in the administration of the Second Injury Fund.\n\n(b) The State Treasurer shall establish within the Second Injury Fund three accounts to be known as the operating account, the settlement account and the finance account which accounts shall be held separate and apart from each other. The operating account shall cover the costs and expenses to the state of operating the Second Injury Fund. The settlement account shall cover actual disbursement of the settled claims whether by one-time full payments or by payments over a period of time. The finance account shall contain such funds and be operated in the manner provided in section 31-354b.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 7494; 1949, 1951, S. 3056d; 1958 Rev., S. 31-221; 1959, P.A. 580, S. 12; 1961, P.A. 491, S. 80; 1967, P.A. 842, S. 21; 1969, P.A. 696, S. 15; 1971, P.A. 351, S. 1; 1972, P.A. 136, S. 1; P.A. 77-119, S. 1; 77-554, S. 2; P.A. 79-376, S. 51; P.A. 81-469, S. 6, 8; P.A. 82-472, S. 110, 183; P.A. 85-189, S. 5; P.A. 86-21; 86-25; P.A. 87-277, S, 1, 4; 87-589, S. 58, 87; P.A. 88-29, S. 1, 2; P.A. 89-68, S. 2; P.A. 90-230, S. 54, 101; 90-311, S. 2, 3; P.A. 91-32, S. 37, 38, 41; 91-339, S. 38, 55; P.A. 93-228, S. 26, 35; 93-429, S. 3, 7; P.A. 95-277, S. 15, 16, 19; P.A. 96-242, S. 6, 10; P.A. 05-199, S. 10; P.A. 10-11, S. 1; P.A. 21-18, S. 6.)\n\n*Note: Sections 8 and 9 of public act 96-242 are special in nature and therefore have not been codified but remain in full force and effect according to their terms.\n\nHistory: 1959 act created second injury and compensation assurance fund and transferred assets of second injury fund to it on October 1, 1959; 1961 act entirely replaced previous provisions; 1967 act required that fund be maintained at $100,000 level rather than $50,000 level; 1969 act required self-insurers to pay 1.5% rather than 1% of their liability payments for preceding year, increased level at which to be maintained to $250,000, specified uses to which fund is to be put and required payment of assessment as a condition of doing business in state; 1971 act made provisions applicable to mutual insurance companies; 1972 act required payment of assessment within 30 days after notice by treasurer rather than “annually on or before July first”, increased payments to not more than 2% of preceding year's liability payments and replaced requirements re $250,000 level to be maintained in fund with provision allowing treasurer to make assessments to cover expenditure and maintain fund at $500,000 level; P.A. 77-119 increased assessment rate to 3.5%; P.A. 77-554 specified that funds be used for adjustments in compensation rate; P.A. 79-376 replaced “workmen's compensation” with “workers' compensation”; P.A. 81-469 provided that the amount of money expended by a carrier in payment of the state's liabilities under this chapter shall be exempted when calculating the payment due under section; P.A. 82-472 made a technical correction; P.A. 85-189 provided that each employer, other than the state and certain municipalities, is liable for assessments levied by the state treasurer to fund the second injury and compensation assurance fund; P.A. 86-21 provided that assessments shall be levied by the state treasurer against employers on whose behalf the second injury fund has made payments pursuant to Sec. 31-355; P.A. 86-25 increased the maximum assessment from 3.5% to 5% and increased the fund's minimum reserve from $500,000 to $1,000,000; P.A. 87-277 added provision re payment from fund of costs or expenses incurred by treasurer in carrying out provisions of part E of chapter 568; P.A. 87-589 changed effective date of P.A. 87-277 from July 1, 1988, to July 1, 1987; P.A. 88-29 added an interest penalty to be imposed on any employer who fails to make payment of an assessment when due to the second injury fund under the Workers' Compensation Act; P.A. 89-68 provided that the fund shall be used to provide the benefits set forth in Sec. 31-306(c); P.A. 90-230 corrected an omission; P.A. 90-311 removed the exemption from payment for municipalities participating in interlocal risk management agencies, effective July 1, 1991; P.A. 91-32 made technical changes; P.A. 91-339 added provisions re payments to the fund by the treasurer on behalf of the state and deleted reference to dependency allowance; P.A. 93-228 raised the amount of money to be contributed to the second injury fund by the state treasurer on behalf of the state from 5% of expenditures to the total amount of expenditures, effective July 1, 1993; P.A. 93-429 authorized the state treasurer to adopt regulations re administrative practices, policies and procedures for the second injury fund, effective July 1, 1993; P.A. 95-277 added a requirement that each private insurance carrier and each interlocal risk management agency annually submit to the Treasurer a report of the total standard earned premium collected in the preceding calendar year, effective June 29, 1995, and replaced provisions detailing funding of Second Injury Fund by employer contributions with provision authorizing Treasurer to develop such policies re determination of employers' contributions through regulations, effective January 1, 1996; P.A. 96-242 made existing language Subsec.

The State Treasurer may enter into contracts that may be useful to the organization, establishment, operation and administration of the account. The finance account shall be funded, first, with state revenue bond proceeds and interest income or income earned on investment of moneys for disbursement purposes and, second, from the special assessment premium surcharges for payment of debt service and reserve requirements. All costs of organizing, establishing and operating the account, including the costs of personnel and contractual services and establishing billing and collection procedures, shall be a charge upon and paid by the State Treasurer from the account unless the State Treasurer otherwise determines to pay such costs from the operating account.\n\n(b) There is established within the finance account (1) a single cost of issuance and finance administration subaccount, (2) a bond proceeds subaccount, and (3) a debt service and reserve subaccount, which subaccounts shall be held separate and apart from each other.

The administrative law judge, on a finding of failure or inability to pay compensation, shall give notice to the Treasurer of the award, directing the Treasurer to make payment from the fund. Whenever liability to pay compensation is contested by the Treasurer, the Treasurer shall file with the administrative law judge, on or before the twenty-eighth day after the Treasurer has received an order of payment from the administrative law judge, a notice in accordance with a form prescribed by the chairperson of the Workers' Compensation Commission stating that the right to compensation is contested, the name of the claimant, the name of the employer, the date of the alleged injury or death and the specific grounds on which the right to compensation is contested. A copy of the notice shall be sent to the employee. The administrative law judge shall hold a hearing on such contested liability at the request of the Treasurer or the employee in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. If the Treasurer fails to file the notice contesting liability within the time prescribed in this section, the Treasurer shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the compensability of such alleged injury or death from the Second Injury Fund and shall have no right thereafter to contest the employee's right to receive compensation on any grounds or contest the extent of the employee's disability.\n\n(c) The employer and the insurer, if any, shall be liable to the state for any payments made out of the fund in accordance with this section or which the Treasurer has by award become obligated to make from the fund, together with cost of attorneys' fees as fixed by the court. If reimbursement is not made, or a plan for payment to the fund has not been agreed to by the Treasurer and employer, not later than ninety days after any payment from the fund, the Attorney General shall bring a civil action, in the superior court for the judicial district where the award was made, to recover all amounts paid by the fund pursuant to the award, plus double damages together with reasonable attorney's fees and costs as taxed by the court. Any amount paid to the Treasurer by the employer or insurer after the filing of an action, but prior to its completion, shall be subject to an interest charge of eighteen per cent per annum, calculated from the date of original payment from the fund.\n\n(d) Any recovery made under this section, including any recovery for costs or attorney's fees, shall be paid into the fund. Any administrative or other costs or expenses incurred by the Attorney General in connection with carrying out the purposes of this section, including the hiring of necessary employees, shall be paid from the fund. The Treasurer shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, which describe what constitutes a proper and sufficient “plan for payment to the fund” for the purposes of this section.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) to (d), inclusive, of this section, whenever the employer's insurer has been determined to be insolvent, as defined in section 38a-838, payments required under this section shall be the obligation of the Connecticut Insurance Guaranty Association pursuant to the provisions of sections 38a-836 to 38a-853, inclusive.\n\n(f) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, the administrative law judge may approve a stipulated settlement for benefits between an injured worker and the Treasurer under this chapter at any time prior to or after the issuance of a finding and award against the employer if the administrative law judge determines that it is in the best interest of the injured workers to do so. Notice of the proposed settlement shall be sent to the employer by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the employer's last-known address on file with the Secretary of the State or local postal authority. The administrative law judge shall hold a hearing on such proposed settlement at the request of the employer in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. If the employer does not file with the Workers' Compensation Commission a written objection to the proposed settlement not later than twenty-eight days after the date of the notice to the employer of the proposed settlement, the employer shall be deemed to have consented to the proposed settlement and may not thereafter contest the terms of the settlement in any forum. Where payment has been ordered under this subsection, the terms of such order shall have the same status and be governed by the same provisions as an award issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(g) Nothing in this section shall preclude the Treasurer from entering into an agreement with the employer for the reimbursement of expenses, costs or benefits paid by the fund. The Treasurer, the uninsured employer, the injured worker, or the injured worker's beneficiaries, or a third party who is liable under section 31-293 may enter into a settlement agreement to finally or partially settle the rights and liabilities of any or all parties under this chapter, subject to the approval of the administrative law judge.\n\n(h) When a finding and award of compensation has been made against an uninsured employer who fails to pay it, that compensation shall be paid from the Second Injury Fund, and if there are further claims for any related, reasonable and necessary treatment, payment shall by provided to the claimant without a subsequent finding and award.\n\n(1959, P.A. 580, S. 13; 1961, P.A. 491, S. 81; 1969, P.A. 696, S. 16; P.A. 85-349, S. 2; P.A. 86-35, S. 1; P.A. 87-277, S. 2, 4; 87-589, S. 58, 87; P.A. 91-32, S. 39, 41; 91-207, S. 1, 9; P.A. 92-31, S. 6, 7; P.A. 05-199, S. 11; P.A. 21-18, S. 1; P.A. 22-89, S. 31.)\n\nHistory: 1961 act entirely replaced previous provisions; 1969 act specified benefits to be considered as “compensation”; P.A. 85-349 required the attorney general to bring a civil action for reimbursement of the payments made by the fund, and assessed an interest charge of 18% on delinquent payments; P.A. 86-35 provided that any recovery of moneys pursuant to this section be paid into the second injury fund, that outside counsel may be used for reimbursement procedures and paid for from the fund, that treasurer may agree to a reimbursement payment plan in lieu of civil action, and that payments due from an insolvent workers' compensation insurer be the obligation of the Connecticut Insurance Guaranty Association; P.A. 87-277 deleted provision re payment from fund of compensation for outside counsel and substituted provision re payment from fund of costs or expenses incurred by attorney general in carrying out purposes of section; P.A. 87-589 changed effective date of P.A. 87-277 from July 1, 1988 to July 1, 1987; P.A. 91-32 made technical changes, added new Subsec.

Cited. 171 C. 577; 174 C. 181; 187 C. 53; 210 C. 626; 212 C. 427. Legislature intended that fund would be liable if employer were bankrupt, in which case no judgment could enter against it; commissioner's ability to enter award against employer's estate for the purpose of establishing fund's liability when a claim against the estate is barred by the nonclaim statute is necessary for the operation of section; commissioner need not determine whether a claim against employer's estate is barred by the nonclaim statute before entering award against the estate or ordering fund to make payments. 256 C. 456.\n\nCited. 24 CA 93; 37 CA 835; 46 CA 346; Id., 596.

      "text": "(a) Whenever the Second Injury Fund is required, pursuant to section 31-355, to pay benefits or compensation mandated by the provisions of this chapter for any employer or insurer who fails or is unable to make such payments, the amount so paid by the fund shall be collectible by any means provided by law for the collection of any tax due the state of Connecticut or any subdivision thereof, including any means provided by section 12-35. Tax warrants referred to in said section 12-35 may be signed by the State Treasurer.\n\n(b) Any such amount due shall be a lien from the due date until discharged by payment against all the property of the employer or insurer within the state, whether real or personal, except such as is exempt from execution, including debts to the employer or insurer, and a certificate of such lien without specifically describing such real or personal property, signed by the State Treasurer, may be filed in the office of the clerk of any town in which such real property is situated, or, in the case of personal property, in the office of the Secretary of the State, which lien shall be effective from the date on which it is recorded. When any such amount with respect to which a lien has been recorded under the provisions of this section has been satisfied, the State Treasurer, upon request of any interested party, shall issue a certificate discharging such lien. Any action for the foreclosure of such lien shall be brought by the Attorney General in the name of the state in the superior court for the judicial district in which the property subject to such lien is situated or, if such property is located in two or more judicial districts, in the superior court for any one such judicial district and the court may limit the time for redemption or order the sale of such property or pass such other or further decree as it judges equitable. When the property to be liened is concealed in the hands of an agent or trustee so that it cannot be found or attached, or is a debt due to the employer, the certificate of lien may be filed by leaving a copy thereof with such agent, trustee or debtor, or by mailing to him a copy thereof by registered or certified mail, and from the time of the receipt of such lien all the effects of the employer or insurer in the hands of such agent or trustee and any debt due from such debtor to the employer or insurer shall be secured in the hands of such agent, trustee or debtor to pay the amount secured by such lien. The payment by such agent, trustee or debtor to the State Treasurer shall discharge him of his liability to the employer or insurer to the extent thereof. The State Treasurer may require such agent, trustee or debtor to disclose under oath within ten days whether he has in his hands the goods or effects of the employer or insurer or is indebted to him. If such agent, trustee or debtor fails to disclose or, having disclosed, fails to turn over such effects or pay to the State Treasurer the amount of his indebtedness to the employer or insurer, the lien shall have the effect of a judgment and the State Treasurer may proceed against him by scire facias taken out from the clerk of the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford in the manner provided in chapter 905 for scire facias against a garnishee.\n\n(P.A. 86-173; P.A. 88-47, S. 2; 88-230, S. 1, 12; 88-364, S. 49, 123; P.A. 90-98, S. 1, 2; P.A. 91-207, S. 8, 9; P.A. 93-142, S. 4, 7, 8; P.A. 95-220, S. 4–6; P.A. 21-18, S. 7.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 88-47 added the reference to Subsec.
