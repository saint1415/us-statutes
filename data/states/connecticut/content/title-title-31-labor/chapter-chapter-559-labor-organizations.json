      "text": "As used in this section, “labor organization” means any organization or association or any agency or employee representation committee or plan which exists for the purpose, in whole or part, of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment or conditions of work, or any federation or council located in this state representing any group of such labor organizations. Except for labor organizations subject to the provisions of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (Public Law 86-267), each labor organization functioning in the state and having twenty-five or more members in any calendar or fiscal year shall, annually, within three months after the end of the calendar or fiscal year used as the basis for such report, file with the Labor Commissioner and make available to its membership a written report either in the form required by Public Law 86-267 or the Internal Revenue Code. Such report shall be filed and transmitted by the treasurer or other chief financial officer of such labor organization and shall be verified by the oath of the treasurer or other chief financial officer filing such report and copies of such report shall be furnished to individual members at the regular or special meeting of the labor organization at which such report is presented and shall be available during the year following the year covered by the report at the labor organization's office during regular business hours and upon request of any member. Reports under the provisions of this section shall not be open to public inspection except that any person may examine the report of any labor organization of which he is a member, and except that the state may audit any such report so filed at the written request of any member and shall transmit to any such member and the labor organization which submitted the report the results of any such audit. The treasurer or other chief financial officer of any labor organization or any other individual charged with the filing of such reports who fails to comply with the provisions of this section shall forfeit to the state twenty-five dollars for each such failure. The Labor Commissioner may destroy any report filed under the provisions of this section after such report has been on file two years.\n\n(1957, P.A. 628, S. 1, 2, 3; 1959, P.A. 507; 1961, P.A. 258; 1971, P.A. 77; P.A. 88-364, S. 47, 123.)\n\nHistory: 1959 act changed time for filing report and content requirement; 1961 act added exception to filing requirement for labor organizations subject to provisions of Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, changed reference from Taft-Hartley Act to Public Act 86-267, and specified that provisions re examination and audit of reports apply to reports of labor organizations for clarity; 1971 act required that reports be filed with labor commissioner rather than with secretary of the state and accordingly transferred power to destroy reports from the secretary to the commissioner; P.A. 88-364 made technical changes.",
