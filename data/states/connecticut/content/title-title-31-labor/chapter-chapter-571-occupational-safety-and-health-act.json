Where no federal standards are applicable, the commissioner shall provide for the development of such state standards as may be necessary in special circumstances.\n\n(b) No standards shall be adopted for products distributed or used in interstate commerce which are different from federal standards for such products unless such standards are required by compelling local conditions and do not unduly burden interstate commerce.\n\n(c) Subject to the time period limitations of subsection (g) of section 4-168, in the event of emergency or unusual situations the commissioner shall provide for an emergency temporary standard to take immediate effect upon publication in the Connecticut Law Journal if he deems (1) that employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards; and (2) that such emergency standard is necessary to protect employees from such danger. Such emergency standard shall be in effect not longer than one hundred twenty days or, if renewed in compliance with subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection, not longer than sixty additional days. On or before the expiration date of such emergency standard or renewal thereof, the commissioner shall develop a permanent standard to replace such emergency standard.\n\n(d) Any standard promulgated shall prescribe the use of labels or other appropriate forms of warning as are necessary to insure that employees are apprised of all hazards to which they are exposed, relevant symptoms and appropriate emergency treatment, and proper conditions and precautions of safe use or exposure where appropriate. Such standard shall also prescribe suitable protective equipment and control procedures to be used in connection with such hazards and shall provide for measuring employee exposure in such manner as may be necessary for the protection of employees. In addition, where appropriate, such standard shall prescribe the type and frequency, medical examinations or other tests which shall be made available, by the employer or at his cost, to employees exposed to such hazards in order to determine any adverse effect from such exposure.\n\n(e) Any employer may apply to the commissioner for a temporary order granting a variance from a standard or any provision thereof promulgated under this section. Such temporary order shall be granted only if the employer files an application which meets the requirements of subsection (f) of this section and establishes that the employer (1) is unable to comply with a standard by its effective date because of unavailability of professional or technical personnel or of materials and equipment needed to come into compliance with the standard or because necessary construction or alteration of facilities cannot be completed by the effective date, (2) is taking all available steps to safeguard employees against the hazards covered by the standard, and (3) has an effective program for coming into compliance with the standard as quickly as practicable. Any temporary order issued under this subsection shall prescribe the practices, means, methods, operations, and processes which the employer must adopt and use while the order is in effect and state in detail the employer's program for coming into compliance with the standard. Such a temporary order may be granted only after notice to employees and an opportunity for a hearing, provided the commissioner may issue one interim order to be effective until a decision is made on the basis of the hearing. No temporary order may be in effect for longer than the period needed by the employer to achieve compliance with the standard or one year, whichever is shorter, except that such an order may be renewed not more than twice as long as the requirements of this subsection are met and if an application for renewal is filed at least ninety days prior to the expiration date of the order. No interim renewal of an order may remain in effect longer than one hundred eighty days.\n\n(f) An application for a temporary variance order shall contain: (1) A specification of the standard or portion thereof from which the employer seeks a variance; (2) a representation by the employer, supported by representations from qualified persons who have firsthand knowledge of the facts represented, that he is unable to comply with the standard or portion thereof and a detailed statement of the reasons therefor; (3) a statement of the steps he has taken and will take, with specific dates, to protect employees against the hazard covered by the standard; (4) a statement of when he expects to be able to comply with the standard and what steps he has taken and what steps he will take, with dates specified, to come into compliance with the standard; and (5) a certification that he has informed his employees of the application by giving a copy thereof to their authorized representative, posting a statement giving a summary of the application and specifying where a copy may be examined at the place or places where notices to employees are normally posted, and by other appropriate means. A description of how employees have been informed shall be contained in the certification. The information to employees shall also inform them of their right to petition the commissioner for a hearing. The commissioner is also authorized to grant a variance from any standard or portion thereof whenever he determines that such variance is necessary to permit an employer to participate in an experiment approved by him designed to demonstrate or validate new and improved techniques to safeguard the health or safety of workers.\n\n(g) Any affected employer may apply to the commissioner for a rule or order for a variance from a standard promulgated under this section. Affected employees shall be given notice of each such application and an opportunity to participate in a hearing. The commissioner shall issue such rule or order if he determines on the record, after opportunity for an inspection where appropriate and a hearing, that the proponent of the variance has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the conditions, practices, means, methods, operations, or processes used or proposed to be used by an employer will provide employment and places of employment which are as safe and healthful as those which would prevail if he complied with the standard. The rule or order so issued shall prescribe the conditions the employer must maintain, and the practices, means, methods, operations, and processes which he must adopt and utilize to the extent they differ from the standard in question. Such a rule or order may be modified or revoked upon application by an employer or employees, or by the commissioner on his own motion, in the manner prescribed for its issuance under this subsection at any time after six months from its issuance.\n\n(h) Any person who may be adversely affected by a standard or regulation issued under this section may challenge the validity or applicability of such standard or regulation by bringing an action for a declaratory judgment in accordance with section 4-175.\n\n(P.A. 73-379, S. 6, 21; P.A. 74-137, S. 5–7, 21; P.A. 80-46, S. 4; P.A. 88-317, S. 92, 107; P.A. 06-196, S. 264; P.A. 14-187, S. 37.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 74-137 added references to owners in Subsecs.

Whenever the commissioner, proceeding pursuant to this section, is denied admission to any such place of employment, he shall obtain a warrant to make an inspection or investigation of such place of employment from any judge of the Superior Court. Any judge of the Superior Court within the state is authorized to issue a warrant pursuant to this section and shall issue such warrant whenever he is satisfied that the following conditions are met: That the individual seeking the warrant is a duly authorized agent of the department; and that such individual has established under oath or affirmation that the place of employment to be investigated in accordance with this section is to be inspected to determine compliance or noncompliance with a standard, regulation or order, or that there is probable cause to believe that there is a condition in or about such place of employment constituting a hazard to safety or health.\n\n(b) In making his inspections and investigations under this chapter, the commissioner may require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence under oath. Witnesses shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of this state. In case of contumacy or failure or refusal of any person to obey such an order, the superior court for the judicial district wherein such person resides, is found or transacts business shall have jurisdiction to issue to such person an order requiring such person to appear to produce evidence if asked, and when so ordered, and to give testimony relating to the matter under investigation or in question. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.\n\n(c) (1) Each employer shall make, keep and preserve and make available to the commissioner and the United States Secretary of Labor such records regarding his activities relating to this chapter as the commissioner may prescribe in regulations adopted in accordance with chapter 54 and this chapter as necessary or appropriate for the enforcement of this chapter or for developing information regarding the causes and prevention of occupational accidents and illnesses. In order to carry out the provisions of this subdivision such regulations may include provisions requiring employers to conduct periodic inspections. The commissioner shall also adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 and this chapter requiring that employers through posting of notices or other appropriate means keep their employees informed of their protections and obligations under this chapter, including the provisions of applicable standards.\n\n(2) The commissioner shall adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 and this chapter requiring employers to maintain accurate records of and to make periodic reports on work-related deaths, injuries and illnesses other than minor injuries requiring only first aid treatment and which do not involve medical treatment, loss of consciousness, restriction of work or motion, or transfer to another job.\n\n(3) The commissioner shall adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 and this chapter requiring employers to maintain accurate records of employee exposures to potentially toxic materials or harmful physical agents which are required to be monitored or measured under any occupational safety and health standard adopted under this chapter. Such regulations shall provide employees or their representatives an opportunity to observe such monitoring or measuring and to have access to the records thereof. Such regulations shall also make appropriate provision for each employee or former employee to have access to such records as will indicate his own exposure to toxic materials or harmful physical agents. Each employer shall promptly notify any employee who has been or is being exposed to toxic materials or harmful physical agents in concentrations or at levels which exceed those prescribed by an applicable occupational safety and health standard promulgated in regulations adopted in accordance with chapter 54 and this chapter and shall inform any employee who is being thus exposed of the corrective action being taken.\n\n(d) Any information obtained by the commissioner under this chapter shall be obtained with a minimum burden upon employers. Unnecessary duplication of efforts in obtaining information shall be reduced to the maximum extent feasible.\n\n(e) Subject to regulations adopted by the commissioner in accordance with chapter 54 and this chapter, a representative of the employer and a representative authorized by the employees of the employer shall be given an opportunity to accompany the commissioner or his authorized representative during the physical inspection of any work place for the purpose of aiding such inspection. Where there is no authorized employee representative, the commissioner or his authorized representative shall consult with a reasonable number of employees concerning matters of health and safety in the work place.\n\n(f) (1) The commissioner may compile, analyze and publish in either summary or detail form all reports or information obtained under this section.\n\n(2) The commissioner shall adopt such regulations in accordance with chapter 54 and this chapter as he may deem necessary to carry out his responsibilities under this chapter, including regulations dealing with the inspection of an employer's or owner's establishment.\n\n(g) (1) In accordance with the provisions of section 4-38d, the duty of the Department of Public Health to license and to establish standards for health facilities operated by a commercial or industrial establishment for the care of its employees shall be transferred to the Division of Occupational Safety and Health of the Labor Department. No commercial or industrial establishment within the state shall establish, conduct, operate or maintain a health facility for its employees without a license as required by this subsection.\n\n(2) Application for such license shall be made to the Labor Department upon forms provided by it and shall contain such information as the department requires, which may include affirmative evidence of ability to comply with reasonable standards and regulations adopted pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. Upon receipt of an application for a license, the Labor Department shall issue such license if, upon inspection and investigation by the Division of Occupational Safety and Health, it finds that the applicant and facilities meet the requirements established by regulation. Such license shall be valid for one year or fraction thereof and shall terminate on March thirty-first, June thirtieth, September thirtieth or December thirty-first of each year. A license, unless sooner suspended or revoked, shall be renewable annually, without charge, upon the filing by the licensee, and approval by the Labor Department, of an annual report upon such date and containing such information in such form as the department prescribes and satisfactory evidence of continuing compliance with requirements. Each license shall be issued only for the premises and persons named in the application and shall not be transferable or assignable. Licenses shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the licensed premises.\n\n(3) The Labor Department shall adopt, in accordance with chapter 54 and this chapter, and enforce regulations for health facilities licensed under the provisions of this subsection in order to provide for reasonable standards of health, safety and comfort for the employees utilizing such facilities. The regulations adopted by the Labor Department shall conform to the standards established by this chapter.\n\n(4) The Labor Department, after reasonable notice and a hearing, may suspend, revoke or refuse to renew a license in any case in which it finds there has been a substantial failure to comply with the requirements established under this subsection.
