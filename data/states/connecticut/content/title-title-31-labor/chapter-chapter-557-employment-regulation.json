If a laid-off employee declines an offer of a position, within the time period provided by the employer, due to underlying conditions related to contracting COVID-19 diagnosed on or before May 1, 2021, as evidenced by a medical note to the employer, such laid-off employee shall retain the right to accept an available position for which the employee is qualified pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of this section, and shall retain all other rights under this section until both (1) the expiration of the public health and civil preparedness emergencies declared by the Governor on March 10, 2020, and any extension of such emergency declarations, and (2) the laid-off employee is reoffered a position.\n\n(e) Each employer that declines to rehire a laid-off employee on the grounds of lack of qualifications and instead hires an individual other than a laid-off employee shall provide to the laid-off employee a written notice not later than thirty days after the date such other individual is hired. Such notice shall include the reasons for such decision.\n\n(f) A laid-off employee rehired pursuant to this section shall be permitted to work for not less than thirty work days, unless there is just cause for the employee's termination.\n\n(g) The requirements of this section shall apply under any of the following circumstances:\n\n(1) The form of organization of the employer changed after March 10, 2020;\n\n(2) Substantially all of the assets of the employer were acquired by another entity that conducts the same or similar operations using substantially the same assets; or\n\n(3) The employer relocates the operations at which a laid-off employee was employed prior to March 10, 2020, to a different employment site not greater than twenty-five miles away from the original employment site.\n\n(h) No employer shall terminate, refuse to reemploy, reduce compensation or otherwise take any adverse action against any individual seeking to enforce his or her rights under this section or for participating in proceedings related to this section, opposing the violation of any provision of this section or otherwise asserting rights under this section.\n\n(i) An employer that terminates, refuses to reemploy or takes any other adverse action against any laid-off employee shall provide to the employee, at or before the time of the termination, refusal to reemploy or other adverse action, a detailed written statement of the reason or reasons for the termination, refusal to reemploy or other adverse action, including all the facts substantiating the reason or reasons and all facts known to the employer that contradict the substantiating facts.\n\n(j) (1) A laid-off employee aggrieved by a violation of any provision of this section may bring a civil action in the Superior Court.\n\n(2) If the court finds that the employer has violated any provision of this section, the court may enjoin the employer from engaging in such violation and may order such affirmative action as the court deems appropriate, including the reinstatement or rehiring of the laid-off employee, with or without back pay and fringe benefits, or other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate. Interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the laid-off employee who was subjected to the violation shall be deducted from the back pay permitted under this subdivision and any reasonable amounts expended by the laid-off employee in searching for, obtaining or relocating to new employment shall be deducted from the interim earnings before such earnings are deducted from such back pay. The court may order compensatory and punitive damages if the court finds that the employer committed the violation with malice or with reckless indifference to the provisions of this section. Any laid-off employee who prevails in a civil action shall be awarded reasonable attorney's fees and costs to be taxed by the court.\n\n(k) The provisions of this section shall apply to each laid-off employee, whether or not such laid-off employee is represented for purposes of collective bargaining or is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and may be waived in a bona fide collective bargaining agreement but only if the waiver is explicitly set forth in the agreement in clear and unambiguous terms. Unilateral implementation of terms and conditions of employment by either party to a collective bargaining relationship shall not constitute or be permitted as a waiver of all or any part of the provisions of this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate or limit the rights, remedies and procedures of any contract or agreement that provides equal or greater protection for laid-off employees than provided by this section and it shall not be a violation of this section for an employer to follow an order of preference for rehiring laid-off employees required by a collective bargaining agreement that is different from the order of preference required by this section.\n\n(P.A. 21-189, S. 1.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 21-189 effective July 13, 2021 (Revisor's note: In Subsec.

      "text": "(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a public employer shall provide an exclusive representative, in an editable digital file format, and, if possible, in a format agreed to by the exclusive representative, the following information if on file with the employer: Name, job title, department, work location, work telephone number and the home address of any newly hired employee. The public employer shall provide the exclusive representative such information, if possible, with real-time electronic transmission of new hire data but in no event later than ten days after such employee is hired or the first pay period of the month following the hiring of such employee, whichever is earlier. For purposes of this section, (1) “public employer” means (A) “employer”, as defined in section 5-270, (B) “municipal employer”, as defined in section 7-467, and (C) local and regional boards of education, (2) “public employee organization” means any lawful association, labor organization, federation or council having as a primary purpose the improvement of wages, hours and other conditions of employment among employees of public employers, and (3) “exclusive representative” means the public employee organization certified or recognized in accordance with state law to be the exclusive bargaining representative of a public employer bargaining unit.\n\n(b) (1) Each public employer shall provide the exclusive representative access to its new employee orientations. The public employer shall give the exclusive representative not less than ten days' written or electronic notice in advance of such an orientation, except a shorter notice may be provided in any instance where there is an urgent need critical to the public employer's operations that prevents the ten days' notice. The exclusive representative shall provide to the public employer, on or before January thirty-first of each year, the physical and electronic address to which such notice shall be sent annually. The structure, time and manner of such exclusive representative's access shall be determined through mutual agreement between the parties, subject to the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(2) Upon request of the public employer or the exclusive representative, the parties shall negotiate regarding the structure, time and manner of access by the exclusive representative to a new employee orientation. Failure to reach agreement on such structure, time and manner of such access shall be subject to compulsory interest arbitration pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(3) When negotiating access regarding a new employee orientation pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection, if a dispute has not been resolved within forty-five days after the first meeting of the parties or within sixty days after the initial request to negotiate was made, whichever is earlier, either party may make a demand for compulsory interest arbitration. If such a demand is made, the applicable arbitration procedure prescribed pursuant to the general statutes shall apply, except that the factors considered by the arbitrator shall be: (A) The ability of the exclusive representative to communicate with the public employees it represents, (B) the legal obligations of the exclusive representative to such public employees, (C) state, federal and local laws that are applicable to the employer and the employees, (D) stipulations of the parties, (E) the interests and welfare of the public and the financial condition and day-to-day operations of similarly situated public agencies, (F) the structure, time and manner of access of the exclusive representative to a new employee orientation for comparable public employers, including, but not limited to, access provisions in other memoranda of understanding or collective bargaining agreements containing such provisions, (G) the public employee organization's need to meaningfully communicate through cost-effective and efficient means with the public employees it represents, and (H) any other factors that are normally or traditionally taken into consideration in establishing the structure, time and manner of access of the exclusive representative to a new employee orientation.\n\n(c) A public employer shall provide the exclusive representative access to the public employees that such exclusive representative represents. Such access includes, but shall not be limited to: (1) The right to meet with individual employees on the premises of the public employer during the workday to investigate and discuss grievances, workplace-related complaints and other workplace issues, (2) the right to conduct worksite meetings during meal periods and during other paid or unpaid breaks, and before and after the workday, on the employer's premises, and (3) the right to meet with newly hired employees within the bargaining unit, without charge to the pay or leave time of the employees, for not less than thirty minutes nor more than one hundred twenty minutes, within thirty calendar days after the date of hire, during new employee orientations, or if the public employer does not conduct new employee orientation, at individual or group meetings.\n\n(d) In addition to any public employee organization's right to employee information pursuant to the laws of this state or any applicable collective bargaining agreement, beginning on January 1, 2022, every one hundred twenty calendar days, unless more frequent or more detailed lists are required by agreement between the parties, a public employer shall provide the exclusive representative, in an editable digital file format agreed to by the exclusive representative, the following information: Each bargaining unit employee's name, job title, worksite location, work telephone number, date of hire, work electronic mail address, home address and, if authorized by the employee via written authorization provided to the exclusive representative, the employee's home telephone number, personal cellular mobile telephone number and personal electronic mail address if on file with the public employer. Any written authorization required under this subsection may be revoked by the employee at any time and such authorization or revocation shall be provided to the exclusive representative at either the physical or electronic address provided by such representative pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(e) The exclusive representative shall have the right to use the electronic mail systems of public employers to communicate with bargaining unit members regarding collective bargaining, the administration of collective bargaining agreements, the investigation of grievances, other workplace-related complaints and issues, and internal matters involving the governance or business of the public employee organization. The provisions of this subsection shall not limit the rights of a public employee organization to communicate with public employees.\n\n(f) Consistent with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, the exclusive representative shall have the right to use state and municipal government buildings and other facilities that are owned or leased by public employers to conduct meetings with bargaining unit members. An exclusive representative shall have the right to hold such meetings at a reasonable time and place, provided the meetings do not interfere with the public employer's operations. An exclusive representative shall have the right to conduct such meetings without undue interference and may place reasonable restrictions on the conduct of an individual attending such meetings.\n\n(g) The requirements set forth in this section establish the minimum requirements for access to and communication with bargaining unit employees by the exclusive representative and shall not prevent a public employer from granting the exclusive representative greater access to or communication with public employees.\n\n(h) Employees, including retired employees, of a public employer may authorize deductions to be made from their salaries, wages or retirement allowances for the payment of dues to, or for any other service, program or committee provided or sponsored by, any public employee organization.\n\n(i) A public employer shall honor employee authorizations created or adopted by a public employee organization for the deductions described in subsection (h) of this section in any form that satisfies the requirements of sections 1-266 to 1-286, inclusive, including, but not limited to, electronic and voice authorizations that meet the requirements of an electronic signature pursuant to said sections. The revocability of an authorization shall be determined by the terms of the authorization.\n\n(j) Public employers that provide for the administration of payroll deductions authorized by employees for public employee organizations shall: (1) Rely on a certification from any public employee organization requesting a deduction or reduction that such organization has and will maintain an authorization, signed by the individual from whose salary or wages the deduction or reduction is to be made. A public employee organization that certifies that it has and will maintain individual employee authorizations shall not be required to provide a copy of an individual authorization to the public employer unless a dispute arises about the existence or terms of the authorization. The public employee organization shall indemnify the public employer for any claims made by the employee for deductions made in reliance on that certification; and (2) direct employee requests to cancel or change deductions for public employee organizations to the employee organization, rather than to the public employer. The public employer shall rely on information provided by the public employee organization regarding whether deductions for the employee organization were properly canceled or changed, and the employee organization shall indemnify the public employer for any claims made by the employee for deductions made in reliance on such information. Deductions may be revoked only pursuant to the terms of an employee's written authorization.\n\n(k) A public employee organization or public employer shall only be liable for any amounts improperly deducted pursuant to this section. No further damages or penalties shall be awarded by any public agency or court.\n\n(l) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a public employer shall be liable to a public employee organization, without recourse to the employees, for the full amount of dues that such employer fails to remit to the public employee organization, provided the public employee organization has complied with the provisions of this section. The failure of an employer to comply with the provisions of this section shall be a violation of the duty to bargain and an unfair labor practice. The provisions of a collective bargaining agreement that contain the obligations set forth in this section may be enforced in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(m) If a dispute arises between the employee and the public employee organization regarding the existence, validity or revocation of a payroll deduction authorization, the dispute shall be resolved through a proceeding pursuant to sections 5-274, 7-471 and 10-153e, as applicable, to resolve a question of a prohibited practice.\n\n(n) A public employer shall not deter or discourage public employees or applicants for public employee positions from becoming or remaining members of a public employee organization, or from authorizing representation by a public employee organization, or from authorizing dues or deductions to a public employee organization.\n\n(o) It shall be a prohibited practice for a public employer to: (1) Encourage an employee to resign or decline to obtain membership in a public employee organization, (2) encourage an employee to revoke authorization for a payroll deduction of dues to a public employee organization, (3) knowingly aid any such effort by any other entity, or (4) permit use of the employer's electronic mail system by any entity to discourage membership in a public employee organization or discourage authorization of payroll deduction of dues to a public employee organization.\n\n(P.A. 21-25, S. 1.)",

      "text": "(a) Any covered employee aggrieved by a denial of compensation under the Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program or any person aggrieved by the imposition of a penalty imposed pursuant to section 31-49r may file an appeal with the Labor Commissioner not more than twenty-one calendar days after issuance of the denial or penalty decision, unless good cause exists for the late filing.\n\n(b) Upon receipt of any such appeal, the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall decide the appeal based upon the file record, except that the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, may do one or both of the following: (1) Supplement the file record, or (2) conduct a hearing. The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, may require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents in connection with the appeal, and may issue subpoenas. For purposes of this section, “file record” means any documents submitted to the Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance Authority or to the private plan administrator, any documents relied upon by the authority or the private plan administrator in making its determination, and any other documents the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, deems necessary to dispose of the appeal.\n\n(c) After determination of the appeal, the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall send each party a written copy of the decision. The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, may award the covered employee or person all appropriate relief, including, but not limited to, any compensation or benefits to which the employee otherwise would have been eligible if such denial had not occurred.\n\n(d) (1) Any decision of the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, in the absence of a timely appeal from a party aggrieved by such decision shall become final on the thirty-first calendar day after the date on which a written copy of the decision is sent to each party. At any time prior to when the decision of the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, becomes final, any party aggrieved by the decision may appeal such decision to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford or for the judicial district wherein the appealing party resides. The appealing party shall file the original appeal with the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, and shall state the grounds on which review is sought. The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall, on or before the fourteenth calendar day thereafter, cause the original appeal to be filed electronically or mailed to the clerk of the Superior Court and a copy sent to each party listed in the decision being appealed by mail or electronically through the Connecticut Labor Department Leave Complaint and Appeal Portal. The clerk shall docket such appeal as returned to the next return day after the receipt of such appeal.\n\n(2) In any appeal to the Superior Court taken pursuant to this subsection, the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall certify the record to the court. The record shall consist of the following: (A) The notice of appeal to the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, (B) the file record, (C) the findings of fact and any decision of the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, and (D) any documents submitted to the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, prior to the filing of the appeal. Upon request of the court, the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall, in cases in which a hearing was conducted before the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, prepare and verify to the court a transcript of such hearing before the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee.\n\n(3) Any appeal to the Superior Court taken under this subsection shall be claimed by the party taking such appeal for the short calendar unless the court orders the appeal placed on the trial list. It shall not be necessary in any judicial proceeding under this section that exceptions to the rulings of the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall have been made or entered and no bond shall be required for entering an appeal to the Superior Court. In any appeal in which one of the parties is not represented by counsel and in which the party taking the appeal does not claim the case for the short calendar or trial within a reasonable time after the return day, the court may, of its own motion, dismiss the appeal, or the party ready to proceed may move for nonsuit or default as appropriate.\n\n(4) Any appeal to the Superior Court taken under this subsection shall be heard by the court upon the certified copy of the record filed by the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee. The court shall not retry the facts or hear any evidence other than such record certified to the court by the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee. Any review by the court shall be limited to determining (A) whether the findings of the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, should be corrected, or (B) whether there is any evidence in the record to support in law the conclusions reached. The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may only determine whether the decision of the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, incorrectly applied the law to the facts found or if such decision is clearly erroneous and could not have reasonably or logically followed from the evidence in the record certified to the court by the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee. In any such appeal, corrections of the commissioner's, or the commissioner's designee's, findings, by the court shall only be made upon (i) refusal by the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, to find a material fact that was an admitted or undisputed fact, (ii) the commissioner's, or the commissioner's designee's, finding of a fact in language of doubtful meaning so that its real significance may not clearly appear, or (iii) the finding of a material fact by the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, without evidence.\n\n(5) The appealing party may request that any finding of the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, be corrected on appeal by filing a motion for the correction of such finding with the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, within fourteen calendar days after the record has been filed in the Superior Court, unless the time is extended for cause by the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee. Such motion shall include portions of the evidence the appealing party deems relevant and material to the corrections requested. The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall file such motion along with the commissioner's, or the commissioner's designee's, decision with the court within a reasonable time upon receiving such motion. If the court denies such motion in whole or in part and such denial is appealed, the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, file copies of evidence filed by the appealing party, together with such additional evidence as may have been taken before the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee.\n\n(6) In any appeal taken under this subsection, unless the court shall otherwise order after motion and hearing, the final decision of the court shall be the decision as to all parties to the original proceeding before the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee. When an appeal is taken to the Superior Court, the clerk thereof shall, in writing, notify the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, of any action of the court thereon and of the disposition of such appeal whether by judgment, remand, withdrawal or otherwise and shall, upon the decision on the appeal, furnish the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, with a copy of such decision.\n\n(7) The court may remand the case to the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, for proceedings de novo, or for further proceedings on the record, or for such limited purposes as the court may prescribe. The court may retain jurisdiction by ordering a return to the court of the proceedings conducted in accordance with the order of the court or the court may order final disposition. A party aggrieved by a final disposition made in compliance with an order of the Superior Court, by the filing of an appropriate motion, may request the court to review the disposition of the case.\n\n(e) Any party aggrieved by a decision of the Superior Court may appeal such decision to the Appellate Court in the same manner as is provided in section 51-197b.\n\n(f) The Labor Department shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, concerning the rules of procedure for the disposition of appeals filed under the provisions of this section.\n\n(P.A. 19-25, S. 12; June Sp.

Section allows for costs, but does not expressly provide for expert witness fees; therefore, general cost provisions of Secs. 52-257 and 52-260 apply, which do not mention nontestimonial costs; accordingly, the nontestimonial work performed by plaintiff's economics expert was not taxable as costs; nothing in the legislative history indicates that legislature's use of term “costs” in either this section or Sec. 31-51q was intended to authorize court to award prevailing party the cost of an economist; because an economist is not a listed expert witness whose cost may be reimbursed under Sec. 52-260(f), testimonial fees of plaintiff's expert economist cannot be reimbursed. 79 CA 501.\n\nSubsec.

Any contractor who is not obligated by agreement to make payment or contribution on behalf of such persons to any such employee welfare fund shall pay to each mechanic, laborer or worker as part of such person's wages the amount of payment or contribution for such person's classification on each pay day.”\n\n(b) If the commissioner, upon inspection or investigation of a complaint, believes that a contractor or subcontractor has knowingly or wilfully employed any mechanic, laborer or worker in the construction, remodeling, refinishing, refurbishing, rehabilitation, alteration or repair of any public works project for or on behalf of the state or any of its agents, or any political subdivision of the state or any of its agents, at a rate of wage on an hourly basis that is less than the rate customary or prevailing for the same work in the same trade or occupation in the town in which such public works project is being constructed, remodeled, refinished, refurbished, rehabilitated, altered or repaired, or who has failed to pay the amount of payment or contributions paid or payable on behalf of each such person to any employee welfare fund, or in lieu thereof to the person, as provided by subsection (a) of this section, such contractor or subcontractor shall be issued a citation and may be fined five thousand dollars for each offense. The commissioner shall maintain a list of any contractor or subcontractor that, during the three preceding calendar years, violates this section or enters into a settlement with the commissioner to resolve any claim brought by the commissioner pursuant to this section. For each contractor or subcontractor placed on such list, the commissioner shall record the following information: (1) The nature of the violation; (2) the total amount of wages and fringe benefits making up the violation or agreed upon in any settlement with the commissioner; and (3) the total amount of civil penalties and fines agreed upon by the commissioner. The commissioner shall review the list on the first day of May each year for the preceding rolling three-year period and may refer for debarment any contractor or subcontractor that committed a violation of this section during the rolling three-year period. The commissioner shall refer for debarment any contractor or subcontractor that entered into one or more settlement agreements with the commissioner where the sum total of all settlements within such period exceeds fifty thousand dollars in back wages or fringe benefits, or entered into one or more settlement agreements with the commissioner where the sum total of all settlements within such period exceeds fifty thousand dollars in civil penalties or fines agreed upon by the commissioner. Any contractor or subcontractor the commissioner refers for debarment may request a hearing before the commissioner. Such hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54. In addition, if it is found by the contracting officer representing the state or political subdivision of the state that any mechanic, laborer or worker employed by the contractor or any subcontractor directly on the site for the work covered by the contract has been or is being paid a rate of wages less than the rate of wages required by the contract to be paid as required by this section, the state or contracting political subdivision of the state may (A) by written or electronic notice to the contractor, terminate such contractor's right to proceed with the work or such part of the work as to which there has been a failure to pay said required wages and to prosecute the work to completion by contract or otherwise, and the contractor and the contractor's sureties shall be liable to the state or the contracting political subdivision for any excess costs occasioned the state or the contracting political subdivision thereby, or (B) withhold payment of money to the contractor or subcontractor.

For each trade or occupation for which more than one collective bargaining agreement is in effect for the town in which such project is being constructed, the collective bargaining agreement of historical jurisdiction shall prevail. For each trade or occupation for which there is no collective bargaining agreement in effect for the town in which the public works project is being constructed, the Labor Commissioner shall adopt and use such appropriate and applicable prevailing wage rate determinations as have been made by the Secretary of Labor of the United States under the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act, as amended.\n\n(e) The Labor Commissioner shall determine the prevailing rate of wages on an hourly basis and the amount of payment or contributions paid or payable on behalf of such person to any employee welfare fund, as defined in subsection (i) of this section, in each locality where any such public work is to be constructed, and the agent empowered to let such contract shall contact the Labor Commissioner, at least ten but not more than twenty days prior to the date such contracts will be advertised for bid, to ascertain the proper rate of wages and amount of employee welfare fund payments or contributions and shall include such rate of wage on an hourly basis and the amount of payment or contributions paid or payable on behalf of each person to any employee welfare fund, as defined in subsection (i) of this section, or in lieu thereof the amount to be paid directly to each person for such payment or contributions as provided in subsection (a) of this section for all classifications of labor in the proposal for the contract. The rate of wage on an hourly basis and the amount of payment or contributions to any employee welfare fund, as defined in subsection (i) of this section, or cash in lieu thereof, as provided in subsection (a) of this section, shall, at all times, be considered as the minimum rate for the classification for which it was established. Prior to the award of any contract, purchase order, bid package or other designation subject to the provisions of this section, such agent shall certify to the Labor Commissioner, either in writing or electronically, the total dollar amount of work to be done in connection with such public works project, regardless of whether such project consists of one or more contracts.

This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit a general contractor from relying on the certification of a lower tier subcontractor, provided the general contractor shall not be exempted from the provisions of section 53a-157a if the general contractor knowingly relies upon a subcontractor's false certification. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1-210, the certified payroll shall be considered a public record and every person shall have the right to inspect and copy such records in accordance with the provisions of section 1-212. The provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of section 31-59 and sections 31-66 and 31-69 that are not inconsistent with the provisions of this section, section 31-53c or 31-54 apply to this section. Failing to file a certified payroll pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection is a class D felony for which the employer may be fined up to five thousand dollars, imprisoned for up to five years, or both.\n\n(g) Any contractor who is required by the Labor Department to make any payment as a result of a subcontractor's failure to pay wages or benefits, or any subcontractor who is required by the Labor Department to make any payment as a result of a lower tier subcontractor's failure to pay wages or benefits, may bring a civil action in the Superior Court to recover no more than the damages sustained by reason of making such payment, together with costs and a reasonable attorney's fee.\n\n(h) (1) The provisions of this section shall not apply where (A) the combined total cost or total bond authorization for all work to be performed by all contractors and subcontractors in connection with new construction of any public works project is less than one million dollars, or (B) the combined total cost of all work to be performed by all contractors and subcontractors in connection with any remodeling, refinishing, refurbishing, rehabilitation, alteration or repair of any public works project is less than one hundred thousand dollars.\n\n(2) On and after October 31, 2017, and prior to July 1, 2019, the provisions of this subdivision shall not apply where the work to be performed by any contractor or subcontractor in connection with new construction, remodeling, refinishing, refurbishing, rehabilitation, alteration or repair of any public works project funded in whole or in part by any private bequest that is greater than nine million dollars but less than twelve million dollars for a municipality in New Haven County with a population of not less than twelve thousand and not more than thirteen thousand, as determined by the most recent population estimate by the Department of Public Health.\n\n(3) On and after July 1, 2019, and prior to January 1, 2020, the provisions of this subdivision shall not apply where the work to be performed by any contractor or subcontractor in connection with new construction, remodeling, refinishing, refurbishing, rehabilitation, alteration or repair of any public works project funded in whole or in part by any private bequest that is greater than nine million dollars but less than twenty-two million dollars for a municipality in New Haven County with a population of not less than twelve thousand and not more than thirteen thousand, as determined by the most recent population estimate by the Department of Public Health.\n\n(i) As used in this section and sections 31-53c and 31-54, “employee welfare fund” means any trust fund established by one or more employers and one or more labor organizations or one or more other third parties not affiliated with the employers to provide from moneys in the fund, whether through the purchase of insurance or annuity contracts or otherwise, benefits under an employee welfare plan; provided such term shall not include any such fund where the trustee, or all of the trustees, are subject to supervision by the Banking Commissioner of this state or any other state or the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States or the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and “benefits under an employee welfare plan” means one or more benefits or services under any plan established or maintained for persons performing the work of any mechanics, laborers or workers or their families or dependents, or for both, including, but not limited to, medical, surgical or hospital care benefits; benefits in the event of sickness, accident, disability or death; benefits in the event of unemployment, or retirement benefits.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 7372; March, 1950, S. 3018d, 3019d; 1961, P.A. 486, S. 1; 1963, P.A. 240, S. 1; 1967, P.A. 494, S. 1; P.A. 73-566, S. 1; P.A. 75-90, S. 1, 2; P.A. 77-442; 77-614, S. 161, 610; P.A. 79-325; P.A. 80-482, S. 200, 348; P.A. 83-537, S. 2; P.A. 85-355, S. 1–3; P.A. 87-9, S. 2, 3; P.A. 91-74, S. 1; 91-407, S. 40, 42; P.A. 93-392, S. 1; 93-435, S. 65, 95; P.A. 97-263, S. 14; P.A. 03-84, S. 17; P.A. 05-50, S. 1; P.A. 06-196, S. 161; P.A. 09-25, S. 1; P.A. 10-47, S. 1; June Sp.

This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit the state from enforcing any civil or criminal law, or any gaming regulation at a commercial enterprise owned or operated by a tribe, or to require the state to enforce a violation of any criminal law which would not be a violation if it occurred outside tribal land. The Governor, upon consulting with the leaders of the General Assembly, may waive the restrictions set forth in this subsection in the event of a declared emergency.\n\n(c) The state shall oppose any application by a tribe, pursuant to 25 CFR chapter 151, to convert any parcel of fee interest land to federal trust status.

The Governor shall employ his best efforts to ensure that any final agreement, compact or contract established under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act includes an Employment Rights Code in accordance with subsection (e) of this section.\n\n(e) The Employment Rights Code referred to under this section shall include the following provisions:\n\n(1) A commercial enterprise subject to tribal jurisdiction shall not, except in the case of a bona fide occupational qualification or need, refuse to hire or employ or bar or discharge from employment any individual or discriminate against him or her in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment because of the individual's race, color, religious creed, sex, gender identity or expression, marital status, national origin, ancestry, age, present or past history of mental disorder, intellectual disability, sexual orientation, learning or physical disability, political activity, union activity or the exercise of rights protected by the United States Constitution. This subdivision shall not be construed to restrict the right of a tribe to give preference in hiring to members of the tribe.\n\n(2) A commercial enterprise subject to tribal jurisdiction shall not deny any individual, including a representative of a labor organization, seeking to ensure compliance with this section, access to employees of the tribe's commercial enterprise during nonwork time in nonwork areas. The tribe shall not permit any supervisor, manager or other agent of the tribe to restrict or otherwise interfere with such access.\n\n(3) When a labor organization claims that it has been designated or selected for the purposes of collective bargaining by the majority of the employees in a unit appropriate for such purposes, the labor organization may apply to an arbitrator to verify the claim pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection. If the arbitrator verifies that the labor organization has been designated or selected as the bargaining representative by a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit, the tribe shall, upon request, recognize the labor organization as the exclusive bargaining agent and bargain in good faith with the labor organization in an effort to reach a collective bargaining agreement. However, the arbitrator shall disallow any claim by a labor organization that is dominated or controlled by the tribe.\n\n(4) (A) Any individual or organization claiming to be injured by a violation of any provision of this subsection shall have the right to seek binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Such individual or organization shall file a demand for arbitration with the tribe not later than one hundred eighty days after the employee or labor organization knows or should know of the tribe's violation of any provision of this subsection. The demand shall state, in plain language, the facts giving rise to the demand.\n\n(B) The demand for arbitration shall also be served upon the Connecticut office of the American Arbitration Association. Absent settlement, a hearing shall be held in accordance with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association. The costs and fees of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the tribe and the labor organization.\n\n(C) The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties and shall be subject to judicial review and enforcement against all parties in the manner prescribed by chapter 909.\n\n(5) A tribe shall not retaliate against any individual who exercises any right under the Employment Rights Code. Any individual or organization claiming to be injured by a violation of the provisions of this section shall have the right to seek binding arbitration pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection.\n\n(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the Governor may negotiate an agreement with a tribe which establishes rights for employees of commercial enterprises subject to tribal jurisdiction in addition to those provided under the Employment Rights Code established under subsection (e) of this section.\n\n(P.A. 93-365, S. 1–6; P.A. 11-55, S. 16; P.A. 13-139, S. 31.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 93-365 effective July 1, 1993; P.A. 11-55 amended Subsec.

Each pay period in which an employee is paid at a rate less than that required under the provisions of this section shall be a separate offense. The contracting department of the state that has imposed such civil penalty on the required employer or agent of such employer shall, within two days after taking such action, notify the Labor Commissioner, in writing, of the name of the employer or agent involved, the violations involved and steps taken to collect the fine.\n\n(d) The Labor Commissioner may make complaint to the proper prosecuting authorities for the violation of any provision of subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(e) For the purpose of predetermining the standard rate of covered wages on an hourly basis, the Labor Commissioner shall establish classifications for all hourly nonsupervisory employees based on the applicable occupation codes and titles set forth in the federal Register of Wage Determinations under the Service Contract Act of 1965, 41 USC 351, et seq., provided the Labor Commissioner shall classify any individual employed on or before July 1, 2009, as a grounds maintenance laborer or laborer as a janitor, and shall classify any individual hired after July 1, 2009, performing the duty of grounds maintenance laborer, laborer or janitor as a light cleaner, heavy cleaner, furniture handler or window cleaner, as appropriate. The Labor Commissioner shall then determine the standard rate of wages for each classification of hourly nonsupervisory employees which shall be (1) the prevailing rate of wages paid to employees in each classification, or if there is no such prevailing rate of wages, the minimum hourly wages set forth in the federal Register of Wage Determinations under the Service Contract Act, plus (2) the prevailing rate of benefits paid to employees in each classification, or if there is no such prevailing rate of benefits, a thirty per cent surcharge on the amount determined in subdivision (1) of this subsection to cover the cost of any health, welfare and retirement benefits, other than those otherwise required by federal, state or local law, or, if no such benefits are provided to the employees, an amount equal to thirty per cent of the amount determined in subdivision (1) of this section, which shall be paid directly to the employees. The standard rate of wages for any employee entitled to receive such rate on or before July 1, 2009, shall not be less than the minimum hourly wage for the classification set forth in the federal Register of Wage Determinations under the Service Contract Act plus the prevailing rate of benefits for such classification for as long as that employee continues to work for a required employer.\n\n(f) Required employers with employees covered by collective bargaining agreements which call for wages and benefits that are reasonably related to the standard rate of wages shall not be economically disadvantaged in the bidding process, provided the collective bargaining agreement was arrived at through arms-length negotiations.\n\n(g) The Labor Commissioner shall, in accordance with subsection (e) of this section, determine the standard rate of wages for each classification on an hourly basis where any covered services are to be provided, and the state agent empowered to let such contract shall contact the Labor Commissioner at least ten days prior to the date such contract will be advertised for bid, to ascertain the standard rate of wages and shall include the standard rate of wages on an hourly basis for all classifications of employment in the proposal for the contract. The standard rate of wages on an hourly basis shall, at all times, be considered the minimum rate for the classification for which it was established. Each required employer shall contact the Labor Commissioner on or before September first of each year for the duration of such contract to ascertain the standard rate of wages to be paid each year and shall make any necessary adjustments to such standard compensation paid or payable on or before October first, annually.\n\n(h) Where a required employer is awarded a contract to perform services that are substantially the same as services that have been rendered under a predecessor contract, such required employer shall retain, for a period of ninety days, all employees who had been employed by the predecessor to perform services under such predecessor contract, except that the successor contract need not retain employees who worked less than fifteen hours per week or who had been employed at the site for less than sixty days. During such ninety-day period, the successor contract shall not discharge without just cause an employee retained pursuant to this subsection. If the performance of an employee retained pursuant to this subsection or section 4a-82 is satisfactory during the ninety-day period, the successor contractor shall offer the employee continued employment for the duration of the successor contract under the terms and conditions established by the successor contractor, or as required by law. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any contract covered by section 31-57g or subsections (n) and (o) of section 4a-82.\n\n(i) Each required employer subject to the provisions of this section shall (1) keep, maintain and preserve such records relating to the wages and hours worked by each employee and a schedule of the occupation or work classification at which each person is employed during each work day and week in such manner and form as the Labor Commissioner establishes to assure the proper payments due to such employees, (2) annually or upon written request, submit to the contracting state agent a certified payroll which shall consist of a complete copy of such records accompanied by a statement signed by the employer which indicates that (A) such records are correct, (B) the rate of wages paid to each employee is not less than the standard rate of wages required by this section, (C) such employer has complied with the provisions of this section, and (D) such employer is aware that filing a certified payroll which it knows to be false is a class D felony for which such employer may be fined not more than five thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than five years, or both, and (3) and not later than the first day upon which work is required to be performed under the contract, and for the duration of the contract, post in a prominent and accessible place a poster stating (A) the standard rate of wages owed to employees under this section, (B) employee rights and remedies for a violation of this section, and (C) the contact information of the Labor Commissioner. The Labor Commissioner shall develop a suitable a poster containing the information described in subdivision (3) of this subsection for employers and provide such poster to required employers. The Labor Commissioner shall post its determinations of the corresponding standard rates for each classification on its Internet web site. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1-210, the certified payroll shall be considered a public record and every person shall have the right to inspect and copy such record in accordance with the provisions of section 1-212. The provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of section 31-59, section 31-66 and section 31-69 which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this section shall apply. Any person who files a false certified payroll in violation of subdivision (2) of this subsection shall be guilty of a class D felony for which such person may be fined not more than five thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\n\n(j) This section shall not apply to contracts, agreements or grants which do not exceed forty-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars per annum.\n\n(k) Any employee or group of employees and their designated representatives alleging nonpayment of the standard rate of wages may bring a complaint to the Labor Commissioner. The Labor Commissioner, the Director of Wage and Workplace Standards and wage enforcement agents of the Labor Department shall have power to enter, during usual business hours, the place of business or employment of any employer to determine compliance with this section, and for such purpose may examine payroll and other records and interview employees, call hearings, administer oaths, take testimony under oath and take depositions in the manner provided by sections 52-148a to 52-148e, inclusive. The commissioner or the director, for such purpose, may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of books and records. Any required employer, an officer or agent of such employer, or the officer or agent of any corporation, firm or partnership who wilfully fails to furnish time and wage records as required by law to the commissioner, the director or any wage enforcement agent upon request or who refuses to admit the commissioner, the director or such agent to a place of employment or who hinders or delays the commissioner, the director or such agent in the performance of any duties in the enforcement of this section shall be fined not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than one hundred dollars, and each day of such failure to furnish time and wage records to the commissioner, the director or such agent shall constitute a separate offense, and each day of refusal of admittance, of hindering or of delaying the commissioner, the director or such agent shall constitute a separate offense.\n\n(l) An employee or group of employees aggrieved by a violation of any provision of this section may, as an alternative to bringing a complaint to the Labor Commissioner under subsection (k) of this section, bring a civil action in the Superior Court. If the court finds that the employer has violated any provision of this section, the court may enjoin the employer from engaging in such violation and may order such affirmative action as the court deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, payment of back pay and the prevailing rate of benefits or thirty per cent surcharge, as required by subsection (e) of this section, or other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate. The court may order compensatory and punitive damages if the court finds that the employer committed a violation with malice or with reckless indifference to the provisions of this section. Any employee who prevails in a civil action may be awarded reasonable attorney's fees and costs to be taxed by the court.\n\n(m) Notwithstanding subsection (j) of this section, any employer that pays the state for a franchise to provide food preparation or service, or both, for the state shall be required to certify that the wages and benefits paid to its employees are not less than the standard rate established pursuant to this section, provided, if no prevailing rate of wages or benefits was in effect at the time the state entered into a franchise agreement, then the employer shall not be required to pay the prevailing rate of wages or benefits during the life of the agreement, unless the agreement is amended, extended or renewed.\n\n(n) The Labor Commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to carry out the provisions of this section.\n\n(o) The provisions of this section and any regulation adopted pursuant to subsection (m) of this section shall not apply to any contract or agreement entered into before July 1, 2000.\n\n(P.A. 99-142, S. 1, 2; P.A. 09-183, S. 1; 09-184, S. 4; P.A. 10-88, S. 2; P.A. 13-227, S. 5; P.A. 23-204, S. 419.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 99-142 effective July 1, 1999; P.A. 09-183 amended Subsec.
