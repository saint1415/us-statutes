Any agreement between an employee and his or her employer for payment of wages other than as specified in said sections shall be no defense to such action. The Labor Commissioner may collect the full amount of any such unpaid wages, payments due to an employee welfare fund or such arbitration award, as well as interest calculated in accordance with the provisions of section 31-265 from the date the wages or payment should have been received, had payment been made in a timely manner. In addition, the Labor Commissioner may bring any legal action necessary to recover twice the full amount of unpaid wages, payments due to an employee welfare fund or arbitration award, and the employer shall be required to pay the costs and such reasonable attorney's fees as may be allowed by the court. The commissioner shall distribute any wages, arbitration awards or payments due to an employee welfare fund collected pursuant to this section to the appropriate person.\n\n(1951, S. 1291b; 1955, S. 3015d; 1967, P.A. 641; P.A. 78-358, S. 2, 6; P.A. 89-157, S. 2; P.A. 90-55, S. 1, 3; P.A. 15-86, S. 2.)\n\nHistory: 1967 act deleted reference to repealed Sec. 31-71, added reference to Secs. 31-71a to 31-37i, authorized recoveries by labor organizations and made provisions applicable to cases where employee or labor organization institutes action to enforce arbitration award; P.A. 78-358 authorized recovery of twice the amount of wages and costs where previously recovery was limited to the amount itself and substituted “recover the amount provided by this section” for “collect such claim” in provision re bringing of legal action; P.A. 89-157 deleted the provisions allowing the labor commissioner to take an assignment of an employee's wage claim and provided for the collection and distribution by the labor commissioner of unpaid wages, payments due an employee welfare fund and arbitration awards; P.A. 90-55 made provisions applicable to cases where employer has failed to compensate an employee in accordance with Sec. 31-76k; P.A. 15-86 replaced “may” with “shall” re recovery in civil action, designated provision re twice the full amount of wages as Subdiv.

Legislature did not exempt real estate salespersons from section as was done in Unemployment and Workers' Compensation Acts. 231 C. 690. Award of double damages justified where employer requested employee to work additional hours, assured employee that she would be paid and then subsequently denied payment of overtime wages; determination of whether an individual can be considered an employer where a corporate entity exists depends on the individual's authority to control hours and wages and responsibility for illegally withholding wages. 243 C. 454. Analysis of legislative history; wage statutes, as a whole, do not provide substantive rights regarding how a wage is earned, but provide remedial protections where employer-employee wage agreement is violated. 260 C. 152. It is well established that it is appropriate for plaintiff to recover attorney's fees and double damages under section only when defendant has acted with bad faith, arbitrariness or unreasonableness; if a contingency fee agreement is reasonable, trial court may depart from its terms only when necessary to prevent substantial unfairness to the party who bears ultimate responsibility for payment of the fee. 265 C. 210. Double damage award under section not equivalent to punitive or exemplary damages; provision prohibiting employer from raising agreement for payment of wages between employer and employee as defense against action for unpaid wages does not bar employer from raising agreement for other purposes, such as ground for vacating arbitration award. 275 C. 72. Definitions in Sec. 31-71a apply when construing section. 293 C. 515. Contract provision providing that commissions will be paid only if the work had been invoiced prior to termination of the employee does not violate statutorily based public policy and is enforceable; an employee cannot use the nonpayment of wages that have not accrued as the basis for a wrongful discharge claim. 322 C. 385.\n\nCited. 8 CA 254; 10 CA 22.

Statute construed to empower Labor Commissioner to initiate legal action for enforcement of payment bond on behalf of employees of subcontractor against general contractor and surety on public works project; statute, together with Secs. 49-41 and 49-42 re public works and bond enforcement, intended by legislature as remedial statutory scheme to ensure that employees on public works projects are paid wages to which they are entitled. 73 CA 39. Since grievance procedures established in collective bargaining agreement were not capable of providing relief for plaintiff's claim, plaintiff did not have to exhaust her administrative remedies before bringing an action under section since to do so would be futile. 78 CA 601.

For the purpose of calculating the overtime rate of compensation required to be paid to an employee who is (i) employed as a delivery driver or sales merchandiser, (ii) paid on a base salary and commission basis, and (iii) not exempt from the overtime requirements of this chapter, the employee's regular rate shall be one-fortieth of the employee's weekly remuneration;\n\n(2) (A) “Hours worked” include all time during which an employee is required by the employer to be on the employer's premises or to be on duty, or to be at the prescribed work place, and all time during which an employee is employed or permitted to work, whether or not required to do so, provided time allowed for meals shall be excluded unless the employee is required or permitted to work. Such time includes, but shall not be limited to, the time when an employee is required to wait on the premises while no work is provided by the employer. (B) All time during which an employee is required to be on call for emergency service at a location designated by the employer shall be considered to be working time and shall be paid for as such, whether or not the employee is actually called upon to work. (C) When an employee is subject to call for emergency service but is not required to be at a location designated by the employer but is simply required to keep the employer informed as to the location at which he may be contacted, or when an employee is not specifically required by his employer to be subject to call but is contacted by his employer or on the employer's authorization directly or indirectly and assigned to duty, working time shall begin when the employee is notified of his assignment and shall end when the employee has completed his assignment. (D) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, when an individual employed by a third-party provider to provide “companionship services”, as defined in the regulations of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, is required to be present at a worksite for a period of not less than twenty-four consecutive hours, such individual and his or her employer may agree in writing to exclude a regularly scheduled sleeping period of not more than eight hours from hours worked, provided (i) adequate on-site sleeping facilities are furnished to such individual, and (ii) such individual receives at least five hours of sleep time. If the scheduled sleeping period is more than eight hours, only eight hours will be excluded. If the scheduled sleeping period is interrupted by an assignment to work, the interruption shall be counted as hours worked. If such individual does not receive at least five hours of sleep time during the scheduled sleeping period, the entire sleeping period shall be considered hours worked.
