An employer not previously subject to this chapter shall become subject to this chapter as follows: (1) An employer subject to the Federal Unemployment Tax Act for any year shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter from the beginning of such year if he had one or more employees in his employment in the state of Connecticut in such year; (2) an employer who acquires substantially all of the assets, organization, trade or business of another employer who at the time of such acquisition was subject to this chapter shall immediately become subject to this chapter as a successor employer; (3) an employer who, after December 31, 1973, (A) in any calendar quarter in either the current or preceding calendar year paid wages for services in employment of one thousand five hundred dollars or more, or (B) for some portion of a day in each of twenty different calendar weeks, whether or not such weeks were consecutive, in either the current or the preceding calendar year, had in employment at least one individual irrespective of whether the same individual was in employment in each such day; (4) an employer for which service in employment as defined in subdivision (1) (C) of subsection (a) of section 31-222 is performed after December 31, 1971; (5) an employer for which service in employment as defined in subdivision (1) (D) of said subsection (a) is performed after December 31, 1971; (6) an employer which, together with one or more other employers, is owned or controlled, by legally enforceable means or otherwise, directly or indirectly by the same interests, or which owns or controls, by legally enforceable means or otherwise, one or more other employers, and which, if treated as a single unit or entity with such other employers or interests, or both, would be an employer under subdivision (3) of this subsection and subparagraphs (H) and (J) of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 31-222; (7) any employer, not defined as such by any other subdivision of this subsection, (A) for which, within either the current or preceding calendar year, service is or was performed with respect to which such employer is liable for any federal tax against which credit may be taken for contributions required to be paid into a state unemployment fund, or (B) which, as a condition for approval of this chapter for full tax credit against the tax imposed by the federal Unemployment Tax Act, is required, pursuant to such federal act, to be an “employer” under this chapter; (8) an employer which, having become an employer under any of subdivisions (1) to (7), inclusive, of this subsection, has not, under subsection (c) ceased to be an employer subject to this chapter; (9) for the effective period of its election pursuant to subsection (b), an employer which has elected to become subject to this chapter. In determining whether an employer in question shall be considered, for the purposes of this section, as having had a particular number of employees in his employment at a given time, there shall be counted, in addition to his own employees, if any, (A) the employees of each employer whose business was at the given time owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the same interests which owned or controlled the business of the employer in question, and (B) the employees of each employer, substantially all of whose assets, organization, trade or business has, after the given time during the same calendar year, been acquired by the employer in question. If an employer shall contract with or shall have under him any contractor or subcontractor for any work which is part of said employer's usual trade, occupation, profession or business, and which is performed in, on or about the premises under such employer's control, and if such contractor or subcontractor shall not be subject to this chapter, such employer shall, for all the purposes of this chapter, be deemed to employ each individual in the employ of such contractor or subcontractor for each day during which such individual is engaged solely in performing such work; but this provision shall not prevent such employer from recovering from such contractor or subcontractor the amount of any contributions he may be required by this chapter to pay with respect to wages of such individuals for such work.\n\n(b)Voluntary liability.Any employer not so subject to this chapter may accept the provisions of this chapter and become in all respects subject thereto by agreeing in writing filed with the administrator to pay the contributions required from employers subject to this chapter. Any employer with persons in his employ engaged in one or more of the types of service specified in subdivision (5) of subsection (a) of section 31-222, except the service described by subparagraph (A) thereof, may elect that the provisions of this chapter apply to such services by agreeing in writing filed with the administrator to pay the contributions on wages for such services. Any employer defined in subdivision (1) (D) or (E) of subsection (a) of section 31-222 or (5) (F) or (L) of said section may elect either to pay the contributions on wages for services or to finance benefits on a reimbursable basis, by paying into the Unemployment Compensation Fund an amount equivalent to the amount of benefits paid out to claimants who during the applicable period were paid wages by the employer concerned, said election to be made in writing to the administrator in accordance with the provisions of subsection (g) of section 31-225. Any employer may revoke acceptance of voluntary liability at the end of any calendar year following the calendar year in which he made such acceptance if he gives written notice to the administrator, accompanied by proof satisfactory to the administrator that he has paid all contributions due under the provisions of this chapter and that he has notified his employees of his intention to revoke such acceptance; such application to revoke acceptance shall be submitted within thirty days after the end of a calendar year and the administrator shall render his decision on such application within sixty days after submission thereof and such revocation of acceptance shall be effective on the thirty-first day of December next preceding the giving of written notice from the administrator to the employer that he is satisfied with such proofs.\n\n(c)Release from liability.An employer may cease to be subject to this chapter at the end of any calendar year following the calendar year in which he became subject to this chapter if he gives written notice to the administrator, accompanied by proof satisfactory to the administrator that he has not employed one employee for at least thirteen weeks during the next-preceding fifteen months, that he is not subject to the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, and that he has notified his employees of his intention to cease to be subject to this chapter; such application for release shall be submitted within thirty days after the end of a calendar year and the administrator shall render his decision on such application within sixty days after submission thereof and the employer shall cease to be subject to this chapter on the thirty-first day of December next preceding the giving of written notice from the administrator to the employer that he is satisfied with such proofs. The administrator shall waive the requirement for an application for release whenever it shall appear that the employer was unable to comply with such requirement for the reason that, at the time when he had qualified for release from liability under the provisions of this chapter, he was in good faith not aware of the fact that he was subject to the provisions of this chapter. An employer who discontinues his business and enters the armed forces of the United States shall cease immediately to be subject to this chapter.\n\n(d)Employment to include out-of-state service.For the purposes of subdivisions (5) and (7) of subsection (a) of this section, employment shall include service which would constitute employment but for the fact that such service is deemed to be performed entirely within another state pursuant to an election under an arrangement entered into with such state by the administrator and an agency charged with the administration of any other state or federal unemployment compensation law.\n\n(e)Calendar week when December 31 and January 1 in same week.For the purposes of subdivisions (3)(B) and (5) of subsection (a) of this section, in respect to any week including both December thirty-first and January first, the days of that week to and including December thirty-first shall be deemed one calendar week, and the days beginning and including January first another such week.\n\n(f)Employer not previously subject to chapter.

If the administrator determines that a person has acquired such assets solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower contribution rate, the administrator shall require such person to pay contributions at the rate provided in subsection (d) of section 31-225a for an employer who has not been chargeable with benefits for a sufficient period of time to have such employer's rate otherwise computed under section 31-225a or, where applicable, the person's charged tax rate, as provided in subsection (e) of section 31-225a, whichever is greater. In determining whether the assets, organization, trade or business of an employer was acquired solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower contribution rate, the factors the administrator shall consider shall include, but not be limited to, the cost of acquiring the business, whether the person continued the business activity of the acquired business, how long the business was continued and whether a substantial number of new employees were hired for performance of duties unrelated to the business activity conducted by the business prior to its acquisition.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter relating to the transfer of unemployment experience, if an employer transfers its assets, organization, trade or business, or a portion of its assets, organization, trade or business, to another employer with whom, at the time of such transfer, the transferring employer shares substantially common ownership, management or control, the unemployment experience of the transferring employer shall be transferred to the receiving employer. The administrator shall recalculate the contribution rates of both employers and make such recalculated rates effective upon the date of the transfer. The administrator may require from any employer, whether or not otherwise subject to this chapter, any sworn or unsworn reports that are necessary for the effective administration of this section.\n\n(d) In addition to the penalty imposed pursuant to subsection (e) of this section and any applicable penalties under this chapter, if a person knowingly violates or attempts to violate any provision of subsection (b) or (c) of this section, or any other provision of this chapter relating to determining the assignment of a contribution rate, or knowingly advises another person in the violation of subsection (b) or (c) of this section, such person shall be subject to the following penalties:\n\n(1) If the person is an employer, such person shall be assigned a penalty rate of contributions of two per cent of taxable wages for the year during which such violation or attempted violation occurred and for the following three years.\n\n(2) If the person is not an employer, such person shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than five hundred dollars or more than five thousand dollars. Any such penalty shall be deposited into the Employment Security Special Administration Fund established under subsection (d) of section 31-259.\n\n(e) Any person who violates this section shall be fined not more than two thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.\n\n(f) This section shall be interpreted and applied in such a manner as to meet the minimum requirements of Public Law 108-295 as interpreted by the federal Department of Labor.\n\n(g) This section shall apply to unemployment compensation tax years beginning on and after January 1, 2006.\n\n(P.A. 05-85, S. 1; P.A. 06-196, S. 162; P.A. 24-147, S. 5.)\n\nHistory: This section was originally published as Sec. 31-223a in the 2006 Supplement to the General Statutes; P.A. 06-196 made technical changes in Subsec.

      "text": "(a) Each contributing employer who is subject to this chapter shall pay to the administrator contributions, which shall not be deducted or deductible from wages, at a rate which is established and adjusted in accordance with the provisions of section 31-225a, stated as a percentage of the wages paid by said employer with respect to employment. In no event shall any employer be required to pay contributions on any amount of wages for which said employer has previously paid contributions.\n\n(b) Contributions shall be payable quarterly or for such shorter periods of not less than four weeks as the administrator may determine, provided no such contribution period shall include parts of two calendar quarters.\n\n(c) Each contribution payment shall be made on or before the last day of the month next following the end of the period of employment with respect to which it is made. The administrator may make and publish regulations with reference to the details of the computation and payment of such contributions. Indian tribes or tribal units, which units include subdivisions, subsidiaries or business enterprises wholly owned by such Indian tribes, subject to subparagraphs (C) and (E) of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 31-222 and this section after December 20, 2000, shall pay contributions under the same terms and conditions as all other subject employers, unless they elect to pay into the Unemployment Compensation Fund amounts equal to the amount of benefits attributable to service in the employ of the Indian tribe.\n\n(d) In lieu of contributions required of employers subject to this chapter, the state shall pay into the Unemployment Compensation Fund an amount equivalent to the amount of benefits charged to the state as provided in section 31-225a, or may at its option make payments as provided in subdivision (1) of subsection (g) of this section for all regular and additional benefits, except that the state shall pay one hundred per cent of all extended benefits paid that are attributable to service in its employ. The amount of payments required under this section to be made into the fund shall be ascertained by the administrator as soon as practicable after the end of each calendar quarter and shall be payable from the General Fund of the state, except as provided hereafter. If a claimant to whom benefits were paid was paid wages by the state during the base period from a special or administrative fund provided for by law, the payment into the Unemployment Compensation Fund shall be made from such special or administrative fund with the approval of the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management. The payment by the state into the fund shall be made at such times and in such manner as the administrator may determine and prescribe.\n\n(e) In lieu of contributions required of employers subject to this chapter, Indian tribes, towns, cities and other political and governmental subdivisions of the state and of the towns and cities may pay into the Unemployment Compensation Fund an amount equivalent to the amount of benefits charged to such Indian tribe, town, city or other political or governmental subdivision as provided in section 31-225a, or may at its option make payments as provided in subdivision (1) of subsection (g) of this section for all regular and additional benefits, except that such entities shall pay one hundred per cent of all extended benefits paid that are attributable to service in their employ, provided Indian tribes shall determine if reimbursement for benefits paid is to be elected by the tribe as a whole, by individual tribal units or by combinations of the individual tribal units. The amount of payments required under this section to be made into the fund shall be ascertained by the administrator as soon as practicable after the end of each calendar quarter. The payments by such Indian tribe, town, city or political or governmental subdivision into the fund shall be made quarterly or at such times and in such manner as the administrator may determine and prescribe.\n\n(f) Payment of any bill rendered by the administrator under subsection (e) of this section shall be made not later than thirty days after such bill was mailed to the Indian tribe, municipality or political or governmental subdivision concerned, to the chief executive officer, clerk or other official or office having charge of making disbursements, or to the official or office designated by the Indian tribe, municipality or political governmental subdivision as authorized to receive such notices. Payments made under the provisions of subsection (e) of this section shall not be deducted or deductible, in whole or in part, from the remuneration of individuals in the employ of the employer. Past due payments of amounts due hereunder or under subsection (e) of this section shall be subject to the same interest that applies to section 31-265 to past due contributions.\n\n(1) Indian tribes or tribal units shall be billed for the full amount of benefits attributable to service in the employ of the Indian tribe or tribal unit on the same schedule as other employing units that have elected to make payments in lieu of contributions.\n\n(2) Failure of the Indian tribe or tribal unit to make required payments, including assessment of interest and penalty, within ninety days of receipt of the bill, shall cause the Indian tribe to lose the option to make payments in lieu of contributions, as described in subsection (e) of this section, for the following tax year unless payment in full is received or a payment schedule has been approved by the administrator or the administrator's designee before contribution rates for the next tax year are computed.\n\n(3) Any Indian tribe or tribal unit that loses the option to make payments in lieu of contributions due to late payment or nonpayment, as described in subdivision (1) of this subsection, shall have the option reinstated if, after a period of one year, all contributions have been made timely, provided no contributions, payments in lieu of contributions for benefits paid, penalties or interest remain outstanding.\n\n(4) Failure of the Indian tribe or any tribal unit thereof to make required payments, including assessments of interest and penalty, after all collection activities deemed necessary by the administrator have been exhausted, may cause services performed for such tribe to not be treated as “employment” for purposes of subsection (a) of section 31-222.\n\n(5) The administrator may determine that any Indian tribe or tribal unit that loses coverage under subdivision (4) of this subsection may have services performed for such tribe again included as “employment” for purposes of subsection (a) of section 31-222 if all contributions, payments in lieu of contributions, penalties and interest have been paid.\n\n(6) The administrator shall notify the United States Internal Revenue Service and the United States Department of Labor of: (A) Any failure of an Indian tribe or tribal unit to make payments required under this section, including assessments of interest and penalty, within ninety days of a final notice of delinquency; and (B) any termination or reinstatement of coverage made under subdivisions (4) and (5) of this subsection.\n\n(7) At the discretion of the administrator, any Indian tribe or tribal unit that elects to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall be required, within sixty days after the effective date of its election, to: (A) Execute and file with the administrator a surety bond approved by the administrator, or (B) deposit with the administrator money or securities on the same basis as other employers with the same election option.\n\n(8) Notices of payment and reporting delinquency to Indian tribes or tribal units pursuant to subsection (f) of this section shall include information that failure to make full payment within the prescribed time frame: (A) Shall cause the Indian tribe to be liable for taxes under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act; (B) shall cause the Indian tribe to lose the option to make payments in lieu of contributions; and (C) may cause any services performed in the employ of the Indian tribe to be excepted from the definition of “employment” as provided in subsection (a) of section 31-222.\n\n(g) Benefits paid to employees of nonprofit organizations shall be financed in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. For the purpose of this subsection, a nonprofit organization is an organization or group of organizations described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Federal Internal Revenue Code which is exempt from income tax under Section 501(a) of said code.\n\n(1) Any nonprofit organization which, pursuant to subdivision (1) (D) of subsection (a) of section 31-222 is, or becomes, subject to this chapter on or after January 1, 1971, shall pay contributions under the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, unless it elects, in accordance with this subparagraph, to pay to the administrator for the unemployment fund an amount equal to the amount of regular and additional benefits and of one-half of the extended benefits paid, that is attributable to service in the employ of such nonprofit organization. (A) Any nonprofit organization which is, or becomes, subject to this chapter on January 1, 1971, may elect to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions for a period of not less than one taxable year beginning with January 1, 1971, provided it shall file with the administrator a written notice of its election within the thirty-day period immediately following July 1, 1971. (B) Any nonprofit organization which becomes subject to this chapter after January 1, 1971, may elect to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions for a period of not less than twelve months beginning with the date on which it so becomes subject by filing a written notice of its election with the administrator not later than thirty days immediately following the date of the determination that it is so subject. (C) Any nonprofit organization which makes an election in accordance with subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of this subdivision shall continue to be liable for payments in lieu of contributions until it files with the administrator a written notice terminating its election not later than thirty days prior to the beginning of the taxable year for which such termination shall first be effective, provided liability for payments in lieu of contributions shall continue for any benefits attributable to service in the employ of such organization while it was electing payments in lieu of contributions. For purposes of benefit ratio and for billing purposes, an organization which terminates its election of payments in lieu of contributions shall be treated as two separate employers. (D) Any nonprofit organization which has been paying contributions under this chapter for a period subsequent to January 1, 1971, may change to a reimbursable basis by filing with the administrator not later than thirty days prior to the beginning of any taxable year a written notice of election to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions. Such election shall not be terminable by the organization for that and the next year. (E) The administrator may for good cause extend the period within which a notice of election, or a notice of termination, must be filed and may permit an election to be retroactive but not any earlier than with respect to benefits paid after December 31, 1970. (F) The administrator, in accordance with such regulations as the administrator may prescribe, shall notify each nonprofit organization of any determination which the administrator may make of its status as an employer and of the effective date of any election which it makes and of any termination of such election. Such determinations shall be subject to reconsideration, appeal and review in accordance with the provisions of this chapter applicable to determination, appeal and review.\n\n(2) Payments in lieu of contributions shall be made in accordance with the following provisions: (A) At the end of each calendar quarter, or at the end of any other period as determined by the administrator, the administrator shall bill each nonprofit organization or group of such organizations which has elected to make payments in lieu of contributions for an amount equal to the full amount of regular and additional benefits plus one-half of the amount of extended benefits paid during such quarter or other prescribed period that is attributable to service in the employ of such organization. (B) Payment of any bill rendered under this subsection shall be made not later than thirty days after such bill was mailed to the last-known address of the nonprofit organization or was otherwise delivered to it, unless there has been an application for review and redetermination in accordance with subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. (C) Payments made by any nonprofit organization under the provisions of this subsection shall not be deducted or deductible, in whole or in part, from the remuneration of individuals in the employ of the organization. (D) The amount due specified in any bill from the administrator shall be conclusive on the organization unless, within the time prescribed in section 31-241 after the bill was mailed to its last-known address or otherwise delivered to it, the organization files an application for redetermination by the administrator or an appeal in the manner provided in sections 31-241 and 31-242 setting forth the grounds for such application or appeal. The administrator or referee, as the case may be, shall promptly review and reconsider the amount due specified in the bill and shall thereafter issue a redetermination or decision, as applicable in any case in which such application for redetermination or appeal has been filed. Any redetermination by the administrator shall be conclusive on the organization unless, within the time prescribed in section 31-241 after the redetermination was mailed to its last-known address or otherwise delivered to it, the organization files an appeal in the manner prescribed in sections 31-241 and 31-242, setting forth the grounds for the appeal. The decision of the referee shall become final on the twenty-second day after the date of its rendition unless the party aggrieved thereby, including the administrator, files an appeal in the manner provided in section 31-249, setting forth the grounds for the appeal. Redeterminations by the administrator shall be governed by the provisions of section 31-243. Proceedings on appeal to the unemployment compensation referee from the amount of a bill rendered under this subsection or a redetermination of such amount shall be in accordance with the provisions of section 31-242 and the decision of the referee shall be subject to the provisions of sections 31-248 and 31-249. (E) Past due payments of amounts in lieu of contributions shall be subject to the same interest that, pursuant to section 31-265 applies to past due contributions; an employer electing reimbursement is subject to the same penalties provided under this chapter as employers paying contributions.\n\n(3) If the administrator at any time deems it necessary because of the financial condition of the organization, any nonprofit organization that elects to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall be required, within thirty days, to execute and file with the administrator a surety bond approved by the administrator or it may elect instead to deposit with the administrator cash or securities. The amount of such bond or deposit shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision. (A) The amount of the bond or deposit required by this subdivision shall be determined by the administrator but shall not exceed a percentage of the organization's annual taxable payroll equal to the maximum rate that any employer liable for contributions during the year involved would have to pay for employment as defined in subsection (b) of section 31-222 for the four calendar quarters immediately preceding the effective date of the election, the renewal date in the case of a bond, or the biennial anniversary of the effective date of election in the case of a deposit of cash or securities, whichever date shall be most recent and applicable. If the nonprofit organization did not pay wages in each of such four calendar quarters, the amount of the bond or deposit shall be as determined by the administrator. The term “cash” includes certified or bank checks or other guaranteed instruments. (B) Any bond deposited under this subdivision shall be in force for a period of not less than two taxable years and shall be renewed with the approval of the administrator, at such times as the administrator may prescribe, but not less frequently than at two-year intervals as long as the organization continues to be liable for payments in lieu of contributions. The administrator shall require adjustments to be made in a previously filed bond as the administrator deems appropriate. If the bond is to be increased, the adjusted bond shall be filed by the organization within thirty days of the date notice of the required adjustment was mailed or otherwise delivered to it. Failure by any organization covered by such bond to pay the full amount of payments in lieu of contributions when due, together with any applicable interest and penalties provided for in subdivision (2) (E) of this subsection, shall render the surety liable on such bond to the extent of the bond, as though the surety was such organization. (C) Any deposit of cash or securities in accordance with this subdivision shall be retained by the administrator in an escrow account until liability under the election is terminated, at which time it shall be returned to the organization, less any deductions as hereinafter provided. The administrator may deduct from the cash deposited under this subdivision by a nonprofit organization or sell the securities it has so deposited to the extent necessary to satisfy any due and unpaid payments in lieu of contributions and any applicable interest and penalties provided for in subdivision (2) (E) of this subsection. The administrator shall require the organization within thirty days following any deduction from a cash deposit or sale of deposited securities under the provisions of this subparagraph to deposit sufficient additional cash or securities to make whole the organization's deposit at the prior level. Any cash remaining from the sale of such securities shall be a part of the organization's escrow account. The administrator may, at any time, review the adequacy of the deposit made by any organization. If, as a result of such review, the administrator determines that an adjustment is necessary, said administrator shall require the organization to make additional deposit within thirty days of written notice of determination or shall return to it such portion of the deposit as the administrator no longer considers necessary, whichever action is appropriate. Disposition of income from securities held in escrow shall be governed by any applicable provision of state law. (D) If any nonprofit organization fails to file a bond or make a deposit, or to file a bond in an increased amount or to increase or make whole the amount of a previously made deposit, as provided under this subdivision, the administrator may terminate such organization's election to make payments in lieu of contributions and such termination shall continue for not less than the four-consecutive-calendar-quarter period beginning with the quarter in which such termination becomes effective; provided the administrator may extend for good cause the applicable filing, deposit or adjustment period by not more than fifteen days.\n\n(4) If any nonprofit organization is delinquent in making payments in lieu of contributions as required under subdivision (2) of this subsection, and a bond or security as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection has not been required, or required and not filed within thirty days, the administrator may terminate such organization's election to make payments in lieu of contributions as of the beginning of the next taxable year, and such termination shall be effective for that and the next taxable year.\n\n(5) Each employer that is liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall pay to the administrator for the fund the amount of regular and additional benefits plus the amount of one-half of extended benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of such employer. If benefits paid to an individual are based on wages paid by more than one employer and one or more of such employers are liable for payments in lieu of contributions, the amount payable to the fund by each employer that is liable for such payments, shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid to the individual as the total base period wages paid to the individual by such employer bear to the total base period wages paid to the individual by all of the individual's base period employers.\n\n(6) Any two or more employers that have become liable for payments in lieu of contributions may file a joint application to the administrator for the establishment of a group account for the purpose of sharing the cost of benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of such employers. Each such application shall identify and authorize a group representative to act as the group's agent for the purposes of this subdivision. Upon the administrator's approval of the application, the administrator shall establish a group account for such employers effective as of the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the administrator receives the application and shall notify the group's representative of the effective date of the account. Such account shall remain in effect for not less than one year and thereafter until terminated at the discretion of the administrator or upon application by the group. Upon establishment of the account, each member of the group shall be liable for payments in lieu of contributions with respect to each calendar quarter in the amount that bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid in such quarter that are attributable to service performed in the employ of all members of the group as the total wages paid for service in employment by such member in such quarter bear to the total wages paid during such quarter for service performed in the employ of all members of the group. The administrator shall prescribe such regulations as he or she deems necessary with respect to applications for establishment, maintenance and termination of group accounts that are authorized by this subdivision, for addition of new members to, and withdrawal of active members from, such accounts, and for the determination of the amounts that are payable under this subdivision by members of the group and the time and manner of such payments.\n\n(h) Subsections (a) to (g), inclusive, of this section shall first apply to benefits charged with respect to benefits paid in benefit years starting on or after June 30, 1975.\n\n(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of the general statutes to the contrary, any employer, individual, organization, partnership, corporation or other legal entity which engages, in any manner, in contract construction activity in this state and which has its base of operations and is incorporated in another state, shall furnish to the administrator before beginning any such construction activity, a bond, with a surety or sureties satisfactory to the administrator, in an amount to be determined by the administrator. The administrator shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, establishing the method for computation of such bond amounts. The use of such bonds shall be limited to payment for any unpaid unemployment compensation contributions, interest and penalties due from such contractor and attributable to such contracted work.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 7497; 1949, S. 3063d; 1953, S. 3064d; 1957, P.A. 596, S. 2, 3; 1969, P.A. 700, S. 3; 1971, P.A. 835, S. 7–9; 1972, P.A. 71, S. 3; P.A. 73-289, S. 1, 4–6, 10; 73-536, S. 3, 12; P.A. 74-229, S. 1, 15, 16, 22; P.A. 75-525, S. 2, 13; P.A. 76-435, S. 12, 13, 82; P.A. 77-426, S. 1, 19; 77-614, S. 19, 610; P.A. 78-368, S. 3, 11; P.A. 80-250; P.A. 81-318, S. 2, 8; 81-472, S. 60, 141, 159; June 18 Sp.

An employer's maximum total liability for such benefits with respect to a claimant's benefit year shall bear the same ratio to the maximum total benefits payable to the claimant as the total wages paid by the employer to the claimant within his or her base period bears to the total wages paid by all employers to the claimant within his or her base period. This ratio shall also be applied to each benefit payment. The amount thus determined, rounded to the nearest dollar with fractions of a dollar of exactly fifty cents rounded upward, shall be charged to the employer's account.\n\n(c) (1) (A) Any week for which the employer has compensated the claimant in the form of wages in lieu of notice, dismissal payments or any similar payment for loss of wages shall be considered a week of employment for the purpose of determining employer chargeability.\n\n(B) No benefits shall be charged to any employer who paid wages of five hundred dollars or less to the claimant in his or her base period.\n\n(C) No dependency allowance paid to a claimant shall be charged to any employer.\n\n(D) In the event of a natural disaster declared by the President of the United States, no benefits paid on the basis of total or partial unemployment that is the result of physical damage to a place of employment caused by severe weather conditions including, but not limited to, hurricanes, snow storms, ice storms or flooding, or fire except where caused by the employer, shall be charged to any employer.\n\n(E) If the administrator finds that (i) an individual's most recent separation from a base period employer occurred under conditions that would result in disqualification by reason of subdivision (2), (6) or (9) of subsection (a) of section 31-236, or (ii) an individual was discharged for violating an employer's drug testing policy, provided the policy has been adopted and applied consistent with sections 31-51t to 31-51aa, inclusive, section 14-261b and any applicable federal law, no benefits paid thereafter to such individual with respect to any week of unemployment that is based upon wages paid by such employer with respect to employment prior to such separation shall be charged to such employer's account, provided such employer shall have filed a notice with the administrator within the time allowed for appeal in section 31-241.\n\n(F) No base period employer's account shall be charged with respect to benefits paid to a claimant if such employer continues to employ such claimant at the time the employer's account would otherwise have been charged to the same extent that he or she employed him or her during the individual's base period, provided the employer shall notify the administrator within the time allowed for appeal in section 31-241.\n\n(G) If a claimant has failed to accept suitable employment under the provisions of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 31-236 and the disqualification has been imposed, the account of the employer who makes an offer of employment to a claimant who was a former employee shall not be charged with any benefit payments made to such claimant after such initial offer of reemployment until such time as such claimant resumes employment with such employer, provided such employer shall make application therefor in a form acceptable to the administrator. The administrator shall notify such employer whether or not his or her application is granted. Any decision of the administrator denying suspension of charges as herein provided may be appealed within the time allowed for appeal in section 31-241.\n\n(H) Fifty per cent of benefits paid to a claimant under the federal-state extended duration unemployment benefits program established by the federal Employment Security Act shall be charged to the experience accounts of the claimant's base period employers in the same manner as the regular benefits paid for such benefit year.\n\n(I) No base period employer's account shall be charged with respect to benefits paid to a claimant who voluntarily left suitable work with such employer (i) to care for a seriously ill spouse, parent or child, or (ii) due to the discontinuance of the transportation used by the claimant to get to and from work, as provided in subparagraphs (A)(ii) and (A)(iii) of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 31-236.\n\n(J) No base period employer's account shall be charged with respect to benefits paid to a claimant who has been discharged or suspended because the claimant has been disqualified from performing the work for which he or she was hired due to the loss of such claimant's operator license as a result of a drug or alcohol test or testing program conducted in accordance with section 14-44k, 14-227a or 14-227b while the claimant was off duty.\n\n(K) No base period employer's account shall be charged with respect to benefits paid to a claimant whose separation from employment is attributable to the return of an individual who was absent from work due to a bona fide leave taken pursuant to sections 31-49f to 31-49t, inclusive, or 31-51kk to 31-51qq, inclusive.\n\n(L) On and after January 1, 2024, (i) no base period employer's account shall be charged with respect to benefits paid to a claimant through the voluntary shared work unemployment compensation program established pursuant to section 31-274j, if a claim for benefits is filed in a week in which the average rate of total unemployment in the state equals or exceeds six and one-half per cent based on the most recent three months of data published by the Labor Commissioner, and (ii) the Labor Commissioner may determine that no base period employer's account shall be charged with respect to benefits paid to a claimant through the voluntary shared work unemployment compensation program established pursuant to section 31-274j, if a claim for benefits is filed in a week in which the average rate of total unemployment in the state equals or exceeds eight per cent in the most recent one month of data published by the Labor Commissioner.\n\n(2) All benefits paid that are not charged to any employer shall be pooled.\n\n(3) The noncharging provisions of this chapter, except subparagraphs (D), (F) and (K) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, shall not apply to reimbursing employers.\n\n(d) (1) The standard rate of contributions shall be five and four-tenths per cent. Each employer who has not been chargeable with benefits, for a sufficient period of time to have his or her rate computed under this section shall pay contributions at a rate that is the higher of (A) one per cent, or (B) the state's five-year benefit cost rate. For purposes of this subsection, the state's five-year benefit cost rate shall be computed annually on or before June thirtieth and shall be derived by dividing the total dollar amount of benefits paid to claimants under this chapter during the five consecutive calendar years immediately preceding the computation date by the five-year payroll during the same period, except that, to the extent allowed by federal law and as necessary to respond to the spread of COVID-19, for any taxable year commencing on or after January 1, 2022, the state's five-year benefit cost rate shall be calculated without regard to benefit payments and taxable wages for calendar years 2020 and 2021, when applicable.\n\n(2) For the period beginning January 1, 2023, and ending December 31, 2023, the state's five-year benefit cost rate shall be calculated pursuant to the formula under subdivision (1) of this subsection minus two-tenths of one per cent.\n\n(3) If the resulting quotient in this subsection is not an exact multiple of one-tenth of one per cent, the five-year benefit cost rate shall be the next higher such multiple.\n\n(e) (1) (A) As of each June thirtieth, the administrator shall determine the charged tax rate for each qualified employer. Such rate shall be obtained by calculating a benefit ratio for each qualified employer. The employer's benefit ratio shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the total amount chargeable to the employer's experience account during the experience period by the total of his or her taxable wages during such experience period that have been reported by the employer to the administrator on or before the following September thirtieth. The resulting quotient, expressed as a per cent, shall constitute the employer's charged rate, except that each employer's charged rate for calendar years 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027 shall be divided by 1.471, 1.269, 1.125 and 1.053, respectively.\n\n(i) For calendar years commencing prior to January 1, 2024, if the resulting quotient is not an exact multiple of one-tenth of one per cent, the charged rate shall be the next higher such multiple, except that if the resulting quotient is less than five-tenths of one per cent, the charged rate shall be five-tenths of one per cent and if the resulting quotient is greater than five and four-tenths per cent, the charged rate shall be five and four-tenths per cent.\n\n(ii) For calendar years commencing on or after January 1, 2024, if the resulting quotient is not an exact multiple of one-tenth of one per cent, the charged rate shall be the next higher such multiple, except that if the resulting quotient is less than one-tenth of one per cent, the charged rate shall be one-tenth of one per cent and if the resulting quotient is greater than ten per cent, the charged rate shall be ten per cent.\n\n(B) For the calendar years commencing on and after January 1, 2024, if the benefit ratios calculated pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this subdivision would result in the average benefit ratio of all employers within a sector of the North American Industry Classification System increasing over the prior calendar year's such average by an amount equal to or greater than .01, the benefit ratio of each employer within such sector shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to one-half of the increase in the average benefit ratio of all employers within such sector. Sectors 21 and 23 of said system shall be considered one sector for the purposes of this subparagraph.\n\n(2) (A) Each contributing employer subject to this chapter shall pay an assessment to the administrator at a rate established by the administrator sufficient to pay interest due on advances from the federal unemployment account under Title XII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S. Code Sections 1321 to 1324). The administrator shall establish the necessary procedures for payment of such assessments. The amounts received by the administrator based on such assessments shall be paid over to the State Treasurer and credited to the General Fund. Any amount remaining from such assessments, after all such federal interest charges have been paid, shall be transferred to the Employment Security Administration Fund or to the Unemployment Compensation Advance Fund established under section 31-264a, (i) to the extent that any federal interest charges have been paid from the Unemployment Compensation Advance Fund, (ii) to the extent that the administrator determines that reimbursement is appropriate, or (iii) otherwise to the extent that reimbursement of the advance fund is the appropriate accounting principle governing the use of the assessments. Sections 31-265 to 31-274, inclusive, shall apply to the collection of such assessments.\n\n(B) On and after January 1, 1994, and conditioned upon the issuance of any revenue bonds pursuant to section 31-264b, each contributing employer shall also pay an assessment to the administrator at a rate established by the administrator sufficient to pay the interest due on advances from the Unemployment Compensation Advance Fund and reimbursements required for advances from the Unemployment Compensation Advance Fund, computed in accordance with subsection (h) of section 31-264a. The administrator shall establish the assessments as a percentage of the charged tax rate for each employer pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection. The administrator shall establish the necessary procedures for billing, payment and collection of the assessments. Sections 31-265 to 31-274, inclusive, shall apply to the collection of such assessments by the administrator. The payments received by the administrator based on the assessments, excluding interest and penalties on past due assessments, are hereby pledged and shall be paid over to the State Treasurer for credit to the Unemployment Compensation Advance Fund.\n\n(f) (1) (A) For each calendar year commencing with calendar year 1994 but prior to calendar year 2013, the administrator shall establish a fund balance tax rate sufficient to maintain a balance in the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund equal to eight-tenths of one per cent of the total wages paid to workers covered under this chapter by contributing employers during the year ending the last preceding June thirtieth. If the fund balance tax rate established by the administrator results in a fund balance in excess of said per cent as of December thirtieth of any year, the administrator shall, in the year next following, establish a fund balance tax rate sufficient to eliminate the fund balance in excess of said per cent.\n\n(B) For each calendar year commencing with calendar year 2013, the administrator shall establish a fund balance tax rate sufficient to maintain a balance in the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund that results in an average high cost multiple equal to 0.5.\n\n(C) Commencing with calendar year 2014 and ending with calendar year 2018, the administrator shall establish a fund balance tax rate sufficient to maintain a balance in the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund that results in an average high cost multiple that is increased by 0.1 from the preceding calendar year.\n\n(D) Commencing with calendar year 2019, the administrator shall establish a fund balance tax rate sufficient to maintain a balance in the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund that results in an average high cost multiple equal to 1.0. If the fund balance tax rate established by the administrator results in a fund balance in excess of the amount prescribed in this subdivision as of December thirtieth of any year, the administrator shall, in the year next following, establish a fund balance rate sufficient to eliminate the fund balance in excess of said amount.\n\n(E) The assessment levied by the administrator at any time (i) during a calendar year commencing on or after January 1, 1994, but prior to January 1, 1999, shall not exceed one and five-tenths per cent, (ii) during a calendar year commencing on or after January 1, 1999, but prior to January 1, 2013, shall not exceed one and four-tenths per cent, and shall not be calculated to result in a fund balance in excess of eight-tenths of one per cent of such total wages, (iii) during a calendar year commencing on or after January 1, 2013, but prior to January 1, 2024, shall not exceed one and four-tenths per cent and shall not be calculated to result in a fund balance in excess of the amounts prescribed in this subdivision, (iv) during the calendar year beginning January 1, 2023, and ending December 31, 2023, shall not exceed one and two-tenths per cent and shall not be calculated to result in a fund balance in excess of the amounts prescribed in this subdivision, and (v) during a calendar year commencing on or after January 1, 2024, shall not exceed one per cent and shall not be calculated to result in a fund balance in excess of the amounts prescribed in this subdivision.\n\n(F) During a calendar year that begins during an economic recession declared by the National Bureau of Economic Research on or before November fifteenth of the prior calendar year, the assessment levied by the administrator shall not exceed one-half of one per cent unless such maximum rate jeopardizes the state's access to interest-free federal advances, including, but not limited to, those offered pursuant to 42 USC 1322 and subject to the funding goals established in 20 CFR 606.32, as amended from time to time.\n\n(2) The average high cost multiple shall be computed as follows: The result of the balance of the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund on December thirtieth immediately preceding the new rate year divided by the total wages paid to workers covered under this chapter by contributing employers for the twelve months ending on the December thirtieth immediately preceding the new rate year shall be the numerator and the average of the three highest calendar benefit cost rates in (A) the last twenty years, or (B) a period including the last three recessions, whichever is longer, shall be the denominator. Benefit cost rates are computed as benefits paid including the state's share of extended benefits but excluding reimbursable benefits as a per cent of total wages in covered employment. The results rounded to the next lower one decimal place will be the average high cost multiple.\n\n(g) Each qualified employer's contribution rate for each calendar year after 1973 shall be a percentage rate equal to the sum of his or her charged tax rate as of the June thirtieth preceding such calendar year and the fund balance tax rate as of December thirtieth preceding such calendar year.\n\n(h) (1) With respect to each benefit year commencing on or after July 1, 1978, notice of determination of the claimant's benefit entitlement for such benefit year shall include notice of the allocation of benefit charges of the claimant's base period employers and each such employer shall be provided a copy of such notice of determination and shall be an interested party thereto. Such determination shall be final unless the claimant or any of such employers files an appeal from such decision in accordance with the provisions of section 31-241.\n\n(2) The administrator shall, not less frequently than once each calendar quarter, provide a statement of charges to each employer to whose experience record any charges have been made since the last previous such statement. Such statement shall show, with respect to each week for which benefits have been paid and charged, the name and Social Security account number of the claimant who was paid the benefit, the amount of the benefits charged for such week and the total amount charged in the quarter.\n\n(3) The statement of charges provided for in subdivision (2) of this subsection shall constitute notice to the employer that it has been determined that the benefits reported in such statement were properly payable under this chapter to the claimants for the weeks and in the amounts shown in such statements. If the employer contends that benefits have been improperly charged due to fraud or error, a written protest setting forth reasons therefor shall be filed with the administrator within sixty days of the date the quarterly statement was provided. An eligibility issue shall not be reopened on the basis of such quarterly statement if notification of such eligibility issue had previously been given to the employer under the provisions of section 31-241, and he or she failed to file a timely appeal therefrom or had the issue finally resolved against him or her.\n\n(4) The provisions of subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection shall not apply to combined wage claims paid under subsection (b) of section 31-255. For such combined wage claims paid under the unemployment law of other states, the administrator shall, each calendar quarter, provide a statement of charges to each employer whose experience record has been charged since the previous such statement. Such statement shall show the name and Social Security number of the claimant who was paid the benefits and the total amount of the benefits charged in the quarter.\n\n(i) (1) At the written request of any employer that holds at least eighty per cent controlling interest in another employer or employers, the administrator may mingle the experience rating records of such dominant and controlled employers as if they constituted a single employer, subject to such regulations as the administrator may make and publish concerning the establishment, conduct and dissolution of such joint experience rating records.\n\n(2) The executors, administrators, successors or assigns of any former employer shall acquire the experience rating records of the predecessor employer with the following exception: The experience of a predecessor employer, who leased premises and equipment from a third party and who has not transferred any assets to the successor, shall not be transferred if there is no common controlling interest in the predecessor and successor entities.\n\n(3) The administrator is authorized to establish such regulations governing joint accounts as may be necessary to comply with the requirements of the federal Unemployment Tax Act.\n\n(j) (1) (A) Each employer subject to this chapter shall submit quarterly, on forms supplied by the administrator, a listing of wage information, including the name of each employee receiving wages in employment subject to this chapter, such employee's Social Security account number and the amount of wages paid to such employee during such calendar quarter.\n\n(B) Commencing with the third calendar quarter of 2026, any employer subject to this chapter may include in the quarterly filing submitted pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, the following data for each employee receiving wages in employment subject to this chapter: Such employee's occupation, such employee's hours worked and the business mailing address zip code of the employer of such employee.\n\n(2) Each employer subject to this chapter that reports wages for employees receiving wages in employment subject to this chapter, and each person or organization that, as an agent, reports wages for employees receiving wages in employment subject to this chapter on behalf of one or more employers subject to this chapter shall submit quarterly the information required by subdivision (1) of this subsection electronically, in a format and manner prescribed by the administrator, unless such employer or agent receives a waiver pursuant to subdivision (5) of this subsection.\n\n(3) Any employer that fails to submit the information required by subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of this subsection in a timely manner, as determined by the administrator, shall be liable to the administrator for a late filing fee of twenty-five dollars. Any employer that fails to submit the information required by subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of this subsection under a proper state unemployment compensation registration number shall be liable to the administrator for a fee of twenty-five dollars. All fees collected by the administrator under this subdivision shall be deposited in the Employment Security Administration Fund.\n\n(4) Each employer subject to this chapter that makes contributions or payments in lieu of contributions for employees receiving wages in employment subject to this chapter, and each person or organization that, as an agent, makes contributions or payments in lieu of contributions for employees receiving wages in employment subject to this chapter on behalf of one or more employers subject to this chapter shall make such contributions or payments in lieu of contributions electronically.\n\n(5) Any employer or any person or organization that, as an agent, is required to submit information pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection or make contributions or payments in lieu of contributions pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection may request in writing, not later than thirty days prior to the date a submission of information or a contribution or payment in lieu of contribution is due, that the administrator waive such requirement. The administrator shall grant such request if, on the basis of information provided by such employer or person or organization and on a form prescribed by the administrator, the administrator finds that there would be undue hardship for such employer or person or organization. The administrator shall promptly inform such employer or person or organization of the granting or rejection of the requested waiver. The decision of the administrator shall be final and not subject to further review or appeal. Such waiver shall be effective for twelve months from the date such waiver is granted.\n\n(k) The employer may inspect his or her account records in the office of the Employment Security Division at any reasonable time.\n\n(P.A. 73-536, S. 4, 12; P.A. 74-229, S. 2–8, 22; P.A. 75-525, S. 3, 13; P.A. 76-74; 76-79; 76-82; 76-88; 76-98; 76-161; 76-259, S. 1, 3; P.A. 77-426, S. 2, 19; P.A. 78-368, S. 4, 5, 11; P.A. 79-187, S. 1; 79-191; 79-631, S. 91, 111; P.A. 80-483, S. 154, 186; P.A. 81-12, S. 1; 81-472, S. 61, 62, 142, 143, 159; P.A. 82-29, S. 1; P.A. 83-547, S. 1, 12; 83-587, S. 49, 96; P.A. 84-312, S. 1, 3; P.A. 85-25; 85-258, S. 2; P.A. 87-76; 87-341, S. 1, 2; P.A. 89-58; P.A. 90-314, S. 1, 3; P.A. 93-243, S. 3, 15; 93-419, S. 1, 9; P.A. 04-60, S. 3; P.A. 05-288, S. 136; P.A. 07-217, S. 145; P.A. 08-60, S. 1; P.A. 09-6, S. 5; P.A. 12-46, S. 1; P.A. 13-66, S. 3; 13-141, S. 1; 13-288, S. 2; P.A. 15-158, S. 1; P.A. 16-169, S. 1; P.A. 19-25, S. 26; 19-117, S. 235; P.A. 21-5, S. 1, 2; 21-200, S. 2; June Sp.

In no event shall a benefit year be established before the termination of an existing benefit year previously established under the provisions of this chapter. Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the base period of a benefit year shall be the first four of the five most recently completed calendar quarters prior to such benefit year, provided such quarters were not previously used to establish a prior valid benefit year and provided further, the base period with respect to a combined wage claim, as described in subsection (b) of section 31-255, shall be the base period of the paying state, except that for any individual who is eligible to receive or is receiving workers' compensation or who is properly absent from work under the terms of the employer's sick leave or disability leave policy, the base period shall be the four consecutive quarters immediately preceding the most recently worked quarter prior to such benefit year, provided such quarters were not previously used to establish a prior valid benefit year and provided further, the last most recently worked calendar quarter is no more than twelve calendar quarters prior to the date such individual makes an initiating claim. As used in this section, an initiating claim shall be deemed valid if the individual is unemployed and meets the requirements of subdivisions (1) and (3) of subsection (a) of section 31-235. The base period of an individual's benefit year shall include wages paid by any nonprofit organization electing reimbursement in lieu of contributions, or by the state and by any town, city or other political or governmental subdivision of or in this state or of any municipality to such person with respect to whom such employer is subject to the provisions of this chapter. With respect to weeks of unemployment beginning on or after January 1, 1978, wages for insured work shall include wages paid for previously uncovered services. For purposes of this section, the term “previously uncovered services” means services that (1) were not employment, as defined in section 31-222, and were not services covered pursuant to section 31-223, at any time during the one-year period ending December 31, 1975; and (2) (A) are agricultural labor, as defined in subparagraph (H) of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 31-222, or domestic service, as defined in subparagraph (J) of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 31-222, or (B) are services performed by an employee of this state or a political subdivision of this state, as provided in subparagraph (C) of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 31-222, or by an employee of a nonprofit educational institution that is not an institution of higher education, as provided in subparagraph (E)(iii) of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 31-222, except to the extent that assistance under Title II of the Emergency Jobs and Unemployment Assistance Act of 1974 was paid on the basis of such services.\n\n(b) The base period of a benefit year for any individual who is ineligible to receive benefits using the base period set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall be the four most recently completed calendar quarters prior to the individual's benefit year, provided such quarters were not previously used to establish a prior valid benefit year, except that for any such individual who is eligible to receive or is receiving workers' compensation or who is properly absent from work under the terms of an employer's sick leave or disability leave policy, the base period shall be the four consecutive quarters immediately preceding the most recently worked quarter prior to such benefit year, provided such quarters were not previously used to establish a prior valid benefit year and provided further, the last most recently worked calendar quarter is not more than twelve calendar quarters prior to the date such individual makes the initiating claim. If the wage information for an individual's most recently worked calendar quarter is unavailable to the administrator from regular quarterly reports of systematically accessible wage information, the administrator shall promptly contact the individual's employer to obtain such wage information.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 7503; 1949, 1953, S. 3068d; 1969, P.A. 700, S. 4; 1971, P.A. 835, S. 12; P.A. 73-78; P.A. 75-334; 75-525, S. 7, 13; P.A. 77-115; 77-426, S. 5, 19; P.A. 79-40; 79-376, S. 30; P.A. 83-421; May 9 Sp.

Sess. P.A. 02-7 designated existing provisions as Subsec. (a) and made technical changes therein, added new Subsec. (b) to establish a temporary, alternative method for calculating the base period of a benefit year for individuals ineligible to receive benefits using the original base period set forth in Subsec. (a), and added new Subsec. (c) to require the administrator to adopt regulations implementing the alternative base period authorized by Subsec. (b), effective August 15, 2002; P.A. 05-34 amended Subsec. (b) to extend period during which alternative base period may be calculated to December 31, 2007, and deleted former Subsec. (c) re adoption of regulations; P.A. 07-193 amended Subsec. (b) by eliminating sunset date and making alternative base period permanent; P.A. 19-117 added references to consecutive quarters in Subsecs. (a) and (b), effective June 26, 2019; P.A. 21-141 amended base period of benefit year for individual who is eligible to receive or is receiving workers' compensation or is properly absent from work under employer's sick leave or disability leave policy and made conforming changes, effective July 7, 2021.\n\nSection is constitutional; does not impair vested rights. 137 C. 129. Workers' compensation benefits do not qualify as “wages” within meaning of Sec. 31-222(b)(1) and therefore could not be used to determine the base period of a benefit year under section. 239 C. 233.\n\nCited. 17 CA 441.\n\nCited. 44 CS 285.",

The administrator shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, for the administration of the profiling system and the Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessment program.

The word “paid” does not mean “payable”, and since all wages paid plaintiff were paid to him in one calendar quarter, he was not eligible to receive unemployment benefits. 135 C. 667.

(a)(2):\n\nTo be available for work one must be ready, able and willing to accept suitable employment; must be exposed unequivocally to the labor market; eligibility for unemployment compensation discussed. 142 C. 160. Plaintiff attending school during the day held not available for work as he limited his availability for “first shift” work for a personal reason unrelated to his employment. 148 C. 475. Mere fact that person places certain restrictions on type of work he is willing to accept does not, in itself, make him unavailable for work within intent and meaning of section; work at a lesser skill and lower wages should not be deemed suitable unless claimant has been given a reasonable period in which to compete in the labor market for available jobs at his higher skill or related skills. 150 C. 278. Uncontroverted testimony concerning efforts to find work and willingness to rearrange a college schedule do not establish rights to benefits where referee not convinced that plaintiff would or could rearrange class schedule and that she was looking for work. 174 C. 527. Cited. 177 C. 132.\n\nClaimant's primary devotion to self-employment activities in business open 7 days a week with one other person who lacked relevant business expertise renders claimant unavailable for work and disqualifies him from receiving benefits. 139 CA 26.\n\n“Available for work”; affected by pregnancy. 7 CS 375; 13 CS 32.

Wife who voluntarily left employment to reside in a distant area where husband was stationed wherein suitable opportunities were restricted was not “available”. 13 CS 423. In absence of finding that claimant refused to accept work, conclusion that she was not “available” was unwarranted. 15 CS 50. “Available for work” means available for employer's work and not necessarily for some other work. 17 CS 142. Availability is to be decided upon what claimant does and not upon the existence of regulation foreign to act which bars employers from hiring. Id., 318. State employee who voluntarily retires and is not willing to work for state because of loss of pension is not available for work and not entitled to benefits. 22 CS 99. One who limits his availability for work because of personal reasons unrelated to employment is not entitled to compensation. 23 CS 86.

Where cessation of work was voluntary on plaintiff's part, through agency of union, plaintiffs could not be said to be “available for work”. 25 CS 294–296. Unemployment commissioner's conclusion that plaintiff was not physically able to engage in work so as to be “available for work” was sufficiently supported by subordinate facts when plaintiff had qualified for Social Security disability benefits. Id., 447. “Reasonable efforts” defined; not unreasonable or arbitrary for commissioner to find that plaintiff's one or two attempts to find work each week did not constitute reasonable effort; courts are bound by findings of subordinate facts and reasonable conclusions of facts made by commissioner. 26 CS 336. Where plaintiff did not go to more than 3 establishments in person in any week in her search for work, she failed to meet statutory requirement that she make reasonable efforts to obtain work. 27 CS 38.

except that the individual is not ineligible on account of such retirement if the administrator finds (A) that the individual has retired because (i) such individual's work has become unsuitable considering such individual's physical condition and the degree of risk to such individual's health and safety, and (ii) such individual has requested of such individual's employer other work that is suitable, and (iii) such individual's employer did not offer such individual such work, or (B) that the individual has been involuntarily retired;\n\n(10) Repealed by P.A. 77-426, S. 6, 19;\n\n(11) Repealed by P.A. 77-426, S. 6, 19;\n\n(12) Repealed by P.A. 77-426, S. 17, 19;\n\n(13) If the administrator finds that, having been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of thirty days or longer and having commenced serving such sentence, the individual has been discharged or suspended during such period of imprisonment, until such individual has earned at least ten times such individual's benefit rate;\n\n(14) If the administrator finds that the individual has been discharged or suspended because the individual has been disqualified under state or federal law from performing the work for which such individual was hired as a result of a drug or alcohol testing program mandated by and conducted in accordance with such law, until such individual has earned at least ten times such individual's benefit rate;\n\n(15) If the individual is a temporary employee of a temporary help service and the individual refuses to accept suitable employment when it is offered by such service upon completion of an assignment until such individual has earned at least six times such individual's benefit rate;

Id., 693. The test to determine whether a person's refusal to cross a picket line established by a union of which he is not a member rendered him a participant in the dispute is whether his refusal was voluntary or involuntary; employee is “directly interested in a labor dispute” if his wages, hours or working conditions will be affected by the outcome of the dispute. 139 C. 20. A pension, at least to the extent to which each payment has been increased because of employer's contributions, is one “by way of compensation for loss of wages”. Id., 569.

The administrator or an examiner shall promptly examine each claim for a benefit payment for a week of unemployment and, on the basis of the facts found by him or her, shall determine whether or not the claimant is eligible to receive such benefit payment for such week and the amount of benefits payable for such week. The determination of eligibility by the administrator or an examiner shall be based upon evidence or testimony presented in a manner prescribed by the administrator, including in writing, by telephone or by other electronic means. The administrator or an examiner may prescribe a hearing by telephone or in person at his or her discretion, provided if an in person hearing is requested, the request may not be unreasonably denied by the administrator or an examiner, as the case may be. Notice of the decision and the reasons therefor shall be given to the claimant. The employers against whose accounts charges may be made due to any benefits awarded by the decision shall be notified of the initial determination of the claimant's benefit entitlement at the time notice is given to the claimant, which notification shall set forth the provisions of this section for appeal, provided any employer who claims that the claimant is ineligible for benefits because his or her unemployment is due to the existence of a labor dispute at such employer's factory, establishment or other premises, shall be notified of the decision and the reasons therefor, whether or not benefits awarded by the decision might be charged against such employer's account. The employer's appeal rights shall be limited to the first notice the employer is given in connection with a claim which sets forth his or her appeal rights, and no issue may be appealed if notice of such issue and the right to appeal such issue had previously been given. For any determination of an overpayment made prior to October 1, 2013, notwithstanding any provisions of this chapter to the contrary, whenever the employer, after receiving notice of such hearing, fails to appear at the hearing or fails to timely submit a written response in a manner prescribed by the administrator, such employer's proportionate share of benefits paid to the claimant prior to the issuance of a decision by a referee under section 31-242 for any week beginning prior to the forty-second day after the end of the calendar week in which the employer's appeal was filed shall be charged against such employer's account and the claimant shall not be charged with an overpayment with respect to such benefits pursuant to subsection (a) of section 31-273. For any determination of an overpayment made on or after October 1, 2013, notwithstanding any provisions of this chapter to the contrary, whenever the employer, after receiving notice of such hearing, fails to appear at the hearing or fails to submit a timely and adequate written response in a manner prescribed by the administrator, such employer's proportionate share of benefits paid to the claimant prior to the issuance of a decision by a referee under section 31-242 or the Employment Security Board of Review under section 31-249a shall be charged against such employer's account. The decision of the administrator shall be final and benefits shall be paid or denied in accordance therewith unless the claimant or any of such employers, within twenty-one calendar days after such notification was provided to the claimant or any of such employers, files an appeal from such decision and applies for a hearing, provided (1) any such appeal which is filed after such twenty-one-day period may be considered to be timely filed if the filing party shows good cause, as defined in regulations adopted pursuant to section 31-249h, for the late filing, (2) if the last day for filing an appeal falls on any day when the offices of the Employment Security Division are not open for business, such last day shall be extended to the next business day, (3) if any such appeal is filed by mail, such appeal shall be considered timely filed if it was received within such twenty-one-day period or bears a legible United States postal service postmark which indicates that within such twenty-one-day period it was placed in the possession of such postal authorities for delivery to the appropriate office, except posting dates attributable to private postage meters shall not be considered in determining the timeliness of appeals filed by mail, and (4) if any such appeal is filed electronically, such appeal shall be considered timely filed if it was received within such twenty-one-day period. Where the administrator or examiner has determined that the claimant is eligible for benefits, benefits shall be paid promptly in accordance with the determination regardless of the pendency of the period to file an appeal or the pendency of such appeal. No examiner shall participate in any case in which he or she is an interested party. Any person who has filed a claim for benefits pursuant to an agreement entered into by the administrator with the proper agency under the laws of the United States, whereby the administrator makes payment of unemployment compensation out of funds supplied by the United States, may in like manner file an appeal from the decision of such claim and apply for a hearing, and the United States or the agency thereof which had employed such person may in like manner appeal from the decision on such claim and apply for a hearing.\n\n(b) The administrator shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of section 31-244 and chapter 54, effective July 1, 1992, establishing procedures and guidelines necessary to implement the provisions of this section. Such regulations shall prescribe a minimum number of days of advance notice to be afforded parties prior to a hearing and standards for determining the timeliness of written responses to hearing notices.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 7513; 1955, S. 3077d; 1957, P.A. 596, S. 5; February, 1965, P.A. 347; 1967, P.A. 790, S. 15; 1971, P.A. 835, S. 22; P.A. 73-536, S. 7, 12; P.A. 74-229, S. 18, 22; 74-339, S. 14, 36; P.A. 79-187, S. 2; P.A. 80-260, S. 1; P.A. 87-364, S. 1, 8; P.A. 91-107, S. 1, 2; P.A. 95-323, S. 4, 8; P.A. 12-125, S. 1; P.A. 13-66, S. 2; P.A. 16-169, S. 6.)\n\nHistory: 1965 act specified that 7-day period for appeals excludes Sundays and holidays; 1967 act provided for extension of appeal deadline if last day for filing “falls on any day when the offices of the employment security division are not open for business”; 1971 act replaced provision which allowed payment of benefits which may be affected by hearing only after final determination is reached with provisions setting forth conditions under which payments may be made during the course of the appeal procedure; P.A. 73-536 specified that notification of employers is not necessary “in cases of claimants laid off for lack of work” and reworded notification provision for clarity, deleted references to “merit rating” accounts and to “compensable separations” and deleted provision requiring notification of state or political subdivision in claims where it is designated a base period employer; P.A. 74-229 deleted exception re notification requirement for claimants laid off for lack of work, required notification of employers re initial determination of benefit entitlement in all cases, added provision limiting employer's appeal rights and extended time for appeal to 14 days, deleting former exclusion for Sundays and holidays; P.A. 74-339 required that determination of eligibility be based on evidence presented in person or in writing at hearing and required that benefits be paid regardless of appeal where previously payment of benefits was conditional; P.A. 79-187 required notification of employers “at the time notice is given to the claimant” rather than “in accordance with subsection (f) of section 31-225a”; P.A. 80-260 increased time for appeal to 21 days; P.A. 87-364 provided that an appeal filed after 21 calendar days may be timely if there was good cause for the late filing, and that the postmark of any appeal filed by mail will be used to determine timeliness; P.A. 91-107 designated existing section as Subsec.

Any or all parties similarly situated may join in one appeal. In such judicial proceeding the original and five copies of a petition, which shall state the grounds on which a review is sought, shall be filed in the office of the board in a manner prescribed by the appeals division. The chairman of the board shall, within the third business day thereafter, cause the original petition or petitions to be mailed to the clerk of the Superior Court and copy or copies thereof to the administrator and to each other party to the proceeding in which such appeal was taken; and said clerk shall docket such appeal as returned to the next return day after the receipt of such petition or petitions. In all cases, the board shall certify the record to the court. The record shall consist of the notice of appeal to the referee and the board, the notices of hearing before them, the referee's findings of fact and decision, the findings and decision of the board, all documents admitted into evidence before the referee and the board or both and all other evidentiary material accepted by them. Upon request of the court, the board shall (1) in cases in which its decision was rendered on the record of such hearing before the referee, prepare and verify to the court a transcript of such hearing before the referee; and (2) in cases in which its decision was rendered on the record of its own evidentiary hearing, provide and verify to the court a transcript of such hearing of the board. In any appeal, any finding of the referee or the board shall be subject to correction only to the extent provided by section 22-9 of the Connecticut Practice Book. Such appeals shall be claimed for the short calendar unless the court shall order the appeal placed on the trial list. An appeal may be taken from the decision of the Superior Court to the Appellate Court in the same manner as is provided in section 51-197b. It shall not be necessary in any judicial proceeding under this section that exceptions to the rulings of the board shall have been made or entered and no bond shall be required for entering an appeal to the Superior Court. Unless the court shall otherwise order after motion and hearing, the final decision of the court shall be the decision as to all parties to the original proceeding. In any appeal in which one of the parties is not represented by counsel and in which the party taking the appeal does not claim the case for the short calendar or trial within a reasonable time after the return day, the court may of its own motion dismiss the appeal, or the party ready to proceed may move for nonsuit or default as appropriate. When an appeal is taken to the Superior Court, the clerk thereof shall by writing notify the board of any action of the court thereon and of the disposition of such appeal whether by judgment, remand, withdrawal or otherwise and shall, upon the decision on the appeal, furnish the board with a copy of such decision. The court may remand the case to the board for proceedings de novo, or for further proceedings on the record, or for such limited purposes as the court may prescribe. The court also may order the board to remand the case to a referee for any further proceedings deemed necessary by the court. The court may retain jurisdiction by ordering a return to the court of the proceedings conducted in accordance with the order of the court or the court may order final disposition.

The fund shall be administered by the State Treasurer as a trust fund, in accordance with the provisions of this section and sections 3-21a, 31-222, 31-225a, 31-231a, 31-232b, 31-232d, 31-232f, 31-236, 31-250a, 31-259, 31-263, 31-264b and 31-274j. The state treasurer may enter into contracts that may be useful to the organization, establishment, operation and administration of the fund under all applicable state and federal laws and may contract with any person to provide whatever services to the fund as, in the discretion of the State Treasurer, are necessary for the proper operation and administration of the fund. All costs of organizing, establishing and operating the fund, including the costs of personnel and contractual services, shall be a charge upon and paid by the State Treasurer from the fund. In addition, all costs of establishing and administering the necessary procedures for billing, payment and collection of the assessments authorized to be established by the administrator pursuant to section 31-225a shall be a charge upon and paid by the State Treasurer from the fund. All costs related to the organization, establishment and operation of the fund and all costs related to the establishment and administration of billing, payment and collection procedures for moneys received from employers in payment of assessments established in accordance with said section 31-225a, to the extent not payable from the fund, may be paid from other moneys of the state when made available for such purpose. There is established within the fund an advance account, a debt service and reserve account and an administration account, which accounts shall be held separate and apart from each other. Additional accounts and subaccounts may be established in the proceedings under which the revenue bonds are authorized.\n\n(c) There shall be deposited in the advance account: (1) The proceeds of revenue bonds issued by the state for deposit into the account and use in accordance with this section and sections 3-21a, 31-222, 31-225a, 31-231a, 31-232b, 31-232d, 31-232f, 31-236, 31-250a, 31-259, 31-263, 31-264b and 31-274j; (2) federal grants and awards or other federal assistance received by the state for deposit into the account or for other purposes in accordance with said sections; and (3) interest or other income earned on the investment of moneys in the advance account pending transfer or use pursuant to said sections.\n\n(d) To the extent that amounts are available therefor in the advance account, and on request of the administrator pursuant to subsection (h) of this section, the State Treasurer shall apply the proceeds (1) to repay, in accordance with the proceedings authorizing any revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section and sections 3-21a, 31-222, 31-225a, 31-231a, 31-232b, 31-232d, 31-232f, 31-236, 31-250a, 31-259, 31-263, 31-264b and 31-274j, the outstanding balance of all or any part of the advances made to the state from the federal unemployment account under Title XII of the Social Security Act, 42 USC Sections 1321 to 1324, inclusive, and any interest due on the advances, and (2) to provide advances to the Unemployment Compensation Benefit Fund.\n\n(e) Within the debt service and reserve account there are established the following subaccounts: (1) A reserve subaccount into which shall be deposited the proceeds of revenue bonds issued by the state for deposit into the reserve subaccount and use in accordance with this section and sections 3-21a, 31-222, 31-225a, 31-231a, 31-232b, 31-232d, 31-232f, 31-236, 31-250a, 31-259, 31-263, 31-264b and 31-274j; and (2) a debt service subaccount into which shall be deposited, in accordance with the proceeding authorizing the bonds, the proceeds of the initial issuance of revenue bonds which are expected to be applied as capitalized interest to the extent required, and payments received from or on behalf of any employer in payment of assessments established in accordance with said sections attributable to the debt service requirement. Moneys in each subaccount created under this subsection may be applied by the State Treasurer to debt service on revenue bonds. The Treasurer shall apply amounts in the reserve subaccount to the payment of debt service on bonds whenever amounts on deposit in the debt service subaccount are insufficient. The net proceeds of any refunding bonds shall be deposited in a special subaccount within the debt service and reserve account and shall be applied solely to the retirement or redemption of the bonds to be refunded.\n\n(f) There shall be deposited in the administration account: (1) The proceeds of revenue bonds expected to be deposited into the administration account and use in accordance with this section and sections 3-21a, 31-222, 31-225a, 31-231a, 31-232b, 31-232d, 31-232f, 31-236, 31-250a, 31-259, 31-263, 31-264b and 31-274j; and (2) any additional money received from employers in payment of assessments established in accordance with said sections, to offset the costs and expenses of administering and operating the fund. Amounts in the administration account may be applied to offset the costs and expenses of establishing, administering and operating the fund.\n\n(g) The fund shall be maintained separate and apart from all other moneys, funds and accounts of the state. Investment earnings credited to the assets of the fund and to any account and subaccount within the fund shall become part of the assets of the fund, account and subaccount, except as otherwise required for rebates in order to assure the excludability of the interest on the bonds from federal income taxation, as provided in the proceedings authorizing any revenue bonds. Any balance remaining in the fund at the end of any fiscal year shall be carried forward in the fund, account and subaccount for the next fiscal year.\n\n(h) Upon the issuance of revenue bonds and to the extent there are sufficient proceeds or other amounts in the advance account available therefor, any advances to the Unemployment Compensation Benefit Fund that the administrator deems necessary for the payment of benefits under this chapter or to the Unemployment Compensation Fund for the repayment of advances made to the state from the federal unemployment account, including interest thereon, may be obtained from the advance account of the Unemployment Compensation Advance Fund. The State Treasurer shall, on request filed in writing by the administrator, withdraw from the advance account of the Unemployment Compensation Advance Fund and deposit in the Unemployment Compensation Benefit Fund, amounts determined by the administrator to be necessary for the payment of benefits under this chapter without incurring federal interest charges, or deposit in the Unemployment Compensation Fund amounts determined by the administrator to be required for the repayment of advances made to the state from the federal unemployment account, including interest thereon. The State Treasurer shall, from time to time and at least annually, determine the amount of interest, amortization, reserve and associated costs required for each advance made from the advance account under this subsection computed in accordance with the requirements of the Unemployment Compensation Fund and the proceedings under which the revenue bonds are authorized and such amounts shall be assessed by the administrator as provided in subdivision (2) of subsection (e) of section 31-225a. For purposes of this subsection, “associated costs” includes all costs related to the efficient establishment, operation and administration of the Unemployment Compensation Advance Fund pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, and the proceedings under which the bonds are issued pursuant to this section and sections 3-21a, 31-222, 31-225a, 31-231a, 31-232b, 31-232d, 31-232f, 31-236, 31-250a, 31-259, 31-263, 31-264b and 31-274j and the costs of establishing and administering the billing, payment and collection procedures referred to in subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(i) The moneys in the advance account may also be used to pay any costs related to the issuance of revenue bonds issued pursuant to section 31-264b and to pay any debt service thereon for which amounts on deposit in the debt service and reserve account maintained pursuant to this section are insufficient.\n\n(j) Notwithstanding any provision of this section and sections 3-21a, 31-222, 31-225a, 31-231a, 31-232b, 31-232d, 31-232f, 31-236, 31-250a, 31-259, 31-263, 31-264b and 31-274j to the contrary, any money received from the Unemployment Compensation Fund may not be used for any purpose inconsistent with federal law, and any federal grants, awards, advances or other federal assistance referred to herein may not be used for any purpose other than that for which such amounts were granted, awarded, advanced, or otherwise appropriated, respectively.\n\n(P.A. 93-243, S. 9, 15; 93-419, S. 3, 9.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 93-243 effective June 23, 1993; P.A. 93-419 amended Subsec.

      "text": "(a) The State Bond Commission may authorize the issuance of revenue bonds of the state in one or more series and in principal amounts necessary or estimated to be necessary as an advance to the Unemployment Compensation Fund, or to repay advances made to the state from the federal unemployment account, but not in excess of one billion dollars outstanding at any one time and such additional amount of bonds required to fund any debt service and reserve account in accordance with the proceedings authorizing the bonds and the costs of issuance, capitalized interest, if any, and the initial costs and expenses of the administration account, provided in computing the total amount of bonds which may at any one time be outstanding, the principal amount of any refunding bonds issued to refund bonds shall be excluded. The legislature finds that it is an essential governmental function to assure that the balance in the state's account in the federal Unemployment Trust Fund is maintained at a level which is sufficient to pay all benefits and further finds that the financing and payment of the outstanding principal amount which has been advanced to the state from the federal account of the Unemployment Trust Fund and the financing and funding of the state's account in the Unemployment Trust Fund by the issuance of revenue bonds pursuant to this section and sections 3-21a, 31-222, 31-225a, 31-231a, 31-232b, 31-232d, 31-232f, 31-236, 31-250a, 31-259, 31-263, 31-264a and 31-274j is in the public interest, will substantially result in savings of interest costs, will achieve a public purpose of reducing overall costs of providing employment benefits and will thereby foster and promote economic growth, provide employment opportunities for the residents of the state and assist companies by reducing their overall costs of doing business in the state.\n\n(b) Bonds issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be special obligations of the state and shall not be payable from nor charged upon any funds other than the Unemployment Compensation Advance Fund and revenues pledged to the payment thereof, nor shall the state or any political subdivision thereof be subject to any liability thereon other than from such sources. The issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this section and sections 3-21a, 31-222, 31-225a, 31-231a, 31-232b, 31-232d, 31-232f, 31-236, 31-250a, 31-259, 31-263, 31-264a and 31-274j shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the state or any political subdivision thereof to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment other than the appropriation set forth in this section. The bonds shall not constitute a charge, lien or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the state or of any political subdivision thereof, except the Unemployment Compensation Advance Fund and revenues pledged or otherwise encumbered under the provisions and for the purpose of said sections. The substance of this limitation shall be plainly stated on the face of each bond. Revenue bonds issued pursuant to said sections shall not be subject to any statutory limitation on the indebtedness of the state and the bonds, when issued, shall not be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of the state in respect to, and to the extent of, any such limitation. As part of the contract of the state with the owners of the revenue bonds, all amounts necessary for the punctual payment of the debt service requirements with respect to the revenue bonds shall be deemed appropriated, but only from the sources pledged pursuant to this section and sections 3-21a, 31-222, 31-225a, 31-231a, 31-232b, 31-232d, 31-232f, 31-236, 31-250a, 31-259, 31-263, 31-264a and 31-274j.\n\n(c) The revenue bonds referred to in subsection (a) of this section may be executed and delivered at the time or times, shall be dated, shall bear interest at the rate or rates, shall mature at the time or times not exceeding ten years from their date, have the rank or priority, be payable in the medium of payment, be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, carry the registration and transfer privileges and be made redeemable before maturity at the price or prices and under the terms and conditions, all as may be provided by the State Bond Commission. With the exception of subsections (i) and (p) all provisions of section 3-20 and the exercise of any right or power granted thereby which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this section and sections 3-21a, 31-222, 31-225a, 31-231a, 31-232b, 31-232d, 31-232f, 31-236, 31-250a, 31-259, 31-263, 31-264a and 31-274j are hereby adopted and may be invoked in respect to all revenue bonds authorized by the State Bond Commission pursuant to said sections. For the purposes of subsection (o) of said section 3-20, “bond act” includes said sections. None of the revenue bonds shall be authorized, except upon a finding by the State Bond Commission that there has been filed with it a request for authorization, which is signed by or on behalf of the State Treasurer and states the terms and conditions as said commission, in its discretion, may require.\n\n(d) The principal of and interest on any bonds issued pursuant to this section and sections 3-21a, 31-222, 31-225a, 31-231a, 31-232b, 31-232d, 31-232f, 31-236, 31-250a, 31-259, 31-263, 31-264a and 31-274j shall be secured by a pledge of the Unemployment Compensation Advance Fund and any revenues, receipts, funds or moneys payable to the fund, including any federal grants or advances available for the fund and including the amounts of payment received from assessments established pursuant to said sections, all as set forth in the proceedings authorizing the bonds pursuant to said sections. Any pledge made by the state pursuant to said sections is a pledge within the meaning and for all purposes of title 42a and shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made. Any revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the state shall be subject immediately to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the state, irrespective of whether the parties have notice of the claims.

Tax warrants referred to in said section 12-35 may be signed either by the administrator, the executive director of the Employment Security Division or any person in the employment security division in a position equivalent to or higher than the position presently held by a revenue examiner four. The amount due shall be a lien from the due date until discharged by payment against all the property of the employer within the state, whether real or personal, except such as is exempt from execution, including debts to the employer, and a certificate of such lien without specifically describing such real or personal property, signed by the administrator, the executive director or any person in the Employment Security Division in a position equivalent to or higher than the position presently held by a revenue examiner four, may be filed in the office of the clerk of any town in which such real property is situated, or, in the case of personal property, in the office of the Secretary of the State, which lien shall be effective from the date on which it is recorded.

When the property to be liened is concealed in the hands of an agent or trustee so that it cannot be found or attached, or is a debt due to the employer, the certificate of lien may be filed by leaving a copy thereof with such agent, trustee or debtor, or by mailing to him a copy thereof by registered or certified mail, and from the time of the receipt of such lien all the effects of the employer in the hands of such agent or trustee and any debt due from such debtor to the employer shall be secured in the hands of such agent, trustee or debtor to pay the tax secured by such lien. The payment by such agent, trustee or debtor to the administrator shall discharge him of his liability to the employer to the extent thereof. The administrator may require such agent, trustee or debtor to disclose under oath within ten days whether he has in his hands the goods or effects of the employer or is indebted to him.

The examiner may prescribe a hearing by telephone or in person at his or her discretion, provided if an in person hearing is requested, the request may not be unreasonably denied by the examiner. Notice of the time and place of such hearing, and the reasons for such hearing, shall be given to the person not less than five days prior to the date appointed for such hearing. Such examiner shall determine whether: (A) Such person shall repay such sum to the administrator for the Unemployment Compensation Fund, (B) such sum shall be recouped by offset from such person's unemployment benefits, or (C) repayment or recoupment of such sum would defeat the purpose of the benefits or be against equity and good conscience and should be waived. In any case where the examiner determines that such sum shall be recouped by offset from a person's unemployment benefits, the deduction from benefits shall not exceed fifty per cent of the person's weekly benefit amount. Where such offset is insufficient to recoup the full amount of the overpayment, the claimant shall repay the remaining amount in accordance with a repayment schedule as determined by the examiner. If the claimant fails to repay according to the schedule, the administrator may recover such overpayment through a wage execution against the claimant's earnings upon his or her return to work in accordance with the provisions of section 52-361a, and the administrator may request the Commissioner of Administrative Services to seek reimbursement for such amount pursuant to section 12-742. Any person with respect to whom a determination of overpayment has been made, according to the provisions of this subsection, shall be given notice of such determination and the provisions for repayment or recoupment of the amount overpaid. No repayment shall be required and no deduction from benefits shall be made until the determination of overpayment has become final.\n\n(2) The determination of overpayment shall be final unless the claimant, within twenty-one days after notice of such determination was provided to the claimant at his or her last-known address, files an appeal from such determination to a referee, except that any such appeal that is filed after such twenty-one-day period may be considered to be timely filed if the filing party shows good cause, as defined in regulations adopted pursuant to section 31-249h, for the late filing. If the last day for filing an appeal falls on any day when the offices of the Employment Security Division are not open for business, such last day shall be extended to the next business day. If any such appeal is filed by mail, the appeal shall be considered timely filed if the appeal was received within such twenty-one-day period or bears a legible United States postal service postmark that indicates that within such twenty-one-day period the appeal was placed in the possession of postal authorities for delivery to the appropriate office, except posting dates attributable to private postage meters shall not be considered in determining the timeliness of appeals filed by mail. If any such appeal is filed electronically, such appeal shall be considered timely filed if it was received within such twenty-one-day period.\n\n(3) The appeal shall be heard in the same manner provided in section 31-242 for an appeal from the decision of an examiner on a claim for benefits. Any party aggrieved by the decision of the referee, including the administrator, may appeal to the Employment Security Board of Review in the manner provided in section 31-249. Decisions of the board may be appealed to the Superior Court in the manner provided in section 31-249b. The administrator is authorized, eight years after the payment of any benefits described in this subsection, to cancel any claim for such repayment or recoupment which in his or her opinion is uncollectible. Effective January 1, 1996, and annually thereafter, the administrator shall report to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to finance, revenue and bonding and the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to labor and public employees, the aggregate number and value of all such claims deemed uncollectible and therefore cancelled during the previous calendar year. Any determination of overpayment made under this section which becomes final may be enforced by a wage execution in the same manner as a judgment of the Superior Court when the claimant fails to pay according to his or her repayment schedule. The court may issue a wage execution upon any final determination of overpayment in the same manner as in cases of judgments rendered in the Superior Court, and upon the filing of an application to the court for an execution, the administrator shall send to the clerk of the court a certified copy of such determination.\n\n(b) (1) Any person who, by reason of fraud, wilful misrepresentation or wilful nondisclosure by such person or by another of a material fact, has received any sum as benefits under this chapter while any condition for the receipt of benefits imposed by this chapter was not fulfilled in such person's case, or has received a greater amount of benefits than was due such person under this chapter, shall be charged with an overpayment and shall be liable to repay to the administrator for the Unemployment Compensation Fund a sum equal to the amount so overpaid to such person. If such person does not make repayment in full of the sum overpaid, the administrator shall recoup such sum by offset from such person's unemployment benefits. The deduction from benefits shall be one hundred per cent of the person's weekly benefit entitlement until the full amount of the overpayment has been recouped. Where such offset is insufficient to recoup the full amount of the overpayment, the claimant shall repay the remaining amount plus, for any determination of an overpayment made on or after July 1, 2005, interest at the rate of one per cent of the amount so overpaid per month, in accordance with a repayment schedule as determined by the examiner. If the claimant fails to repay according to the schedule, the administrator may recover such overpayment plus interest through a wage execution against the claimant's earnings upon the claimant's return to work in accordance with the provisions of section 52-361a. In addition, the administrator may request the Commissioner of Administrative Services to seek reimbursement for such amount pursuant to section 12-742. If the administrator's actions are insufficient to recover such overpayment, the administrator may submit the outstanding balance to the Internal Revenue Service for the purpose of offsetting the claimant's federal tax refund pursuant to 26 USC 6402(f), 31 USC 3720A or other applicable federal laws. The administrator is authorized, eight years after the payment of any benefits described in this subsection, to cancel any claim for such repayment or recoupment which in the administrator's opinion is uncollectible. Effective January 1, 1996, and annually thereafter, the administrator shall report to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to finance, revenue and bonding and the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to labor and public employees, the aggregate number and value of all such claims deemed uncollectible and therefore cancelled during the previous calendar year.\n\n(2) (A) For any determination of an overpayment made prior to October 1, 2013, any person who has made a claim for benefits under this chapter and has knowingly made a false statement or representation or has knowingly failed to disclose a material fact in order to obtain benefits or to increase the amount of benefits to which such person may be entitled under this chapter shall forfeit benefits for not less than one or more than thirty-nine compensable weeks following determination of such offense or offenses, during which weeks such person would otherwise have been eligible to receive benefits. For the purposes of section 31-231b, such person shall be deemed to have received benefits for such forfeited weeks. This penalty shall be in addition to any other applicable penalty under this section and in addition to the liability to repay any moneys so received by such person and shall not be confined to a single benefit year. The provisions of this subparagraph shall not be applicable to claims deemed payable as of October 1, 2019. (B) For any determination of an overpayment made on or after October 1, 2013, any person who has made a claim for benefits under this chapter and has knowingly made a false statement or representation or has knowingly failed to disclose a material fact in order to obtain benefits or to increase the amount of benefits to which such person may be entitled under this chapter shall be subject to a penalty of fifty per cent of the amount of overpayment for the first offense and a penalty of one hundred per cent of the amount of overpayment for any subsequent offense. This penalty shall be in addition to the liability to repay the full amount of overpayment and shall not be confined to a single benefit year. Thirty-five per cent of any such penalty shall be paid into the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund and sixty-five per cent of such penalty shall be paid into the Employment Security Administration Fund. The penalty amounts computed in this subparagraph shall be rounded to the nearest dollar with fractions of a dollar of exactly fifty cents rounded upward.\n\n(3) Any person charged with the fraudulent receipt of benefits or the making of a fraudulent claim, as provided in this subsection, shall be entitled to a determination of eligibility by the administrator that shall be based upon evidence or testimony presented in a manner prescribed by the administrator including in writing, by telephone or by other electronic means. The administrator may prescribe a hearing by telephone or in person at his or her discretion, provided if an in person hearing is requested, the request may not be unreasonably denied by the administrator. Notice of the time and place of such hearing, and the reasons for such hearing, shall be given to the person not less than five days prior to the date appointed for such hearing. The administrator shall determine, on the basis of facts found by the administrator, whether or not a fraudulent act subject to the penalties of this subsection has been committed and, upon such finding, shall fix the penalty for any such offense according to the provisions of this subsection. Any person determined by the administrator to have committed fraud under the provisions of this section shall be liable for repayment to the administrator of the Unemployment Compensation Fund for any benefits determined by the administrator to have been collected fraudulently, as well as any other penalties assessed by the administrator in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. Until such liabilities have been met to the satisfaction of the administrator, such person shall forfeit any right to receive benefits under the provisions of this chapter. Notification of such decision and penalty shall be provided to such person and shall be final unless such person files an appeal not later than twenty-one days after the date such notification was provided to such person, except that (A) any such appeal that is filed after such twenty-one-day period may be considered to be timely filed if the filing party shows good cause, as defined in regulations adopted pursuant to section 31-249h, for the late filing, (B) if the last day for filing an appeal falls on any day when the offices of the Employment Security Division are not open for business, such last day shall be extended to the next business day, (C) if any such appeal is filed by mail, the appeal shall be considered timely filed if the appeal was received within such twenty-one-day period or bears a legible United States postal service postmark that indicates that within such twenty-one-day period the appeal was placed in the possession of postal authorities for delivery to the appropriate office, except posting dates attributable to private postage meters shall not be considered in determining the timeliness of appeals filed by mail, and (D) if any such appeal is filed electronically, such appeal shall be considered timely filed if it was received within such twenty-one-day period. Such appeal shall be heard by a referee in the same manner provided in section 31-242 for an appeal from the decision of an examiner on a claim for benefits. The manner in which such appeals shall be heard and appeals taken therefrom to the board of review and then to the Superior Court, either by the administrator or the claimant, shall be in accordance with the provisions set forth in section 31-249 or 31-249b, as the case may be. Any determination of overpayment made under this subsection which becomes final on or after October 1, 1995, may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment of the Superior Court when the claimant fails to pay according to the claimant's repayment schedule. The court may issue execution upon any final determination of overpayment in the same manner as in cases of judgments rendered in the Superior Court; and upon the filing of an application to the court for an execution, the administrator shall send to the clerk of the court a certified copy of such determination.\n\n(c) Any person, firm or corporation who knowingly employs a person and pays such employee without declaring such payment in the payroll records shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor.\n\n(d) If, after investigation, the administrator determines that there is probable cause to believe that the person, firm or corporation has wilfully failed to declare payment of wages in the payroll record, the administrator shall provide an opportunity for a hearing on the matter. If a hearing is requested, it shall be conducted by the administrator, or a deputy or representative designated by the administrator. Notice of the time and place of such hearing, and the reasons therefor, shall be given to the person, firm, or corporation not less than five days prior to the date appointed for such hearing. If the administrator determines, on the basis of the facts found by him or her, that such nondeclaration occurred and was wilful, the administrator shall fix the payments and penalties in accordance with the provisions of subsection (e) of this section. Such person, firm or corporation may appeal to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford or for the judicial district in which the employer's principal place of business is located. Such court shall give notice of a time and place of hearing to the administrator. At such hearing the court may confirm or correct the administrator's determination. If the administrator's determination is confirmed, the cost of such proceedings, as in civil actions, shall be assessed against such person, firm or corporation. No costs shall be assessed against the state on such appeal.\n\n(e) If the administrator determines that any person, firm or corporation has wilfully failed to declare the payment of wages on payroll records, the administrator may impose a penalty of ten per cent of the total contributions past due to the administrator, as determined pursuant to section 31-270. Such penalty shall be in addition to any other applicable penalty and interest under section 31-266. In addition, the administrator may require the person, firm or corporation to make contributions at the maximum rate provided in section 31-225a for a period of one year following the determination by the administrator concerning the wilful nondeclaration. If the person, firm or corporation is paying or should have been paying, the maximum rate at the time of the determination, the administrator may require that such maximum rate continue for a period of three years following the determination.\n\n(f) Any person who knowingly makes a false statement or representation or fails to disclose a material fact in order to obtain, increase, prevent or decrease any benefit, contribution or other payment under this chapter, or under any similar law of another state or of the United States in regard to which this state acted as agent pursuant to an agreement authorized by section 31-225, whether to be made to or by himself or herself or any other person, and who receives any such benefit, pays any such contribution or alters any such payment to his or her advantage by such fraudulent means (1) shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor if such benefit, contribution or payment amounts to five hundred dollars or less or (2) shall be guilty of a class D felony if such benefit, contribution or payment amounts to more than five hundred dollars. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 54-193, no person shall be prosecuted for a violation of the provisions of this subsection committed on or after October 1, 1977, except within five years next after such violation has been committed.\n\n(g) Any person, firm or corporation who knowingly fails to pay contributions or other payments due under this chapter shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 54-193, no person shall be prosecuted for a violation of the provisions of this subsection committed on or after October 1, 1987, except within five years after such violation has been committed.\n\n(h) Any person who knowingly violates any provision of this chapter for which no other penalty is provided by law shall be fined not more than two hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than six months or both.\n\n(i) Any person who wilfully violates any regulation made by the administrator or the board under the authority of this chapter, for which no penalty is specifically provided, shall be fined not more than two hundred dollars.\n\n(j) All interest payments collected by the administrator under subsection (b) of this section shall be deposited in the Employment Security Administration Fund.\n\n(k) For any determination of an overpayment made on or after October 1, 2013, if the administrator determines that an overpayment was caused by an employer's failure to timely or adequately respond to the administrator's request for information relating to a claim in a manner prescribed by the administrator, such employer shall not be relieved of its proportionate share of charges for each week determined to be overpaid.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 7543; 1949, S. 3089d; 1953, S. 3090d, 3091d; 1967, P.A. 790, S. 20, 21; P.A. 74-229, S. 21, 22; 74-339, S. 32, 33, 36; P.A. 77-227; 77-426, S. 14, 19; P.A. 78-287; 78-331, S. 14, 41, 58; P.A. 79-42; 79-67, S. 1, 2; 79-187, S. 4; P.A. 81-318, S. 3, 4, 8; P.A. 82-132; P.A. 87-364, S. 7, 8; P.A. 88-230, S. 1, 12; P.A. 90-98, S. 1, 2; P.A. 93-142, S. 4, 7, 8; P.A. 95-220, S. 4–6; 95-323, S. 1, 2, 8; P.A. 04-60, S. 1, 2; P.A. 05-288, S. 139; P.A. 11-36, S. 1, 2; P.A. 13-66, S. 1; P.A. 16-169, S. 16; P.A. 19-117, S. 150.)\n\nHistory: 1967 act amended Subsecs.
