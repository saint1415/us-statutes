In any hearing the board shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence prevailing in the courts.\n\n(c) A stenographic or electronic record of the testimony shall be taken at all hearings of the board and a transcript thereof shall be filed with the board upon its request. The board shall have the power to order the taking of further testimony and for further argument. If, upon all the testimony, the board determines that the employer has engaged in or is engaging in any unfair labor practice, it shall state its finding of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on such employer an order requiring him to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice, and shall take such further affirmative action as will effectuate the policies of this chapter, including, but not limited to: (1) Withdrawal of recognition from and refraining from bargaining collectively with any company union, established, maintained or assisted by any action defined in this chapter as an unfair labor practice; (2) awarding of back pay; (3) reinstatement with or without back pay of any employee discriminated against in violation of section 31-105 or by maintenance of a preferential list from which such employee shall be returned to work; (4) reinstatement with or without back pay of all employees whose work has ceased or whose return to work has been delayed or prevented as the result of unfair labor practice in respect to any employee or employees or the maintenance of a preferential list from which such employees shall be returned to work. Such order may further require such person to make reports from time to time showing the extent to which the order has been complied with. If upon all the testimony the board is of the opinion that the person or persons named in the complaint have not engaged in or are not engaging in any such unfair labor practice, then the board shall make its finding of fact and shall issue an order dismissing the complaint. The board shall not require as a condition of taking action or issuing any order under this chapter that employees on strike or engaged in any other lawful concerted activity shall discontinue such strike or such activity. Until a transcript of the record in a case has been filed in the Superior Court, as provided in section 31-109, the board may, at any time, upon notice, modify or set aside in whole or in part any finding or order made or issued by it. Proceedings before the board shall be held with all possible expedition.\n\n(1949 Rev., S. 7394; 1969, P.A. 357; P.A. 73-120, S. 1, 3.)\n\nHistory: 1969 act detailed agent's responsibility to make report or issue written complaint and procedure if agent neither makes report nor issues complaint in Subsec. (a); P.A. 73-120 amended Subsec.

In the event an appeal has not been filed pursuant to section 4-183 or subsection (d) of this section, the board may file its petition in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford, or, if said court is not in session, the board may petition any judge of said court.
