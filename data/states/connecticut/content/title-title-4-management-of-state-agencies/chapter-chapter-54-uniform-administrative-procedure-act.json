      "text": "(a) There shall be a standing legislative committee to review all regulations of the several state departments and agencies following the proposal thereof, which shall consist of eight members of the House of Representatives, four from each major party, to be appointed on the first Wednesday after the first Monday in January in the odd-numbered years, by the speaker of said House, and six members of the Senate, three from each major party, to be appointed on or before said dates by the president pro tempore of the Senate. The members shall serve for the balance of the term for which they were elected. Vacancies shall be filled by appointment by the authority making the appointment. There shall be two cochairpersons, one of whom shall be a member of the Senate and one of whom shall be a member of the House of Representatives, each appointed by the applicable appointing authority, provided the cochairpersons shall not be members of the same political party and shall be from alternate parties in the respective houses in each successive term. For purposes of this section, “appointing authority” means the speaker or minority leader of the House of Representatives and the president pro tempore or minority leader of the Senate, as appropriate according to the respective house and party of the member to be appointed. Each chairperson may call meetings of the committee for the performance of its duties.\n\n(b) (1) No adoption, amendment or repeal of any regulation, except a regulation issued pursuant to subsection (g) of section 4-168, shall be effective until (A) an electronic copy of the proposed regulation approved by the Attorney General, as provided in section 4-169, and an electronic copy of the regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in section 4-168a are submitted to the standing legislative regulation review committee in a manner designated by the committee, by the agency proposing the regulation, (B) the regulation is approved by the committee, at a regular meeting or a special meeting called for the purpose, and (C) a certified electronic copy of the regulation is submitted to the office of the Secretary of the State by the agency, as provided in section 4-172, and the regulation is posted on the eRegulations System by the Secretary. (2) The date of submission for purposes of subsection (c) of this section shall be the first Tuesday of each month. Any regulation received by the committee on or before the first Tuesday of a month shall be deemed to have been submitted on the first Tuesday of that month. Any regulation submitted after the first Tuesday of a month shall be deemed to be submitted on the first Tuesday of the next succeeding month. (3) The form of proposed regulations which are submitted to the committee shall be as follows: New language added to an existing regulation shall be underlined; language to be deleted shall be enclosed in brackets and a new regulation or new section of a regulation shall be preceded by the word “(NEW)” in capital letters. Each proposed regulation shall have a statement of its purpose following the final section of the regulation. (4) The committee may permit any proposed regulation, including, but not limited to, a proposed regulation which by reference incorporates in whole or in part, any other code, rule, regulation, standard or specification, to be submitted in summary form together with a statement of purpose for the proposed regulation. On and after October 1, 1994, if the committee finds that a federal statute requires, as a condition of the state exercising regulatory authority, that a Connecticut regulation at all times must be identical to a federal statute or regulation, then the committee may approve a Connecticut regulation that by reference specifically incorporates future amendments to such federal statute or regulation provided the agency that proposed the Connecticut regulation shall submit for approval amendments to such Connecticut regulations to the committee not later than thirty days after the effective date of such amendment, and provided further the committee may hold a public hearing on such Connecticut amendments. (5) The agency shall also provide the committee with a copy of the fiscal note prepared pursuant to subsection (a) of section 4-168. At the time of submission to the committee, the agency shall submit an electronic copy of the proposed regulation and the fiscal note to (A) the Office of Fiscal Analysis which, not later than seven days after receipt, shall submit an analysis of the fiscal note to the committee; and (B) each joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of the subject matter of the proposed regulation. No regulation shall be found invalid due to the failure of an agency to submit an electronic copy of the proposed regulation and the fiscal note to each committee of cognizance, provided such regulation and fiscal note have been electronically submitted to one such committee.\n\n(c) The committee shall review all proposed regulations and, in its discretion, may hold public hearings on any proposed regulation and may approve, disapprove or reject without prejudice, in whole or in part, any such regulation. If the committee fails to so approve, disapprove or reject without prejudice a proposed regulation, within sixty-five days after the date of submission as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the committee shall be deemed to have approved the proposed regulation for purposes of this section.\n\n(d) If the committee disapproves a proposed regulation in whole or in part, it shall give notice of the disapproval and the reasons for the disapproval to the agency, and no agency shall thereafter issue any regulation or directive or take other action to implement such disapproved regulation, or part thereof, as the case may be, except that the agency may adopt a substantively new regulation in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, provided the General Assembly may reverse such disapproval under the provisions of section 4-171. If the committee disapproves any regulation proposed for the purpose of implementing a federally subsidized or assisted program, the General Assembly shall be required to either sustain or reverse the disapproval.\n\n(e) If the committee rejects a proposed regulation without prejudice, in whole or in part, it shall notify the agency of the reasons for the rejection and the agency, following approval by the Attorney General for legal sufficiency pursuant to section 4-169, shall resubmit the regulation in revised form to the committee, if the adoption of such regulation is required by the general statutes or any public or special act, not later than the first Tuesday of the second month following such rejection without prejudice and may so resubmit any other regulation, in the same manner as provided in this section for the initial submission. Each resubmission under this subsection shall include a summary of revisions identified by paragraph. The committee shall review and take action on such resubmitted regulation no later than thirty-five days after the date of submission, as provided in subsection (b) of this section. Posting of the notice on the eRegulations System pursuant to the provisions of section 4-168 shall not be required in the case of such resubmission.\n\n(f) If an agency fails to submit any regulation approved in whole or in part by the standing legislative regulation review committee to the office of the Secretary of the State as provided in section 4-172, not later than fourteen days after the date of approval, the agency shall notify the committee, not later than five days after such fourteen-day period, of its reasons for failing to submit such regulation. If any agency fails to comply with the time limits established under subsection (c) of section 4-168, or under subsection (e) of this section, the administrative head of such agency shall submit to the committee a written explanation of the reasons for such noncompliance. The committee, upon the affirmative vote of two-thirds of its members, may grant an extension of the time limits established under subsection (c) of section 4-168 and under subsection (e) of this section. If no such extension is granted, the administrative head of the agency shall personally appear before the standing legislative regulation review committee, at a time prescribed by the committee, to explain such failure to comply. After any such appearance, the committee may, upon the affirmative vote of two-thirds of its members, report such noncompliance to the Governor. Not later than fourteen days thereafter, the Governor shall report to the committee concerning the action the Governor has taken to ensure compliance with the provisions of section 4-168 and with the provisions of this section.\n\n(1971, P.A. 854, S. 5; 1972, P.A. 258, S. 2; P.A. 73-396, S. 1, 2; P.A. 76-297, S. 2; 76-434, S. 3, 12; P.A. 78-283, S. 2; P.A. 79-623, S. 2, 8; P.A. 80-471, S. 4; P.A. 83-322, S. 1, 2; P.A. 85-608, S. 2; P.A. 86-250, S. 2, 4; 86-403, S. 9, 132; P.A. 88-317, S. 5, 107; P.A. 90-124, S. 2; P.A. 94-76; P.A. 95-41; P.A. 99-90, S. 5; P.A. 01-195, S. 75, 181; P.A. 05-288, S. 17; P.A. 09-19, S. 4; P.A. 11-150, S. 19; P.A. 12-92, S. 4, 5; P.A. 13-247, S. 31; 13-274, S. 6; P.A. 14-187, S. 5; P.A. 15-18, S. 6.)\n\nHistory: 1972 act specified the form of proposed regulations to be presented to regulation review committee; P.A. 73-396 changed date of appointment from July 1 to the first Wednesday after the first Monday in January of odd-numbered years and required seventeen copies rather than one copy to be given the review committee; P.A. 76-297 allowed submission of regulations in summary form and included procedure for course of action if committee rejects resolution without prejudice; P.A. 76-434 deleted provision providing per diem and reimbursement for expenses; P.A. 78-283 required that regulations be filed in secretary of the state's office and required notification of review committee if filing not performed; P.A. 79-623 added provisions concerning fiscal notes; P.A. 80-471 revised form of submitted regulations and permitted summary form; P.A. 83-322 specified the date of submission of proposed regulations for the purposes of Subsec.

If the agency fails to render such decision made after reconsideration within such ninety-day period, the original final decision shall remain the final decision in the contested case for purposes of any appeal under the provisions of section 4-183.\n\n(4) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection, an agency decision made after reconsideration pursuant to this subsection shall become the final decision in the contested case in lieu of the original final decision for purposes of any appeal under the provisions of section 4-183, including, but not limited to, an appeal of (A) any issue decided by the agency in its original final decision that was not the subject of any petition for reconsideration or the agency's decision made after reconsideration, (B) any issue as to which reconsideration was requested but not granted, and (C) any issue that was reconsidered but not modified by the agency from the determination of such issue in the original final decision.\n\n(b) On a showing of changed conditions, the agency may reverse or modify the final decision, at any time, at the request of any person or on the agency's own motion. The procedure set forth in this chapter for contested cases shall be applicable to any proceeding in which such reversal or modification of any final decision is to be considered. The party or parties who were the subject of the original final decision, or their successors, if known, and intervenors in the original contested case, shall be notified of the proceeding and shall be given the opportunity to participate in the proceeding.

If the agency finds that public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires emergency action, and incorporates a finding to that effect in its order, summary suspension of a license may be ordered pending proceedings for revocation or other action.

Since phrase “institution of agency proceedings” means the institution of a particular action at law or case in litigation and “proceeding” encompasses a broader category of events than that encompassed by a hearing or final decision, Department of Public Utility Control instituted proceedings against plaintiff when it issued the letter to plaintiff informing it of its initiation of the new investigation; grounds for revocation of license must be more than self-evident to the licensee, thus Department of Public Utility Control's letter to licensee which merely advised that department had initiated an investigation into whether it should revoke licensee's certificate of public convenience and necessity, stated certain departmental procedural practices and indicated that licensee was designated as a party to the proceeding without reference to the basis underlying initiation of the proceeding did not satisfy statutory requirements because the letter commenced revocation proceedings and could not have provided licensee with notice and opportunity to show compliance prior to institution of the proceeding; “opportunity to show compliance” provision represents a “second chance” doctrine which allows licensee opportunity to put its house in lawful order before more formal agency proceedings are undertaken; court did not interpret Subsec. as requiring a hearing or opportunity for a hearing prior to revocation of license or as component of the “opportunity to show compliance” provision. 270 C. 778. Issuance of second chance notice under Subsec. is precursor to formal license revocation process governed by Sec. 4-177(b) and does not on its own constitute the institution of agency proceedings; agency proceeding by Insurance Department is not instituted until department commences a contested case proceeding in accordance with regulation implementing Sec. 4-177(b). 315 C. 196.\n\nCited. 14 CA 552; 24 CA 662; judgment reversed, see 223 C. 618; 34 CA 343; 37 CA 777.

The filing of a petition for reconsideration is not a prerequisite to the filing of such an appeal.\n\n(b) A person may appeal a preliminary, procedural or intermediate agency action or ruling to the Superior Court if (1) it appears likely that the person will otherwise qualify under this chapter to appeal from the final agency action or ruling and (2) postponement of the appeal would result in an inadequate remedy.\n\n(c) (1) Within fortyfive days after mailing of the final decision under section 4180 or, if there is no mailing, within fortyfive days after personal delivery of the final decision under said section, or (2) within forty-five days after the agency denies a petition for reconsideration of the final decision pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 4-181a, or (3) within forty-five days after mailing of the final decision made after reconsideration pursuant to subdivisions (3) and (4) of subsection (a) of section 4-181a or, if there is no mailing, within forty-five days after personal delivery of the final decision made after reconsideration pursuant to said subdivisions, or (4) within forty-five days after the expiration of the ninety-day period required under subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of section 4-181a if the agency decides to reconsider the final decision and fails to render a decision made after reconsideration within such period, whichever is applicable and is later, a person appealing as provided in this section shall serve a copy of the appeal on the agency that rendered the final decision at its office or at the office of the Attorney General in Hartford and file the appeal with the clerk of the superior court for the judicial district of New Britain or for the judicial district wherein the person appealing resides or, if that person is not a resident of this state, with the clerk of the court for the judicial district of New Britain. Within that time, the person appealing shall also serve a copy of the appeal on each party listed in the final decision at the address shown in the decision, provided failure to make such service within fortyfive days on parties other than the agency that rendered the final decision shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the appeal. Service of the appeal shall be made by United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, without the use of a state marshal or other officer, or by personal service by a proper officer or indifferent person making service in the same manner as complaints are served in ordinary civil actions. If service of the appeal is made by mail, service shall be effective upon deposit of the appeal in the mail.\n\n(d) The person appealing, not later than fifteen days after filing the appeal, shall file or cause to be filed with the clerk of the court an affidavit, or the state marshal's return, stating the date and manner in which a copy of the appeal was served on each party and on the agency that rendered the final decision, and, if service was not made on a party, the reason for failure to make service. If the failure to make service causes prejudice to any party to the appeal or to the agency, the court, after hearing, may dismiss the appeal.\n\n(e) If service has not been made on a party, the court, on motion, shall make such orders of notice of the appeal as are reasonably calculated to notify each party not yet served.\n\n(f) The filing of an appeal shall not, of itself, stay enforcement of an agency decision. An application for a stay may be made to the agency, to the court or to both. Filing of an application with the agency shall not preclude action by the court. A stay, if granted, shall be on appropriate terms.\n\n(g) Within thirty days after the service of the appeal, or within such further time as may be allowed by the court, the agency shall transcribe any portion of the record that has not been transcribed and transmit to the reviewing court the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding appealed from, which shall include the agency's findings of fact and conclusions of law, separately stated. By stipulation of all parties to such appeal proceedings, the record may be shortened. A party unreasonably refusing to stipulate to limit the record may be taxed by the court for the additional costs. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record.\n\n(h) If, before the date set for hearing on the merits of an appeal, application is made to the court for leave to present additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the proceeding before the agency, the court may order that the additional evidence be taken before the agency upon conditions determined by the court. The agency may modify its findings and decision by reason of the additional evidence and shall file that evidence and any modifications, new findings, or decisions with the reviewing court.\n\n(i) The appeal shall be conducted by the court without a jury and shall be confined to the record. If alleged irregularities in procedure before the agency are not shown in the record or if facts necessary to establish aggrievement are not shown in the record, proof limited thereto may be taken in the court. The court, upon request, shall hear oral argument and receive written briefs.\n\n(j) The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court shall affirm the decision of the agency unless the court finds that substantial rights of the person appealing have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: (1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (3) made upon unlawful procedure; (4) affected by other error of law; (5) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (6) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. If the court finds such prejudice, it shall sustain the appeal and, if appropriate, may render a judgment under subsection (k) of this section or remand the case for further proceedings. For purposes of this section, a remand is a final judgment.\n\n(k) If a particular agency action is required by law, the court, on sustaining the appeal, may render a judgment that modifies the agency decision, orders the particular agency action, or orders the agency to take such action as may be necessary to effect the particular action.\n\n(l) In all appeals taken under this section, costs may be taxed in favor of the prevailing party in the same manner, and to the same extent, that costs are allowed in judgments rendered by the Superior Court. No costs shall be taxed against the state, except as provided in section 4-184a.\n\n(m) In any case in which a person appealing claims that he cannot pay the costs of an appeal under this section, he shall, within the time permitted for filing the appeal, file with the clerk of the court to which the appeal is to be taken an application for waiver of payment of such fees, costs and necessary expenses, including the requirements of bond, if any. The application shall conform to the requirements prescribed by rule of the judges of the Superior Court. After such hearing as the court determines is necessary, the court shall render its judgment on the application, which judgment shall contain a statement of the facts the court has found, with its conclusions thereon. The filing of the application for the waiver shall toll the time limits for the filing of an appeal until such time as a judgment on such application is rendered.\n\n(1971, P.A. 854, S. 18; P.A. 73-620, S. 12–14, 18, 19; P.A. 76-436, S. 252, 681; P.A. 77-603, S. 1, 125; P.A. 78-280, S. 10, 127; P.A. 79-163; P.A. 84-43, S. 1; P.A. 88-230, S. 1, 12; 88-317, S. 23, 107; P.A. 90-98, S. 1, 2; P.A. 93-142, S. 4, 7, 8; P.A. 95-220, S. 4–6; P.A. 99-39; 99-215, S. 24, 29; P.A. 00-99, S. 20, 154; P.A. 06-32, S. 2.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 73-620 added proviso that in conflict between state and federal statutes or regulations, federal provisions prevail, required that record contain findings of fact and conclusions of law changed place for filing petition from Hartford county court of common pleas to court where aggrieved person resides and added Subsec.

Service of process by a person who lacked statutory authority did not deprive trial court of subject matter jurisdiction for an administrative appeal when in every other respect service met requirements of statute; court found service requirement of statute to be directory and not mandatory and, in the absence of a showing of prejudice, found service by a person who lacked statutory authority not to be the equivalent of a total failure of service of process. 69 CA 563. Failure of party to file administrative appeal under the UAPA within the 45 days required deprives trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over an appeal; thus, upon landlord's failure to file a timely appeal from Banking Commissioner's order requiring defendant landlord to return a security deposit, commissioner's findings and conclusions became final, binding and not subject to review. 76 CA 824. The only reasonable interpretation of Subsec. is that it lists four alternative time frames during which an appeal of a final decision may be brought, and that, in any given circumstance, only one such time frame will apply. 139 CA 565.
