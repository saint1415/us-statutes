Before such modifications are effected the Governor shall file a report with the joint standing committee having cognizance of matters relating to appropriations and the budgets of state agencies and the joint standing committee having cognizance of matters relating to state finance, revenue and bonding describing the change in circumstances which makes it necessary that certain reductions should be made or the basis for his determination that estimated budget resources will be insufficient to finance all appropriations in full. (2) If the cumulative monthly financial statement issued by the Comptroller pursuant to section 3-115 includes a projected General Fund deficit greater than one per cent of the total of General Fund appropriations, the Governor, within thirty days following the issuance of such statement, shall file a report with such joint standing committees, including a plan which he shall implement to modify such allotments to the extent necessary to prevent a deficit. No modification of an allotment requisition or an allotment in force made by the Governor pursuant to this subsection shall result in a reduction of more than three per cent of the total appropriation from any fund or more than five per cent of any appropriation, except such limitations shall not apply in time of war, invasion or emergency caused by natural disaster.\n\n(c) If a plan submitted in accordance with subsection (b) of this section indicates that a reduction of more than three per cent of the total appropriation from any fund or more than five per cent of any appropriation is required to prevent a deficit, the Governor may request that the Finance Advisory Committee approve any such reduction, provided any modification which would result in a reduction of more than five per cent of total appropriations shall require the approval of the General Assembly.\n\n(d) The secretary shall submit copies of allotment requisitions thus approved or modified or allotments in force thus modified, with the reasons for any modifications, to the administrative heads of the budgeted agencies concerned, to the Comptroller and to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of appropriations and matters relating to the budgets of state agencies, through the Office of Fiscal Analysis. The Comptroller shall set up such allotments on the Comptroller's books and be governed thereby in the control of expenditures of budgeted agencies.\n\n(e) The provisions of this section shall not be construed to authorize the Governor to reduce allotment requisitions or allotments in force concerning (1) aid to municipalities; or (2) any budgeted agency of the legislative or judicial branch, except that the Governor may propose an aggregate allotment reduction of a specified amount in accordance with this section for the legislative or judicial branch.

The committee may hold a public hearing on such proposed reductions. Such proposed reductions shall become effective unless they are rejected by a two-thirds vote of the members of the committee not later than fifteen days after receipt of the notification of objection to the proposed reductions. If the committee rejects such proposed reductions, the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management shall present an alternative plan to achieve such reductions to the president pro tempore and the speaker for any such proposal affecting the legislative branch or to the Chief Justice for any such proposal affecting the judicial branch. If proposed reductions in allotment requisitions or allotments in force for any budgeted agency of the legislative or judicial branch are not rejected, such reductions shall be achieved as determined by the Joint Committee on Legislative Management or the Chief Justice, as appropriate.
