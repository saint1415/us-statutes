No action on a claim under such contract shall be brought except within the period which commences with the execution of the contract or the authorized commencement of work on the contract project, whichever is earlier, and which ends three years after the acceptance of the work by the agency head of the department administering the contract evidenced by a certificate of acceptance issued to the contractor or three years after the termination of the contract, whichever is earlier. Issuance of such certificate of acceptance shall not be a condition precedent to the commencement of any action. Acceptance of an amount offered as final payment shall not preclude any person, firm or corporation from bringing a claim under this section. Such action shall be tried to the court without a jury.

The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to claims under a contract unless notice of each such claim and the factual bases of each claim has been given in writing to the agency head of the department administering the contract within the time period which commences with the execution of the contract or the authorized commencement of work on the contract project, whichever is earlier, and which ends two years after the acceptance of the work by the agency head evidenced by a certificate of acceptance issued to the contractor or two years after the termination of the contract, whichever is earlier. A demand for arbitration of any such claim shall include the amount of damages and the alleged facts and contractual or statutory provisions which form the basis of the claim.

Any such documents for which no decision is sought or privilege obtained shall not be subject to disclosure under section 1-210 and shall not be disclosed by the agency to any person or agency that is not a party to the arbitration. Such documents shall be used only for settlement or litigation of the parties' claims. The arbitrators shall determine any issue of relevance of such documents after an in camera inspection.

Unless the parties agree otherwise, no evidentiary hearing on the merits of the claim may be held less than six months after the demand for arbitration is filed with the dispute resolution entity.\n\n(e) The arbitrators shall conduct the hearing and shall hear evidence as to the facts, and arguments as to the interpretation and application of contractual provisions.

(a) to authorize action against state in superior court for claims arising out of awarding of contract by commissioner of public works, require as prerequisite to bringing any action against state in superior court under Subsec. (a) that the “factual bases” for claims be given to “agency head” of department administering contract, prohibit awarding of interest under Secs. 13a-96 and 37-3a to claimant for same debt for same period and prohibit accrual of interest until at least 30 days after claimant submits bill or claim for unpaid debt, amended Subsec.

Contract involved essentially the purchase of laundry equipment and work required to install the equipment was not sufficient for the contract to qualify under statute. 190 C. 212. Contracts for construction of city streets and a city bridge do not come within provisions of statute. 198 C. 185. Cited. 217 C. 281; 239 C. 93. Claim is barred unless it arises directly “under” contract, as opposed to “related to”, “connected with” or “derived from”. 250 C. 553. The waiver of sovereign immunity contained in section requires all existing disputed claims arising under a public works contract to be litigated or arbitrated in a single action. 287 C. 1. Defendant state agency expressly agreed to arbitration proceedings under section and therefore waived judicial review of the issue of arbitrability. 294 C. 695. Limited waiver of government immunity from suit does not abrogate doctrine of nullum tempus, i.e. no time runs against the king. 307 C. 412. Notice and demand re arbitration of liquidated damages claim was sufficient where it alerted department to the general nature of that claim, which is all that section requires. 319 C. 582.\n\nCited. 28 CA 175; 29 CA 292. Arbitration proceeding under section is not an action under Sec. 52-592. 87 CA 367. Since the stated basis of the unjust enrichment claim was that plaintiff performed services and provided materials that were not contemplated by the contract itself, the claim does not fall directly under the contract as required by the statute and therefore sovereign immunity bars the claim. 130 CA 211. Department explicitly contested arbitrability of matter and thereby did not waive judicial review of arbitrator's decision re arbitrability of claim; arbitration panel exceeded its authority by rendering award on a claim that was defined by a statutory waiver of sovereign immunity rather than by a contractual agreement. 141 CA 738; judgment reversed, see 319 C. 582.\n\nParties may agree to arbitrate as alternative to proceeding by suit. 28 CS 173. Action for breach of contract for highway design made in 1966 cannot be maintained as amendment extending section to design contracts was passed in 1969. 31 CS 313. Cited. 37 CS 50.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nCited. 211 C. 370; 221 C. 346. Notice under Subsec. does not require explicit statement of intent to bring an action, but only factually adequate written notice by a contractor to a department head asserting a right to payment of money believed to be owed, and plaintiff's letter constituted sufficient notice of claim. 299 C. 167.\n\nSubsec. (e):\n\nBecause statute governs form of an arbitrator's findings, decision and award and contains no well-defined, explicit or clear requirement that arbitration award be consistent with findings of fact, plaintiff could not establish the elements necessary to vacate arbitration award on the ground that arbitration panel manifestly disregarded the law. 273 C. 746.",

Each violation shall be a separate and distinct offense and in the case of a continuing violation each calendar day's continuance of the violation shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct offense. The executive head of the state or quasi-public agency may request the Attorney General to bring a civil action in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford to seek imposition and recovery of such civil penalty.\n\n(i) Each state agency or quasi-public agency shall post a notice of the provisions of this section relating to state employees and quasi-public agency employees in a conspicuous place that is readily available for viewing by employees of such agency or quasi-public agency.
