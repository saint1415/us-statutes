      "text": "(a) The term “offense” means any crime or violation which constitutes a breach of any law of this state or any other state, federal law or local law or ordinance of a political subdivision of this state, for which a sentence to a term of imprisonment or to a fine, or both, may be imposed, except one that defines a motor vehicle violation or is deemed to be an infraction. The term “crime” comprises felonies and misdemeanors. Every offense which is not a “crime” is a “violation”. Conviction of a violation shall not give rise to any disability or legal disadvantage based on conviction of a criminal offense.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the provisions of sections 53a-28 to 53a-44, inclusive, shall apply to motor vehicle violations. Said provisions shall apply to convictions under section 21a-278 except that the execution of any mandatory minimum sentence imposed under the provisions of said section may not be suspended.\n\n(1969, P.A. 828, S. 24; 1972, P.A. 294, S. 39; P.A. 75-380, S. 15; 75-577, S. 8, 126; P.A. 92-260, S. 8.)\n\nHistory: 1972 act added provision in Subsec.

In determining the appropriate terms of financial restitution, the court shall consider: (A) The financial resources of the offender and the burden restitution will place on other obligations of the offender; (B) the offender's ability to pay based on installments or other conditions; (C) the rehabilitative effect on the offender of the payment of restitution and the method of payment; and (D) other circumstances, including the financial burden and impact on the victim, that the court determines make the terms of restitution appropriate. If the court determines that the current financial resources of the offender or the offender's current ability to pay based on installments or other conditions are such that no appropriate terms of restitution can be determined, the court may forego setting such terms. The court shall articulate its findings on the record with respect to each of the factors set forth in subparagraphs (A) to (D), inclusive, of this subsection. Restitution ordered by the court pursuant to this subsection shall be based on easily ascertainable damages for injury or loss of property, actual expenses incurred for treatment for injury to persons and lost wages resulting from injury. Restitution shall not include reimbursement for damages for mental anguish, pain and suffering or other intangible losses, but may include the costs of counseling reasonably related to the offense. Restitution ordered by the court pursuant to this subsection shall be imposed or directed by a written order of the court on a form prescribed by the Chief Court Administrator containing the amount of damages for injury or loss of property, actual expenses incurred for treatment for injury to persons and lost wages resulting from injury as ascertained by the court. The order of the court shall direct that a certified copy of the completed form containing the written order be delivered by certified mail to each victim and contain an advisement to the victim that the order is enforceable as a judgment in a civil action as provided in section 53a-28a. The court shall retain the original of each form containing a written order of restitution as part of such offender's court record.\n\n(d) A sentence to a period of probation or conditional discharge in accordance with sections 53a-29 to 53a-34, inclusive, shall be deemed a revocable disposition, in that such sentence shall be tentative to the extent that it may be altered or revoked in accordance with said sections but for all other purposes it shall be deemed to be a final judgment of conviction.\n\n(e) When sentencing a person to a period of probation who has been convicted of (1) a misdemeanor that did not involve the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against another person or (2) a motor vehicle violation for which a sentence to a term of imprisonment may be imposed, the court shall consider, as a condition of such sentence of probation, ordering the person to perform community service in the community in which the offense or violation occurred. If the court determines that community service is appropriate, such community service may be implemented by a community court established in accordance with section 51-181c if the offense or violation occurred within the jurisdiction of a community court established by said section.\n\n(f) When sentencing a person to a period of probation who is or has been subject to a protective order, the court may issue a protective order that is effective during such period of probation.\n\n(g) In addition to any sentence imposed pursuant to section 53-247 or section 53a-73b, at the time of a person's sentencing for any conviction under said sections, the court shall order that, for the five-year period commencing from the date of such conviction or the date of such person's release from imprisonment for such conviction, whichever is later, such person (1) shall not harbor, own, possess, reside with, adopt or serve as a foster placement for any animal, and (2) shall not be employed by, or volunteer for, any entity in any position that involves care for, or regular contact with, any animal.\n\n(1969, P.A. 828, S. 28; 1971, P.A. 871, S. 10; P.A. 73-137, S. 7; 73-639, S. 3; P.A. 75-633, S. 4; P.A. 92-260, S. 11; P.A. 95-175, S. 1; P.A. 97-199, S. 1; June 18 Sp.

Notwithstanding the provisions of section 53a-32, the parties may agree to waive the requirement of a court hearing. The Court Support Services Division shall establish within its policy and procedures a requirement that any victim be notified whenever a person's sentence of probation may be terminated pursuant to this subsection. The sentencing court shall permit such victim to appear before the sentencing court for the purpose of making a statement for the record concerning whether such person's sentence of probation should be terminated. In lieu of such appearance, the victim may submit a written statement to the sentencing court and the sentencing court shall make such statement a part of the record. Prior to ordering that such person's sentence of probation be continued or terminated, the sentencing court shall consider the statement made or submitted by such victim.\n\n(h) For the purposes of this section, a motor vehicle violation for which a sentence to a term of imprisonment of more than one year may be imposed shall be deemed an unclassified felony.\n\n(1969, P.A. 828, S. 29; 1971, P.A. 871, S. 124, 129; P.A. 79-585, S. 8, 15; P.A. 89-219, S. 6, 10; P.A. 92-260, S. 12; P.A. 93-340, S. 12, 19; P.A. 95-142, S. 2; P.A. 01-84, S. 14, 26; P.A. 02-132, S. 30; P.A. 04-139, S. 8; P.A. 05-288, S. 181; P.A. 08-102, S. 1; P.A. 09-84, S. 1; P.A. 10-43, S. 19; P.A. 12-80, S. 4; 12-133, S. 18; P.A. 13-258, S. 6; P.A. 15-213, S. 2; P.A. 19-189, S. 14.)\n\nHistory: 1971 act repealed former Subsec.

Trial court's imposition of restitution as additional condition of probation was not punitive in nature and therefore did not affect defendant's sentence; section does not deprive trial court of jurisdiction to impose a condition of probation subsequent to initial sentencing and prior to defendant's commencement of probation period. 283 C. 735. Section not applicable to trial court's corrected order of probation because order was a clarification, not a modification, of conditions of probation previously imposed on defendant. 294 C. 516.\n\nCited. 9 CA 686; 12 CA 338; 14 CA 272; 19 CA 304; 22 CA 199; Id., 449; 32 CA 1; 33 CA 432; 34 CA 1; 39 CA 722; 45 CA 722. Trial court's modification of defendant's probation to include sex offender evaluation and treatment was proper; Office of Adult Probation had authority under statute to add an additional condition of probation; sexual offender treatment is clearly enumerated in Subsec. (a) and could have been imposed by sentencing court; and at any time during period of probation, after hearing and for good cause shown, court may modify or enlarge conditions of probation pursuant to Subsec. (c). 57 CA 112. Failure to deliver a written copy of conditions of probation did not excuse subsequent probation violation and did not invalidate resulting probation revocation. 58 CA 153. Condition required by Office of Adult Probation was inconsistent with those required by court. 69 CA 421; judgment reversed, see 268 C. 174. Under section, office had authority to include a curfew restriction on defendant at the start of his probationary period without a court hearing and a showing of good cause, and such a condition was not inconsistent with the purposes of probation. 75 CA 643.

(a):\n\nCited. 169 C. 223; 196 C. 305; 229 C. 285. Where, pursuant to a plea bargain, defendant pleads guilty to sexual assault in fourth degree in violation of Sec. 53a-73a and public indecency in violation of Sec. 53a-186, trial court acted within its discretion in permitting Office of Adult Probation to notify members of defendant's community. 250 C. 280. Subdiv. (4): Since damage to an unoccupied house was the “fruit” of the collective criminal trespass in which the youthful offender had participated and of which he was convicted, the damage had a nexus to the offense and accordingly the order of restitution was reasonably related to the consequence of the youth's criminal trespass and well within the discretion of the trial court even though the youth had not personally profited from the trespass or caused any physical damage to the property. 301 C. 684.\n\nCited. 3 CA 410; 7 CA 326; 42 CA 460; 45 CA 722. Trial court's order of sexual offender treatment was authorized because section grants the court broad authority to impose any other conditions reasonably related to rehabilitation. 57 CA 743. Court's order that defendant pay veterinary and impoundment bills incurred from defendant's failure to restrain an animal from doing injury to another animal in violation of Sec. 53-247(a) was proper because such bills met statutory requirement of “fruits” for which the court may order restitution and such order did not violate “due process” because court was justified in concluding that defendant had means of earning income during the period set for restitution. 84 CA 542. Trial court's order of specialized sex offender treatment as condition of probation was authorized under Subdiv. (17) re “other conditions reasonably related to” rehabilitation and was not prohibited due to omission from Subdiv. (12) which enumerated certain crimes meriting such treatment. 95 CA 686. Court's termination of defendant's status in accelerated rehabilitation program cannot rest solely on undisposed charge of a crime identical to the underlying charge for which defendant seeks dismissal. 98 CA 111. Subdiv. (17): In order for a condition of probation to be “reasonably related to the defendant's rehabilitation” pursuant to Subdiv., there must be a nexus between the condition of probation and the charge for which defendant is serving probation. 102 CA 507. Although trial court specifically ordered restitution, it did not find that any damage was caused to the victim by defendant or that defendant profited from the criminal activity, nor was any rehabilitative purpose cited, so there is no basis for the court's order. 118 CA 236; judgment reversed, see 301 C. 684.\n\nCited. 35 CS 675; 37 CS 853; 39 CS 504. Defendant found to have complied with terms of his accelerated rehabilitation program which required that he refrain from violating any criminal laws of the United States, this state or any other state, notwithstanding fact that defendant pled guilty to criminal charges stemming from separate events that occurred after date that he applied for entry into accelerated rehabilitation but prior to date that he was actually accepted into program. 50 CS 383.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\nCited. 229 C. 285.\n\nCited. 3 CA 410; 33 CA 103; 42 CA 768. Office's requirement that, as part of sex offender treatment, defendant refrain from use of alcohol is consistent with terms ordered by the court and therefore properly imposed by office. 60 CA 614. Probation officer could not enter into agreement with defendant that would have been in direct contradiction to a condition of probation imposed by sentencing court. 86 CA 657.\n\nCited. 37 CS 853.\n\nSubsec. (c):\n\nSpecial condition on probation administration properly imposed 1 year after sentencing in exercise of court's discretion. 207 C. 152. Once defendant is discharged from probation, the conditions of his probation are no longer subject to modification or enlargement. 287 C. 478.\n\nCited. 33 CA 103; 37 CA 72; 42 CA 768. Probation officer did not have authority to modify original conditions of probation ordered by sentencing court. 86 CA 657. Statute mandates that a court conduct a hearing related to any decision to modify probation and the hearing must be the forum in which the court explores the issue of whether good cause exists at the time the court is considering modifying the terms of the probation; the court may not modify probation unless there is a showing of good cause. 107 CA 800; judgment reversed, see 294 C. 516. When the state enters into a plea agreement that includes a period of probation, both defendant and the state do so with the understanding that the terms of probation may be modified or enlarged in accordance with law, and that such a modification might include a reduction. 147 CA 465.",

      "text": "(a) At any time during the period of probation or conditional discharge, the court or any judge thereof may issue a warrant for the arrest of a defendant for violation of any of the conditions of probation or conditional discharge, or may issue a notice to appear to answer to a charge of such violation, which notice shall be personally served upon the defendant. Whenever a probation officer has probable cause to believe that a person on probation who is a serious firearm offender has violated a condition of probation, or knows that a person on probation for a felony conviction has been arrested for the commission of a serious firearm offense, such probation officer shall apply to the court or any judge thereof for a warrant for the arrest of such person for violation of a condition or conditions of probation or conditional discharge. Any such warrant shall authorize all officers named therein to return the defendant to the custody of the court or to any suitable detention facility designated by the court. Whenever a probation officer has probable cause to believe that a person has violated a condition of such person's probation, such probation officer (1) may notify any police officer that such person has, in such officer's judgment, violated the conditions of such person's probation, and (2) shall notify such police officer if such person is a serious firearm offender or is on probation for a felony conviction and has been arrested for the commission of a serious firearm offense. Such notice shall be sufficient warrant for the police officer to arrest such person and return such person to the custody of the court or to any suitable detention facility designated by the court. Whenever a probation officer so notifies a police officer, the probation officer shall notify the victim of the offense for which such person is on probation, and any victim advocate assigned to assist the victim, provided the probation officer has been provided with the name and contact information for such victim or victim advocate. Any probation officer may arrest any defendant on probation without a warrant or may deputize any other officer with power to arrest to do so by giving such other officer a written statement setting forth that the defendant has, in the judgment of the probation officer, violated the conditions of the defendant's probation. Such written statement, delivered with the defendant by the arresting officer to the official in charge of any correctional center or other place of detention, shall be sufficient warrant for the detention of the defendant. After making such an arrest, such probation officer shall present to the detaining authorities a similar statement of the circumstances of violation. Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, provisions regarding release on bail of persons charged with a crime shall be applicable to any defendant arrested under the provisions of this section. Upon such arrest and detention, the probation officer shall immediately so notify the court or any judge thereof.\n\n(b) When the defendant is presented for arraignment on the charge of violation of any of the conditions of probation or conditional discharge, the court shall review any conditions previously imposed on the defendant and may order, as a condition of the pretrial release of the defendant, that the defendant comply with any or all of such conditions in addition to any conditions imposed pursuant to section 54-64a. Unless the court, pursuant to subsection (c) of section 54-64a, orders that the defendant remain under the supervision of a probation officer or other designated person or organization, the defendant shall be supervised by the Court Support Services Division of the Judicial Branch in accordance with subsection (a) of section 54-63b.\n\n(c) Upon notification by the probation officer of the arrest of the defendant or upon an arrest by warrant as herein provided, the court shall cause the defendant to be brought before it without unnecessary delay for a hearing on the violation charges. At such hearing the defendant shall be informed of the manner in which such defendant is alleged to have violated the conditions of such defendant's probation or conditional discharge, shall be advised by the court that such defendant has the right to retain counsel and, if indigent, shall be entitled to the services of the public defender, and shall have the right to cross-examine witnesses and to present evidence in such defendant's own behalf. Unless good cause is shown, a charge of violation of any of the conditions of probation or conditional discharge shall be disposed of or scheduled for a hearing not later than one hundred twenty days after the defendant is arraigned on such charge, except, if the defendant is a serious firearm offender, or is on probation for a felony conviction and has been arrested for the commission of a serious firearm offense, such charge shall be disposed of or scheduled for a hearing not later than sixty days after the defendant is arraigned on such charge.\n\n(d) If such violation is established and the violation consisted of the commission of a serious firearm offense or the defendant is a serious firearm offender, the court shall revoke the sentence of probation or conditional discharge, otherwise, the court may: (1) Continue the sentence of probation or conditional discharge; (2) modify or enlarge the conditions of probation or conditional discharge; (3) extend the period of probation or conditional discharge, provided the original period with any extensions shall not exceed the periods authorized by section 53a-29; or (4) revoke the sentence of probation or conditional discharge. If such sentence is revoked, the court shall require the defendant to serve the sentence imposed or impose any lesser sentence. Any such lesser sentence may include a term of imprisonment, all or a portion of which may be suspended entirely or after a period set by the court, followed by a period of probation with such conditions as the court may establish. No such revocation shall be ordered, except upon consideration of the whole record and unless such violation is established by the introduction of reliable and probative evidence and by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n(e) Provisions regarding release on bail of any serious firearm offender arrested pursuant to this section who is charged with a crime, or any felony offender arrested pursuant to this section for a serious firearm offense, shall be applicable to such serious firearm offender provided that, for the purpose of applying such provisions, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such serious firearm offender poses a danger to the safety of other persons.\n\n(1969, P.A. 828, S. 32; 1971, P.A. 871, S. 12; P.A. 86-403, S. 89, 132; P.A. 95-142, S. 7; P.A. 98-130; P.A. 99-187, S. 4; P.A. 08-102, S. 7; P.A. 10-43, S. 20; P.A. 12-114, S. 14; P.A. 13-214, S. 1; P.A. 23-53, S. 37.)\n\nHistory: 1971 act clarified Subsec.

(b) to add provision that any lesser sentence imposed upon revocation may include a term of imprisonment followed by a period of probation; P.A. 99-187 amended Subsec. (a) to add provision authorizing a probation officer to place a defendant who, in such officer's judgment, has violated the conditions of such defendant's probation in the zero-tolerance drug supervision program in lieu of returning such defendant to court for violation of probation proceedings and to make technical changes for purposes of gender neutrality; P.A. 08-102 added new Subsec. (b) re court review of previously imposed conditions, court-ordered pretrial release conditions and supervising authority for defendant, designated existing provisions re hearing on violation charges as Subsec. (c) and amended same to make a technical change and add requirement that a charge of violation be disposed of or scheduled for a hearing not later than 120 days after arraignment, and redesignated existing Subsec. (b) as Subsec. (d); P.A. 10-43 amended Subsec. (a) to delete provision authorizing probation officer to place defendant who has violated conditions of probation in zero-tolerance drug supervision program and to authorize probation officer to notify police officer whenever probation officer has probable cause to believe that a person has violated a condition of such person's probation, rather than only when a sexual offender has violated the conditions of such person's probation by failing to notify probation officer of any change of such person's residence address; P.A. 12-114 amended Subsec. (a) to add provision re probation officer to notify victim when probation officer notifies a police officer of a probation violation; P.A. 13-214 amended Subsec. (a) to add provisions requiring probation officer to notify victim advocate assigned to assist victim when probation officer notifies a police officer of a probation violation; P.A. 23-53 added language re serious firearm offender or arrest for serious firearm offense throughout and as Subsec. (e), and added provision re exception for Subsec. (e) in Subsec. (a)(2).",

Section does not prevent court from revoking probation for failure to satisfy probation condition of successful completion of sexual offender treatment related to a crime committed under Sec. 53a-21(a)(1) which is not enumerated in section because section's automatic nature does not deprive courts of discretion to revoke probation under other circumstances. 95 CA 686. Simply because automatic revocation proceeding established by section arguably is inapplicable to defendant convicted after trial, it does not follow that such defendant is immune from discretionary revocation sought by defendant's probation officer on the basis of defendant's discharge from sex offender treatment in accordance with the normal procedures set forth in Sec. 53a-32. 98 CA 579. Defendant, who was aware of the terms of his probation when entering his plea, violated his probation when he refused to discuss the details of his underlying offense at counseling. 112 CA 562.",

Finding by trial court, rather than jury, that imposing extended incarceration would best serve the public interest clearly violated defendant's constitutional rights under the sixth amendment to U.S. Constitution; section is unconstitutional to the extent it does not provide that defendant is entitled to have jury make a required finding that exposes defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by jury's guilty verdict. 283 C. 748.\n\nCited. 9 CA 686; 12 CA 1; 31 CA 140; 36 CA 401; 37 CA 733; 45 CA 369; Id., 390.

Section constitutes a sentence enhancement and not an independent criminal offense. 117 CA 486. Rule in 283 C. 748 does not apply retroactively. 130 CA 435. Defendant's status as a persistent felony offender and his resulting sentence enhancements do not run contrary to the plain language of section which permits enhancement of defendant's conviction of robbery in the first degree under Subsec. (a) and of his conviction of attempt to escape from custody under Subsec. (b) and defendant's arguments that his conviction of robbery in the first degree under Subsec. (a) precludes a sentence enhancement under Subsec. (b) and that the legislature did not intend for more than one recidivist enhancement to apply to the conviction of multiple current charges because he was not afforded the opportunity to reform are without merit. 173 CA 119; judgment affirmed in part, see 330 C. 793.\n\nSubsec.

Purpose is to allow sentencing court to impose a more severe sentence than would be allowed for the substantive offense; Subsec. requires sentencing court to consider defendant's history and character and the nature and circumstances of his criminal conduct and whether extended incarceration and lifetime supervision will best serve the public interest; there is no requirement that sentences imposed be strictly proportional to the nature of substantive offense or offenses of which defendant was convicted; nature of substantive offense is only one factor to be considered by sentencing court. 254 C. 613.\n\nCited. 19 CA 571. Under plain and unambiguous language of Subsec., only class D felonies, which carry a lesser maximum punishment than unclassified felonies, are excluded as predicate felonies, the legislature having specifically chosen not to exclude unclassified felonies. 128 CA 765. When defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently pleads guilty to a sentence enhancement provision, defendant waives right to jury trial thereon, and no constitutional violation occurs where defendant's increased penalty allegedly results from trial court's, rather than jury's, consideration of factors other than defendant's previous convictions. 141 CA 814.\n\nSubsec. (i) (former Subsec. (h)):\n\nUnder 2001 revision, section clearly reflected legislature's negative view of persistent dangerous felony offenders and the degree of punishment it wished to impose on them at the time defendant committed the offenses such that defendant was on fair notice that the substantive provision of section would apply even if certain procedural provisions were later found to be unconstitutional; text and legislative history of section indicate that the term “public interest”, as used in section, does not include the public interest in minimizing costs of incarceration. 303 C. 246.\n\nCited. 21 CA 331; 37 CA 228. Court followed 283 C. 748 in holding that jury and not the court must make finding of whether defendant's extended incarceration will best serve the public interest. 105 CA 278. Section is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant or on its face. 121 CA 672.\n\nSubsec. (k) (former Subsec. (j)):\n\nUnder 2007 revision, and following 283 C. 748, where defendant's guilty plea effectively waived his right to a jury finding that enhancement of his sentence as a persistent serious felony offender was in the public interest, defendant was not presumed to have waived a court finding on the public interest determination and the court was the proper entity to make such public interest determination. 143 CA 76. The applicable law for the purposes of sentencing the defendant was the law in effect at the time that the crimes were committed, which authorized the court to enhance the defendant's sentence under the public interest provision that was eliminated in 2008, since there was no language stating that the legislative amendment applied retroactively. 206 CA 209.",

If any person is convicted of, or found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect of, any crime not specified in subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection, the court may, for good cause shown, issue a standing criminal protective order pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(b) Such standing criminal protective order may include, but need not be limited to, provisions enjoining the offender from (1) imposing any restraint upon the person or liberty of the victim; (2) threatening, harassing, assaulting, molesting, sexually assaulting or attacking the victim; or (3) entering the family dwelling or the dwelling of the victim.

(a) to add references to Secs. 53a-181c, 53a-181d and 53a-181e; June Sp. Sess. P.A. 98-1 made a technical change in Subsec. (c), effective June 24, 1998; P.A. 99-186 amended Subsec. (a) to make provisions applicable to any person convicted “of attempt or conspiracy to violate any of said sections or section 53a-54a”; P.A. 05-147 amended Subsec. (a) to include a violation of Sec. 53a-223 and make a technical change; P.A. 07-123 amended Subsec. (a) to designate list of qualifying offenses as Subdiv. (1) and amended same by including a violation of Sec. 53a-182b, 53a-183, 53a-223a or 53a-223b and making technical changes, to add Subdiv. (2) re any crime that the court determines constitutes a family violence crime, as defined in Sec. 46b-38a, or attempt or conspiracy to commit any such crime, include sentence authorized under Sec. 53a-36 and to add provision authorizing a court for good cause shown to issue standing criminal restraining order if person is convicted of a crime against a family or household member other than a crime specified in Subdiv. (1) or (2); P.A. 10-144 substituted “standing criminal protective order” for “standing criminal restraining order” in Subsecs. (a) and (b), amended Subsec. (a) to provide that order remain in effect for duration specified by court, made technical changes in Subsec. (b) and replaced former Subsec. (c) re required language with new Subsec. (c) re required notice; P.A. 11-152 amended Subsec. (a)(1) to include a violation of Sec. 53-21(a)(1) or (2), 53a-70c or 53a-73a; P.A. 14-147 added Subsec. (d) defining “standing criminal protective order”; P.A. 14-217 amended Subsec. (c) to replace “five years” and “five thousand dollars” with “ten years” and “ten thousand dollars”, respectively, and make a technical change, effective January 1, 2015; P.A. 14-234 amended Subsec. (a) by deleting references to crime against a family member or household member, as defined in Sec. 46b-38a, and making a conforming change, effective January 1, 2015; P.A. 16-71 amended Subsec. (a)(1) by adding reference to Sec. 53a-192a(a)(2); P.A. 17-163 added provision re victim enrolled in school or institution of higher education in Subsec. (b), effective January 1, 2018; P.A. 19-189 amended Subsec. (a) by replacing “53a-70b,” with “section 53a-70b of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2019, or”; P.A. 21-78 designated existing provisions of Subsec. (c) as Subdiv. (1) and added Subdiv. (2) re notice to victim protected by order; P.A. 24-137 amended Subsec. (a) by adding references to any person found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect.\n\nSee Sec. 51-5c re automated registry of protective orders.\n\nImposition of a standing criminal restraining order after defendant began serving his sentence did not constitute punishment or affect defendant's sentence and therefore, trial court had jurisdiction to impose it. 269 C. 107.\n\nOrder precluding defendant from having contact with his minor children is within scope of statute. 81 CA 84.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nSubsec. clearly articulates the discretionary standard for trial courts when imposing standing criminal protective orders; there is nothing in the Subsec. that suggests that a trial court's authority to issue a standing criminal protective order has a temporal element to it or is limited to when there is a change in circumstances. 221 CA 164.",

Such hearing shall be conducted (1) before the jury that determined the defendant's guilt, or (2) before a jury impaneled for the purpose of such hearing if (A) the defendant was convicted upon a plea of guilty; (B) the defendant was convicted after a trial before three judges as provided in subsection (b) of section 53a-45; or (C) if the jury that determined the defendant's guilt has been discharged by the court for good cause, or (3) before the court, on motion of the defendant and with the approval of the court and the consent of the state.\n\n(c) In such hearing the court shall disclose to the defendant or his counsel all material contained in any presentence report that may have been prepared. No presentence information withheld from the defendant shall be considered in determining the existence of any mitigating or aggravating factor. Any information relevant to any mitigating factor may be presented by either the state or the defendant, regardless of its admissibility under the rules governing admission of evidence in trials of criminal matters, but the admissibility of information relevant to any of the aggravating factors set forth in subsection (i) of this section shall be governed by the rules governing the admission of evidence in such trials. The state and the defendant shall be permitted to rebut any information received at the hearing and shall be given fair opportunity to present argument as to the adequacy of the information to establish the existence of any mitigating or aggravating factor. The burden of establishing any of the aggravating factors set forth in subsection (i) of this section shall be on the state. The burden of establishing any mitigating factor shall be on the defendant.\n\n(d) In determining whether a mitigating factor exists concerning the defendant's character, background or history, or the nature and circumstances of the crime, pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the jury or, if there is no jury, the court shall first determine whether a particular factor concerning the defendant's character, background or history, or the nature and circumstances of the crime, has been established by the evidence, and shall determine further whether that factor is mitigating in nature, considering all the facts and circumstances of the case. Mitigating factors are such as do not constitute a defense or excuse for the capital felony of which the defendant has been convicted, but which, in fairness and mercy, may be considered as tending either to extenuate or reduce the degree of his culpability or blame for the offense or to otherwise constitute a basis for a sentence less than death.\n\n(e) The jury or, if there is no jury, the court shall return a special verdict setting forth its findings as to the existence of any factor set forth in subsection (h) of this section, the existence of any aggravating factor or factors set forth in subsection (i) of this section and whether any aggravating factor or factors outweigh any mitigating factor or factors found to exist pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(f) If the jury or, if there is no jury, the court finds that (1) none of the factors set forth in subsection (h) of this section exist, (2) one or more of the aggravating factors set forth in subsection (i) of this section exist, and (3) (A) no mitigating factor exists or (B) one or more mitigating factors exist but are outweighed by one or more aggravating factors set forth in subsection (i) of this section, the court shall sentence the defendant to death.\n\n(g) If the jury or, if there is no jury, the court finds that (1) any of the factors set forth in subsection (h) of this section exist, or (2) none of the aggravating factors set forth in subsection (i) of this section exists, or (3) one or more of the aggravating factors set forth in subsection (i) of this section exist and one or more mitigating factors exist, but the one or more aggravating factors set forth in subsection (i) of this section do not outweigh the one or more mitigating factors, the court shall impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release.\n\n(h) The court shall not impose the sentence of death on the defendant if the jury or, if there is no jury, the court finds by a special verdict, as provided in subsection (e) of this section, that at the time of the offense (1) the defendant was a person with intellectual disability, as defined in section 1-1g, or (2) the defendant's mental capacity was significantly impaired or the defendant's ability to conform the defendant's conduct to the requirements of law was significantly impaired but not so impaired in either case as to constitute a defense to prosecution, or (3) the defendant was criminally liable under sections 53a-8, 53a-9 and 53a-10 for the offense, which was committed by another, but the defendant's participation in such offense was relatively minor, although not so minor as to constitute a defense to prosecution, or (4) the defendant could not reasonably have foreseen that the defendant's conduct in the course of commission of the offense of which the defendant was convicted would cause, or would create a grave risk of causing, death to another person.\n\n(i) The aggravating factors to be considered shall be limited to the following: (1) The defendant committed the offense during the commission or attempted commission of, or during the immediate flight from the commission or attempted commission of, a felony and the defendant had previously been convicted of the same felony; or (2) the defendant committed the offense after having been convicted of two or more state offenses or two or more federal offenses or of one or more state offenses and one or more federal offenses for each of which a penalty of more than one year imprisonment may be imposed, which offenses were committed on different occasions and which involved the infliction of serious bodily injury upon another person; or (3) the defendant committed the offense and in such commission knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim of the offense; or (4) the defendant committed the offense in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner; or (5) the defendant procured the commission of the offense by payment, or promise of payment, of anything of pecuniary value; or (6) the defendant committed the offense as consideration for the receipt, or in expectation of the receipt, of anything of pecuniary value; or (7) the defendant committed the offense with an assault weapon, as defined in section 53-202a; or (8) the defendant committed the offense set forth in subdivision (1) of section 53a-54b to avoid arrest for a criminal act or prevent detection of a criminal act or to hamper or prevent the victim from carrying out any act within the scope of the victim's official duties or to retaliate against the victim for the performance of the victim's official duties.\n\n(P.A. 73-137, S. 4; P.A. 80-332, S. 1; 80-442, S. 14, 28; P.A. 85-366, S. 1; P.A. 93-306, S. 12; P.A. 95-19, S. 1; P.A. 01-151, S. 1, 2, 5; P.A. 11-129, S. 20; P.A. 12-5, S. 5; P.A. 15-84, S. 6.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 80-332 restated provisions and referred to mitigating or aggravating factors throughout, replacing references to factors set forth in Subsecs. (f) and (g); P.A. 80-442 referred to imposition of sentence in accordance with Sec. 53a-35a(1) rather than to sentence for a Class A felony in Subsec. (e), effective July 1, 1981; P.A. 85-366 added a new Subsec. (d) to specify the procedure for the determination by a jury or court of the existence of a mitigating factor and to add a definition of mitigating factors, relettered the remaining Subsecs. and amended Subsec. (f) to replace “a sentence in accordance with Sec. 53a-35a(1)” with “a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release”; P.A. 93-306 amended Subsec. (h) to add as an aggravating factor that the defendant committed the offense with an assault weapon; P.A. 95-19 revised section to permit the jury or court to make findings as to whether any aggravating factor or factors outweigh any mitigating factor or factors and require the court to sentence the defendant accordingly, while retaining provision that the existence of certain factors concerning the defendant will operate to automatically bar the imposition of the death sentence, and, more specifically, amended Subsec. (b) to provide that the separate hearing shall not be held if the state stipulates “that any factor set forth in subsection (h) exists” rather than “that one or more mitigating factors exist” and make technical changes, amended Subsec. (c) to make technical changes, amended Subsec. (e) to require the jury or court to return a special verdict setting forth its findings as to “the existence of any factor set forth in subsection (h), the existence of any aggravating factor or factors set forth in subsection (i) and whether any aggravating factor or factors outweigh any mitigating factor or factors found to exist pursuant to subsection (d)” rather than “the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factor”, amended Subsec. (f) to revise the circumstances that must be found for the court to impose the death sentence by requiring the court to sentence the defendant to death if the jury or court finds “that (1) none of the factors set forth in subsection (h) exist, (2) one or more of the aggravating factors set forth in subsection (i) exist and (3)(A) no mitigating factor exists or (B) one or more mitigating factors exist but are outweighed by one or more aggravating factors set forth in subsection (i)” rather than “that one or more of the factors set forth in subsection (h) exist and that no mitigating factor exists”, designated provisions of Subsec. (f) re the circumstances that must be found for the court to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release as new Subsec. (g) and amended said Subsec. to require the court to impose said sentence if the jury or court finds “that (1) any of the factors set forth in subsection (h) exist, or (2) none of the aggravating factors set forth in subsection (i) exists or (3) one or more of the aggravating factors set forth in subsection (i) exist and one or more mitigating factors exist, but the one or more aggravating factors set forth in subsection (i) do not outweigh the one or more mitigating factors” rather than “that none of the factors set forth in subsection (h) exists or that one or more mitigating factors exist”, redesignated former Subsec. (g) as new Subsec. (h) and amended said Subsec. to replace the provision that the court shall not impose the death sentence if the jury or court finds that “any mitigating factor exists” and that “the mitigating factors to be considered concerning the defendant shall include, but are not limited to” the five enumerated factors with the provision that the court shall not impose the death sentence if the jury or court finds any of the enumerated factors and deleted former Subdiv. (3) as a factor that would in and of itself bar the imposition of the death sentence the circumstance that at the time of the offense the defendant “was under unusual and substantial duress, although not such duress as to constitute a defense to prosecution”, renumbering Subdivs. (4) and (5) as Subdivs. (3) and (4), respectively, redesignated former Subsec. (h) re aggravating factors as new Subsec. (i) and amended said Subsec. to replace the provision requiring the court to impose the death sentence if no mitigating factor is present and the jury or court finds one of the enumerated factors with “The aggravating factors to be considered shall be limited to the following:”; P.A. 01-151 amended Subsec. (h) to add new Subdiv. (2) barring the imposition of the death sentence on a defendant who was a person with mental retardation, as defined in Sec. 1-1g, redesignate existing Subdivs. (2), (3) and (4) as Subdivs. (3), (4) and (5), and make technical changes for purposes of gender neutrality and amended Subsec. (i) to add Subdiv. (8) establishing as an aggravating factor the commission of the offense set forth in Sec. 53a-54b(1) to avoid arrest for a criminal act, prevent detection of a criminal act, hamper or prevent the victim carrying out the victim's official duties or retaliate against the victim for performance of the victim's official duties and make a technical change for purposes of gender neutrality, effective July 1, 2001; pursuant to P.A. 11-129, “mental retardation” was changed editorially by the Revisors to “intellectual disability” in Subsec. (h)(2); P.A. 12-5 amended Subsec. (a) to replace reference to capital felony with provision re capital felony committed prior to April 25, 2012, under provisions of Sec. 53a-54b in effect prior to April 25, 2012, effective April 25, 2012; P.A. 15-84 amended Subsec. (a) to designate existing provision re hearing as Subdiv. (1) and add Subdiv. (2) re person 18 years of age or older at time of offense, amended Subsec. (h) to delete former Subdiv. (1) re defendant under age 18 and redesignate existing Subdivs. (2) to (5) as Subdivs. (1) to (4), and made technical changes, effective October 1, 2015, and applicable to any person convicted prior to, on or after that date.\n\nSee Sec. 53a-35b re definition of “life imprisonment”.\n\nSee Sec. 53a-35c re availability of sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of release.\n\nCited. 197 C. 436; 207 C. 374; 209 C. 225; 212 C. 258; 221 C. 430; 225 C. 559. Does not violate prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment nor infringe on rights to due process. 230 C. 183. Cited. 233 C. 813; 234 C. 735; 235 C. 206; 237 C. 332; 238 C. 389; 240 C. 743; 242 C. 409. Court upheld previous holding that statute does not require a capital sentencer to give mitigating force to any particular proven factor solely because that factor establishes something good about defendant; instead, statute leaves the decision as to whether a proven factor is mitigating in nature to sentencer's reasoned moral judgment; once sentencer has found an aggravating factor proven beyond a reasonable doubt, there is no requirement that it go further and make an additional determination that the presence of that factor justifies imposition of the death penalty. 264 C. 1. Statutory scheme does not contemplate right of allocution in a capital sentencing hearing; once one or more jurors find that defendant has proven existence of a mitigating factor by a preponderance of the evidence, entire jury, and not just those jurors who have found the existence of that mitigating factor, proceed to the weighing process; nonunanimous decision during penalty phase of a capital trial does not result automatically in sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release; trial court improperly declined to instruct jury that, in order to sentence defendant to death, it must be persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating factor or factors outweigh mitigating factor or factors and that, accordingly, it is persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that death is the appropriate punishment. 272 C. 106. Death penalty does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment; holdings in 230 C. 183 and 238 C. 389 reaffirmed. 303 C. 71. Death penalty unconstitutional under Art. I, Secs. 8 and 9 of Connecticut Constitution. 318 C. 1.\n\nCited. 9 CA 686; 32 CA 296; 36 CA 364.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\nTerm “judges” in the first sentence does not entitle defendant who elected to have a jury determine his sentence at the penalty phase hearing to have all three members of the panel before whom the guilt phase was conducted preside at such hearing. 264 C. 1. Provision does not preclude trial court's declaring a mistrial and impaneling new jury after original jury becomes deadlocked in penalty phase of a capital case. 271 C. 338. Subdiv. (3): Defendant's decision to forgo jury determination in capital felony sentencing proceeding and opt for sentencing by three-judge panel was knowing, voluntary and intelligent; formulaic canvass of defendant is not required and validity of jury waiver is determined by examination of totality of the circumstances. 303 C. 71.\n\nSubsec. (c):\n\nCited. 241 C. 57. The state may present evidence to rebut mitigation at the penalty phase that would not be admissible under normal rules of evidence; under statute, the state like defendant only has to meet the relevancy standard for evidence to be allowed. 251 C. 579. Although defendant may offer any evidence relevant to any mitigating factor, trial court is vested with discretion to exclude irrelevant information. 272 C. 106.\n\nSubsec. (d):\n\nMercy is a legitimate consideration only insofar as it is related to mitigating evidence; requirement for capital sentencer to consider “all the facts and circumstances of the case” is not unconstitutionally vague. 264 C. 1. Lack of remorse is not listed as a statutory aggravating factor, and so may not be relied upon as an aggravating factor, but because mitigating factors call upon jury to elect whether to exercise mercy, defendant's lack of remorse will be relevant generally to rebut defendant's claimed mitigating factors; jury must make its determination of whether the proposed mitigating evidence is mitigating in nature considering all facts and circumstances of the case, but statute does not require that mitigating evidence have some nexus to the offense. 266 C. 171. “Facts and circumstances” language is a constitutionally permissible method of determining how mitigating circumstances are to be established; nowhere does statute require that mitigating evidence have some nexus to the offense. 272 C. 106. Requiring fact finder to determine whether a particular mitigating factor established by the evidence is mitigating in nature as a prerequisite to the weighing of aggravating and mitigating factors does not improperly prevent mitigating evidence offered by defendant from being given full consideration and effect; not improper for three-judge panel to find cumulative factor both factually proven and to be mitigating in nature but not find any of the individual factors to be mitigating in nature although some were factually proven. 303 C. 71. Court's instruction to jury that it was permitted, but not required, to cumulate the evidence to find a mitigating factor complies with previously articulated constitutional standard; instruction describing mitigating evidence as “unique factors concerning the nature of the crime or who the defendant is” did not preclude jury from considering relevant mitigating evidence; “facts and circumstances” language does not unconstitutionally preclude sentencer from considering relevant mitigating evidence and does not unconstitutionally require that mitigating factor have some nexus to the crime; addition of weighing process in 1995 does not alter the constitutionality of allocating to defendant the burden of proving that a factor is mitigating in light of the facts and circumstances of the case. 305 C. 101, but see 318 C. 1.\n\nSubsec. (e):\n\nCited. 199 C. 163. Imposition of death penalty premised on two unanimous findings by trier of fact that (1) existence of aggravating factor proved beyond a reasonable doubt by state, and (2) existence of a mitigating factor not proved by defendant by a preponderance of the evidence. 207 C. 374.\n\nSubsec. (f):\n\nCited. 199 C. 163; 208 C. 125; 237 C. 694. Statute requires that jury determine that aggravating factors outweigh mitigating factors by any amount or degree; in light of the unique nature of death penalty, of the need for reliability and consistency and the nature of rendering a verdict requiring death penalty, jury must be persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating factors outweigh mitigating factors and therefore it is persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that death sentence should be imposed. 266 C. 171. Three-judge panel could reasonably have concluded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant's age, troubled background and other aspects of his person were outweighed, by any amount or degree, by the cruelty, heinousness and depravity of defendant's crime. 303 C. 71.\n\nSubsec. (g):\n\nCited. 199 C. 163; 235 C. 206; 238 C. 828. Although trial court should generally use language of Subdiv. (2) in instructing jury on the statutory mitigating factor, it is not possible that court's minor misstatement, involving such a tenuous semantic distinction, could have misled jury; general thrust of statute as a whole persuades us that legislature intended to recognize as mitigating, per se, only those factors that tend to reduce defendant's moral culpability for the offense and make it unlikely that threat of execution would serve as effective deterrent; “mental capacity” as used in Subdiv. (2) is not open-ended term referring to any and all types of mental function, but refers specifically to defendant's ability, at time of the offense, to understand the wrongful nature and consequences of his conduct; legislature's intent in enacting Subsec. was to specify factual circumstances under which defendant's moral culpability for committing the offense is reduced; in order to establish either prong of the mitigating factor of Subdiv. (2), defendant must show that his mental impairment had a causal nexus with the offense, thereby reducing his moral culpability. 269 C. 213.\n\nSubsec. (h):\n\nSubdiv. (4): Meaning of “especially cruel” must include intentional infliction of extreme pain or torture above and beyond that necessarily accompanying the underlying killing. 212 C. 258. “Same felony” means a felony that is the same in all material respects as the felony that is committed in this state during commission of the capital felony; that requirement is fully satisfied only if the two felonies share the same essential elements. 264 C. 1.\n\nSubsec. (i):\n\nTo qualify as an aggravating factor that defendant committed the offense in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner, victim must have suffered extreme pain and torture beyond that necessary to cause death. 253 C. 1. Subdiv. (6) does not apply to a capital felony committed during the course of a robbery. 261 C. 111. In order to establish the aggravating factor defined in Subdiv. (4), state must prove that defendant murdered both victims in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner. 262 C. 537. Principles of accessorial liability may be used to prove aggravating factors in the penalty phase of a capital case. 271 C. 338. Subdiv. (3): In order to establish this aggravating factor, state must prove that defendant knew that in killing one person, another person would be subject to a very serious risk or danger to his or her life. Id. Subdiv. (4) requires proof that defendant engaged in intentional conduct that inflicted extreme physical or psychological pain, suffering or torture on victim above and beyond that necessarily accompanying the underlying killing, and that defendant specifically intended to inflict such extreme pain, suffering or torture or was callous or indifferent to the extreme physical or psychological pain, suffering or torture that his intentional conduct in fact inflicted on victim. 272 C. 106. Subdiv. (4): Court's limiting instruction on aggravating factor of committing offense in “an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner” that permits proof by callousness or indifference to the additional pain, suffering or torture that defendant's intentional conduct inflicted on the victim does not render aggravating factor unconstitutionally vague. 303 C. 71. Subdiv. (6): It is not a violation of the state constitution for the sole aggravating factor found by the jury, namely, murder committed for pecuniary gain, to duplicate an element of the underlying crime of capital felony by murder for hire under Sec. 53a-54b(2); statutory language does not impose any additional temporal or premeditation requirements beyond that the expectation of compensation must be created before the murder and exist at the time of the murder. 305 C. 101, but see 318 C. 1.\n\nSubdiv. (1): To ensure that prior felony conviction that is based on a constitutionally invalid guilty plea is not used as aggravant in a death penalty case, it is in the interests of justice that court hear evidence on whether the plea was voluntarily and knowingly made, and defendant bears burden of establishing the constitutional invalidity of prior plea. 48 CS 279.",

Subsec. does not create nonwaivable right to mandatory sentence review by Connecticut Supreme Court of any and all claims that death sentence was “the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor”, regardless of the time and manner in which claim was raised; court is not required to impose moratorium on execution of death sentences whenever an unproven claim of systemic arbitrariness in administration of death penalty scheme is raised. Id., 676. Defendant's claim that his death sentence was imposed arbitrarily and capriciously because there are no uniform standards guiding prosecutors' decisions to seek the death penalty is contradicted by overwhelming authority and is rejected. 303 C. 71. Jury could reasonably have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the sole aggravating factor outweighed the numerous mitigating factors and therefore the jury's sentencing verdict was not unreasonable and the sentence was not the product of passion, prejudice or other arbitrary factor. 305 C. 101, but see 318 C. 1.",

(2) criminalizes certain conduct that would not violate attendant circumstances provision in Subdiv. (1), and both provisions ensure elimination of the impossibility defense. 317 C. 292. Determination of what conduct constitutes a substantial step focuses on what the actor has already done rather than what the actor has left to do to complete the substantive crime. 331 C. 1.\n\nCited. 5 CA 586; 6 CA 164; Id., 476; 7 CA 149; Id., 257; 10 CA 217; Id., 462; 11 CA 80; 12 CA 221; 13 CA 12; Id., 237; 14 CA 309; judgment reversed, see 212 C. 50; 15 CA 222; Id., 416; 23 CA 663; Id., 692; 24 CA 27; judgment reversed, see 220 C. 652; Id., 264; 26 CA 52; Id., 65; Id., 114; Id., 242; Id., 367; Id., 433; Id., 779; 28 CA 290; Id., 306; Id., 402; Id., 548; 29 CA 39; Id., 262; 30 CA 9; Id., 68; Id., 470; Id., 606; 31 CA 120; Id., 385; 33 CA 368; Id., 647; Id., 743; judgment reversed, see 233 C. 502; 35 CA 279; Id., 699; 36 CA 41; Id., 718; 38 CA 536; 39 CA 224; Id., 242; 40 CA 387; Id., 624; 41 CA 47; Id., 287; 42 CA 264; 43 CA 488; Id., 578; Id., 619; Id., 680; Id., 785; 44 CA 499; 45 CA 658; Id., 756. Proof of prior plan or premeditation not necessary to establish criminal liability for attempted murder. 47 CA 401. Subdiv. (2) cited re testimony of sole witness sufficient to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and re showing that victim had custody or control over appropriated property is sufficient to support a charge of larceny. 49 CA 486. Subdiv. (2): Defendant took substantial step in hiring an agent to commit an arson even though agent was not actually paid; to constitute a substantial step, consummation of the deed is not required. 59 CA 362. Statutory provisions codified common law distinction between the acts of solicitation and attempt and an attempt not a solicitation under Sec. 53a-179a. 65 CA 145. On basis of the evidence, jury could reasonably conclude that defendant intended to force victim to have sexual intercourse with him and intended to compel sexual intercourse by use of force or the threat of use of force. 75 CA 447. To be guilty of crime of attempt to commit assault in the first degree, defendant must be shown to have had the mental state required to commit assault in the first degree and fact that the wounds actually inflicted by defendant were relatively minor does not mean that there was insufficient evidence to find that he intended to inflict serious injury. 78 CA 646. Evidence which established that defendant arranged for sale of heroin to undercover police officer then left his residence and traveled in the direction of designated meeting place for the sale was sufficient to find defendant guilty of attempt to commit a crime, in particular, the sale of narcotics by a person who is not drug dependent in violation of Sec. 21a-278(b). 82 CA 111. Intent required for crime of attempted assault of a peace officer is the intent to prevent the officer from performing duties, regardless of whether injury is intended. 96 CA 634. Subdiv. (2): Conviction as accessory to attempted robbery in the first degree does not require state to demonstrate that accused intended for accomplice to possess a deadly weapon. “Circumstances as he believes them to be” language does not establish additional specific intent element necessitating proof that defendant believed one of his accomplices was armed with deadly weapon during attempted robbery. 184 CA 24.

The “born alive” rule, which prescribes that only one who has been born alive can be the victim of a homicide, was the common law of this state when Penal Code was adopted and has not been abrogated by the legislature, and therefore trial court properly determined that an infant who is born alive and who subsequently dies of injuries sustained in utero is a “person” within meaning of homicide statutes; nothing in section requires a temporal nexus between the victim's status as a person and the conduct that brings about the person's death; transferred intent provisions are equally applicable to a fetus born alive as they are to any other person. 296 C. 622.\n\nCited. 7 CA 367; Id., 457; 8 CA 496; Id., 147; judgment reversed, see 206 C. 278; Id., 169; judgment reversed, see 205 C. 370; 10 CA 697; 11 CA 80; Id., 628; 20 CA 27; 21 CA 801; 22 CA 199; Id., 507; Id., 521; 23 CA 692; 24 CA 624; 26 CA 242; 27 CA 73; Id., 403; Id., 643; 28 CA 231; Id., 469; 29 CA 573; 30 CA 406; judgment reversed, see 228 C. 335; 31 CA 385; 32 CA 438; Id., 687; Id., 759; 33 CA 122; Id., 782; 34 CA 58; judgment reversed, see 232 C. 537; Id., 96; judgment reversed, see 232 C. 537; Id., 368, see also 233 C. 517; 35 CA 138; Id., 374; judgment reversed, see 235 C. 413; Id., 541; 36 CA 336; Id., 417; Id., 805; Id., 831; 37 CA 252; judgment reversed, see 236 C. 388; Id., 404; Id., 574; 40 CA 47; Id., 60; Id., 374; Id., 470; 41 CA 361; Id., 495; Id., 515; 43 CA 252; Id., 830; 44 CA 198; Id., 338; 45 CA 297; 46 CA 600.

Trial court's instruction re extreme emotional disturbance defense was proper. 55 CA 469. Cited. 57 CA 734. Subsec. permits conviction of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm under Sec. 53a-55a regardless of extreme emotional disturbance defense. 86 CA 784. One who uses deadly weapon upon a vital part of another will be deemed to have intended the probable result of that act, and from such circumstance a proper inference may be drawn in some cases that there was an intent to kill. 95 CA 263. Murder is a specific intent crime and although court's instruction improperly referred to general intent to engage in proscribed conduct, the erroneous instruction was not harmful beyond a reasonable doubt and defendant was not deprived of fair trial because court also properly instructed jury that it had to find defendant intended to cause victim's death. 99 CA 230. A homicide influenced by an extreme emotional disturbance is not one which is necessarily committed in hot blood stage, but rather one that was brought about by a significant mental trauma that caused defendant to brood for long period of time and then react violently, seemingly without provocation. 104 CA 780.\n\nSubsec. must be read without the word “affirmative”; the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements of the offense charged without imposing any burden on defendant. 33 CS 28.

Proper construction to be given to term “in the course of a single transaction” is that there need only be some nexus between murders, that the murders be connected by a common purpose or plan in order to be “in the course of a single transaction”; does not require murders to be at the same time in order to constitute “in the course of a single transaction”; temporal relationship between murders is not an absolute prerequisite to prosecution under Subdiv. 254 C. 578. Read together, Sec. 53a-54(a) and this Subdiv. provide that conviction of intentional murder under doctrine of transferred intent may be the predicate for conviction of capital felony under this Subdiv. when victim is under 16, regardless of defendant's subjective state of mind; knowledge of the victim's age is not an element of Subdiv.; to limit applicability of Subdiv. to cases in which state can prove that defendant knew or reasonably should have known the age of his victim would be both impracticable and inconsistent with the legislative intent. 265 C. 35. Legislature had rational basis for classifying intentional murder of a person under the age of 16 as a capital felony. 272 C. 106.\n\nCited. 38 CA 581.",

Motion to dismiss on grounds that Subdiv. (3) is unconstitutionally vague because legislature failed to define phrases “extreme indifference to human life” and “grave risk of death” and defendant was not given “fair warning” and statute is susceptible to “arbitrary enforcement” fails to meet burden of proof because person of ordinary intelligence would have had fair warning that defendant's actions were proscribed and was properly denied by trial court; based on established principles concerning how evidence is construed, and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, evidence was sufficient to support trial court's verdict of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm. 257 C. 544.

Evidence presented at trial concerning a healthy 1-year-old left in defendant's care was sufficient to support conviction. 47 CA 188. Subdiv. (1): Criminal liability as an accessory to manslaughter in the first degree has long been recognized under this state's jurisprudence. 49 CA 121. To be guilty under Subsec., it must be established that defendant must have had the general intent to engage in the proscribed conduct. 56 CA 742. Subdiv. (3): Action of defendant in entering house, after car chase, obtaining loaded shotgun, walking 100 feet to edge of driveway and shooting victim showed an extreme indifference to human life. 61 CA 463. Evidence insufficient to find that defendant demonstrated an extreme indifference to human life to support conviction of manslaughter in the first degree when defendant himself ingested fentanyl lollipops, there was no evidence that he or anyone to whom he had given the lollipops had an adverse reaction to them, risks associated with ingestion of methadose and fentanyl not commonly known by laypeople, and defendant immediately called 9-1-1 upon hearing the victim was unresponsive. 106 CA 467. Subdiv. (3): Conviction under Subdiv. and Sec. 53a-59(a)(3) constituted double jeopardy violation because there was no conceivable circumstance in which defendant could have caused victim's death without also having caused victim “serious physical injury” as defined in Sec. 53a-3(4). 187 CA 725. The mens rea elements in the two provisions, namely, the “intent to cause serious physical injury” in Subdiv. (1) and “recklessly engaging in conduct which creates a grave risk of death” in Subdiv. (3), do not relate to the same result; the mental state elements in the two provisions - failing to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that your manner of operation would cause death under Sec. 53a-57(a) and an intent to cause serious physical injury under Subdiv. (1) - do not relate to the same result; the mental state element under Subdiv. (3) and under Sec. 53a-57(a) is mutually exclusive and relate to the same result, thus guilty verdicts as to the crimes of reckless manslaughter and criminally negligent operation were legally inconsistent. 191 CA 33; judgment reversed in part, see 342 C. 538. Subdiv. (1): As charged, defendant's rights to be free from double jeopardy violated as the offenses of manslaughter in the first degree under Subdiv. and risk of injury to a child under Sec. 53-21 arose from the same actions and constituted the same offense, and the offense of risk of injury to a child is a lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree. 197 CA 302; judgment reversed, see 340 C. 425.\n\nCited. 44 CS 417.",

Assault statute provides for intent to be transferred and does not require that defendant be aware of the presence of unintended victim. 84 CA 263. In challenge of evidence as being insufficient to prove element that appellant was “aided by two or more other persons actually present”, where appellant and another defendant assaulted the driver of a jeep while a third defendant assaulted the passenger of a jeep and a fourth defendant kept lookout, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that the lookout aided in the assault by following the jeep, blocking the jeep from exiting an alleyway and acting as a lookout, and it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that appellant and other two defendants had aided each other by attacking from both sides of the jeep so that neither victim could assist the other or run for help. 111 CA 184. Re accessory liability under section, defendant only needs to have the intent to cause serious physical injury, not the intent to do so with a dangerous instrument; jury could have reasonably inferred that defendant intended to aid another to inflict serious physical injury on victim and that principal used a dangerous instrument. 136 CA 568; judgment reversed on eyewitness identification, see 314 C. 131.

(3): Criminal conduct can arise by an omission to act when there is a legal duty to do so and defendant who had established a familial relationship with victim's mother and her children, had assumed responsibility for the welfare of the children and had taken care of the children as though he were their father, had a legal duty to protect victim from abuse and breach of that duty exposed defendant to criminal liability. 245 C. 209. Cited. 247 C. 662. Defendant was not without fair warning and his due process rights were not denied by court's holding construing a common law duty to act under section; evidence that child abuse victim had sustained obvious injuries was sufficient to support defendant's conviction based on his failure to act; re double jeopardy claim, defendant failed to meet his burden of proving that his conviction with regard to different injuries arose out of the same act; this section and Sec. 53-21 do not stand in relationship to each other as greater and lesser included offenses and are not the same offense for double jeopardy purposes. 260 C. 93. Defendant who was not perpetrator of physical assaults on child and who was neither a parent nor a legal guardian could not be criminally liable for assault in the first degree in violation of Subdiv. (3); accordingly, defendant's conviction of two counts of that crime were reversed and case remanded for resentencing on remaining charge of risk of injury to a child. 274 C. 727. Sec. 53a-61(a)(2) is lesser included offense of Subdiv. (3), and court's refusal to grant related jury instruction constituted harmful error. 289 C. 742. Subdiv. (1): A fist or other body part is not a dangerous instrument. 307 C. 115. Convictions under Subdivs. (1) and (3) are not legally inconsistent because a person may intend to seriously injure a person within the meaning of Subdiv. (1) while simultaneously recklessly creating a risk of that person's death within the meaning of Subdiv. (3). 316 C. 651. Subsection's use of “serious disfigurement” evidences intent to require consideration of factors such as permanence, location, size, general appearance and visibility to others; serious disfigurement does not have to be permanent or in a location that is visible to others. 332 C. 472. Evidence insufficient to find serious disfigurement where regardless if evaluated at the time of injury or of trial, victim had two lacerations on her forearm caused by a knife that left a permanent scar of one and one-half inches which is unremarkable in appearance and does not substantially detract from her appearance. Id. Where court reversed conviction of assault in the first degree for insufficient evidence, court declined to modify the judgment to reflect the highest lesser included offense that requires only physical injury, assault in the second degree, and remanded case for acquittal and vacating of sentence for said charge. Id. Because Subdiv. (1) does not indicate unit of prosecution intended by legislature, and absent clear legislative intent to impose multiple punishments for violations of same criminal statute arising out of single transaction or occurrence, unit of prosecution must be resolved in favor of rule of lenity to resolve any doubt against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses. 336 C. 219. Subdiv. (1): It is possible to commit the crime of home invasion without committing the crime of attempt to commit assault in the first degree, therefore home invasion in violation of Sec. 53a-100aa(a)(2) and attempt to commit assault in the first degree in violation of Subdiv. and Sec. 53a-49 are not the same offense for purposes of double jeopardy. 343 C. 470.\n\nCited. 1 CA 609; 3 CA 166; 5 CA 40; 6 CA 124; Id., 469; Id., 476; 7 CA 309; 8 CA 119; Id., 176; 9 CA 79; Id., 169; judgment reversed, see 205 C. 370; Id., 330; 10 CA 103; Id., 176; Id., 302; Id., 462; Id., 643; 11 CA 499; 12 CA 217; Id., 655; 13 CA 12; Id., 120; Id., 237; Id., 687; Id., 824; 14 CA 1; Id., 140; Id., 493; Id., 511; 15 CA 34; Id., 416; Id., 531; Id., 704; 16 CA 184; Id., 206; Id., 346; Id., 390; 17 CA 391; 18 CA 477; 19 CA 174; Id., 618; 20 CA 27; 21 CA 688; 22 CA 199; Id., 340; Id., 610; 23 CA 28; Id., 315; Id., 663; Id., 692; 24 CA 152; Id., 264; Id., 316; Id., 556; Id., 563; Id., 624; 25 CA 243; Id., 275; Id., 433; Id., 578; Id., 619; 26 CA 52; Id., 114; Id., 145; Id., 331; Id., 367; Id., 433; Id., 641; 27 CA 73; Id., 322; Id., 654; 28 CA 34; Id., 290; Id., 402; Id., 548; Id., 825; Id., 833; judgment reversed, see 227 C. 518; 29 CA 59; Id., 262; Id., 704; Id., 744; 30 CA 9; Id., 26; Id., 68; Id., 232; Id., 359; Id., 406; judgment reversed, see 228 C. 335; Id., 606; 31 CA 58; 32 CA 553; 33 CA 60; Id., 122; Id., 743; judgment reversed, see 233 C. 502; 34 CA 223; Id., 261; Id., 610; Id., 691; Id., 807; 35 CA 51; Id., 138; Id., 279; Id., 699; Id., 740; 36 CA 41; Id., 473; Id., 483; Id., 506; Id., 576; Id., 695; Id., 805; Id., 831; 37 CA 21; Id., 464; Id., 749; 39 CA 18; judgment reversed, see 237 C. 748; Id., 563; 40 CA 60; Id., 387; Id., 483; Id., 515; Id., 624; 41 CA 515; Id., 565; Id., 831; 42 CA 307; Id., 371; 43 CA 205; Id., 488; Id., 578; 44 CA 26; Id., 231; Id., 476; Id., 499; 45 CA 270; Id., 591; 46 CA 684; Id., 734. Offenses described in Subdivs. (1) and (4) are two separate offenses for purposes of double jeopardy. 53 CA 581. To secure conviction for assault in the first degree under Subdiv. (1), state must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intended to cause serious physical injury to another person, did, in fact, cause serious physical injury to that person and caused that injury by means of a dangerous instrument. 70 CA 232. There was sufficient evidence from which jury reasonably could have found victim had suffered serious and permanent disfigurement and that defendant intended to cause such serious and permanent disfigurement where defendant butted victim's face with his head, bit her face, struck her on the head with a hairdryer, kicked her and attempted to choke her, resulting in scars to victim's face. 74 CA 633. Defendant's actions in shaking infant with such violence as to cause injuries consistent with “shaken baby syndrome” was a gross deviation from the standard of conduct a reasonable person would observe and evinced extreme indifference to human life. Id., 736. Subdiv. (2): Fact that the wounds actually inflicted by defendant were relatively minor does not mean that there was insufficient evidence to find that he intended to inflict serious injury. 78 CA 646. Subdiv. (1): Evidence that defendant arrived at crime scene and fired several shots at bedroom where he believed wife was staying was sufficient for jury to conclude that defendant committed attempt to commit assault in the first degree which requires proof of intentional conduct constituting a substantial step toward intentionally causing victim serious physical injury by means of a dangerous instrument or deadly weapon. 99 CA 203. Subdiv. (5): Court's instructions to jury improperly included additional element of intent to use firearm but did not prejudice defendant because inclusion of the additional element was to the state's, and not to defendant's, detriment. 107 CA 517. The jury reasonably could have concluded that scars constituted serious physical injury because they negatively affected the appearance of skin on face and abdomen. 118 CA 831. Mandatory nonsuspendable 5 year minimum term of imprisonment for violation of Subdiv. (1) does not violate constitutional due process or equal protection rights. 130 CA 632. Scarring does not have to be on a victim's face, it can be on far less observable parts of the body to support a finding of serious disfigurement; victim suffered serious disfigurement when scar was permanent, easily seen two and one-half years after the injury, and was located on the lower part of arm. 172 CA 668; judgment reversed in part, see 332 C. 472. Subdiv. (3): Conviction under Subdiv. and Sec. 53a-55(a)(3) constituted double jeopardy violation because there was no conceivable circumstance in which defendant could have caused victim's death without also having caused victim “serious physical injury” as defined in Sec. 53a-3(4). 187 CA 725. Attempted murder under Sec. 53a-49(a) and assault in the first degree under this section are not the same offense of for purposes of double jeopardy. 204 CA 207.",

(3): Statements made that “more of what happened to your son is going to happen to you” and “I'm going to be there to watch it happen”, when spoken to one whose son had suffered serious physical injuries, did not constitute a true threat due to subsequent apology and lack of other animosity between the parties; to ensure that only serious expressions of an intention to commit an act of unlawful violence are punished, as the first amendment requires, state must do more than demonstrate that a statement could be interpreted as a threat. 313 C. 434. Imminence is only one factor for a court to consider in determining whether a statement constitutes a true threat under section, and not a requirement. 327 C. 1. Subsec. is divisible, with offenses requiring proof of an intentional mental state under Subdivs. (1) and (2) and recklessness under Subdiv. (3); threatening offense committed with reckless disregard under Subdiv. (3) does not constitute a crime of moral turpitude under Second Circuit case law and for purposes of immigration consequences. 328 C. 198.\n\nSubdiv.

Subdiv. (2) was not unconstitutionally vague on its face; statute's application to defendant's conduct was proper and did not interfere with his duty to protect his child and statute was not vague as applied to facts of case; there is no indication that legislature did not intend to create separate crimes prohibited by Secs. 53a-181 (a)(3) and Subdiv. (2). 81 CA 248. Convictions for threatening in second degree in violation of Subdivs. (1) and (2) did not violate right against double jeopardy because each conviction arose from a different violation. 154 CA 45.

(2): Defendant's statements to State Marshal who had come onto his property to serve court documents on the Defendant, which included statement, “[i]f you come back, I guarantee you, you won't walk away”, were true threats. 226 CA 234.",

Intent or motive of sexual assault perpetrators discussed. 47 CA 159. Age of victim not an element of crime for which jury makes a factual determination but a sentencing factor determined by the courts. 74 CA 376. On basis of the evidence, jury could reasonably conclude that defendant intended to force victim to have sexual intercourse with him and intended to compel sexual intercourse by use of force or the threat of use of force. 75 CA 447. Because the necessary elements of this section and Sec. 53-21 are distinct, court's respective findings of not guilty and guilty of these distinct crimes was not legally inconsistent. 78 CA 25. Trial court's finding that the state had proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that defendant had committed sexual assault in the first degree and thereby violated his probation was not clearly erroneous and was supported by the evidence. 108 CA 250. Sexual assault in the fourth degree is not a lesser included offense of sexual assault in the first degree; convictions under this section and Sec. 53a-73a do not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy because they are separate and distinct crimes and each crime requires proof of an element that the other does not. 171 CA 530.\n\nCited. 41 CS 229; 43 CS 46.\n\nSubsec.

Conviction of both sexual assault and unlawful restraint is not double jeopardy. 47 CA 117. Trial court did not abuse its discretion in commenting on testimony of state's expert witness concerning inconsistencies in results of victim's rape kit tests, that court having also instructed jury to base findings on recollection of all evidence presented; defendant's challenge to other aspects of instructions on scientific evidence were not properly preserved for appellate review; trial court properly admitted victim's written statement to police as constancy of accusation evidence; defendant failed to establish that court abused its discretion or that he was prejudiced by admission of that evidence, and his claim that victim's statement is admissible only if tape recorded was incorrect. 48 CA 135. Subdiv. (1): Trier of fact reasonably could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant compelled victim to engage in sexual intercourse by use of force. 52 CA 466. Subdiv. (1): Defendant could not succeed in argument that the evidence did not support a guilty verdict under section; jury could reasonably have concluded that the facts and inferences established guilt beyond reasonable doubt. 55 CA 412. Evidence was sufficient for jury to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 57 CA 736. Statute is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to facts of the case. 58 CA 585. Evidence was sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 75 CA 201. Subdiv. (1): Sexual assault in the second degree was not a lesser offense included within sexual assault in the first degree because it would be possible to commit the latter offense in the manner described in the information and bill of particulars without committing the former offense. 99 CA 251. Subdiv. (2) and Sec. 53-21(a)(2) are not the same offenses for double jeopardy purposes. 118 CA 180. Under Subdiv. (4), state need not show that any specific or identifiable drug or intoxicating substance had been administered to the victim without her consent, only that the victim was under the influence of some drug or intoxicating substance; criminal liability under Subdiv. (4) does not require a showing that the criminal actor administered the drug or intoxicating substance at issue or that the criminal actor knew, or had reason to know, that the victim was mentally incapacitated. 136 CA 731. Subdiv. (2): The age difference of more than 2 years between the complainant and the perpetrator of the sexual assault is an essential element; where the victim of the assault was 12 years old at the time of the assault and the state provided evidence that defendant was married and the father of a 3 year old child at the time and the jury had the opportunity to view defendant, the state presented sufficient evidence of defendant's age. 160 CA 61.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\nCited. 207 C. 412, 416. Issue of whether victims were less than 10 years of age was a question for jury to decide during guilt phase of trial except in this case, where court decided issue of age in sentencing process, error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 271 C. 499. Under 2001 revision, as amended by P.A. 02-138, S. 5, Subdiv. (3) does not mandate that persons convicted of first degree sexual assault be sentenced to a period of imprisonment and special parole; it provides, rather, that if the court elects to impose such a sentence, the total combined period of imprisonment and special parole must total at least 10 years. 320 C. 239. Under 2005 revision, Subdiv. (3) requires only that any period of special parole that may be imposed shall, along with the accompanying term of imprisonment, constitute a total sentence of not less than 10 years.

(a)(1) not void for vagueness as applied to defendant in this case despite lack of judicial gloss on meaning of “years” and does not violate defendant's right to equal protection. 47 CA 68. Evidence was sufficient for jury to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 57 CA 736. Pursuant to Sec. 53-21(2), risk of injury to or impairing the morals of a child involves sexual contact with a child younger than the age of 16 years “in a sexual and indecent manner likely to impair the health or morals of such child”; this section contains no such similar provision; risk of injury to a child, therefore, contains elements lacking in sexual assault in the second degree. 79 CA 591.\n\nSubsec.

Court determined defendant was more than 2 years older than victim by calculating the difference in age based on birthdates rather than calendar years; statute not unconstitutionally vague and does not violate defendant's right to equal protection under the law. 248 C. 543. Statute does not require physical violence as element of the crime. 260 C. 486. Prescribes a general liability crime and defendant cannot prevail on claim that attempt charge under section is invalid based on strict liability of crime; evidence of adult male's electronic mail exchanges with undercover officer posing as 13-year-old girl, defendant's arrival at prearranged meeting place and possession of related pornographic materials was sufficient to prove required intent and knowledge to support conviction under section and section is not unconstitutionally void for vagueness based on these facts. 277 C. 155.\n\nCited. 7 CA 46; 8 CA 190; Id., 313; 9 CA 426; 10 CA 591; 11 CA 236; 13 CA 493; 14 CA 244; 15 CA 222; 17 CA 174; Id., 186; Id., 447; Id., 525; 18 CA 273; 19 CA 44; Id., 445; Id., 646; 20 CA 40; Id., 115; Id., 193; Id., 263; Id., 288, 289; Id., 530, 532; Id., 737; 23 CA 241; Id., 712; 24 CA 146; 25 CA 235; Id., 243; 26 CA 625; judgment reversed, see 224 C. 656; Id., 674; Id., 758; 28 CA 91; 31 CA 120; 32 CA 217; judgment reversed, see 229 C. 580; Id., 773; 33 CA 205; 34 CA 46; 37 CA 213; 38 CA 125; Id., 731; 39 CA 742; 40 CA 132; 41 CA 139; 43 CA 142; Id., 619; Id., 667; Id., 785; 45 CA 289; Id., 512. Trial court properly refused to instruct jury as requested by defendant on the issue of fraudulent misrepresentation; no affirmative defense of fraudulent misrepresentation is available under provision of statute prohibiting sexual intercourse between a person who is between the ages of 13 and 15 and a person who is at least 2 years older. 63 CA 536. Subdiv. (1): Sexual assault in the second degree was not a lesser offense included within sexual assault in the first degree because it would be possible to commit the latter offense in the manner described in the information and bill of particulars without committing the former offense. 99 CA 251. Subdiv. (1): Decriminalization of an act under Subdiv. in P.A. 07-143 entitled person with prior conviction for committing such act to erasure and destruction of records under Sec. 54-142d. 142 CA 21. Subdiv. (1): Court could reasonably have found sufficient evidence to satisfy penetration element of sexual assault where both the child and defendant were wearing underwear. 148 CA 378. Subdiv. (1): Conviction under this Subdiv. and Sec. 53-21(a)(2) does not violate defendant's constitutional right against double jeopardy because each crime requires proof of a fact that the other does not. 174 CA 172. Subdiv. (3): Evidence sufficient to prove sexual assault in the second degree where victim was able to communicate during earlier stages of assault but could not physically or verbally communicate her lack of consent during later penile-vaginal intercourse. 180 CA 799. Subdiv. (1): The limited exception under Sec. 54-193a for a prosecution of sexual assault in the second degree under this Subdiv. cannot be expanded and applied to a risk of injury charge under Sec. 53-21(a)(2). 213 CA 757.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\nCited. 207 C. 412. Defendant's sentence of 10 years of imprisonment followed by 10 years of special parole violated Sec. 54-128(c) and was an illegal sentence because total length of terms of imprisonment and special parole combined exceeded maximum term of imprisonment authorized for sexual assault in the second degree by Subsec. and Sec. 53a-35a(6). 279 C. 527.",

Where defendant also charged with sexual assault, restriction of movement alone can be basis of kidnapping if defendant, by violent actions, restrained victim with intent to prevent liberation. 262 C. 179; judgment reversed, see 299 C. 740. Legislature intended to exclude from scope of the more serious crime of kidnapping and its accompanying severe penalties those confinements or movements of a victim that are merely incidental to and necessary for the commission of another crime against that victim. 287 C. 509. Subdiv. (2)(A): Since there was no evidence that defendant restrained victim to any greater degree than that necessary to commit the sexual assault, his conviction of kidnapping in the first degree cannot stand. Id., 608. Holding in 287 C. 509 that to commit a kidnapping, defendant must intend to prevent the victim's liberation for a longer period of time or to a greater degree than that which is necessary to commit the other crime, applies retroactively to petitioner's habeas corpus proceeding in which he challenges his kidnapping conviction. 299 C. 740. Where defendant was also charged with robbery and there was no evidence that victim was bound or moved physically, and victim was restrained for five minutes and released immediately after robbery was complete, the restraint alone cannot support kidnapping charge. 301 C. 77.

Retroactive relief is available, as long as the evidence warrants such relief, for all collateral attacks on judgments rendered final prior to the holding in 287 C. 509, irrespective of whether the kidnapping instruction was challenged in the criminal proceeding, and such challenges are not subject to the procedural default rule; omission of a Salamon instruction not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 321 C. 56.

Holding witnesses at gunpoint prior to firing fatal shot into a murder victim was kidnapping with intent to advance or accomplish the murder. 47 CA 134. Unlawful restraint as a lesser included offense, discussed. Id., 159. Evidence was insufficient to sustain defendant's conviction under section. 55 CA 447. Subdiv. (2): Under kidnapping statute, the state had to prove that defendant had abducted and restrained alleged victim with the intent to inflict physical injury or to sexually attack her. 81 CA 320. Kidnapping in the first degree statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to facts of defendant's case. 91 CA 47. Abduction requirement under kidnapping statute was satisfied by testimony showing that defendant, in an effort to prevent victim from leaving his apartment, took her by the leg and placed his arm around her neck in a headlock and thereby restricted her movement with the intent to prevent her liberation. 96 CA 155. Kidnapping conviction reversed and matter remanded so jury could be instructed re holdings in 287 C. 509 and 288 C. 418 that it could not find defendant guilty of kidnapping unless he intended to prevent the victim's liberation for a longer period of time or to a greater degree than that necessary to commit the underlying crime. 115 CA 166. Subdiv. (2)(A): When assessing whether a kidnapping charge is merely incidental to and necessary for another crime, trial court must make a specific factual finding whether defendant intended to restrain the victim to a greater degree than what was necessary to commit the other crime; where defendant is charged with kidnapping pursuant to Subdiv. (2)(A), and no evidence is presented at trial re defendant's intention to inflict physical injury subsequent to related sexual assault, court's analysis of the kidnapping charge is limited to defendant's conduct up to the completion of the sexual assault. 118 CA 140. Subdiv. (2)(A) is a lesser offense included within the kidnapping charge of Subdiv. (2)(B) and thus conviction of both offenses for the same act constituted double jeopardy. Id., 831. Subdiv. (2): 287 C. 509 does not control burglary and larceny case because restraint of victim was not necessary to accomplish those crimes and restraint occurred after defendant took jewelry. 127 CA 181. Subdivs. (2)(A) and (2)(B) are separate offenses for double jeopardy purposes. 180 CA 371; judgment reversed on alternate grounds, see 338 C. 54. Subdiv. (2)(B): In order to prevail on habeas claim that the absence of a Salamon instruction did not constitute harmless error, petitioner is not required to establish that there was insufficient evidence to convict him or that a properly instructed jury likely would find him guilty; commissioner bears burden of demonstrating that the omission of a Salamon instruction on incidental restraint did not contribute to the verdict; test to be applied by appellate court is whether there is a reasonable possibility that a properly instructed jury would reach a different result. 184 CA 101; judgment reversed, see 339 C. 1.\n\nCited. 43 CS 46.",

The court's repeated pronouncements that there are no minimum time or distance requirements to establish restraint within the meaning of Subsec., coupled with Subsec.'s prohibition of the act of restraint only when it is accomplished with the specific intent of preventing a victim's liberation, defeats defendant's claim that Subsec. is unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's actions. 294 C. 753.

      "text": "(a) The following definitions are applicable to this part: (1) “Building” in addition to its ordinary meaning, includes any watercraft, aircraft, trailer, sleeping car, railroad car or other structure or vehicle or any building with a valid certificate of occupancy. Where a building consists of separate units, such as, but not limited to separate apartments, offices or rented rooms, any unit not occupied by the actor is, in addition to being a part of such building, a separate building; (2) “dwelling” means a building which is usually occupied by a person lodging therein at night, whether or not a person is actually present; (3) “night” means the period between thirty minutes after sunset and thirty minutes before sunrise; and (4) “public land” means a state park, state forest or municipal park or any other publicly-owned land that is open to the public for active or passive recreation.\n\n(b) The following definition is applicable to sections 53a-100aa to 53a-106, inclusive: A person “enters or remains unlawfully” in or upon premises when the premises, at the time of such entry or remaining, are not open to the public and when the actor is not otherwise licensed or privileged to do so.\n\n(1969, P.A. 828, S. 102; P.A. 74-186, S. 10, 12; P.A. 79-570, S. 7; P.A. 92-260, S. 40; P.A. 05-234, S. 8; Jan.

P.A. 08-1, S. 4.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 74-186 included railroad cars in definition of “building”; P.A. 79-570 included buildings “with a valid certificate of occupancy” in definition of “building”; P.A. 92-260 made a technical change in definition of “building”; P.A. 05-234 added Subsec. (a)(4) defining “public land”, effective January 1, 2006; Jan. Sp. Sess. P.A. 08-1 amended Subsec. (a) to make definitions applicable to Sec. 53a-100aa, included in existing reference to “this part”, and amended Subsec. (b) to add reference to Sec. 53a-100aa, effective March 1, 2008.\n\nCited. 191 C. 180; 195 C. 598; Id., 611; 209 C. 322; 210 C. 199; 216 C. 367.\n\nFailure of court to define the phrase “enters unlawfully” misled jury. 6 CA 24.

Although it is true that the crime of burglary in the second degree requires the element of a “dwelling” as opposed to “building”, statute defines “dwelling” as a type of building “which is usually occupied by a person lodging therein at night, whether or not a person is actually present”; an individual apartment, within an apartment home, while a dwelling, also is a separate building. 76 CA 779. Subdiv. (1): Under the ordinary definition of a “building”, one's home is clearly a building. 78 CA 610. State does not need to furnish valid certificate of occupancy or prove specific ability to occupy if structure in question falls within ordinary meaning of building. 106 CA 295. Subdiv. (2): Evidence was sufficient to find that the breezeway constituted part of the family's “dwelling”. 125 CA 529. Subdiv. (1): Trial court properly determined that shed was a “building” for purposes of section. 151 CA 732. Subdiv. (1): Charges for home invasion, arising under Subsec., and burglary in the first degree, under Sec. 53a-101(a)(3), are susceptible to separation into parts, thus defendant's conviction of both offenses did not violate his constitutional protection against double jeopardy. 187 CA 847.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\nCited. 8 CA 528; 19 CA 179; 24 CA 563; 42 CA 507. Defendant's presence in an apartment that was not his own, his attempts to evade police and his flight were sufficient evidence from which jury could infer that he had entered apartment unlawfully. 66 CA 357. Restaurant was not open to the public at time defendant entered and management office was a separate area not open to public and defendant was not licensed or privileged to enter or remain in or upon premises. 74 CA 607.",

There was sufficient evidence for jury to conclude that defendants took steak knives to arm themselves during the burglary and thus committed burglary in the first degree. 52 CA 149. Jury was within its right to conclude that defendant, armed with dangerous instrument, entered apartment unlawfully with intent to commit a robbery, but once inside, did not do anything which constituted a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in a robbery or that he abandoned his attempt. 87 CA 251.\n\nSubsec.

Utility room in rear of gas station convenience store in which defendant sexually assaulted and murdered victim, being a separate room and structurally distinct from the convenience store that could be reached only through gas station's garage bay area and not open to the public, reasonably could have been found to be a separate “building” under statute. 252 C. 274. Trial court correctly permitted jury to consider charge of burglary in the third degree as lesser included offense of burglary in the first degree; state was not collaterally estopped from prosecuting defendant for burglary in the first degree. 275 C. 192.

Crimes of burglary in the first degree in violation of Subdiv. (1) and burglary in the first degree in violation of Subdiv. (2) each contain an element the other does not; to convict defendant under Subdiv. (1), state had to prove that defendant entered or remained unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein and that he was armed with a dangerous instrument; to convict defendant under Subdiv. (2), state had to prove that defendant entered or remained unlawfully in a building with the intent to commit a crime therein and that in the course of committing the crime, he intentionally, knowingly or recklessly inflicted bodily injury on another person; Subsec. does not require state to prove that defendant forcibly entered the building or that defendant was in possession of stolen property. 96 CA 421. Trial court reasonably concluded that defendant injured the victim while in immediate flight from the commission of a burglary even though evidence demonstrated that defendant struck the victim beyond the property line of the residence where the burglary occurred. 132 CA 718. Subdiv. (3): Charges for burglary in the first degree, arising under Subdiv., and home invasion, under Sec. 53a-100aa(a)(1), are susceptible to separation into parts, thus defendant's conviction of both offenses did not violate his constitutional protection against double jeopardy. 187 CA 847.",

Commodities of a public utility nature such as gas, electricity, steam and water constitute property, but the supplying of such a commodity to premises from an outside source by means of wires, pipes, conduits or other equipment shall be deemed a rendition of a service rather than a sale or delivery of property. (2) “Obtain” includes, but is not limited to, the bringing about of a transfer or purported transfer of property or of a legal interest therein, whether to the obtainer or another. (3) To “deprive” another of property means (A) to withhold it or cause it to be withheld from him permanently or for so extended a period or under such circumstances that the major portion of its economic value or benefit is lost to him, or (B) to dispose of the property in such manner or under such circumstances as to render it unlikely that an owner will recover such property. (4) To “appropriate” property of another to oneself or a third person means (A) to exercise control over it, or to aid a third person to exercise control over it, permanently or for so extended a period or under such circumstances as to acquire the major portion of its economic value or benefit, or (B) to dispose of the property for the benefit of oneself or a third person. (5) An “owner” means any person who has a right to possession superior to that of a taker, obtainer or withholder. (6) To “receive” means to acquire possession, control or title, or to lend on the security of the property. (7) “Service” includes, but is not limited to, labor, professional service, public utility and transportation service, the supplying of hotel accommodations, restaurant services, entertainment, and the supplying of equipment for use, but does not include school accommodations provided by a school district to (A) a child or an emancipated minor, or (B) a pupil eighteen years of age or older who was a homeless person, as defined in subdivision (3) of section 8-355, at the time of the offense. (8) “Check” means any check, draft or similar sight order for the payment of money which is not postdated with respect to the time of issuance. (9) “Drawer” of a check means a person whose name appears thereon as the primary obligor, whether the actual signature be that of himself or of a person purportedly authorized to draw the check in his behalf. (10) “Representative drawer” means a person who signs a check as drawer in a representative capacity or as agent of the person whose name appears thereon as the principal drawer or obligor. (11) A person “issues” a check when, as a drawer or representative drawer thereof, he delivers it or causes it to be delivered to a person who thereby acquires a right against the drawer with respect to such check. One who draws a check with intent that it be so delivered is deemed to have issued it if the delivery occurs. (12) A person “passes” a check when, being a payee, holder or bearer of a check which previously has been or purports to have been drawn and issued by another, he delivers it, for a purpose other than collection, to a third person who thereby acquires a right with respect thereto. (13) “Funds” means money or credit. (14) A drawer has “insufficient funds” with a drawee to cover a check when he has no funds or account whatever, or funds in an amount less than that of the check; and a check dishonored for “no account” shall also be deemed to have been dishonored for “insufficient funds”.

Employers did not commit extortion when they sought restitution of wages from employee who was found guilty of misappropriating the wages. 75 CA 319. The essential elements of larceny are (1) the wrongful taking or carrying away of the personal property of another, (2) the existence of a felonious intent in the taker to deprive the owner of the property permanently, and (3) the lack of consent of the owner; to prove the requisite specific intent, the state must show that defendant acted with the subjective desire or knowledge that his actions constituted stealing. 115 CA 295. Evidence insufficient to establish intent to commit larceny where there was no claim that defendant was not the legal owner of the money taken and evidence was presented that defendant was seeking return of defendant's specific property, albeit by force. 148 CA 684; judgment affirmed, see 317 C. 338.\n\nCited. 32 CS 650; Id., 653; 34 CS 612; 36 CS 570; 37 CS 678.

(3): Wrongfully taking property from the person of another constitutes a trespass of the person, and such a taking from the person constitutes larceny in the second degree. 95 CA 248. Larceny in second degree under section is not ordinarily lesser included offense of robbery for purposes of double jeopardy. 109 CA 74. Subdiv.

Subsec., as amended by P.A. 09-138 to increase the value of property taken for the commission of larceny in the second degree, does not apply retroactively to defendant's case; legislature stated that the provision was effective October 1, 2009, without any express language referring to retroactivity and the legislative history does not indicate a clear or unequivocal intent for it to apply retroactively. 136 CA 427; judgment affirmed, see 314 C. 570.

A showing that victim had custody or control over appropriated property is sufficient to support a charge of larceny; testimony of sole witness sufficient to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt. 49 CA 486. Subdiv. (3) requires that evidence show either actual use of a dangerous instrument or its threatened use, demonstrated by either an actual display or words combined with an overt display of the threatened instrument. 71 CA 585. Court's failure to instruct jury on the affirmative defense of inoperability of gun involved in the incident at issue, as provided for in text of statute relative to charge of robbery in the first degree, constituted plain error and violated defendant's constitutional right to fair trial. Id., 865. Subdiv. (3) requires use or threatened use of a dangerous instrument. 81 CA 367. Evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction under Subdiv. (4). 83 CA 489. Subdiv. (4): There is no statutory monetary value of stolen property included as element of robbery in the first degree. 86 CA 507. Trial court did not err in permitting state to file an amended information charging defendant with robbery in the second degree in violation of Sec. 53a-135(a)(2) after trial had commenced in matter where defendant had originally been charged with robbery in the first degree in violation of Subdivs. (2), (3) and (4); because amended information charged lesser included offenses included within offenses that were charged in the original information, no due process violation arose. 87 CA 750. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt; while every element must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find defendant guilty of the charged offense, each of the basic and inferred facts underlying the conclusion need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 93 CA 257. Subdiv. (4): Defendant's statement to victim that she “wouldn't get hurt” if she did what she was told to do, combined with victim's testimony that defendant was holding something under his jacket and pointing it in her direction, provided sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction of robbery in the first degree. Id., 650. Subdiv. (4): Defendant need only represent by his words or conduct that he possesses a firearm, and need not actually possess a firearm, to be convicted under Subdiv. 141 CA 814. Subdiv. (1): The act of punching victim in the jaw provided sufficient evidence to satisfy statutory requirement of intent to cause the victim serious injury. 154 CA 271. No constitutional violation against defendant's right not to be placed in double jeopardy exists for convictions under Subdivs. (1) and (3) because a charge under Subdiv. (1) is a separate and distinct offense from a charge under Subdiv. (3). 170 CA 254. Subdiv. (2): Conviction as accessory to attempted robbery in the first degree does not require state to demonstrate that accused intended for an accomplice to possess a deadly weapon. 184 CA 24. Section provides for both principal and accessorial liability, therefore a jury instruction regarding accessory liability with regard to robbery in the first degree is unnecessary. 192 CA 68. Subdiv. (4): The state's burden of proof is not to demonstrate that a reasonable person believed that a perpetrator possessed a handgun, but that the perpetrator represented that he had or would use a gun. 218 CA 31.",

Court's failure to instruct jury on the lesser included offense of robbery in the second degree in violation of statute where there was uncontroverted evidence from two state's witnesses that the gun was inoperable constituted plain error and violated defendant's constitutional right to fair trial. 71 CA 865. To prove defendant guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery in the second degree in violation of Subdiv. (2), state needs to prove defendant and co-conspirator specifically had an agreement to display a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument and that defendant had specific intent that such a weapon or instrument would be displayed. 138 CA 228; judgment affirmed, see 315 C. 451. Subsec. contains no language indicating the legislature's intent to bar multiple punishments for the perpetrators of single second degree robberies who, in committing such offenses, violate multiple subdivisions of section. 175 CA 566. Subdiv. (1)(B): A defendant need not have a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument, but need only represent by his words or conduct that he is so armed. 203 CA 219.",

Defendant's claim that statute is so vague and indefinite that it violates the due process clause of Art. I, Sec. 8 of the state constitution and the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution because it did not clearly define his conduct–telephoning victim despite police warnings not to contact her and instructing her to tell police that “nothing ever happened”–is without merit; language of statute plainly warns potential perpetrators that statute applies to any conduct that is intended to prompt witness to testify falsely or to refrain from testifying in an official proceeding that the perpetrator believes to be pending or imminent; legislature's unqualified use of word “induce” clearly informs persons of ordinary intelligence that any conduct, physical or verbal, can potentially give rise to criminal liability. 74 CA 473. Supreme Court made clear that liability under section hinges on mental state of the perpetrator in engaging in the conduct at issue, not on whether he must overcome by coercive means the will of a witness reluctant to do so; as interpreted in our case law, section provides fair warning of the conduct that it prohibits. 83 CA 672. Section can be violated even if witness may be independently willing to provide false testimony; person became a “witness” who may be summoned to testify in an official proceeding once defendant began discussing defendant's case with the person. 138 CA 420.

(a):\n\nSubsec. applies whenever defendant believes that an official proceeding will probably occur, even if the police are only at the investigation stage and regardless of whether an official proceeding is actually pending or about to be instituted; “about to be instituted” signifies probability rather than temporal proximity; section does not apply when defendant believes that only an investigation, but not an official proceeding, is likely to occur; the jury may consider defendant's attempt to prevent a potential witness from speaking with the police as evidence of his intent to induce the witness to engage in conduct prohibited by section. 312 C. 551.\n\nCited. 41 CA 584. The “pending or about to be instituted” element may be satisfied when facts support the inference that defendant reasonably could have contemplated that an official proceeding was likely to arise; it is enough under statute to satisfy required belief that an official proceeding is “about to be instituted” and is therefore imminent if defendant, knowing he has been implicated in a crime, threatens a likely witness to that crime to withhold evidence from the police; it is sufficient to qualify as tampering that defendant attempted to discourage the witness from speaking to the police, as opposed to testifying at trial, when there was evidence that defendant believed an official proceeding was imminent. 110 CA 608.",

For purposes of this section, “large scale emergency response” means an on-site response to any such reported incident by five or more first responders, and “first responder” means any peace officer or firefighter or any ambulance driver, emergency medical responder, emergency medical technician or paramedic, as those terms are defined in section 19a-175.\n\n(b) Falsely reporting an incident in the first degree is a (1) class D felony for a violation of subdivision (1), (2) or (3) of subsection (a) of this section, or (2) class C felony for a violation of subdivision (4) of subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(c) In addition to any sentence imposed pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, if (1) a person is convicted of an offense in violation of subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section that resulted in a large scale emergency response, (2) any agency or department of the state or political subdivision of the state requests financial restitution for costs associated with such emergency response, and (3) the court finds that the agency or department of the state or political subdivision of the state incurred costs associated with such emergency response as a result of such offense, the court shall order the offender to make financial restitution under terms that the court determines are appropriate.

If the court determines that the current financial resources of the offender or the offender's current ability to pay based on installments or other conditions are such that no appropriate terms of restitution can be determined, the court may forego setting such terms. The court shall articulate its findings on the record with respect to each of the factors set forth in subparagraphs (A) to (D), inclusive, of this subsection. Restitution ordered by the court pursuant to this subsection shall be based on easily ascertainable damages for actual expenses associated with such emergency response. Restitution ordered by the court pursuant to this subsection shall be imposed or directed by a written order of the court containing the amount of actual expenses associated with such emergency response, as ascertained by the court.

(a):\n\nCited. 198 C. 43; 214 C. 378; 227 C. 153; 233 C. 903. Subdiv. (1): Does not require proof of actual physical contact on part of defendant with a victim; when applied to speech, parameters of the violent, threatening or tumultuous behavior prohibited by section are consistent with “fighting words”; judgment of Appellate Court in 36 CA 625 reversed. 237 C. 613. Subdiv. (3): To avoid invalidation on grounds of overbreadth, judicial gloss adopted that when a police officer is the only person upon whose sensibilities the inflammatory language could have played, a conviction can be supported only for extremely offensive behavior supporting an inference that the actor wished to provoke the policeman to violence. 265 C. 145. Subdiv. (3): Statements made that “more of what happened to your son is going to happen to you” and “I'm going to be there to watch it happen”, when spoken to one whose son had suffered serious physical injuries, did not constitute a true threat due to subsequent apology and lack of other animosity between the parties; to ensure that only serious expressions of an intention to commit an act of unlawful violence are punished, as the first amendment requires, state must do more than demonstrate that a statement could be interpreted as a threat. 313 C. 434. Evidence sufficient to support finding that defendant intended to “inconvenience, [annoy] or alarm” victim by posting victim's diary entries on Facebook even though victim was not invited by defendant to view the posts. 321 C. 688.\n\nSubdiv. (5): This part of statute is confined to language which constitutes “fighting” words and defendant's repeated vile, racist and threatening epithets were of such a nature. 1 CA 669. Cited. Id., 709. Statute meets requirements of fair notice to defendant. 6 CA 407.

The distinction that may be drawn between the “fighting words” as contemplated under Subdiv. (1) and those under Subdiv. (5) can be found under the totality of the circumstances which gives rise to the words; Subdiv. (1) proscribes fighting words uttered in a violent, tumultuous or threatening manner, whereas Subdiv. (5) proscribes fighting words that tend to induce immediate violence by the person or persons to whom the words are uttered because of their raw effect; the core meaning of Subdiv. (5) remains intact–fighting words may arise in different contexts not confined to abusive or obscene language–and is not unconstitutionally vague. 78 CA 98. There is no indication that legislature did not intend to create separate crimes prohibited by this section and Sec. 53a-62(a)(2). 81 CA 248. Subdiv. (1): Defendant engaged in fighting or violent or tumultuous behavior with intent to cause annoyance, alarm and inconvenience by spitting on victim's face because spitting is an unsanitary act, likely to spread potentially deadly disease and is almost universally regarded as contemptuous, is calculated to incite others to act in retaliation and actual physical contact of defendant with victim is not required. 102 CA 551. Defendant's statement that “you better watch yourself” to staff after exiting day-care center did not meet “fighting words” or “true threat” exceptions to first amendment speech protections justifying revocation of probation for committing breach of the peace under section. 183 CA 354; judgment reversed, see 183 C. 354.

(3): Statute is not unconstitutionally overbroad; statute prohibits purposeful telephone harassment and does not involve first amendment concerns since it proscribes conduct and not the content of calls; section is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's conduct. 55 CA 475, but see 310 C. 337. Criminal violation of a protective order pursuant to Sec. 53a-110b and harassment in the second degree pursuant to Subdiv. (3) constitute separate offenses for double jeopardy purposes. 61 CA 118. Defendant who made 5 phone calls to victim was not placed in double jeopardy for multiple convictions of harassment under section because fact that victim listened to the messages consecutively did not transform defendant's separate offenses into one act or one offense and the phrase “a telephone call” coupled with the phrase “likely to cause annoyance” shows legislative intent to punish each call made with the requisite intent. 93 CA 582. A person's speech during a telephone call may be evidence of the person's intent in physically making the telephone call, but cannot be basis for conviction under section without implicating the person's freedom of speech rights; it is the physical act of placing the call and causing a ring at the receiving end that constitutes the actus reus under Subdiv. (3). 120 CA 330, but see 310 C. 337. Subdiv. (3): Legislature intended the standard of conduct for provision re “annoyance or alarm” to be that perceived as such by a reasonable person operating under contemporary community standards; section unconstitutionally applied to defendant's speech in violation of first amendment re defendant's telephone call to the office of his ex-wife's attorney because the evidence of the harassing manner of defendant's telephone call rested entirely on the content of the speech he conveyed. 128 CA 546. Subdiv. (2): Subdiv. does not unconstitutionally prohibit certain forms of speech protected by first amendment to U.S. Constitution. 155 CA 560. Subdiv. (2): Unconstitutional as applied because conviction was dependent upon content of e-mail, rather than the manner in which it was communicated, therefore violating defendant's right to free speech. Id., 758.\n\nSubdiv. (3): Freedom of speech subject to reasonable regulation of place and manner of exercise; not necessary to limit application of statute to “fighting words”; the prohibition is against purposeful harassment by means of device readily susceptible of abuse; trespasser upon our privacy. 34 CS 689.",

      "text": "The following definitions are applicable to this section and sections 53a-194 to 53a-210, inclusive:\n\n(1) Any material or performance is “obscene” if, (A) taken as a whole, it predominantly appeals to the prurient interest, (B) it depicts or describes in a patently offensive way a prohibited sexual act, and (C) taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, educational, political or scientific value. Predominant appeal shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults unless it appears from the character of the material or performance or the circumstances of its dissemination to be designed for some other specially susceptible audience. Whether a material or performance is obscene shall be judged by ordinary adults applying contemporary community standards. In applying contemporary community standards, the state of Connecticut is deemed to be the community.\n\n(2) Material or a performance is “obscene as to minors” if it depicts a prohibited sexual act and, taken as a whole, it is harmful to minors. For purposes of this subdivision: (A) “Minor” means any person less than seventeen years old as used in section 53a-196 and less than sixteen years old as used in sections 53a-196a and 53a-196b, and (B) “harmful to minors” means that quality of any description or representation, in whatever form, of a prohibited sexual act, when (i) it predominantly appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid interest of minors, (ii) it is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors, and (iii) taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, educational, political or scientific value for minors.\n\n(3) “Prohibited sexual act” means erotic fondling, nude performance, sexual excitement, sado-masochistic abuse, masturbation or sexual intercourse.\n\n(4) “Nude performance” means the showing of the human male or female genitals, pubic area or buttocks with less than a fully opaque covering, or the showing of the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any portion thereof below the top of the nipple, or the depiction of covered male genitals in a discernibly turgid state in any play, motion picture, dance or other exhibition performed before an audience.\n\n(5) “Erotic fondling” means touching a person's clothed or unclothed genitals, pubic area, buttocks, or if such person is a female, breast.\n\n(6) “Sexual excitement” means the condition of human male or female genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.\n\n(7) “Sado-masochistic abuse” means flagellation or torture by or upon a person clad in undergarments, a mask or bizarre costume, or the condition of being fettered, bound or otherwise physically restrained on the part of one so clothed.\n\n(8) “Masturbation” means the real or simulated touching, rubbing or otherwise stimulating a person's own clothed or unclothed genitals, pubic area, buttocks, or, if the person is female, breast, either by manual manipulation or with an artificial instrument.\n\n(9) “Sexual intercourse” means intercourse, real or simulated, whether genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital or oral-anal, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex or between a human and an animal, or with an artificial genital.\n\n(10) “Material” means anything tangible which is capable of being used or adapted to arouse prurient, shameful or morbid interest, whether through the medium of reading, observation, sound or in any other manner. Undeveloped photographs, molds, printing plates, and the like, may be deemed obscene notwithstanding that processing or other acts may be required to make the obscenity patent or to disseminate it.\n\n(11) “Performance” means any play, motion picture, dance or other exhibition performed before an audience.\n\n(12) “Promote” means to manufacture, issue, sell, give, provide, lend, mail, deliver, transfer, transmit, publish, distribute, circulate, disseminate, present, exhibit, advertise, produce, direct or participate in.\n\n(13) “Child sexual abuse material” means any visual depiction including any photograph, film, videotape, picture or computer-generated image or picture, whether made or produced by electronic, digital, mechanical or other means, of sexually explicit conduct, where the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a person under sixteen years of age engaging in sexually explicit conduct, provided whether the subject of a visual depiction was a person under sixteen years of age at the time the visual depiction was created is a question to be decided by the trier of fact.\n\n(14) “Sexually explicit conduct” means actual or simulated (A) sexual intercourse, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital or oral-anal physical contact, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex, or with an artificial genital, (B) bestiality, (C) masturbation, (D) sadistic or masochistic abuse, or (E) lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person.\n\n(15) “Visual depiction” includes undeveloped film and videotape and data, as defined in subdivision (8) of section 53a-250, that is capable of conversion into a visual image and includes encrypted data.\n\n(1969, P.A. 828, S. 195; P.A. 74-124; P.A. 78-331, S. 21, 58; 78-345, S. 1, 4; P.A. 83-507; P.A. 85-496, S. 4; P.A. 92-260, S. 76; P.A. 04-139, S. 2; P.A. 14-192, S. 5; P.A. 24-118, S. 2.)\n\nHistory: P.A. 74-124 added provision re application of contemporary community standards in judgments concerning obscenity; P.A. 78-331 extended applicability of definitions to encompass Sec. 53a-196a; P.A. 78-345 amended Subsec. (b) to replace “nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement or sado-masochistic abuse” with reference to prohibited sexual acts, to redefine “minor” re 16-year-olds, to replace definition of “nudity” with definition of “nude performance”, to delete definition of “sexual conduct”, to define “prohibited sexual act”, “erotic fondling”, “masturbation”, and “sexual intercourse” and to redefine “harmful to minors” as description or representation which lacks serious literary, artistic, educational, political or scientific value for minors rather than as something “utterly without redeeming social importance for minors” and redefined “material” in Subsec. (c) to specify something used or adapted to arouse “prurient, shameful or morbid” interest; P.A. 83-507 amended Subsec. (a) to redefine “obscene” by replacing (1) “its predominant appeal is to prurient, shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, excretion, sadism or masochism” with “it predominantly appeals to the prurient interest”, (2) “it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in describing or representing such matters” with “it depicts or describes in a patently offensive way a prohibited sexual act” and (3) “it is utterly without redeeming social value” with “taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, educational, political or scientific value”, and reordered and redesignated the other definitions; P.A. 85-496 included reference to Sec. 53a-196c and added definition of “child pornography”; P.A. 92-260 made definitions applicable to “this section and sections 53a-194 to 53a-210, inclusive” rather than to “sections 53a-193 to 53a-196a, inclusive and section 53a-196c”, replaced alphabetic Subsec. indicators with numeric indicators, amended Subsec. (1) to replace numeric Subdiv. indicators with alphabetic indicators and add “or performance” in provisions re judging predominant appeal and applying community standards, and amended Subsec. (2) to replace numeric Subdiv. indicators with alphabetic indicators and alphabetic Subpara. indicators with numeric indicators; P.A. 04-139 applied definitions to Secs. 53a-196e to 53a-196g, inclusive, amended Subdiv. (2) to make a technical change and to delete in Subpara. (A) applicability to Sec. 53a-196c of definition of a minor as a person less than 16 years old, redefined “child pornography” in Subdiv. (13) and added definitions of “sexually explicit conduct” and “visual depiction” as Subdivs. (14) and (15), respectively; P.A. 14-192 amended Subdiv. (13) to redefine “child pornography” by adding “digital”; P.A. 24-118 redefined “child pornography” as “child sexual abuse material” in Subdiv. (13).\n\nCited. 193 C. 612. Defendant's challenge denied re prior interpretation of “live performance” and “before an audience” in Subdivs. (11) and (13), revision of 1999. 277 C. 155.\n\nCited. 3 CA 80; 28 CA 91; 29 CA 591.\n\nDefinition of obscenity is sufficiently explicit to inform a person of ordinary intelligence of what material would be in violation of the law; definition of “obscene” contained in section is presently immune from attack upon the grounds of vagueness or overbreadth at the federal level. 32 CS 639. Cited. 38 CS 570, 574.\n\nSubdiv. (11):\n\nRequirement in Sec. 53a-196d, through its incorporation of Sec. 53a-193(11) and (13), that the live performance depicted in the materials be “performed before an audience” means that there must be some recording or viewing of, or listening to, a live performance, or a reproduction of a live performance, by a person or persons other than the person or persons simultaneously engaged in the performance; the number of such persons recording, viewing or listening to the performance and whether they actually are present at the live performance or depicted in reproductions of it are irrelevant for purposes of determining whether an audience exists. 252 C. 579. The use of “performance” in this subdivision does not conflict with the use of “showing” in Subdiv. (4) since a performance is an exhibition and common meaning of exhibition is to show or display outwardly; context of section concerns depicting a prohibited sexual act such as a nude performance showing certain body parts, including photographs. 346 C. 432.\n\nSubdiv. (14):\n\nSubpara. (E): Although they should not be rigidly or mechanically applied, the factors set forth in United States v. Dost, 636 F. Supp. 828, factors are helpful in cases in which probable cause depends in part on whether the description in a search warrant affidavit of possibly lascivious images supports, as part of the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable inference that evidence of a crime will be found in the place to be searched. 335 C. 29.",
