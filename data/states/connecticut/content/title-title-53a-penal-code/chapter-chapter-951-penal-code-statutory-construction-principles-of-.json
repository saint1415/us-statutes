Statute does not provide for a separate, substantive offense but provides alternate means by which the underlying substantive crime may be committed. 49 CA 121. Fact that defendant not formally charged as accessory does not preclude a conviction as such. Id., 183. State must prove that accused shared both the criminal intent and community of unlawful purpose with principal perpetrator of the crime. 63 CA 466. Court's charge re accessorial liability properly tracks language of section and correctly explained that acting as accessory merely is an alternative means of committing the substantive offense. 81 CA 152. When defendant is charged with manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm as an accessory, state must prove that defendant intended to inflict serious physical injury and to aid the principal in doing so, but does not have to also prove that defendant intended the use, carrying or threatened use of the firearm. 95 CA 362. There is no meaningful distinction between principal and accessory liability and defendant may be convicted as accessory even if charged as a principal. 105 CA 862. Evidence introduced at trial was sufficient to establish intent and defendant's identity with respect to charges stemming from drug transaction. 110 CA 70. Conviction as accessory to attempted robbery in the first degree pursuant to section does not require state to demonstrate that accused intended for an accomplice to possess a deadly weapon. 184 CA 24. Prohibition against double jeopardy is not always automatically violated simply because of contemporaneous convictions of the same offense as both a principal and as an accessory; double jeopardy is not implicated if a jury reasonably could find on the basis of the evidence presented that each charged offense was the result of a distinct act of independent legal significance, one committed as a principal and another as an accessory; trial court not constitutionally required to vacate defendant's conviction of two counts of assault in the first degree as an accessory because defendant's multiple punishments for assault as to each victim were premised not on a single criminal act but distinct repetitions of the same crime. 185 CA 1.\n\nDefendant who operated boat while brother stole lobsters was criminally liable for intentionally aiding brother in the conduct that constituted the liable for intentionally aiding brother in the conduct that constituted the offense. 37 CS 809. Cited. 38 CS 301; 40 CS 38.\n\nSubsec. (a):\n\nCited. 242 C. 485. Jury did not have to find that defendant actually wielded knife during robbery; it had to find that defendant was a participant in the robbery. 275 C. 534. Trial court properly rejected defendant's claim that a defense of duress, if credited, would negate the required mental state governing accessorial liability, specific intent and duress can coexist. 282 C. 281. Statute deems the accessory to be the same as the principal for purposes of criminal liability and punishment. 336 C. 219.\n\nCited. 37 CA 464; 39 CA 333. To be guilty as accessory, one must share the criminal intent and community of unlawful purpose with perpetrator of the crime and must knowingly and willfully assist perpetrator in the acts which prepare for, facilitate or consummate it. 77 CA 80. Although the evidence did not reveal whether it was defendant or a coparticipant who had fired the fatal shot, the jury reasonably could have determined that there was sufficient concert of action between defendant and the coparticipant to support the accessory allegation. 136 CA 197; judgment reversed in part, see 336 C. 219..",

Use of the terms “honest” and “sincere” in the jury instructions were an accurate statement of the law of self-defense regarding the subjective portion of the subjective-objective test and did not mislead the jury. 318 C. 621.\n\nCited. 3 CA 289; 5 CA 338; 22 CA 521; 25 CA 456; 29 CA 754; 31 CA 385. The subjective-objective inquiry into defendant's belief regarding the necessary degree of force requires jury to make two separate affirmative determinations in order for defendant's claim of self-defense to succeed. 68 CA 19. In the case of self-defense, eyewitness testimony of prior specific acts of violence perpetrated on defendant by his or her victim are admissible to show defendant's state of mind at the time of the killing. Id., 828. State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was not justified in using deadly physical force. 75 CA 80. Where a particular jury instruction, when viewed in isolation, could have been construed as dictating a purely objective standard, it was held that the charge as a whole, adequately instructed jury as to both the subjective and objective aspects of the test involved in a self-defense analysis. Id., 500. Trial court improperly instructed jury on defendant's claim of self-defense by removing from its consideration the disputed factual issue of whether defendant used nondeadly force in self-defense; new trial ordered. 97 CA 679.\n\nSubsec. (b):\n\nCited. 186 C. 654; 229 C. 916, see also 35 CA 520. Defendant's knowledge of ability to retreat is measured according to the subjective standard of defendant's actual knowledge; defendant accused of felony murder may not rely on a claim of self-defense. 254 C. 184. Subdiv. (1) allows state to rebut self-defense claim by showing that defendant could have retreated safely before using deadly force; it does not follow that defendant is statutorily or constitutionally entitled to use evidence of retreat after using deadly force to bolster self-defense claim without permitting jury to consider other possible reasons for the flight. 279 C. 414. Unlike the subjective-objective test in Subsec. (a), the duty to retreat under 2003 revision imposes only a subjective requirement that retreat in complete safety be available and that defendant know of it. 292 C. 656.\n\nCited. 31 CA 385; 34 CA 610; 40 CA 624; 43 CA 488; 44 CA 62. Retreat exception applies to a dwelling, not to a superior right to being outside the dwelling. 47 CA 91. Jury instruction that included an objective standard regarding the statutory duty to retreat was improper. 187 CA 661.\n\nSubsec. (c):\n\nCited. 221 C. 58. Subdiv. (2): Person who first uses physical force is not necessarily the initial aggressor under section; judgment of Appellate Court in 30 CA 406 reversed. 228 C. 335. There was no occasion for trial court to instruct the jury on initial aggressor doctrine under Subdiv. (2) when the state did not claim that defendant was the initial aggressor. 246 C. 268. Subdiv. (2): Language of Subdiv. is plain and unambiguous and provides that initial aggressor is justified in using physical force only if he withdraws and certain other conditions are satisfied, and Subdiv. does not provide, or suggest, that initial aggressor who uses nondeadly force is justified in using deadly force to repel victim's unlawful escalation of force to the deadly level. 292 C. 734. Subdiv. (2): Although court used the word retreat in its jury instructions on the law of initial aggressor, rather than the word withdraw set forth in statute, such usage was not confusing or misleading. 299 C. 1. Subdiv. (3): Defendant is not disqualified as a matter of law under Subdiv. from asserting a claim of self-defense during a combat by agreement when one party unilaterally and dangerously escalates the equal and previously agreed upon terms of a fight; instruction charging the jury on combat by agreement did not misstate the law when such jury instruction required defendant to “actually know” rather than “actually and reasonably believe” that the victim had escalated the fight from the mere use of physical force to actual use or imminent use of deadly force. 318 C. 621.\n\nSubdiv. (1): Provocation element carries with it requirement that actor act with specific intent to elicit use of physical force by another. 19 CA 609. Cited. 22 CA 521; 35 CA 699. Jury could have reasonably concluded from evidence presented that defendant was not justified in using deadly force against the victim because he was the initial aggressor. 75 CA 80.\n\nCited. 41 CS 525.",

      "text": "(a)(1) For purposes of this section, a reasonable belief that a person has committed an offense means a reasonable belief in facts or circumstances which if true would in law constitute an offense. If the believed facts or circumstances would not in law constitute an offense, an erroneous though not unreasonable belief that the law is otherwise does not render justifiable the use of physical force to make an arrest or to prevent an escape from custody.\n\n(2) A peace officer or an authorized official of the Department of Correction or the Board of Pardons and Paroles who is effecting an arrest pursuant to a warrant or preventing an escape from custody is justified in using the physical force prescribed in subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section unless such warrant is invalid and is known by such officer to be invalid.\n\n(b) Except as provided in subsection (a) or (d) of this section, a peace officer or an authorized official of the Department of Correction or the Board of Pardons and Paroles is justified in using physical force upon another person when and to the extent that he or she reasonably believes such use to be necessary to: (1) Effect an arrest or prevent the escape from custody of a person whom he or she reasonably believes to have committed an offense, unless he or she knows that the arrest or custody is unauthorized; or (2) defend himself or herself or a third person from the use or imminent use of physical force while effecting or attempting to effect an arrest or while preventing or attempting to prevent an escape.\n\n(c) (1) Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, a peace officer or an authorized official of the Department of Correction or the Board of Pardons and Paroles is justified in using deadly physical force upon another person for the purposes specified in subsection (b) of this section only when his or her actions are objectively reasonable under the given circumstances at that time, and:\n\n(A) He or she reasonably believes such use to be necessary to defend himself or herself or a third person from the use or imminent use of deadly physical force; or\n\n(B) He or she (i) has reasonably determined that there are no available reasonable alternatives to the use of deadly physical force, (ii) reasonably believes that the force employed creates no unreasonable risk of injury to a third party, and (iii) reasonably believes such use of force to be necessary to (I) effect an arrest of a person whom he or she reasonably believes has committed or attempted to commit a felony which involved the infliction of serious physical injury, and if, where feasible, he or she has given warning of his or her intent to use deadly physical force, or (II) prevent the escape from custody of a person whom he or she reasonably believes has committed a felony which involved the infliction of serious physical injury and who poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to others, and if, where feasible, he or she has given warning of his or her intent to use deadly physical force.\n\n(2) For purposes of evaluating whether actions of a peace officer or an authorized official of the Department of Correction or the Board of Pardons and Paroles are reasonable under subdivision (1) of this subsection, factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, whether (A) the person upon whom deadly physical force was used possessed or appeared to possess a deadly weapon, (B) the peace officer or an authorized official of the Department of Correction or the Board of Pardons and Paroles engaged in reasonable deescalation measures prior to using deadly physical force, and (C) any unreasonable conduct of the peace officer or an authorized official of the Department of Correction or the Board of Pardons and Paroles led to an increased risk of an occurrence of the situation that precipitated the use of such force.\n\n(d) A peace officer or an authorized official of the Department of Correction or the Board of Pardons and Paroles is justified in using a chokehold or other method of restraint applied to the neck area or that otherwise impedes the ability to breathe or restricts blood circulation to the brain of another person for the purposes specified in subsection (b) of this section only when he or she reasonably believes such use to be necessary to defend himself or herself from the use or imminent use of deadly physical force.\n\n(e) Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, a person who has been directed by a peace officer or an authorized official of the Department of Correction or the Board of Pardons and Paroles to assist such peace officer or official to effect an arrest or to prevent an escape from custody is justified in using reasonable physical force when and to the extent that he or she reasonably believes such to be necessary to carry out such peace officer's or official's direction.\n\n(f) A person who has been directed to assist a peace officer or an authorized official of the Department of Correction or the Board of Pardons and Paroles under circumstances specified in subsection (e) of this section may use deadly physical force to effect an arrest or to prevent an escape from custody only when: (1) He or she reasonably believes such use to be necessary to defend himself or herself or a third person from what he or she reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force; or (2) he or she is directed or authorized by such peace officer or official to use deadly physical force, unless he or she knows that the peace officer or official himself or herself is not authorized to use deadly physical force under the circumstances.\n\n(g) A private person acting on his or her own account is justified in using reasonable physical force upon another person when and to the extent that he or she reasonably believes such use to be necessary to effect an arrest or to prevent the escape from custody of an arrested person whom he or she reasonably believes to have committed an offense and who in fact has committed such offense; but he or she is not justified in using deadly physical force in such circumstances, except in defense of person as prescribed in section 53a-19.\n\n(h) In determining whether use of force by a peace officer who is a police officer, as defined in subsection (a) of section 29-6d, is justified pursuant to this section, the trier of fact may draw an unfavorable inference from a police officer's deliberate failure in violation of section 29-6d to record such use of physical force.\n\n(1969, P.A. 828, S. 23;
