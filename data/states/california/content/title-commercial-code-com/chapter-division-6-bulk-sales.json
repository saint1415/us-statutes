The term includes costs of collection and attorney’s fees only to the extent that the laws of this state permit the holder of the claim to recover them in an action against the obligor.(5) “Claimant” means a person holding a claim incurred in the seller’s business other than any of the following:(i) An unsecured and unmatured claim for employment compensation and benefits, including commissions and vacation, severance, and sick-leave pay.(ii) A claim for injury to an individual or to property, or for breach of warranty, unless all of the following are satisfied:(A) A right of action for the claim has accrued.(B) The claim has been asserted against the seller.(C) The seller knows the identity of the person asserting the claim and the basis upon which the person has asserted it.(iii) A claim for taxes owing to a governmental unit, if both of the following are satisfied:(A) A statute governing the enforcement of the claim permits or requires notice of the bulk sale to be given to the governmental unit in a manner other than by compliance with the requirements of this division.(B) Notice is given in accordance with the statute.(6) “Creditor” means a claimant or other person holding a claim.(7) (i) “Date of the bulk sale” means either of the following:(A) If the sale is by auction or is conducted by a liquidator on the seller’s behalf, the date on which more than 10 percent of the net proceeds is paid to or for the benefit of the seller.(B) In all other cases, the later of the date on which either of the following occurs:(I) More than 10 percent of the net contract price is paid to or for the benefit of the seller.(II) More than 10 percent of the assets, as measured by value, are transferred to the buyer.(ii) For purposes of this subdivision the following shall apply:(A) Delivery of a negotiable instrument (subdivision (1) of Section 3104) to or for the benefit of the seller in exchange for assets constitutes payment of the contract price pro tanto.(B) To the extent that the contract price is deposited in an escrow, the contract price is paid to or for the benefit of the seller when the seller acquires the unconditional right to receive the deposit or when the deposit is delivered to the seller or for the benefit of the seller, whichever is earlier.(C) An asset is transferred when a person holding an unsecured claim can no longer obtain through judicial proceedings rights to the asset that are superior to those of the buyer arising as a result of the bulk sale. A person holding an unsecured claim can obtain those superior rights to a tangible asset at least until the buyer has an unconditional right, under the bulk-sale agreement, to possess the asset, and a person holding an unsecured claim can obtain those superior rights to an intangible asset at least until the buyer has an unconditional right, under the bulk-sale agreement, to use the asset.(8) “Date of the bulk-sale agreement” means either of the following:(i) In the case of a sale by auction or conducted by a liquidator (subparagraph (i) of paragraph (3)), the date on which the seller engages the auctioneer or liquidator.(ii) In all other cases, the date on which a bulk-sale agreement becomes enforceable between the buyer and the seller.(9) “Debt” means liability on a claim.(10) “Liquidator” means a person who is regularly engaged in the business of disposing of assets for businesses contemplating liquidation or dissolution.(11) “Net contract price” means the new consideration the buyer is obligated to pay for the assets less each of the following:(i) The amount of any proceeds of the sale of an asset, to the extent the proceeds are applied in partial or total satisfaction of a debt secured by the asset.(ii) The amount of any debt to the extent it is secured by a security interest or lien that is enforceable against the asset before and after it has been sold to a buyer. If a debt is secured by an asset and other property of the seller, the amount of the debt secured by a security interest or lien that is enforceable against the asset is determined by multiplying the debt by a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the new consideration for the asset on the date of the bulk sale and the denominator of which is the value of all property securing the debt on the date of the bulk sale.(12) “Net proceeds” means the new consideration received for assets sold at a sale by auction or a sale conducted by a liquidator on the seller’s behalf less each of the following:(i) Commissions and reasonable expenses of the sale.(ii) The amount of any proceeds of the sale of an asset, to the extent the proceeds are applied in partial or total satisfaction of a debt secured by the asset.(iii) The amount of any debt to the extent it is secured by a security interest or lien that is enforceable against the asset before and after it has been sold to a buyer.

      "text": "6106.2. (a) This section applies only to a bulk sale where the consideration is two million dollars ($2,000,000) or less and is substantially all cash or an obligation of the buyer to pay cash in the future to the seller or a combination thereof.\n\n(b) Upon every bulk sale subject to this section except one made by sale at auction or a sale or series of sales conducted by a liquidator on the seller’s behalf, it is the duty of the buyer or, if the transaction is handled through an escrow, the escrow agent to apply the cash consideration in accordance with this section so far as necessary to pay those debts of the seller for which claims are due and payable on or before the date of the bulk sale and are received in writing on or prior to the date specified as the last date to file claims with the person designated in the notice to receive claims. This duty of the buyer or escrow agent runs to each claimant timely filing the claim.(c) If the seller disputes whether a claim is due and payable on the date of the bulk sale or the amount of any claim, the buyer or escrow agent shall withhold from distribution an amount equal to (1) 125 percent of the first seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) of the claim, and (2) an amount equal to that portion of the claim in excess of the first seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500), or the pro rata amount under subdivision (b) of Section 6106.4, if applicable, and shall send a written notice to the claimant filing the claim on or before two business days after the distribution that the amount will be paid to the seller, or to the other claimants in accordance with subdivision (b) of Section 6106.4, as the case may be, unless attached within 25 days from the mailing of the notice. Any portion of the amount withheld which is not attached by the claimant within that time shall be paid by the buyer or escrow agent to the seller, or to the other claimants in accordance with subdivision (b) of Section 6106.4 if they have not been paid in full. An attachment of any amount so withheld shall be limited in its effect to the amount withheld for the attaching claimant and shall give the attaching claimant no greater priority or rights with respect to its claim than the claimant would have had if the claim had not been disputed. For purposes of this subdivision, a claimant may obtain the issuance of an attachment for a claim which is less than five hundred dollars ($500) and which otherwise meets the requirements of Section 483.010 of the Code of Civil Procedure or which is a secured claim or lien of the type described in Section 483.010 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The remedy in this subdivision shall be in addition to any other remedies the claimant may have, including any right to attach the property intended to be transferred or any other property.(d) If the cash consideration payable is not sufficient to pay all of the claims received in full, where no escrow has been established pursuant to Section 6106.4, the buyer shall follow the procedures specified in subdivisions (a) to (c), inclusive, of Section 6106.4, and the immunity established by paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of that section shall apply to the buyer.(e) The buyer or escrow agent shall, within 45 days after the buyer takes legal title to any of the goods, either pay to the extent of the cash consideration the claims filed and not disputed, or the applicable portion thereof to the extent of the cash consideration under subdivision (b) of Section 6106.4, or institute an action in interpleader pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 386 of the Code of Civil Procedure and deposit the consideration with the clerk of the court pursuant to subdivision (c) of that section. The action shall be brought in the appropriate court in the county where the seller had its principal place of business in this state. Sections 386.1 and 386.6 of the Code of Civil Procedure shall apply in the action.(f) The notice shall state, in addition to the matters required by Section 6105, the name and address of the person with whom claims may be filed and the last date for filing claims, which shall be the business day before the date stated in the notice pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 6105. Claims shall be deemed timely filed only if actually received by the person designated in the notice to receive claims before the close of business on the day specified in the notice as the last date for filing claims.(g) This section shall not be construed to release any security interest or other lien on the property which is the subject of the bulk sale except upon a voluntary release by the secured party or lienholder.(Added by Stats. 1990, Ch. 1191, Sec. 4.)\n\n(b) Upon every bulk sale subject to this section except one made by sale at auction or a sale or series of sales conducted by a liquidator on the seller’s behalf, it is the duty of the buyer or, if the transaction is handled through an escrow, the escrow agent to apply the cash consideration in accordance with this section so far as necessary to pay those debts of the seller for which claims are due and payable on or before the date of the bulk sale and are received in writing on or prior to the date specified as the last date to file claims with the person designated in the notice to receive claims.

Any portion of the amount withheld which is not attached by the claimant within that time shall be paid by the buyer or escrow agent to the seller, or to the other claimants in accordance with subdivision (b) of Section 6106.4 if they have not been paid in full. An attachment of any amount so withheld shall be limited in its effect to the amount withheld for the attaching claimant and shall give the attaching claimant no greater priority or rights with respect to its claim than the claimant would have had if the claim had not been disputed. For purposes of this subdivision, a claimant may obtain the issuance of an attachment for a claim which is less than five hundred dollars ($500) and which otherwise meets the requirements of Section 483.010 of the Code of Civil Procedure or which is a secured claim or lien of the type described in Section 483.010 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

(a) Except as provided in subdivision (c), and subject to the limitation in subdivision (d), a buyer who fails to comply with the requirements of Section 6104 with respect to a claimant is liable to the claimant for damages in the amount of the claim, reduced by any amount that the claimant would not have realized if the buyer had complied.\n\n(b) In an action under subdivision (a), the claimant has the burden of establishing the validity and amount of the claim, and the buyer has the burden of establishing the amount that the claimant would not have realized if the buyer had complied.(c) A buyer who made a good faith and commercially reasonable effort to comply with the requirements of Section 6104 or to exclude the sale from the application of this division under subdivision (c) of Section 6103 is not liable to creditors for failure to comply with the requirements of Section 6104. The buyer has the burden of establishing the good faith and commercial reasonableness of the effort.(d) In a single bulk sale the cumulative liability of the buyer for failure to comply with the requirements of Section 6104 may not exceed an amount equal to any of the following:(1) If the assets consist only of inventory and equipment, twice the net contract price, less the amount of any part of the net contract price paid to or applied for the benefit of the seller or a creditor except to the extent that the payment or application is applied to a debt which is secured by the assets and which has been taken into consideration in determining the net contract price.(2) If the assets include property other than inventory and equipment, twice the net value of the inventory and equipment less the amount of the portion of any part of the net contract price paid to or applied for the benefit of the seller or a creditor which is allocable to the inventory and equipment except to the extent that the payment or application is applied to a debt which is secured by the assets and which has been taken into consideration in determining the net contract price.(e) For the purposes of paragraph (2) of subdivision (d), the “net value” of an asset is the value of the asset less each of the following:(1) The amount of any proceeds of the sale of an asset, to the extent the proceeds are applied in partial or total satisfaction of a debt secured by the asset.(2) The amount of any debt to the extent it is secured by a security interest or lien that is enforceable against the asset before and after it has been sold to a buyer. If a debt is secured by an asset and other property of the seller, the amount of the debt secured by a security interest or lien that is enforceable against the asset is determined by multiplying the debt by a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the asset on the date of the bulk sale and the denominator of which is the value of all property securing the debt on the date of the bulk sale. The portion of a part of the net contract price paid to or applied for the benefit of the seller or a creditor that is “allocable to the inventory and equipment” is the portion that bears the same ratio to that part of the net contract price as the net value of the inventory and equipment bears to the net value of all of the assets.(f) A payment made by the buyer to a person to whom the buyer is, or believes it is, liable under subdivision (a) reduces pro tanto the buyer’s cumulative liability under subdivision (d).(g) No action may be brought under subdivision (a) by or on behalf of a claimant whose claim is unliquidated or contingent.(h) A buyer’s failure to comply with the requirements of Section 6104 does not do any of the following:(1) Impair the buyer’s rights in or title to the assets.(2) Render the sale ineffective, void, or voidable.(3) Entitle a creditor to more than a single satisfaction of its claim.(4) Create liability other than as provided in this division.(i) Payment of the buyer’s liability under subdivision (a) discharges pro tanto the seller’s debt to the creditor.(j) Unless otherwise agreed, a buyer has an immediate right of reimbursement from the seller for any amount paid to a creditor in partial or total satisfaction of the buyer’s liability under subdivision (a).(Repealed and added by Stats. 1990, Ch. 1191, Sec. 3.)\n\n(b) In an action under subdivision (a), the claimant has the burden of establishing the validity and amount of the claim, and the buyer has the burden of establishing the amount that the claimant would not have realized if the buyer had complied.\n\n(c) A buyer who made a good faith and commercially reasonable effort to comply with the requirements of Section 6104 or to exclude the sale from the application of this division under subdivision (c) of Section 6103 is not liable to creditors for failure to comply with the requirements of Section 6104.
