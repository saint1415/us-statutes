The background check may include, but not be limited to, unannounced onsite inspection prior to enrollment, review of business records, and data searches. If discrepancies are found to exist during the preenrollment period, the department may conduct additional inspections prior to enrollment. Failure to remediate significant discrepancies as prescribed by the director may result in denial of the application for enrollment. Providers that do not provide services consistent with the standards of care or that do not comply with the department’s rules related to the fiscal integrity of the program may be disenrolled as a provider from the program at the sole discretion of the department.(g) The department shall not enroll any applicant who, within the previous 10 years:(1) Has been convicted of any felony or misdemeanor that involves fraud or abuse in any government program, that relates to neglect or abuse of a patient in connection with the delivery of a health care item or service, or that is in connection with the interference with, or obstruction of, any investigation into health care related fraud or abuse.(2) Has been found liable for fraud or abuse in any civil proceeding, or that has entered into a settlement in lieu of conviction for fraud or abuse in any government program.(h) In addition, the department may deny enrollment to any applicant that, at the time of application, is under investigation by the department or any local, state, or federal government law enforcement agency for fraud or abuse.

The disenrollment shall be effective on the date the license, certificate, or approval is revoked, lost, or surrendered.(B) (i) The department may elect to not disenroll an individual or entity as a provider in the program pursuant to subparagraph (A) if the revocation, suspension, or loss of the individual’s or entity’s license, certification, or other approval in another state, or if the pending disciplinary hearing during which the individual or entity surrendered the license, certification, or other approval in another state, is based solely on conduct that is not deemed to be unprofessional conduct under California law.(ii) The department shall seek any federal approvals that it deems necessary to implement this subparagraph. This subparagraph shall be implemented only to the extent that the department obtains any necessary federal approvals and that federal financial participation under the Medi-Cal program is available and not otherwise jeopardized.(2) (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a provider shall be subject to disenrollment if the provider submits claims for payment for the services, goods, supplies, or merchandise provided, directly or indirectly, to a program beneficiary, by an individual or entity that has been previously suspended, excluded, or otherwise made ineligible to receive, directly or indirectly, reimbursement from the program or from the Medi-Cal program and the individual has previously been listed on either the Suspended and Ineligible Provider List, which is published by the department, to identify suspended and otherwise ineligible providers or any list published by the federal Office of the Inspector General regarding the suspension or exclusion of individuals or entities from the federal Medicare and Medicaid programs, to identify suspended, excluded, or otherwise ineligible providers.(B) (i) Subparagraph (A) does not apply if the sole basis for an individual’s listing on either the Suspended and Ineligible Provider List or any list published by the federal Office of the Inspector General regarding the suspension or exclusion of individuals or entities from the federal Medicare and Medicaid programs, to identify suspended, excluded, or otherwise ineligible providers, is conduct that is not deemed to be unprofessional conduct under California law.(ii) The department shall request a waiver or any other federal approvals that it deems necessary to implement this subparagraph. This subparagraph shall be implemented only to the extent that the department obtains any necessary federal approvals and that federal financial participation under the Medi-Cal program is available and not otherwise jeopardized.(3) The department shall deactivate, immediately and without prior notice, the provider numbers used by a provider to obtain reimbursement from the program when warrants or documents mailed to a provider’s mailing address, its pay to address, or its service address, if any, are returned by the United States Postal Service as not deliverable or when a provider has not submitted a claim for reimbursement from the program for one year. Prior to taking this action, the department shall use due diligence in attempting to contact the provider at its last known telephone number and to ascertain if the return by the United States Postal Service is by mistake and shall use due diligence in attempting to contact the provider by telephone or in writing to ascertain whether the provider wishes to continue to participate in the Medi-Cal program. If deactivation pursuant to this section occurs, the provider shall meet the requirements for reapplication as specified in regulation.(4) For purposes of this subdivision:(A) “Mailing address” means the address that the provider has identified to the department in its application for enrollment as the address at which it wishes to receive general program correspondence.(B) “Pay to address” means the address that the provider has identified to the department in its application for enrollment as the address at which it wishes to receive warrants.(C) “Service address” means the address that the provider has identified to the department in its application for enrollment as the address at which the provider will provide services to program beneficiaries.(j) Subject to Article 4 (commencing with Section 19130) of Chapter 5 of Part 2 of Division 5 of Title 2 of the Government Code, the department may enter into contracts to secure consultant services or information technology including, but not limited to, software, data, or analytical techniques or methodologies for the purpose of fraud or abuse detection and prevention. Contracts under this section shall be exempt from the Public Contract Code.(k) Enrolled providers shall attend specific orientation approved by the department in comprehensive family planning services. Enrolled providers who insert IUDs or contraceptive implants shall have received prior clinical training specific to these procedures.(l) Upon receipt of reliable evidence that would be admissible under the administrative adjudication provisions of Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, of fraud or willful misrepresentation by a provider under the program or commencement of a suspension under Section 14123, the department may do any of the following:(1) Collect any State-Only Family Planning Program or Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment Program overpayment identified through an audit or examination, or any portion thereof from any provider. Notwithstanding Section 100171 of the Health and Safety Code, a provider may appeal the collection of overpayments under this section pursuant to procedures established in Article 5.3 (commencing with Section 14170) of Chapter 7 of Part 3 of Division 9. Overpayments collected under this section shall not be returned to the provider during the pendency of any appeal and may be offset to satisfy audit or appeal findings, if the findings are against the provider. Overpayments shall be returned to a provider with interest if findings are in favor of the provider.(2) Withhold payment for any goods or services, or any portion thereof, from any State-Only Family Planning Program or Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment Program provider.
