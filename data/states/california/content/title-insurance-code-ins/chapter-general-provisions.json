A valid electronic signature is sufficient for any law requiring a written signature.\n\n(2) For purposes of this section, the definitions set forth in Section 1633.2 of the Civil Code apply. The term “licensee” means an insurer, agent, broker, or any other person who is required to be licensed by the department.(3) Notwithstanding subdivision (l) of Section 1633.2 of the Civil Code, for purposes of this section, “person” includes, but is not limited to, the policy owner, policyholder, applicant, insured, or assignee or designee of an insured.(b) In order to transmit a record listed in subdivision (a) electronically, a licensee shall comply with all of the following:(1) A licensee, or licensee’s representative, acquires the consent of the person to opt in to receive the record by electronic transmission, and the person has not withdrawn that consent, prior to providing the record by electronic transmission.

In addition, if the person who consented receives an annual statement, the email address of the person who has consented shall be set forth on that record.(5) The licensee shall annually provide one free printed copy of any record described in this subdivision upon request by the person.(6) If a provision of this code requires a licensee to transmit a record by first-class mail, regular mail, does not specify a method of delivery, or is a record that is required to be provided pursuant to Article 6.6 (commencing with Section 791), and if the licensee is not otherwise prohibited from transmitting the record electronically under subdivision (b) of Section 1633.8 of the Civil Code, then the record may be transmitted by electronic transmission if the licensee complies with all of the requirements of Sections 1633.15 and 1633.16 of the Civil Code.(7) Notwithstanding subdivision (b) of Section 1633.8 of the Civil Code, if a provision of this code requires a licensee to transmit a record by return receipt, registered mail, certified mail, signed written receipt of delivery, or other method of delivery evidencing actual receipt by the person, and if the licensee is not otherwise prohibited from transmitting the record electronically under Section 1633.3 of the Civil Code and this section, then the licensee shall maintain a process or system that demonstrates proof of delivery and actual receipt of the record by the person consistent with this paragraph. The licensee shall document and retain information demonstrating delivery and actual receipt so that it is retrievable, upon request, by the department at least five years after the policy is no longer in force.

The commissioner shall ensure the report addresses the use of electronic transmissions by insurers conducting the business of insurance, the department’s enforcement actions relating to those electronic transmissions, and the impact of those enforcement actions on insurer compliance rates.(e) Notwithstanding paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) of Section 1633.3 of the Civil Code, a statutory requirement for a separate acknowledgment, signature, or initial that is not expressly prohibited by subdivision (c) of Section 1633.3 of the Civil Code may be transacted using an electronic signature, or by electronic transaction, subject to all applicable provisions of this section.(f) (1) Whenever the commissioner has reason to believe that a licensee has been or is engaged in conduct in this state that violates this section, or if the commissioner believes that a licensee has been or is engaged in conduct outside this state that has an effect on an insurance risk located within this state and that violates this section, the commissioner shall issue and serve upon that licensee a statement of charges and notice of hearing to be held at a time and place fixed in the notice. The date for the hearing shall be not less than 30 days after the date of service.(2) At the time and place fixed for the hearing, the licensee charged shall have an opportunity to answer the charges against it and present evidence on its behalf. Upon good cause shown, the commissioner shall permit any adversely affected person to appear and be heard at the hearing by counsel or in person.(3) At any hearing conducted pursuant to this section, the commissioner may administer oaths, examine and cross-examine witnesses, and receive oral and documentary evidence. The commissioner shall have the power to subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, and require the production of books, papers, records, correspondence, and other documents that are relevant to the hearing.

A copy of the statement of charges, notice, order, or other process shall be provided to the person or persons whose rights under this section have been allegedly violated. A verified return setting forth the manner of service, the return postcard receipt in the case of registered mail, or signed receipt documentation shall be sufficient proof of service.(5) If, after a hearing pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (4), the commissioner determines that the licensee charged has engaged in conduct or practices in violation of this section, the commissioner shall reduce their findings to writing and shall issue and cause to be served upon the licensee a copy of the findings and an order requiring the licensee to cease and desist from the conduct or practices constituting a violation of this section. As part of the order, the commissioner may suspend a licensee from providing records by electronic transmission if there is a pattern or practice that demonstrates the licensee has failed to comply with the requirements of this section. A licensee may appeal the suspension and resume its electronic transmission of records upon communication from the department that the changes the licensee made to its process or system to comply with the requirements of this section are satisfactory.(6) Until expiration of the time allowed using the procedure set forth in paragraph (7) for filing a petition for review or until the petition is actually filed, whichever occurs first, the commissioner may modify or set aside any order issued under this section. After expiration of the time allowed under paragraph (7) for filing a petition for review, if no petition has been duly filed, the commissioner may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, alter, modify, or set aside, in whole or in part, any order issued under this section whenever conditions of fact or law warrant that action or if the public interest requires.(7) A licensee subject to an order of the commissioner under this section or a person whose rights under this section were allegedly violated may obtain a review of an order of the commissioner by filing a petition in a court of competent jurisdiction, within 30 days from the date of the service of the order, pursuant to Section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The court shall have jurisdiction to make and enter a decree modifying, affirming, or reversing any order of the commissioner, in whole or in part.(8) An order issued by the commissioner under this section shall become final upon either of the following:(A) Upon the expiration of the time allowed for the filing of a petition for review, if no petition has been duly filed. However, the commissioner may modify or set aside an order to the extent provided in paragraph (6).(B) Upon a final decision of the court, if the court directs that the order of the commissioner be affirmed or the petition for review dismissed.(9) An order of the commissioner under this section or order of a court to enforce the order of the commissioner shall not in any way relieve or absolve a person or licensee affected by that order from liability under any law of this state.(10) A licensee who violates a cease and desist order of the commissioner under this section may, after notice and hearing and upon order of the commissioner, be subject to one of the following penalties at the discretion of the commissioner:(A) A civil penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each violation, except that the total civil penalty for violations of this section in a single investigation shall not exceed two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000).(B) A civil penalty of not more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) if the commissioner finds that violations have occurred with such frequency as to constitute a general business practice.(C) Suspension or revocation of a licensee’s license if the licensee knew or reasonably should have known it was in violation of the cease and desist order.(Amended (as amended by Stats. 2017, Ch. 561, Sec. 137) by Stats. 2019, Ch. 235, Sec. 4.
