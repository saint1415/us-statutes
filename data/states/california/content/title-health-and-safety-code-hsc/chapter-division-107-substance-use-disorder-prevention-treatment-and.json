The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n\n(a) The Legislature has established various drug- and alcohol-related programs which provide for education, prevention, intervention, treatment, or enforcement.(b) The Legislature has classified certain substances as controlled substances and has defined the lawful and unlawful use of controlled substances which are commonly referred to as, but not limited to, anabolic steroids, marijuana, and cocaine.(c) The Legislature has classified certain substances as imitation controlled substances which are commonly referred to as, but not limited to, designer drugs.(d) The Legislature has determined that the possession with the intent to be under the influence, or being under the influence of toluene, or any substance or material containing toluene, or any substance with similar toxic qualities, is unlawful. Some substances or materials containing toluene, or substances with similar toxic qualities are commonly referred to, but not limited to, inhalants such as cement, glue, and paint thinner.(e) The Legislature has determined that the purchase, possession, or use of alcohol by persons under 21 years of age is unlawful.(f) Substance use disorder should be viewed and treated as a health problem, as well as a public safety problem as described in Section 11760.5.(g) Comprehensive prevention and treatment services for individuals experiencing or recovering from substance use disorders must be medically accurate, culturally congruent, and evidence based.(h) Naloxone, a life-saving opioid antagonist medication used to reverse an opioid overdose, including heroin, fentanyl, and prescription opioid medications, is safe and easy to use, works almost immediately, and is not addictive. Naloxone has very few negative effects, and has no effect if opioids are not in a person’s system.(i) With the establishment of the Naloxone Distribution Program and the United States Food and Drug Administration’s approval for over-the-counter, nonprescription use of naloxone for the reversal of an opioid overdose, the Legislature further finds that carrying naloxone provides an extra layer of protection for those at a higher risk for overdose. Although most professional first responders and emergency departments carry naloxone, they may not arrive in time to reverse an opioid overdose. Anyone can carry naloxone, give it to someone having an overdose, and potentially save a life. Bystanders such as friends, family, non-health care providers, and persons who use drugs can reverse an opioid overdose with naloxone.(Amended by Stats. 2025, Ch. 569, Sec. 10.
