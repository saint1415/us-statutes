The provisions of this interstate compact are as follows:\n\nWestern Interstate Nuclear CompactArticle I.Policy and PurposeThe party states recognize that the proper employment of scientific and technological discoveries and advances in nuclear and related fields and direct and collateral application and adaptation of processes and techniques developed in connection therewith, properly correlated with the other resources of the region, can assist substantially in the industrial progress of the West and the further development of the economy of the region. They also recognize that optimum benefit from nuclear and related scientific or technological resources, facilities and skills requires systematic encouragement, guidance, assistance, and promotion from the party states on a cooperative basis. It is the policy of the party states to undertake such cooperation on a continuing basis. It is the purpose of this compact to provide the instruments and framework for such a cooperative effort in nuclear and related fields, to enhance the economy of the West and contribute to the individual and community well-being of the region’s people.Article II.The Board(a) There is hereby created an agency of the party states to be known as the “Western Interstate Nuclear Board” (hereinafter called the board).

Any member of the board may provide for the discharge of his duties and the performance of his functions thereon (either for the duration of his membership or for any lesser period of time) by a deputy or assistant, if the laws of his state make specific provisions therefor. The federal government may be represented without vote if provision is made by federal law for such representation.(b) The board members of the party states shall each be entitled to one vote on the board. No action of the board shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of all members representing the party states are present and unless a majority of the total number of votes on the board are cast in favor thereof.(c) The board shall have a seal.(d) The board shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, a vice chairman, and a treasurer.
