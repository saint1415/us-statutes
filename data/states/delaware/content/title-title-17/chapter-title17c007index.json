However, no state highway shall cross any railroad or railway at grade except at a point or place where such railroad or railway is now crossed at grade by a public road, provided, however, state highways may cross spurs, sidings and branchlines of any railroad or railway at grade if approval is first obtained from the Secretary of the Department of Transportation to whom reasons and supporting data for requesting at grade crossing shall be furnished. All at grade crossings so approved shall be furnished with crossing protection, required by applicable federal, state and local regulations.(b) The Department may enter upon the lands or waters of any person for the purpose of making such examination and surveys for proposed highways as shall be required to be made in the selection of the most advantageous route for such highway, but subject at all times to responsibility for all and any damages which shall be done to the property of any such person or persons.29 Del.

If, in the opinion of the Department, the convenience of the traveling public requires it, the Department shall relocate the public road or the part thereof thus vacated and shall connect the public road with some other public road which crosses the railroad. The Department may acquire any land, building, franchise, easement or other property necessary for the relocation of the road by purchase thereof or by condemnation proceedings as provided in Chapter 61 of Title 10. The character of the construction of the relocated public road shall be at the discretion of the Department and need not conform to the usual standards of the Department.(b) Whenever any public road is vacated, who shall enclose the same or any part thereof and what portion of the costs such persons ought to pay respectively shall be determined as provided in Chapter 13 of this title.29 Del.

If the company does not within 30 days thereafter comply with subsection (a) of this section, it shall be fined for the first offense $100, for the second offense $200 and for every subsequent offense not less than $500 nor more than $1,000.(c) The Superior Court shall have jurisdiction of offenses under this section.17 Del.
