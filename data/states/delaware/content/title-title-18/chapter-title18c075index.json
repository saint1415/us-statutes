The disclosures must be provided in a separate document that is signed by the viator and the viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker, and must provide the following information:(1) There are possible alternatives to viatical settlement contracts, including any accelerated death benefits or policy loans offered under the viator’s life insurance policy.(2) That a viatical settlement broker represents exclusively the viator, and not the insurer or the viatical settlement provider, and owes a fiduciary duty to the viator, including a duty to act according to the viator’s instructions and in the best interest of the viator.(3) Some or all of the proceeds of the viatical settlement may be taxable under federal income tax and state franchise and income taxes, and that assistance should be sought from a professional tax advisor.(4) Proceeds of the viatical settlement could be subject to the claims of creditors.(5) Receipt of the proceeds of a viatical settlement may adversely affect the viator’s eligibility for Medicaid or other government benefits or entitlements, and that advice should be obtained from the appropriate government agencies.(6) The viator has the right to rescind a viatical settlement contract before the earlier of 60 calendar days after the date upon which the viatical settlement contract is executed by all parties or 30 calendar days after the viatical settlement proceeds have been paid to the viator, as provided in § 7510 of this title. Rescission, if exercised by the viator, is effective only if both notice of the rescission is given, and the viator repays all proceeds and any premiums, loans and loan interest paid on account of the viatical settlement within the rescission period. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the viatical settlement contract is deemed to have been rescinded, subject to repayment by the viator or the viator’s estate of all viatical settlement proceeds and any premiums, loans and loan interest the viatical settlement within 60 days of the insured’s death.(7) Funds will be sent to the viator within 3 business days after the viatical settlement provider has received the insurer or group administrator’s written acknowledgment that ownership of the policy or interest in the certificate has been transferred and the beneficiary has been designated.(8) Entering into a viatical settlement contract may cause other rights or benefits, including conversion rights and waiver of premium benefits that may exist under the policy or certificate, to be forfeited by the viator, and that assistance should be sought from a financial adviser.(9) Disclosure to a viator must include distribution of a brochure describing the process of viatical settlements. The NAIC’s form for the brochure must be used unless another form is developed or approved by the Commissioner.(10) The disclosure document must contain the following language:“All medical, financial or personal information solicited or obtained by a viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker about an insured, including the insured’s identity or the identity of family members, a spouse or a significant other may be disclosed as necessary to effect the viatical settlement between the viator and the viatical settlement provider. If you are asked to provide this information, you will be asked to consent to the disclosure. The information may be provided to someone who buys the policy or provides funds for the purchase. You may be asked to renew your permission to share information every two years.”________________(11) Following execution of a viatical settlement contract, the insured may be contacted for the purpose of determining the insured’s health status and to confirm the insured’s residential or business street address and telephone number, or as otherwise provided in this Act. This contact must be limited to once every 3 months if the insured has a life expectancy of more than 1 year, and no more than once per month if the insured has a life expectancy of 1 year or less. All such contracts may only be made by a viatical settlement provider licensed in the state in which the viator resided at the time of the viatical settlement, or by the authorized representative of a duly licensed viatical settlement provider.(b) A viatical settlement provider shall provide the viator with at least the following disclosures no later than the date the viatical settlement contract is signed by all parties. The disclosures must be conspicuously displayed in the viatical settlement contract or in a separate document signed by the viator and provide the following information:(1) The affiliation, if any, between the viatical settlement provider and the issuer of an insurance policy to be viaticated.(2) The document must include the name, business address, and telephone number of the viatical settlement provider.(3) Any affiliations or contractual arrangements between the viatical settlement provider and the viatical settlement purchaser.(4) If an insurance policy to be viaticated has been issued as a joint policy or involves family riders or any coverage of a life other than the insured under the policy to be viaticated, the viator must be informed of the possible loss of coverage on the other lives under the policy and must be advised to consult with his or her insurance producer or the company issuing the policy for advice on the proposed viatical settlement.(5) State the dollar amount of the current death benefit payable to the viatical settlement provider under the policy or certificate. If known, the viatical settlement provider shall also disclose the availability of any additional guaranteed insurance benefits, the dollar amount of any accidental death and dismemberment benefits under the policy or certificate, and the extent to which the viator’s interest in those benefits will be transferred as a result of the viatical settlement contract.(6) State whether the funds will be escrowed with an independent third party during the transfer process, and if so, provide the name, business address, and telephone number of the independent third party escrow agent, and the fact that the viator or owner may inspect or receive copies of the relevant escrow or trust agreements or documents.(c) A viatical settlement broker shall provide the viator with at least the following disclosures no later than the date the viatical settlement contract is signed by all parties. The disclosures must be conspicuously displayed in the viatical settlement contract or in a separate document signed by the viator and provide the following information:(1) The name, business address, and telephone number of the viatical settlement broker.(2) A full, complete, and accurate description of all offers, counter-offers, acceptances and rejections relating to the proposed viatical settlement contract.(3) A written disclosure of any affiliations or contractual arrangements between the viatical settlement broker and any person making an offer in connection with the proposed viatical settlement contracts.(4) The amount and method of calculating the broker’s compensation.

Laws, c. 132,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;81 Del. Laws, c. 172,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n7509. Disclosure to insurer.Prior to the initiation of a plan, transaction, or series of transactions, a viatical settlement broker or viatical settlement provider shall fully disclose to an insurer a plan, transaction, or series of transactions, to which the viatical settlement broker or viatical settlement provider is a party, to originate, renew, continue, or finance a life insurance policy with the insurer for the purpose of engaging in the business of viatical settlements at any time prior to, or during the first 5 years after, issuance of the policy.81 Del. Laws, c. 172,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n7510. General rules.(a) A viatical settlement provider entering into a viatical settlement contract shall first obtain the following:(1) If the viator is the insured, a written statement from a licensed attending physician that the viator is of sound mind and under no constraint or undue influence to enter into a viatical settlement contract.(2) A document in which the insured consents to the release of the insured’s medical records to a licensed viatical settlement provider, viatical settlement broker, and the insurance company that issued the life insurance policy covering the life of the insured.(3) Within 20 days after a viator executes documents necessary to transfer any rights under an insurance policy or within 20 days of entering any agreement, option, promise, or any other form of understanding, expressed or implied, to viaticate the policy, the viatical settlement provider shall give written notice to the insurer that issued that insurance policy that the policy has or will become a viaticated policy. The notice must be accompanied by the documents required by this subsection.(4) The viatical settlement provider shall deliver a copy of the medical release required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a copy of the viator’s application for the viatical settlement contract, the notice required under § 7509 of this title, and a request for verification of coverage to the insurer that issued the life policy that is the subject of the viatical transaction. The NAIC’s form for verification of coverage must be used unless another form is developed and approved by the Commissioner.(5) The insurer shall respond to a request for verification of coverage submitted on an approved form by a viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker within 30 calendar days of the date the request is received and indicate whether, based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer intends to pursue an investigation at this time regarding the validity of the insurance contract or possible fraud. The insurer shall accept a request for verification of coverage made on an NAIC form or any other form approved by the Commissioner. The insurer shall accept an original, facsimile, or electronic copy of such request and any accompanying authorization signed by the viator. Failure by the insurer to meet its obligations under this subsection is a violation of §§ 7511(c) and 7516 of this title.(6) Prior to or at the time of execution of the viatical settlement contract, the viatical settlement provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which the viator consents to the viatical settlement contract, represents that the viator has a full and complete understanding of the viatical settlement contract, that the viator has a full and complete understanding of the benefits of the life insurance policy, acknowledges that the viator is entering into the viatical settlement contract freely and voluntarily and, for persons with a terminal or chronic illness or condition, acknowledges that the insured has a terminal or chronic illness or condition that was diagnosed after the life insurance policy was issued.(7) If a viatical settlement broker performs any of these activities required of the viatical settlement provider, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of this subsection.(b) All medical information solicited or obtained by any licensee is subject to the applicable provisions of state law relating to confidentiality of medical information.(c) All viatical settlement contracts entered into in this State must provide the viator with an absolute right to rescind the contract before the earlier of 60 calendar days after the date upon which the viatical settlement contract is executed by all parties or 30 calendar days after the viatical settlement proceeds have been sent to the viator as provided in this section. Rescission by the viator may be conditioned upon the viator both giving notice and repaying to the viatical settlement provider within the rescission period all proceeds of the settlement and any premiums, loans and loan interest paid by or on behalf of the viatical settlement provider in connection with or as a consequence of the viatical settlement. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the viatical settlement contract is deemed to have been rescinded, subject to repayment to the viatical settlement provider or purchaser of all viatical settlement proceeds, and any premiums, loans and loan interest that have been paid by the viatical settlement provider or purchaser, which must be paid within 60 calendar days of the death of the insured. In the event of any rescission, if the viatical settlement provider has paid commissions or other compensation to a viatical settlement broker in connection with the rescinded transaction, the viatical settlement broker shall refund all such commissions and compensation to the viatical settlement provider within 5 business days following receipt of written demand from the viatical settlement provider, which demand must be accompanied by either the viator’s notice of rescission if rescinded at the election of the viator, or notice of the death of the insured if rescinded by reason of the death of the insured within the applicable rescission period.(d) The viatical settlement provider shall instruct the viator to send the executed documents required to effect the change in ownership, assignment or change in beneficiary directly to the independent escrow agent. Within 3 business days after the date the escrow agent receives the document (or from the date the viatical settlement provider receives the documents, if the viator erroneously provides the documents directly to the provider), the provider must pay or transfer the proceeds of the viatical settlement into an escrow or trust account maintained in a state or federally-chartered financial institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Upon payment of the settlement proceeds into the escrow account, the escrow agent shall deliver the original change in ownership, assignment or change in beneficiary forms to the viatical settlement provider or related provider trust or other designated representative of the viatical settlement provider. Upon the escrow agent’s receipt of the acknowledgment of the properly completed transfer of ownership, assignment or designation of beneficiary from the insurance company, the escrow agent shall pay the settlement proceeds to the viator.(e) Failure to tender consideration to the viator for the viatical settlement contract within the time set forth in the disclosure pursuant to § 7508(a)(7) of this title renders the viatical settlement contract voidable by the viator for lack of consideration until the time consideration is tendered to and accepted by the viator. Funds are deemed sent by a viatical settlement provider to a viator as of the date that the escrow agent either releases funds for wire transfer to the viator or places a check for delivery to the viator via United States Postal Service or other nationally recognized delivery service.(f) Contacts with the insured for the purpose of determining the health status of the insured by the viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker after the viatical settlement has occurred may only be made by the viatical settlement provider or broker licensed in this State or its authorized representative and are limited to once every 3 months for insureds with a life expectancy of more than 1 year, and to no more than 1 per month for insureds with a life expectancy of 1 year or less. The provider or broker shall explain the procedure for these contacts at the time the viatical settlement contract is entered into. The limitations set forth in this subsection do not apply to any contacts with an insured under a viaticated policy for reasons other than determining the insured’s health status. Viatical settlement providers and viatical settlement brokers are responsible for the actions of their authorized representatives.(g) A related provider trust must have a written agreement with the licensed viatical settlement provider under which the licensed viatical settlement provider is responsible for ensuring compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements and under which the trust agrees to make all records and files related to viatical settlement transactions available to the Commissioner as if those records and files were maintained directly by the licensed viatical settlement provider.72 Del. Laws, c. 132,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;81 Del. Laws, c. 172,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n7511. Prohibited practices.(a) It is a violation of this Act for any person to enter into a viatical settlement contract at any time prior to the application or issuance of a policy which is the subject of viatical settlement contract or within a 5-year period commencing with the date of issuance of the insurance policy or certificate unless the viator certifies to the viatical settlement provider that 1 or more of the following conditions have been met within the 5-year period:(1) The policy was issued upon the viator’s exercise of conversion rights arising out of a group or individual policy, if the total of the time covered under the conversion policy plus the time covered under the prior policy is at least 60 months. The time covered under a group policy must be calculated without regard to any change in insurance carriers, if the coverage has been continuous and under the same group sponsorship.(2) The viator submits independent evidence to the viatical settlement provider that 1 or more of the following conditions have been met within the 5-year period:a. The viator or insured is terminally or chronically ill.b. The viator’s spouse dies.c. The viator divorces his or her spouse.d. The viator retires from full-time employment.e. The viator becomes physically or mentally disabled and a physician determines that the disability prevents the viator from maintaining full-time employment.f. A final order, judgment, or decree is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, on the application of a creditor of the viator, adjudicating the viator bankrupt or insolvent, or approving a petition seeking reorganization of the viator or appointing a receiver, trustee, or liquidator to all or a substantial part of the viator’s assets.(3) The viator enters into a viatical settlement contract more than 2 years after the date of issuance of a policy and, with respect to the policy, at all times prior to the date that is 2 years after policy issuance, the following conditions are met:a. Policy premiums have been funded exclusively with unencumbered assets, including an interest in the life insurance policy being financed only to the extent of its net cash surrender value, provided by, or fully recourse liability incurred by, the insured or a person described in § 7502(14)c.5. of this title.b. There is no agreement or understanding with any other person to guarantee any such liability or to purchase, or stand ready to purchase, the policy, including through an assumption or forgiveness of the loan.c. Neither the insured nor the policy has been evaluated for settlement.(b) Copies of the independent evidence described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and documents required by § 7510(a) of this title must be submitted to the insurer when the viatical settlement provider or other party entering into a viatical settlement contract with a viator submits a request to the insurer for verification of coverage. The copies must be accompanied by a letter of attestation from the viatical settlement provider that the copies are true and correct copies of the documents received by the viatical settlement provider.(c) If the viatical settlement provider submits to the insurer a copy of the owner or insured’s certification described in § 7511(a) of this title and the independent evidence required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section when the provider submits a request to the insurer to effect the transfer of the policy or certificate to the viatical settlement provider, the copy conclusively establishes that the viatical settlement contract satisfies the requirements of this subsection and the insurer shall timely respond to the request.(d) No insurer may, as a condition of responding to a request for verification of coverage or effecting the transfer of a policy pursuant to a viatical settlement contract, require that the viator, insured, viatical settlement provider, or viatical settlement broker sign any form, disclosure, consent, or waiver form that has not been expressly approved by the Commissioner for use in connection with viatical settlement contracts in this State.(e) Upon receipt of a properly completed request for change of ownership or beneficiary of a policy, the insurer shall respond in writing within 30 calendar days with written acknowledgement confirming that the change has been effected or specifying the reasons why the requested change cannot be processed. The insurer may not unreasonably delay effecting change of ownership or beneficiary and may not otherwise seek to interfere with any viatical settlement contract lawfully entered into in this State.81 Del. Laws, c. 172,\n\n§\n\n1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n7512. Prohibited practices and conflicts of interest.(a) With respect to any viatical settlement contract or insurance policy, a viatical settlement broker may not knowingly solicit an offer from, effectuate a viatical settlement with, or make a sale to any viatical settlement provider, viatical settlement purchaser, financing entity or related provider trust that is controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such viatical settlement broker.(b) With respect to any viatical settlement contract or insurance policy, no viatical settlement provider knowingly may enter into a viatical settlement contract with a viator, if, in connection with such viatical settlement contract, anything of value will be paid to a viatical settlement broker that is controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such viatical settlement provider or the viatical settlement purchaser, financing entity or related provider trust that is involved in such viatical settlement contract.(c) A violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section is a fraudulent viatical settlement act.(d) A viatical settlement provider may not enter into a viatical settlement contract unless the viatical settlement promotional, advertising and marketing materials, as may be prescribed by regulation, have been filed with the Commissioner. Marketing materials may not expressly reference that the insurance is “free” for any period of time. The inclusion of any reference in the marketing materials that would cause a viator to reasonably believe that the insurance is free for any period of time is a violation of this Act.(e) A life insurance producer, insurance company, viatical settlement broker, or viatical settlement provider may not make any statement or representation to the applicant or policyholder in connection with the sale or financing of a life insurance policy to the effect that the insurance is free or without cost to the policyholder for any period of time unless provided in the policy.81 Del. Laws, c. 172,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n7513. Advertising for viatical settlements.(a) The purpose of this section is to provide prospective viators with clear and unambiguous statements in the advertisement of viatical settlements and to assure the clear, truthful, and adequate disclosure of the benefits, risks, limitations, and exclusions of any viatical settlement contract bought or sold. This purpose is intended to be accomplished by the establishment of guidelines and standards of permissible and impermissible conduct in the advertising of viatical settlements to assure that product descriptions are presented in a manner that prevents unfair, deceptive, or misleading advertising and is conducive to accurate presentation and description of viatical settlements through the advertising media and material used by viatical settlement licensees.(b) This section applies to any advertising of viatical settlement contracts or related products or services intended for dissemination in this State, including internet advertising viewed by persons located in this State. Where disclosure requirements are established pursuant to federal regulation, this section must be interpreted so as to minimize or eliminate conflict with federal regulation wherever possible.(c) Every viatical settlement licensee shall establish and at all times maintain a system of control over the content, form and method of dissemination of all advertisements of its contracts, products, and services. All advertisements, regardless of by whom written, created, designed, or presented, are the responsibility of the viatical settlement licensees, as well as the individual who created or presented the advertisement. A system of control must include regular routine notification, at least once a year, to agents and others authorized by the viatical settlement licensee who disseminate advertisements of the requirements and procedures for approval prior to the use of any advertisements not furnished by the viatical settlement licensee.(d) Advertisements must be truthful and not misleading in fact or by implication. The form and content of an advertisement of a viatical settlement contract or product or service must be sufficiently complete and clear so as to avoid deception. The advertisement must not have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive. Whether an advertisement has the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive must be determined by the Commissioner from the overall impression that the advertisement may be reasonably expected to create upon a person of average education or intelligence within the segment of the public to which it is directed.(e) Certain viatical settlement advertisements are deemed false and misleading on their face and are prohibited. Those advertisements include the following representations:(1) “Guaranteed,” “fully secured,” “100 percent secured,” “fully insured,” “secure,” “safe,” “backed by rated insurance companies,” “backed by federal law,” “backed by state law,” or “state guaranty funds,” or similar representations.(2) “No risk,” “minimal risk,” “low risk,” “no speculation,” “no fluctuation,” or similar representations.(3) “Qualified or approved for individual retirement accounts (IRAs), Roth IRAs, 401(k) plans, simplified employee pensions (SEP), 403(b), Keogh plans, TSA, other retirement account rollovers,” “tax deferred,” or similar representations.(4) Utilization of the word “guaranteed” to describe the fixed return, annual return, principal, earnings, profits, investment, or similar representations.(5) “No sales charges or fees” or similar representations.(6) “High yield,” “superior return,” “excellent return,” “high return,” “quick profit,” or similar representations.(7) Purported favorable representations or testimonials about the benefits of viatical settlement contracts as an investment, taken out of context from newspapers, trade papers, journals, radio and television programs, and all other forms of print and electronic media.(f) The information required to be disclosed under this section may not be minimized, rendered obscure, or presented in an ambiguous fashion or intermingled with the text of the advertisement so as to be confusing or misleading.(1) An advertisement may not omit material information or use words, phrases, statements, references, or illustrations if the omission or use has the capacity, tendency, or effect of misleading or deceiving viators as to the nature or extent of any benefit, loss covered, premium payable, or state or federal tax consequence. The fact that the viatical settlement contract offered is made available for inspection prior to consummation of the sale, or an offer is made to refund the payment if the viator is not satisfied or that the viatical settlement contract includes a “free look” period that satisfies or exceeds legal requirements, does not remedy misleading statements.(2) An advertisement may not use the name or title of a life insurance company or a life insurance policy unless the advertisement has been approved by the insurer.(3) An advertisement may not represent that premium payments will not be required to be paid on the life insurance policy that is the subject of a viatical settlement contract in order to maintain that policy, unless that is the fact.(4) An advertisement may not state or imply that interest charged on an accelerated death benefit or a policy loan is unfair, inequitable, or in any manner an incorrect or improper practice.(5) The words “free,” “no cost,” “without cost,” “no additional cost,” “at no extra cost,” or words of similar import may not be used with respect to any benefit or service unless true. An advertisement may specify the charge for a benefit or a service or may state that a charge is included in the payment or use other appropriate language.(6) Testimonials, appraisals, or analyses used in advertisements must be genuine; represent the current opinion of the author; be applicable to the viatical settlement contract, product or service advertised, if any; and be accurately reproduced with sufficient completeness to avoid misleading or deceiving prospective viators as to the nature or scope of the testimonials, appraisal, analysis, or endorsement. In using testimonials, appraisals, or analysis, a licensee under this Act makes as its own all the statements contained therein, and the statements are subject to all the provisions of this section.a. If the individual making a testimonial, appraisal, analysis or an endorsement has a financial interest in the party making use of the testimonial, appraisal, analysis, or endorsement, either directly or through a related entity as a stockholder, director, officer, employee or otherwise, or receives any benefit directly or indirectly other than required union scale wages, that fact must be prominently disclosed in the advertisement.b. An advertisement may not state or imply that a viatical settlement contract, benefit, or service has been approved or endorsed by a group of individuals, society, association, or other organization unless that is the fact and unless any relationship between an organization and the viatical settlement licensee is disclosed. If the entity making the endorsement or testimonial is owned, controlled, or managed by the viatical settlement licensee, or receives any payment or other consideration from the viatical settlement licensee for making an endorsement or testimonial, that fact must be disclosed in the advertisement.c. When an endorsement refers to benefits received under a viatical settlement contract, all pertinent information must be retained for a period of 5 years after its use.(g) An advertisement may not contain statistical information unless it accurately reflects recent and relevant facts. The source of all statistics used in an advertisement must be identified.(h) An advertisement may not disparage insurers, viatical settlement providers, viatical settlement brokers, insurance producers, policies, services, or methods of marketing.(i) The name of the viatical settlement licensee must be clearly identified in all advertisements about the licensee or its viatical settlement contract, products or services, and if any specific viatical settlement contract is advertised, the viatical settlement contract must be identified either by form number or some other appropriate description. If an application is part of the advertisement, the name of the viatical settlement provider must be shown on the application.(j) An advertisement may not use a trade name, group designation, name of the parent company of a viatical settlement licensee, name of a particular division of the viatical settlement licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device or reference without disclosing the name of the viatical settlement licensee, if the advertisement would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the viatical settlement licensee, or to create the impression that a company other than the viatical settlement licensee would have any responsibility for the financial obligation under a viatical settlement contract.(k) An advertisement may not use any combination of words, symbols, or physical materials that by their content, phraseology, shape, color, or other characteristics are so similar to a combination of words, symbols, or physical materials used by a government program or agency or otherwise appear to be of such a nature that they tend to mislead prospective viators into believing that the solicitation is in some manner connected with a government program or agency.(l) An advertisement may state that a viatical settlement licensee is licensed in the state where the advertisement appears, if it does not exaggerate that fact or suggest or imply that competing viatical settlement licensee may not be so licensed. The advertisement may ask the audience to consult the licensee’s web site or contact the Department of Insurance to find out if the state requires licensing and, if so, whether the viatical settlement provider, viatical settlement broker is licensed.(m) An advertisement may not create the impression that the viatical settlement provider, its financial condition or status, the payment of its claims or the merits, desirability, or advisability of its viatical settlement contracts forms are recommended or endorsed by any government entity.(n) The name of the actual licensee must be stated in all of its advertisements. An advertisement may not use a trade name, any group designation, name of any affiliate or controlling entity of the licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device in a manner that would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the actual licensee or create the false impression that an affiliate or controlling entity would have any responsibility for the financial obligation of the licensee.(o) An advertisement may not directly or indirectly create the impression that any division or agency of the State or of the United States government endorses, approves, or favors any of the following:(1) Any viatical settlement licensee or its business practices or methods of operation.(2) The merits, desirability or advisability of any viatical settlement contract.(3) Any viatical settlement contract.(4) Any life insurance policy or life insurance company.(p) If the advertiser emphasizes the speed with which the viatication will occur, the advertising must disclose the average time frame from completed application to the date of offer and from acceptance of the offer to receipt of the funds by the viator.(q) If the advertising emphasizes the dollar amounts available to viators, the advertising must disclose the average purchase price as a percent of face value obtained by viators contracting with the licensee during the past 6 months.81 Del.
