      "text": "§\n\n1;§\n\n8502. Purpose and scope.(a) The purpose of this chapter is to:(1) Provide the Commissioner a summary of an insurer or insurance group’s corporate governance structure, policies and practices to permit the Commissioner to gain and maintain an understanding of the insurer’s corporate governance framework.(2) Outline the requirements for completing a corporate governance annual disclosure with the Commissioner.(3) Provide for the confidential treatment of the corporate governance annual disclosure and related information that will contain confidential and sensitive information related to an insurer or insurance group’s internal operations and proprietary and trade secret information which, if made public, could potentially cause the insurer or insurance group competitive harm or disadvantage.(b) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prescribe or impose corporate governance standards and internal procedures beyond that which is required under applicable state corporate law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the Commissioner’s authority, or the rights or obligations of third parties, under § 318 through § 321 of this title.(c) The requirements of this chapter shall apply to all insurers domiciled in this State.81 Del. Laws, c. 119,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n8503. Definitions.As used in this chapter, unless the context requires otherwise:(1)“Commissioner.” —The term “Commissioner” shall mean the Insurance Commissioner of this State.(2)“Corporate governance annual disclosure” or “CGAD.” —The term “corporate governance annual disclosure” or “CGAD” shall mean a confidential report filed by the insurer or insurance group made in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.(3)“Insurance group.” —For purposes of this chapter, the term “insurance group” shall mean those insurers and affiliates included within an insurance holding company system as defined in Chapter 50 of this title.(4)“Insurer.” —The term “insurer” shall have the same meaning as set forth in § 102(10) of this title, except that it shall not include agencies, authorities or instrumentalities of the United States, its possessions and territories, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, or a state or political subdivision of a state.(5)“NAIC.” —The term “NAIC” shall mean the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.81 Del. Laws, c. 119,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n8504. Disclosure requirement.(a) An insurer, or the insurance group of which the insurer is a member, shall, no later than June 1 of each calendar year, submit to the Commissioner a Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure (CGAD) that contains the information described in § 8506(b) of this title. Notwithstanding any request from the Commissioner made pursuant to subsection (c) of this section below, if the insurer is a member of an insurance group, the insurer shall submit the report required in this section to the Commissioner of the lead state for the insurance group, in accordance with the laws of the lead state, as determined by the procedures outlined in the most recent Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by the NAIC.(b) The CGAD must include a signature of the insurer or insurance group’s chief executive officer or corporate secretary attesting to the best of that individual’s belief and knowledge that the insurer has implemented the corporate governance practices and that a copy of the disclosure has been provided to the insurer’s board of directors or the appropriate committee thereof.(c) An insurer not required to submit a CGAD under this section shall do so upon the Commissioner’s request.(d) For purposes of completing the CGAD, the insurer or insurance group may provide information regarding corporate governance at the ultimate controlling parent level, an intermediate holding company level or the individual legal entity level, depending upon how the insurer or insurance group has structured its system of corporate governance. The insurer or insurance group is encouraged to make the CGAD disclosures at the level at which the insurer’s or insurance group’s risk appetite is determined, or at which the earnings, capital, liquidity, operations, and reputation of the insurer are overseen collectively and at which the supervision of those factors are coordinated and exercised, or the level at which legal liability for failure of general corporate governance duties would be placed. If the insurer or insurance group determines the level of reporting based on these criteria, it shall indicate which of the 3 criteria was used to determine the level of reporting and explain any subsequent changes in level of reporting.(e) The review of the CGAD and any additional requests for information shall be made through the lead state as determined by the procedures within the most recent Financial Analysis Handbook referenced in subsection (a) of this section.(f) Insurers providing information substantially similar to the information required by this chapter in other documents provided to the Commissioner, including proxy statements filed in conjunction with Form B requirements, or other state or federal filings provided to this Department shall not be required to duplicate that information in the CGAD, but shall only be required to cross reference the document in which the information is included.81 Del. Laws, c. 119,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n8505. Rules and regulations.The Commissioner may, upon notice and an opportunity for all interested parties to be heard, issue such rules, regulations and orders as shall be necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.81 Del. Laws, c. 119,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n8506. Contents of corporate governance annual disclosure.(a) The insurer or insurance group shall have discretion over the responses to the CGAD inquiries, provided the CGAD shall contain the material information necessary to permit the Commissioner to gain an understanding of the insurer’s or group’s corporate governance structure, policies and practices. The Commissioner may request additional information that he or she deems material and necessary to provide the Commissioner with a clear understanding of the corporate governance policies, the reporting or information system or controls implementing those policies.(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section above, the CGAD shall be prepared consistent with the Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Regulation to be promulgated by the Commissioner. Documentation and supporting information shall be maintained and made available upon examination by or upon request of the Commissioner.81 Del. Laws, c. 119,\n\n§\n\n1;70 Del.
