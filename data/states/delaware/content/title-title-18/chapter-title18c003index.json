Such regulations shall contain the following provisions:(1) Requests for arbitration shall be in writing and mailed to the Commissioner within 60 days of the receipt of the written statement referred to in paragraph (c)(7) of this section.(2) Arbitrators shall be chosen from an appropriate panel of arbitrators, and hearings shall be conducted according to rules established by the Department of Insurance.(3) The arbitrator shall review written arbitration requests prior to holding any hearing or allowing any exchange of information between the parties in order to determine whether a written arbitration request is meritless on its face, and may summarily dismiss meritless requests for arbitration.(4) Neither party shall be held to have waived any of its rights to seek relief in a court of law with respect to a covered person’s legal rights to benefits by an act relating to arbitration or the rendering of an arbitration decision.(5) Arbitration decisions shall be rendered within 45 days of the Commissioner’s receipt of an arbitration request.(f) The Insurance Commissioner shall establish a schedule of fees for arbitration. Fees chargeable to covered persons shall not exceed $75 per arbitration. The carrier shall be responsible for all costs of arbitration which exceed this fee regardless of the final ruling, and shall reimburse the Commissioner for the expenses related to the arbitration process.

Should the decision favor the covered person, the carrier shall have the right to appeal the matter to the court, in accordance with court rules. The outcome of that appeal, however, shall have no effect on the covered person, as to whom the decision of the arbitrator shall control. The assignment of counsel for an appeal by the carrier and the payment of expenses of that assigned counsel shall be as set forth in § 6416(b) of this title.(h) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect policies or contracts to the extent that those policies or contracts are exempt from state regulation under federal law or regulation, nor shall anything in this section be read to restrict any affirmative rights granted to patients or insureds under any other provision of the Delaware Code or the common law of the State.(i) Notwithstanding any other language in the Delaware Code, the Department of Health and Social Services shall have the authority to carry out all duties assigned to it by this section.70 Del.
