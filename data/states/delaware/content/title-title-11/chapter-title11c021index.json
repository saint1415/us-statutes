The defendant’s character, physical and mental condition, including engagement in medical, mental health, or substance abuse treatment, and the effect detention would have on any current treatment.e. The defendant’s record of convictions.f. The defendant’s possibility of statutory mandatory imprisonment or habitual criminal offender eligibility.g. The defendant’s custody status at the time of the offense.(6) If a court imposes monetary bail for any reason, the court shall set forth on the record:a. The monetary amounts set.b. The reason for the use of monetary bail.c. Any consideration the court gave to the defendant’s means to meet the monetary condition.d. The reasons that no condition or combination of nonmonetary conditions of release would reasonably assure the defendant’s appearance at court proceedings, reasonably assure the protection of the community, victims, witnesses, or any other person, and reasonably maintain the integrity of the judicial process, such that the defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct justice.(7) A defendant who cannot post monetary bail is eligible for review of the defendant’s conditions of release under § 2110(a) of this title.(b) In a pretrial release order, the court shall include a written statement that does all of the following:(1) Sets forth all of the conditions to which the release is subject in a manner sufficiently clear and specific to serve as a guide for the defendant’s conduct.(2) Advises the defendant of the potential consequences of violating a condition of release, including the possible issuance of a warrant for the defendant’s arrest and any applicable criminal penalties.(3) Advises the defendant that the defendant would be eligible for temporary preventive detention pending a pretrial hearing if the defendant is arrested while pending trial on the current offense.(c) An order setting conditions of release is reviewable in accordance with the rules of the court then exercising jurisdiction in the matter.11 Del.

The defendant’s eligibility to be sentenced under § 4214 of this title.(2) Although the charged offense itself may be a predicate to preventive detention proceedings, the court must exercise care not to give preclusive weight to the nature of the present charged offense when evaluating all relevant factors for the preventive detention decision.(h)Contents of preventive detention order. —In a preventive detention order issued following a hearing under subsection (e) of this section, the court shall make all of the following findings:(1) Findings of fact that establish proof positive or presumption great that the defendant committed 1 of the offenses under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.(2) Findings of fact that establish clear and convincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions of release will do all of the following:a.

If the defendant is not indicted or has not waived indictment within 60 days of entry of a temporary preventive detention order issued under subsection (d) of this section or a preventive detention order issued under subsection (e) of this section, whichever is later, the offense with which the defendant is charged is deemed bailable and the court shall determine, in a manner consistent with all applicable provisions of this chapter, the terms of a conditions of release bond to be imposed.(2) a. A defendant may not remain detained under an order issued under subsection (e) of this section for more than the following periods on a charged offense after the return or unsealing of the indictment, whichever is later:1. Three hundred sixty-five days on a charge of murder in the first degree, in violation of § 636 of this title.2. Two hundred seventy days for a class A felony other than murder in the first degree.3. One hundred eighty days for all other felony offenses under paragraph (b)(1) of this title other than murder in the first degree or another class A felony.b. If a defendant’s trial does not commence within the applicable period under paragraph (j)(2)a. of this section, the offense with which the defendant is charged is deemed bailable and the court shall determine, in a manner consistent with all applicable provisions of this chapter, the terms of a conditions of release bond to be imposed.(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a defendant must be released on a conditions of release bond if, 2 years after the court’s issuance of the preventive detention order issued under subsection (e) of this section, the Attorney General is not ready to proceed to voir dire, opening argument, or a hearing of any motions that had been reserved for the time of trial.
