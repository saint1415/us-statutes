The right of the exclusive representative shall not apply where the complaint involves matters of personal, embarrassing and confidential nature, and the complainant specifically requests, in writing, that the exclusive representative not be present.(c) The public employer shall deduct from the payroll of the public employee the monthly amount of dues or service fee as certified by the secretary of the exclusive bargaining representative and shall deliver the same to the treasurer of the exclusive bargaining representative as follows:(1) In compliance with § 1319 of this title.(2) If the collective bargaining agreement does not contain a provision enforceable under § 1319 of this title, upon the written authorization of any public employee within a bargaining unit.

Disposition of complaints.(a) The Board is empowered and directed to prevent any unfair labor practice described in § 1307(a) and (b) of this title and to issue appropriate remedial orders. Whenever it is charged that anyone has engaged or is engaging in any unfair practice as described in § 1307(a) and (b) of this title, the Board or any designated agent thereof shall have authority to issue and cause to be served upon such party a complaint stating the specific unfair practice charge and including a notice of hearing containing the date and place of hearing before the Board or any designated agent thereof. Evidence shall be taken and filed with the Board; provided, that no complaint shall issue based on any unfair labor practice occurring more than 180 days prior to the filing of the charge with the Board.(b) (1) If, upon all the evidence taken, the Board shall determine that any party charged has engaged or is engaging in any such unfair practice, the Board shall state its findings of fact and conclusions of law and issue and cause to be served on such party an order requiring such party to cease and desist from such unfair practice, and to take such reasonable affirmative action as will effectuate the policies of this chapter, such as payment of damages and/or the reinstatement of an employee; provided however, that the Board shall not issue:a.

Bargaining unit determination.(a) An employee organization desiring to be certified as the exclusive representative shall file a petition with the Board, accompanied by the uncoerced signatures of at least 30% of the public employees in the unit claimed to be appropriate, indicating a desire to be represented for the purpose of bargaining collectively with the public employer.(b) If the Board or its duly authorized designee determines that a petition is properly filed and is accompanied by the requisite number of valid signatures, the Board or its designee shall proceed toward defining the appropriate bargaining unit by setting a date for hearing on the matter. If a petition is not properly filed or if it is not accompanied by the requisite number of valid signatures, the Board or its designee shall dismiss the petition.(c) After holding such hearings as it deems necessary the Board shall determine the appropriate bargaining unit. The Board may, by rule, delegate its unit definition authority to 1 or more of its members or to its executive director, provided that a unit definition order may be subject to review by the Board at the request of any party or upon the Board’s own motion in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Board.(d) In making its determination as to the appropriate bargaining unit, the Board or its designee shall consider community of interests including such factors as the similarity of duties, skills and working conditions of the employees involved; the history and extent of the employee organization; the recommendations of the parties involved; the effect of overfragmentation of bargaining units on the efficient administration of government; and such other factors as the Board may deem appropriate. The Board or its designee shall exclude supervisory employees from all appropriate units created subsequent to September 23, 1994.(e) Procedures for redefining or modifying a unit shall be set forth in the rules and procedures established by the Board.(f) Any bargaining unit designated as appropriate prior to September 23, 1994, for which an exclusive representative has been certified, shall so continue without the requirement of a review and possible redesignation until such time as a question concerning appropriateness is properly raised under this chapter. The appropriateness of the unit may be challenged by the public employer, 30% of the members of the unit, an employee organization, or the Board not more than 180 days nor less than 120 days prior to the expiration of any collective bargaining agreement in effect on September 23, 1994. The continued appropriateness of any bargaining unit designated as appropriate prior to September 23, 1994, for which an exclusive representative is not certified, may be challenged by the public employer, 30% of the members of the unit, an employee organization, or the Board at any time up until 30 days prior to the holding of an election to determine representation.(g) (1) Two or more certified exclusive representatives of the same public employer may file a joint petition to transfer certain positions between their units. Said joint petition shall be accompanied by the uncoerced signatures of at least 30% of the public employees in the positions sought to be transferred, indicating a desire to be represented by the proposed new representative for the purpose of collective bargaining.(2) The Board shall make a determination as to the appropriateness of the bargaining unit into which the public employees are to be transferred. If the Board determines that the bargaining unit into which the employees are to be transferred is not appropriate, the joint petition shall be denied and the status quo ante shall remain. If the Board determines that the bargaining unit is appropriate, the Board shall hold an election on such joint petition to transfer in which only the public employees in each position who would be transferred shall be entitled to vote. The election ballot shall contain 2 options:a. Continue to be represented by the present exclusive bargaining representative; orb. Transfer to the proposed exclusive bargaining representative, who shall be named.(3) The exclusive bargaining representative that receives the majority of the votes of those voting in the elections shall be declared the exclusive bargaining representative for those positions.19 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1304;55 Del. Laws, c. 126;69 Del. Laws, c. 466,\n\n§\n\n 1;71 Del. Laws, c. 164,\n\n§\n\n 1;85 Del. Laws, c. 193,\n\n§\n\n2;§\n\n1311. Determination and certification of exclusive representative.(a) Any employee organization seeking certification as exclusive representative in a designated appropriate bargaining unit shall file a petition with the Board. The petition must contain the uncoerced signatures of at least 30% of the employees within the designated appropriate bargaining unit. If the designated appropriate bargaining unit is sufficiently similar to the bargaining unit claimed to be appropriate in the petition filed pursuant to § 1310(a) of this title, such that the signatures submitted at that time represent 30% of the employees within the designated appropriate bargaining unit, those signatures shall be deemed sufficient for the purpose of this subsection. If the designated bargaining unit is not sufficiently similar to the bargaining unit claimed to be appropriate, the employee organization may continue to rely on the previously submitted uncoerced signatures of the employees who are in the designated bargaining unit and must supplement these signatures with uncoerced signatures of other employees within the designated appropriate bargaining unit, such that the signatures submitted represent at least 30% of the employees within the designated appropriate bargaining unit. No signature shall be considered valid if it was signed more than 12 months prior to the date on which the petition is filed.(b) Where an employee organization has been certified as the exclusive representative, a group of employees within the bargaining unit may file a petition with the Board for decertification of the exclusive bargaining representative. The petition must contain the uncoerced signatures of at least 30% of the employees within the bargaining unit and allege that the employee organization presently certified is no longer the choice of the majority of the employees in the bargaining unit. If a lawful collective bargaining agreement of no more than 3 years’ duration is in effect, no petition shall be entertained unless filed not more than 180 days nor less than 120 days prior to the expiration of such agreement. A decertification petition also may be filed if more than 1 year has elapsed from the date of certification of an exclusive bargaining representative and no collective bargaining agreement has been executed, and the procedures for mediation and fact-finding have been invoked and completed as provided in this chapter.(c) If the Board determines that a petition is properly supported, timely filed and covers the designated appropriate bargaining unit, the Board shall cause an election of all eligible employees to be held within a reasonable time after the unit determination has been made, in accordance with procedures adopted by the Board, to determine if and by whom the employees wish to be represented. The election ballot shall contain, as choices to be made by the voter, the name of the petitioning employee organization and the certified employee organization, the name or names of any other employee organization showing written proof of at least 10% representation of the public employees within the designated appropriate bargaining unit, in accordance with rules and procedures adopted by the Board, and a choice that the public employee does not desire to be represented by any of the named employee organizations.(d) The employee organization, if any, which receives the majority of the votes cast in an election shall be certified by the Board as the exclusive representative. In any election where there are more than 2 choices on the ballot and none of the choices receives a majority of the votes cast, a run-off election shall be conducted. The ballot in the run-off election shall contain the 2 choices on the original ballot that received the largest number of votes.(e) No election shall be held pursuant to this section within 12 months from the date of a preceding valid election.19 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§§\n\n 1304-1307;55 Del. Laws, c. 126;65 Del. Laws, c. 499,\n\n§\n\n 1;69 Del. Laws, c. 466,\n\n§\n\n 1;85 Del. Laws, c. 193,\n\n§\n\n2;§\n\n1311A. Collective bargaining in the state service.(a) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Code, exclusive representatives of the state merit employees, who are in the classified service and not working in higher education, shall collectively bargain in the units as determined pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. The scope of bargaining shall include:(1) Compensation, which shall be defined as the payment of money in the form of hourly or annual salary, and any cash allowance or items in lieu of a cash allowance to a public employee by reason of said employee’s employment by a public employer, as defined in this chapter, whether the amount is fixed or determined by time, task, or other basis of calculations. Position classification, health care and other benefit programs established pursuant to Chapters 52 and 96 of Title 29, workers compensation, disability programs, and pension programs shall not be deemed to be compensation for purposes of this section; and(2) Any items negotiable for state merit employees pursuant to § 5938 of Title 29.(b) Each exclusive representative shall bargain for compensation for the members of its exclusive bargaining unit or units in a mutually agreed upon consolidated manner. The exclusive representative shall work with the Secretary of the Department of Human Resources to determine how its exclusive bargaining unit or units shall be consolidated. If the exclusive representative and the Secretary of the Department of Human Resources are unable to reach an agreement regarding the manner in which to consolidate the bargaining unit or units, negotiations will default to the individual bargaining units as certified by the Public Employment Relations Board.(c) To the extent a finalized agreement on compensation items requires legislative approval or the appropriation of funds, the Governor shall recommend the same to the General Assembly for the ensuing fiscal years and the agreement provision requiring such appropriation shall be contingent on the specific appropriation of funds by the General Assembly. In the event the General Assembly fails to appropriate the funds necessary to implement the provision of an agreement, that provision shall be returned to the parties for negotiation or the provision may be implemented to the extent consistent with or limited by appropriations from the General Assembly, at the discretion of the General Assembly. Contracts shall be timed to become effective in accordance with the State’s fiscal year.(d) The parties may engage in collective bargaining for compensation simultaneously or separately from collective bargaining for terms and conditions.(e) The negotiation of collective bargaining agreements shall be staggered over a period of time. Such schedule shall be determined by mutual agreement of the Secretary of Human Resources and the exclusive representative of all bargaining units prior to March 1, 2020. Existing collective bargaining agreements regarding compensation will remain in effect until such time as they, by their terms, expire. The grouping of bargaining units in a consolidated manner as contemplated in subsection (b) of this section, above, shall be determined in advance of the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements existing as of May 30, 2019, that were originally authorized through 76 Del Laws c. 178.(f) Exclusive bargaining representatives may bargain for different pay rate increases for their individual bargaining units, provided, however, that the compensation for any given bargaining unit or units may not exceed the pay ranges for the respective pay grades, as established in the annual appropriations act.(g) [Repealed.]76 Del. Laws, c. 178,\n\n§\n\n 1;77 Del. Laws, c. 347,\n\n§§\n\n 1, 2;80 Del. Laws, c. 352,\n\n§\n\n1;81 Del. Laws, c. 124,\n\n§\n\n1;82 Del. Laws, c. 26,\n\n§\n\n2;§\n\n1311B. Majority verification procedure.(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an employee organization may file a petition with the Board requesting certification as the exclusive representative of an appropriate bargaining unit based on a verification that over 50% of the employees in the proposed appropriate bargaining unit wish to be represented by the petitioner. The Board shall require dated representation authorization signatures of affected employees as verification of the employee organization’s claim of status.(b) Upon receipt of an employee organization’s petition, accompanied by employee authorization signatures under this section, the Board shall investigate the petition. If the Board determines that over 50% of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit have provided authorization signatures designating the employee organization specified in the petition as their exclusive representative, the Board may not order an election but shall certify the employee organization.85 Del. Laws, c. 193,\n\n§\n\n2;§\n\n1312. Employee organizations required to register and submit annual reports.Every employee organization which has or seeks recognition as a representative of public employees under this chapter shall file with the Board a registration report, signed by its president or other designated officer. Such report shall be updated on an annual basis by any organization which continues to have or seeks recognition, shall be in a form prescribed by the Board and shall be accompanied by 2 copies of the employee organization’s constitution and bylaws. All changes or amendments to such constitutions and bylaws shall be promptly reported to the Board.69 Del. Laws, c. 466,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1313. Collective bargaining agreements.(a) Collective bargaining shall commence at least 90 days prior to the expiration date of any current collective bargaining agreement or in the case of a newly certified exclusive representative within a reasonable time after certification.(b) Negotiating sessions including strategy meetings of public employers, mediation and the deliberative process of binding interest arbitrators shall be exempt from Chapter 100 of Title 29. Hearings conducted by binding interest arbitrators shall be open to the public.(c) The public employer and the exclusive bargaining representative shall negotiate written grievance procedures by means of which bargaining unit employees, through their collective bargaining representatives, may appeal the interpretation or application of any term or terms of an existing collective bargaining agreement; such grievance procedures shall be included in any agreement entered into between the public employer and the exclusive bargaining representative.(d) Any contract or agreement reached between a public employer and any exclusive representative organization shall be for a minimum period of 2 years from the effective date of such contract or agreement unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the public employer and the exclusive representative.(e) No collective bargaining agreement shall be valid or enforceable if its implementation would be inconsistent with any statutory limitation on the public employer’s funds, spending or budget, or would otherwise be contrary to law.(f) Public employers shall file with the Board a copy of any agreements that have been negotiated with public employee representatives following the consummation of negotiations. The Board shall maintain a current file of all such agreements.69 Del. Laws, c. 466,\n\n§\n\n 1;72 Del. Laws, c. 272,\n\n§§\n\n 2, 7;74 Del. Laws, c. 173,\n\n§\n\n 2;§\n\n1314. Mediation.(a) If, after a reasonable period of negotiations over the terms of an agreement or after a reasonable time following certification of an exclusive representative, no agreement has been signed, the parties may voluntarily submit to mediation. If, however, no agreement is reached between the parties by 90 days prior to the expiration of an existing collective bargaining agreement, or, in the case of a compensation bargaining unit of nonhigher education state employees at least 120 days prior to the expiration date of an existing collective bargaining agreement or in the case of a newly certified representative within 60 days after negotiations have commenced, both parties shall immediately notify the Board of the status of negotiations.(b) If the parties have not voluntarily agreed to enlist the services of a mediator and less than 75 days remain before the expiration of an existing collective bargaining agreement, or, in the case of a compensation bargaining unit of nonhigher education state employees at least 90 days prior to the expiration date of an existing collective bargaining agreement or in the case of a newly certified representative more than 90 days have elapsed since negotiations began, the Board must appoint a mediator if so requested by the public employer or the exclusive bargaining representative. The mediator shall be chosen from a list of qualified persons maintained by the Board upon mutual agreement of the parties or from the American Arbitration Association, and shall be representative of the public.(c) If the labor dispute has not been settled within 30 days after mediation has been requested or less than 60 days remain before the expiration of an existing collective bargaining agreement, the parties jointly or individually may petition the Board in writing to initiate binding arbitration. In lieu of a petition, the mediator may inform the Board that further negotiations between the parties, at that time, are unlikely to be productive and recommend that binding arbitration be initiated. The public employer and the exclusive bargaining representative may initiate binding arbitration at any time by mutual agreement. The arbitrator shall be chosen from a list of qualified persons maintained by the Board upon mutual agreement of the parties or from the American Arbitration Association, and shall be representative of the public.(d) Any costs involved in retaining a mediator to assist the parties in reaching a negotiated agreement shall be paid by the Board.69 Del. Laws, c. 466,\n\n§\n\n 1;72 Del. Laws, c. 272,\n\n§§\n\n 3, 7;74 Del. Laws, c. 173,\n\n§\n\n 2;76 Del. Laws, c. 178,\n\n§\n\n 3;§\n\n1315. Binding interest arbitration.(a) Within 7 working days of receipt of a petition or recommendation to initiate binding arbitration, the Board shall make a determination, with or without a formal hearing, as to whether a good faith effort has been made by both parties to resolve their labor dispute through negotiations and mediation and shall certify the parties at impasse and authorize the initiation of binding arbitration procedures except that any discretionary subject shall not be subject to binding arbitration.(b) Pursuant to § 4006(f) of Title 14, the Board shall appoint the Executive Director or the Executive Director’s designee to act as binding interest arbitrator subject to agreement of the parties. Such delegation shall not limit a party’s right to appeal to the Board. If the parties do not agree to use the Executive Director as the binding interest arbitrator the parties shall select an arbitrator by mutual agreement. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, either party may request a list of 9 arbitrators from the American Arbitration Association. One arbitrator shall be chosen by the parties by alternately striking names from such list. Who strikes first shall be determined by coin toss. Nothing herein shall prevent the parties from mutually agreeing to alternative methods to achieve a final and binding resolution of any impasse.(c) The arbitrator shall hold hearings in order to define the area or areas of dispute, to determine facts relating to the dispute, and to render a decision on unresolved contract issues. The hearings shall be held at times, dates and places to be established by the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall be empowered to administer oaths and issue subpoenas on behalf of the parties to the dispute or on the arbitrator’s own behalf.(d) The arbitrator shall make written findings of facts and a decision for the resolution of the dispute; provided, however, that the decision shall be limited to a determination of which of the parties’ last, best, final offers shall be accepted in its entirety. In arriving at a determination, the arbitrator shall specify the basis for the arbitrator’s findings, taking into consideration, in addition to any other relevant factors, the following:(1) The interests and welfare of the public.(2) Comparison of the wages, salaries, benefits, hours and conditions of employment of the employees involved in the arbitration proceedings with the wages, salaries, benefits, hours and conditions of employment of other employees performing the same or similar services or requiring similar skills under similar working conditions in the same community and in comparable communities and with other employees generally in the same community and in comparable communities.(3) The overall compensation presently received by the employees inclusive of direct wages, salary, vacations, holidays, excused leaves, insurance and pensions, medical and hospitalization benefits, the continuity and stability of employment, and all other benefits received.(4) Stipulations of the parties.(5) The lawful authority of the public employer.(6) The financial ability of the public employer, based on existing revenues, to meet the costs of any proposed settlements; provided that any enhancement to such financial ability derived from savings experienced by such public employer as a result of a strike shall not be considered by the arbitrator.(7) Such other factors not confined to the foregoing which are normally or traditionally taken into consideration in the determination of wages, hours and conditions of employment through voluntary collective bargaining, mediation, binding arbitration or otherwise between parties, in the public service or in private employment.In making determinations, the arbitrator shall give due weight to each relevant factor. All of the above factors shall be presumed relevant. If any factor is found not to be relevant, the arbitrator shall detail in the arbitrator’s findings the specific reason why that factor is not judged relevant in arriving at the arbitrator’s determination. With the exception of paragraph (d)(6) of this section, no single factor in this subsection, shall be dispositive.(e) Within 30 days after the conclusion of the hearings but not later than 120 days from the day of appointment, the arbitrator shall serve the arbitrator’s written determination for resolution of the dispute on the public employer, the certified exclusive representative and the Board. The decision of the arbitrator shall become an order of the Board within 5 business days after it has been served on the parties.(f) The cost of binding arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties involved in the dispute.(g) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit or otherwise impede a public employer and certified exclusive representative from continuing to bargain in good faith over terms and conditions of employment or from using the services of a mediator at any time during the conduct of collective bargaining. If at any point in the impasse proceedings invoked under this chapter, the parties are able to conclude their labor dispute with a voluntarily reached agreement, the Board shall be so notified, and all impasse resolution proceedings shall be forthwith terminated.(h) Notwithstanding any language to the contrary, any arbitration results rendered pursuant to this section involving collective bargaining agreements, negotiations or mediations with the State involving § 1311A of this title, shall be contingent upon appropriation by the General Assembly.69 Del. Laws, c. 466,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;72 Del. Laws, c. 272,\n\n§§\n\n 4, 7;74 Del. Laws, c. 173,\n\n§\n\n 2;76 Del. Laws, c. 178,\n\n§\n\n 4;§\n\n1316. Strikes prohibited.(a) No public employee shall strike while in the performance of official duties.(b) No public employee shall be entitled to any daily pay, wages, reimbursement of expenses, benefits or any consideration in lieu thereof, for the days on which the employee engaged in a strike.(c) Where a public employee has lost entitlement to any daily pay or other consideration pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, any agreement between such public employee or employee organization bargaining on the employee’s behalf and a public employer which provided for the direct or indirect restoration of such entitlement shall be void as against public policy.19 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1312;55 Del. Laws, c. 126;56 Del. Laws, c. 376,\n\n§\n\n 10;69 Del. Laws, c. 466,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1317. Injunctions.(a) Chancery Court is vested with the authority to hear and determine all actions alleging violations of § 1316 of this title. Suits to enjoin violations of § 1316 of this title will have priority over all matters on the Court’s docket except other emergency matters.(b) Where it appears that any public employee, group of employees, employee organizations or any officer or agent thereof, threaten or are about to do, or are doing, any act in violation of § 1316 of this title, the public employer may forthwith apply to the Court of Chancery for an injunction against such violation.(c) If an order of the Court enjoining or restraining a violation of § 1316 of this title does not receive immediate compliance, the public employer shall apply to the Court for appropriate contempt sanctions against any party in violation of such order. Upon a proper showing that any person or organization has failed to comply with such an order, the Court shall, in addition to any other remedy it deems appropriate, fine such violating party an amount on a daily, weekly or monthly basis without limitation as determined by the Court.(d) In determining an appropriate amount for fines imposed pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the Court shall consider and receive evidence of:(1) The extent and value of services lost due to the violation of § 1316 of this title.(2) Any unfair labor practices committed by either party during the collective bargaining process.(3) The extent of the wilful defiance or resistance to the Court’s order.(4) The impact of the strike on the health, safety and welfare of the public.69 Del. Laws, c. 466,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1318. Status of existing exclusive representative.An employee organization that has been certified as the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit deemed to be appropriate prior to September 23, 1994, shall so continue without the requirement of an election and certification until such time as a question concerning representation is appropriately raised under this chapter in accordance with § 1311(b) of this title, or until the Board finds the unit not to be appropriate in accordance with § 1310(f) of this title.69 Del. Laws, c. 466,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1319. Fair share fees.(a) Where the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement so provide, a public employer shall deduct a fair share fee from each nonmember’s salary or wages and promptly transmit this amount to the exclusive representative.(b) As a precondition to the collection of fair share fees, the exclusive representative shall establish and maintain a procedure that:(1) Provides nonmembers with an adequate explanation of the basis for the fee and any rebate;(2) Provides nonmembers with a reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee and any rebate before an impartial decision maker; and(3) Provides an escrow for the amounts reasonably in dispute while such challenges are pending.A public employer shall not refuse to carry out its obligations under subsection (a) of this section on the grounds that the exclusive representative has not satisfied its responsibilities under this subsection.(c) In order to avoid undue delays in the receipt of and determination of the validity of fair share fees or rebates, any suit challenging a fair share fee or rebate must be filed within 6 months after receipt of the notice described in subsection (b) of this section or within 6 months after the nonmember exhausts the procedure described in subsection (b) of this section, whichever is later.73 Del. Laws, c. 353,\n\n§\n\n 4;§\n\n1320. Bargaining unit information and access.(a) Within 14 calendar days from the date of hire of a bargaining unit employee, a public employer must provide the following contact information of the bargaining unit employee to an exclusive representative in a secure format agreed to by the exclusive representative: name; position; worksite location; employee identification number; home address; home and personal cell phone numbers on file with the public employer; date of hire; and work email address and personal email address on file with the public employer.(b) In January and October of each year, beginning in January 2026, a public employer must provide to an exclusive representative in a secure format agreed to by the exclusive representative the following information for all bargaining unit employees: name; position; worksite location; employee identification number; home address; home and personal cell phone numbers on file with the public employer; date of hire; and work email address and personal email address on file with the public employer.(c) A public employer must allow an exclusive representative to communicate with bargaining unit members using the members’ employer-issued email addresses regarding collective bargaining, the administration of collective bargaining agreements, the investigation of grievances, other workplace-related complaints and issues, and internal matters involving the governance or business of the exclusive representative, consistent with the employer’s generally applicable technology use policies.(d) A public employer must allow an exclusive representative to meet with bargaining unit members in facilities owned or leased by the public employer regarding collective bargaining, the administration of collective bargaining agreements, grievances and other workplace-related complaints and issues, and internal matters involving the governance or business of the exclusive representative, provided the use does not interfere with governmental operations. Meetings conducted in government buildings pursuant to this subsection must not be for the purpose of supporting or opposing any candidate for partisan political office or for the purpose of distributing literature or information regarding partisan elections. An exclusive representative conducting a meeting in a government building or other government facility pursuant to this subsection may be charged for maintenance, security, and other costs related to the use of the government building or facility that would not otherwise be incurred by the government entity.85 Del.
