Lawfulness of flight and landings.Flight in aircraft over the lands and waters of this State is lawful, unless at such a low altitude as to interfere with the then existing use to which the land or water, or the space over the land or water, is put by the owner, or unless so conducted as to be imminently dangerous to persons or property lawfully on the land or water beneath.No person shall land an aircraft on the lands or waters of another, without the owner’s consent, except in the case of a forced landing. For damages caused by a forced landing, however, the owner or lessee of the aircraft or the airperson shall be liable, as provided in § 305 of this title.33 Del.

If the aircraft is leased at the time of the injury to person or property, both owner and lessee shall be liable, and they may be sued jointly, or either or both of them may be sued separately. An airman who is not the owner or lessee shall be liable only for the consequences of the airman’s own negligence. The injured person, or owner or bailee of the injured property, shall have a lien on the aircraft causing the injury to the extent of the damage caused by the aircraft or objects falling from it.33 Del.
