Laws, c. 513,\n\n§\n\n 4;§\n\n5715. Execution of judgment; writ of possession.(a) Upon rendering a final judgment for plaintiff, but in no case prior to the expiration of the time for the filing of an appeal or motion to vacate or open the judgment, the court shall issue a writ of possession directed to the constable or the sheriff of the county in which the property is located, describing the property and commanding the officer to remove all persons and put the plaintiff into full possession.(b) The officer to whom the writ of possession is directed and delivered shall give at least 24 hours’ notice to the person or persons to be removed and shall execute it between the hours of sunrise and sunset.MANUFACTURED HOME. If the writ of possession being posted relates to the possession of a rented lot for manufactured housing, under Chapter 70 of this title, and, on or before the date the writ of possession is posted, the tenant has prepaid a per diem storage fee in an amount equivalent to 7 days’ rent, then the court, through its officers, may extend the notice period for the removal of the home from the lot, to a maximum period of 7 calendar days from the date of posting. In no event may the tenant inhabit the home after the first 24 hours of the notice period. If the per diem charge above described has been prepaid and the time for removal has been extended, then 7 calendar days after the posting of the writ, the manufactured home may be removed by the landlord. If the period for removal of the home has not been extended by a prepayment of the per diem amount for storage, then 24 hours after the posting of the writ, the home may be removed from the lot by the landlord. In either event, after removal, the home must be stored at the tenant’s expense for a period of 30 days before it can be disposed of through further legal action. The tenant may not remove the home from the storage location until the landlord has been reimbursed for any judgment amount and the reasonable cost of removal and storage of the manufactured home.(c) The plaintiff has the obligation to notify the constable to take the steps necessary to put the plaintiff in full possession.(d) The issuance of a writ of possession for the removal of a tenant cancels the agreement under which the person removed held the premises and annuls the relationship of landlord and tenant. Plaintiff may recover, by an action for summary possession, any sum of money which was payable at the time when the action for summary possession was commenced and the reasonable value of the use and occupation to the time when a writ of possession was issued and for any period of time with respect to which the agreement does not make any provision for payment of rent, including the time between the issuance of the writ and the landlord’s actual recovery of the premises.(e) If, at the time of the execution of the writ of possession, the tenant fails to remove tenant’s property, the landlord shall have the right to and may immediately remove and store such property for a period of 7 days, at tenant’s expense, unless the property is a manufactured home and the rental agreement is subject to Chapter 70 of this title, in which case the manufactured home must be stored for a period of 30 days. If, at the end of such period, the tenant has failed to claim said property and to reimburse the landlord for the expense of removal and storage in a reasonable amount, such property and possessions shall be deemed abandoned and may be disposed of by the landlord without further notice or obligation to the tenant. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the landlord from suing for both rent and possession at the same hearing.(1) If there is no appeal from the judgment of summary possession at the time of the execution of the writ of possession and the tenant has failed to remove tenant’s property, then the landlord may immediately remove and store such property for a period of 7 days, at tenant’s expense, unless the property is a manufactured home and the rental agreement is subject to Chapter 70 of this title, in which case the manufactured home must be stored for a period of 30 days.(2) If, at the end of such period, the tenant has failed to claim said property and to reimburse the landlord for the expense of removal and storage in a reasonable amount, such property and possessions shall be deemed abandoned and may be disposed of by the landlord without further notice or obligation to the tenant.(3) All writs of possession where no appeal has been filed must contain the following language:NOTICE WHERE NO APPEAL FILEDIf you do not remove your property from the premises within 24 hours, then the landlord may immediately remove and store your property for a period of 7 days at your expense, unless the property is a manufactured home and the rental agreement is subject to Chapter 70 of this title, in which case the manufactured home must be stored for a period of 30 days. If you fail to claim your property and reimburse the landlord prior to the expiration of the 7-day period, then the landlord may dispose of your property without any further legal action.MANUFACTURED HOME. If the writ of possession being posted relates to the possession of a rented lot for manufactured housing, under Chapter 70 of this title, and, on or before the date the writ of possession is posted, the tenant has prepaid a per diem storage fee in an amount equivalent to 7 days’ rent, then the court, through its officers, may extend the notice period for the removal of the home from the lot to a maximum period of 7 calendar days from the date of posting. In no event may the tenant inhabit the home after the first 24 hours of the notice period. If the per diem charge above described has been prepaid and the time for removal has been extended, then 7 calendar days after the posting of the writ, the manufactured home may be removed by the landlord. If the period for removal of the home has not been extended by a prepayment of the per diem amount for storage, then 24 hours after the posting of the writ, the home may be removed from the lot by the landlord. In either event, after removal, the home must be stored at the tenant’s expense for a period of 30 days before it can be disposed of through further legal action. The tenant may not remove the home from storage location until the landlord has been reimbursed for any judgment amount and the reasonable cost of removal and storage of the manufactured home.(f) If, at the time of the execution of the writ of possession, an appeal of the judgment of possession has been filed:(1) If there has been an appeal filed from a judgment of summary possession at the time of the execution of the writ of possession and the tenant has failed to remove property within 24 hours, then the landlord may immediately remove and store such property, at the tenant’s expense, for a period of 7 days after the resolution of the appeal, unless the property is a manufactured home and the rental agreement is subject to Chapter 70 of this title, in which case the manufactured home must be stored for a period of 30 days.(2) If, at the end of such period, the tenant has failed to claim said property and to reimburse the landlord for the expense of removal and storage in a reasonable amount, such property and possessions shall be deemed abandoned and may be disposed of by the landlord without further notice or obligation to the tenant.(3) All writs of possession, where an appeal has been filed, must contain the following language:NOTICE WHERE APPEAL HAS BEEN FILEDIf you do not remove your property from the premises with 24 hours, then the landlord may immediately remove and store your property until 7 days after your appeal has been decided, at your expense. If you fail to claim your property and reimburse the landlord prior to the expiration of the 7-day period, then the landlord may dispose of your property without any further legal action.MANUFACTURED HOME. If the writ of possession being posted relates to the possession of a rented lot for manufactured housing, under Chapter 70 of this title, and, on or before the date the writ of possession is posted, the tenant has prepaid a per diem storage fee in an amount equivalent to 7 days’ rent, then the court, through its officers, may extend the notice period for the removal of the home from the lot to a maximum period of 7 calendar days from the date of posting. In no event may the tenant inhabit the home after the 1st 24 hours of the notice period. If the per diem charge above described has been prepaid and the time for removal has been extended, then 7 calendar days after the posting of the writ, the manufactured home may be removed by the landlord. If the period for removal of the home has not been extended by a prepayment of the per diem amount for storage, then 24 hours after the posting of the writ, the home may be removed from the lot by the landlord. In either event, after removal, the home must be stored at the tenant’s expense for a period of 30 days before it can be disposed of through further legal action. The tenant may not remove the home from storage location until the landlord has been reimbursed for any judgment amount and the reasonable cost of removal and storage of the manufactured home.(g) Nothing in subsection (d) of this section shall prevent the landlord from making a claim for rent due from the tenant under the provisions of the lease. The landlord shall have the duty of exercising diligence in landlord’s efforts to re-rent the premises. The landlord shall have the burden of showing the exercise of such diligence. The landlord shall have the right to sue for both rent and possession at the same hearing.(h) Whenever the plaintiff is put into full possession under this chapter it shall be the duty of the plaintiff, at the time actual repossession occurs, to have the locks to the premises changed if said premises are to be further leased out. Any plaintiff who fails to comply with this subsection shall be liable to any new tenant whose person or property is injured as a result of entry to the premises gained by the dispossessed tenant by use of a key still in their possession which fit the lock to the premises at the time of this tenancy.70 Del. Laws, c. 513,\n\n§\n\n 4;§\n\n5716. Stay of proceedings by tenant; good faith dispute.When a final judgment is rendered in favor of the plaintiff in a proceeding brought against a tenant for failure to pay rent and the default arose out of a good faith dispute, the tenant may stay all proceedings on such judgment by paying all rent due at the date of the judgment and the costs of the proceeding or by filing with the court an undertaking to the plaintiff, with such assurances as the court shall require, to the effect that defendant will pay such rent and costs within 10 days of the final judgment being rendered for the plaintiff. At the expiration of said period, the court shall issue a warrant of possession unless satisfactory proof of payment is produced by the tenant.70 Del. Laws, c. 513,\n\n§\n\n 4;§\n\n5717. Stay of proceedings on appeal.(a)Nonjury trials. —With regard to nonjury trials, a party aggrieved by the judgment rendered in such proceeding may request in writing, within 5 days after judgment, a trial de novo before a special court comprised of 3 justices of the peace other than the justice of the peace who presided at the trial, as appointed by the chief magistrate or a designee, which shall render final judgment, by majority vote, on the original complaint within 15 days after such request for a trial de novo. No such request shall stay proceedings on such judgment unless the aggrieved party, at the time of making such request, shall execute and file with the Court an undertaking to the successful party, with such bond or other assurances as may be required by the Court, to the effect that the aggrieved party will pay all costs of such proceedings which may be awarded against that party and abide the order of the Court therein and pay all damages, including rent, justly accruing during the pendency of such proceedings. All further proceedings in execution of the judgment shall thereupon be stayed.(b) An appeal taken pursuant to subsection (a) of this section may also include claims and counter-claims not raised in the initial proceeding; provided, that within 5 days of the filing of the appeal, the claimant also files a bill of particulars identifying any new issues which claimant intends to raise at the hearing which were not raised in the initial proceeding.(c)Jury trials. —With regard to jury trials, a party aggrieved by the judgment rendered in such proceeding may request, in writing, within 5 days after judgment, a review by an appellate court comprised of 3 justices of the peace other than the justice of the peace who presided at the jury trial, as appointed by the chief magistrate or a designee. This review shall be on the record and the party seeking the review must designate with particularity the points of law which the party appealing feels were erroneously applied at the trial court level. The decision on the record shall be by majority vote. No such request shall stay proceedings on such judgment unless the aggrieved party, at the time of making such request, shall execute and file with the Court an undertaking to the successful party, with such bond or other assurances as may be required by the Court, to the effect that the aggrieved party will pay all costs of such proceedings which may be awarded against that party and abide the order of the Court therein and pay all damages, including rent, justly accruing during the pendency of such proceedings. All further proceedings in execution of the judgment shall thereupon be stayed.(d) The Court shall not issue the writ of possession during the 5-day appeal period. After the 5-day appeal period has ended, the Court may issue the writ of possession at the plaintiff’s request if the defendant has filed an appeal, but not filed a bond or other assurance or an in forma pauperis request to stay the issuance of the writ of possession. If the plaintiff executes on the writ of possession prior to a determination of the appeal and the appealing party is ultimately successful, then the plaintiff shall be responsible for reasonable cover damages (including, but not limited to, the cost of substitute housing or relocation) for the period of the dispossession as a result of the execution of the writ of possession, plus court costs and fees.(e) An aggrieved party may appeal in forma pauperis if the Court grants an application for such status. In that event, the Court may waive the filing fee and bond for a trial de novo, a trial on the record or a request to stay the writ of possession.(f) An appeal taken pursuant to this section may include any issue on which judgment was rendered at the trial court level, including the issue of back rent due, any other statute to the contrary notwithstanding.70 Del. Laws, c. 513,\n\n§\n\n 4;§\n\n5718. Proceedings in forma pauperis.Upon application of a party claiming to be indigent, the Court may authorize the commencement, prosecution or defense of any civil action or civil appeal without prepayment of fees and costs or security therefor by a person who makes an affidavit that such person is unable to pay the costs or give security therefore. Such affidavit shall state the nature of the action or defense and the affiant’s belief that the affiant is entitled to redress, and shall state sufficient facts from which the Court may make an objective determination of the petitioner’s alleged indigence.The Court may, in its discretion, conduct a hearing on the question of indigence. In any action in which a claim for damages is asserted by a party seeking the benefit of this rule, the prothonotary shall, before entering a dismissal of the claim or satisfaction of any judgment entered therein, require payment of accrued court costs from any party for whose benefit this rule has been applied if said party has recovered a judgment in said proceedings or received any funds in settlement thereof. A party and such party’s attorney of record shall file appropriate affidavits in the event a claim is sought to be dismissed without settlement or recovery.70 Del. Laws, c. 513,\n\n§\n\n 4;§\n\n5719. Landlord regaining possession of residential rental unit upon the death of a deceased sole tenant.(a) Possession of a residential rental unit upon the death of a sole tenant shall be returned to the landlord without an action for summary possession if:(1) An affiant or personal representative of the deceased sole tenant’s estate presents the landlord with valid documentation issued by the register of wills evidencing such representation pursuant to Title 12, in which case the landlord shall allow the affiant or personal representative access to the residential rental unit of the deceased sole tenant to remove the deceased sole tenant’s belongings; and(2) An affiant or personal representative informs the landlord that further access to the deceased sole tenant’s residential rental unit is not needed by the affiant or personal representative and/or their agents or 30 days have elapsed since the death of the deceased sole tenant and the affiant or personal representative has not provided the landlord written notice that access to the deceased sole tenant’s residential rental unit is still needed by the affiant or personal representative and/or their agents.(b) If an affiant or personal representative of the deceased sole tenant’s estate presents the landlord with valid documentation issued by the register of wills evidencing such representation pursuant to Title 12, the landlord still retains the right to initiate at any time an action for summary possession and/or moneys due, in which case the landlord shall bring the action against the estate of the deceased sole tenant and serve the complaint upon the affiant or personal representative at the address provided by the affiant or personal representative and, if no such good address is provided, then to serve the complaint upon the register of wills in the county in which the residential rental unit is located. If an affiant or personal representative of the deceased sole tenant’s estate does not present the landlord with valid documentation issued by the register of wills evidencing such representation pursuant to Title 12, the landlord must serve the register of wills in the county in which the residential unit is located in order to bring an action for summary possession to obtain possession of the residential rental unit and moneys due, if any. Anytime the register of wills is to be served as a registered agent for an estate, prior to initiating the action, the landlord must place a notice of such action in a paper that is circulated in the county in which the residential rental unit is located. The notice must identify: the name of the landlord; the name of the deceased sole tenant; the residential rental unit address; the type of action to be brought; the court in which such action will be brought; and the amount of the claim, if any.(c) If at the time of the execution of the writ of possession there is still property inside the deceased sole tenant’s residential rental unit that does not belong to the landlord then the landlord shall have the right to immediately remove and store such property for a period of 7 days, at the expense of the estate of the deceased sole tenant. If at the end of such period, a representative of the estate, who has valid documentation of such representation issued by the register of wills pursuant to Title 12, has failed to claim said property and reimburse the landlord for the reasonable expenses of removal and storage, such property shall be deemed abandoned and may be disposed of by the landlord without further notice or obligation to any party. Upon rendering a final judgment for plaintiff, but in no case prior to the expiration of the time for the filing of an appeal or motion to vacate or open the judgment, the court shall issue a writ of possession directed to the constable or the sheriff of the county in which the property is located, describing the property and commanding the officer to remove all persons and put the plaintiff into full possession.(d) If the landlord is not entitled to all or any portion of the security deposit, the landlord shall remit the security deposit within 20 days of receiving possession of the residential rental unit (or, if storage of property that was inside the deceased sole tenant’s residential rental unit is required, then within 20 days after the storage of said property has ended) to a representative of the estate of the deceased sole tenant, if any, who has valid documentation of such representation issued by the register of wills pursuant to Title 12. Within 20 days after receiving possession of the residential rental unit of the deceased sole tenant (or, if storage of property that was inside the deceased sole tenant’s residential rental unit is required, then within 20 days after the storage of said property has ended), the landlord shall provide the representative of the estate of the deceased sole tenant, if any, with an itemized list of damages to the premises and the estimated costs of repair for each and shall tender payment for the difference between any rental amount due and owing, the security deposit and such costs of repair of damage to the premises. Failure to do so shall constitute an acknowledgment by the landlord that no payment is due. The representative’s acceptance of a payment submitted with an itemized list of damages shall constitute agreement on the rental amount due, if any, and damages as specified by the landlord, unless the representative of the estate, within 10 days of the representative’s receipt of such tender of payment, objects in writing to the amount withheld by the landlord. Failure for a representative of the estate to present the landlord with valid documentation of such representation issued by the register of wills or failure of the representative to provide the landlord with a good address shall relieve the landlord of responsibility to give notice of any damages and potential liability for double the amount of the security deposit, but the landlord shall continue to be liable to the representative of the estate for any unused portion of the security deposit; provided, that the representative of the estate shall make a claim in writing to the landlord within 1 year from the landlord receiving possession of the residential rental unit of the deceased sole tenant.79 Del. Laws, c. 65,\n\n§\n\n 4;§\n\n5720. Shielding of records [Effective Jan. 30, 2026].(a) A defendant in an action under this chapter may apply to the Court in which the action was filed for an order shielding the record of the action. The Court must grant the defendant’s motion if the Court finds any of the following:(1) The judgment against the defendant was a judgment on the merits, a default judgment, or a stipulated judgment, 5 or more years have passed since the judgment was entered, the defendant has satisfied any monetary award included in the judgment, and the defendant has had no other similar judgments within 5 years of the defendant’s motion to shield.(2) The parties resolved the action through a stipulated agreement, and the defendant has complied with the terms of the stipulated agreement.(3) The plaintiff withdrew the complaint.(4) The Court dismissed the plaintiff’s complaint.(5) The final judgment was in favor of the defendant.(6) The plaintiff and defendant have agreed to the shielding.(7) The shielding of the record is clearly in the interests of justice.(b) If the Court determines the defendant is eligible for relief under subsection (a) of this section, the Court must issue an order shielding the record of the action and setting aside the original judgment, if a judgment was entered.(c) On entry of the Court’s order under subsection (b) of this section, the action that is the subject of shielding under subsection (a) of this section is deemed not to have been filed, and the defendant may answer accordingly any questions related to the action’s occurrence.(d) Within 45 days of the Court’s entry of an order under subsection (b) of this section, the Court must do all of the following:(1) Provide the defendant with written notification of the shielding and a certified copy of the records being shielded.(2) Provide the defendant with written notification that the records being shielded will no longer be accessible to the public through the Delaware court system.(3) Remove the record of the action from all of the Court’s databases or systems that are publicly accessible.(4) Ensure that all physical or electronic records held by the Court that are associated with the action are stored in such a way as to be permanently inaccessible to the public except as provided for under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.(e) Shielded records may only be disclosed if 1 of the following occurs:(1) The records are requested by the Department of Justice, which must maintain the confidentiality of the records.(2) The records are requested by the defendant.(3) The Court considers publication in the public interest and redacts or otherwise obscures the defendant’s name, personal information, and the address of the property for which summary possession was sought.(f) The Court may not charge a filing fee for filing a motion under subsection (a) of this section.(g) The Court may adopt such rules as necessary to implement this section.85 Del. Laws, c. 106,\n\n§\n\n1;",
