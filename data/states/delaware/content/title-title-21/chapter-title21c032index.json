(b) A personal power of attorney may be accompanied by a notice in the following form, signed by the principal and placed at the beginning of the personal power of attorney. In the absence of a signed notice, upon a challenge to the authority of an agent to act under the personal power of attorney, the agent shall have the burden of demonstrating that the personal power of attorney is valid. NOTICE As the person signing this limited durable power of attorney you are the Principal. The purpose of this power of attorney is to give the person you designate (your “Agent”) broad powers to complete all paperwork necessary to accomplish any required actions set forth in this title without advance notice to you or approval by you. This power of attorney does not authorize your Agent to make health-care decisions for you. Unless you specify otherwise, your Agent's authority will continue even if you become incapacitated, or until you die or revoke the power of attorney, or until your Agent resigns or is unable to act for you. You should select someone you trust to serve as your Agent. This power of attorney does not impose a duty on your Agent to exercise granted powers, but when powers are exercised, your Agent must use due care to act for your benefit and in accordance with this power of attorney. Your Agent must keep your funds and other property separate from your Agent's funds and other property. A court can take away the powers of your Agent if it finds your Agent is not acting properly. The powers and duties of an Agent under a durable power of attorney are explained more fully in § 3212 of this title. If there is anything about this form that you do not understand, you should ask a lawyer of your own choosing to explain it to you. I have read or had explained to me this notice and I understand its contents. ________________________________PrincipalDate________PrincipalDate ________________________________ (c) Regardless of the method by which a person accepts appointment as an agent under a personal power of attorney (pursuant to § 3211 of Title 21 of the Delaware Code), such agent shall have no authority to act as agent under the personal power of attorney unless the agent has first executed and affixed to the personal power of attorney a certification in substantially the following form: AGENT'S CERTIFICATION I, ________________________________(Name of Agent), have read the attached limited durable personal power of attorney and I am the person identified as the Agent or identified as the Agent for the Principal. To the best of my knowledge this power has not been revoked. I hereby acknowledge that, when I act as Agent, I shall: Act in accordance with the principal's reasonable expectations to the extent actually known to me and, otherwise, in the Principal's best interest; Act in good faith; Act only within the scope of authority granted in the personal power of attorney; and To the extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances, keep in regular contact with the principal and communicate with the principal. In addition, in the absence of a specific provision to the contrary in the limited durable personal power of attorney, when I act as Agent, I shall: Keep the assets of the Principal separate from my assets; Exercise reasonable caution and prudence; and Keep a full and accurate record of all actions, receipts and disbursements on behalf of the Principal. ________________________________AgentDate________AgentDate 83 Del.

In the absence of a signed notice, upon a challenge to the authority of an agent to act under the personal power of attorney, the agent shall have the burden of demonstrating that the personal power of attorney is valid.NOTICEAs the person signing this limited durable power of attorney you are the Principal.The purpose of this power of attorney is to give the person you designate (your “Agent”) broad powers to complete all paperwork necessary to accomplish any required actions set forth in this title without advance notice to you or approval by you.This power of attorney does not authorize your Agent to make health-care decisions for you.Unless you specify otherwise, your Agent’s authority will continue even if you become incapacitated, or until you die or revoke the power of attorney, or until your Agent resigns or is unable to act for you. You should select someone you trust to serve as your Agent.This power of attorney does not impose a duty on your Agent to exercise granted powers, but when powers are exercised, your Agent must use due care to act for your benefit and in accordance with this power of attorney.Your Agent must keep your funds and other property separate from your Agent’s funds and other property.A court can take away the powers of your Agent if it finds your Agent is not acting properly.The powers and duties of an Agent under a durable power of attorney are explained more fully in § 3212 of this title.If there is anything about this form that you do not understand, you should ask a lawyer of your own choosing to explain it to you.I have read or had explained to me this notice and I understand its contents.________________________________PrincipalDate________PrincipalDate________________________________(c) Regardless of the method by which a person accepts appointment as an agent under a personal power of attorney (pursuant to § 3211 of Title 21 of the Delaware Code), such agent shall have no authority to act as agent under the personal power of attorney unless the agent has first executed and affixed to the personal power of attorney a certification in substantially the following form:AGENT’S CERTIFICATIONI, ________________________________(Name of Agent), have read the attached limited durable personal power of attorney and I am the person identified as the Agent or identified as the Agent for the Principal.

Laws, c. 149,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n3205. Execution of personal power of attorney— Validity; limited durable power of attorney; copies.(a) A personal power of attorney is validly executed if it complies with § 3204 of this title, unless such personal power of attorney provides that it is governed by the laws of another jurisdiction, in which case, such personal power of attorney is validly executed if such execution complies with the laws of such other jurisdiction.(b) A limited durable power of attorney (other than a personal power of attorney) will be deemed to be validly executed under the laws of this State if, when the power of attorney was executed, the execution complied with:(1) The law of the jurisdiction that determines the meaning and effect of the power of attorney; or(2) The requirements for a military power of attorney pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 1044b, as amended.(c) Except as otherwise provided by statute other than this chapter, a photocopy or electronically transmitted copy of an original power of attorney has the same effect as the original.83 Del. Laws, c. 149,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n3206. Nomination of guardian of person or property; relation of agent to court-appointed fiduciary.(a) The appointment by a court of a guardian or other fiduciary charged with the management of the principal’s property or the care of the principal’s person shall terminate all personal powers of attorney.(b) After the appointment of a guardian or other fiduciary charged with the management of the principal’s property or the care of the principal’s person, the agent is accountable to such guardian or other fiduciary as well as to the principal as to any personal powers of attorney which the agent continues to hold. A guardian or other fiduciary shall only have such powers to revoke or amend the powers of the agent as shall be given to such guardian or other fiduciary by the court.83 Del. Laws, c. 149,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n3207. When the personal power of attorney is effective.A personal power of attorney is effective when executed.83 Del. Laws, c. 149,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n3208.

An act so performed, unless otherwise invalid or unenforceable, binds the principal and the principal’s successors in interest.(e) The execution of a personal power of attorney does not revoke a personal power of attorney previously executed by the principal unless the subsequent personal power of attorney provides that the previous personal power of attorney is revoked or that all other personal powers of attorney are revoked.83 Del. Laws, c. 149,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n3209. Concurrent agents, joint agents, and successor agents.(a) A principal may designate 2 or more persons to act as concurrent agents. Each concurrent agent may exercise its authority independently.(b) A principal may designate 2 or more persons to act as joint agents. No joint agent shall have the power to act without the agreement of all other joint agents and shall have no power to act independent of the other agent.(c) If the principal designates more than 1 agent and does not specify that they are concurrent agents or joint agents, such agents shall be considered concurrent agents.(d) A principal may designate 1 or more successor agents to act if an agent resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated, is not qualified to serve, or declines to serve. Unless the personal power of attorney otherwise provides, a successor agent:(1) Has the same authority as that granted to the original agent; and(2) May not act until all predecessor agents have resigned, died, become incapacitated, are no longer qualified to serve, or have declined to serve.(e) A principal may give an appointed agent or another person designated by name, office or function the authority to designate by a writing executed by such person, 1 or more concurrent, joint, or successor agents in addition to those designated in the personal power of attorney. Unless the personal power of attorney authorizing the appointment of such further agents otherwise provides, a concurrent, joint, or successor agent appointed by this method:(1) Has the same authority as that granted to the original agent; and(2) May not act until the predecessor designee has resigned, died, become incapacitated, is no longer qualified to serve, or has declined to serve.(f) Except as otherwise provided in the personal power of attorney and subsection (g) of this section, an acting agent that does not participate in or conceal a breach of fiduciary duty committed by another agent, including a predecessor agent, is not liable for the actions of the other agent.(g) An acting agent that has actual knowledge of a breach or imminent breach of fiduciary duty by another agent shall notify the principal and, if the principal is incapacitated, take any action reasonably appropriate in the circumstances to safeguard the principal’s best interest. An agent that fails to notify the principal or take action as required by this subsection is liable for the reasonably foreseeable damages that could have been avoided if the agent had notified the principal or taken such action.83 Del. Laws, c. 149,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n3210. Reimbursement and compensation of agent.(a) An agent is entitled to reimbursement of expenses reasonably incurred on behalf of the principal.(b) An agent shall not be entitled to compensation unless:(1) The personal power of attorney so provides; and(2) The compensation is reasonable under the circumstances.83 Del. Laws, c. 149,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n3211. Agent’s acceptance.Except as otherwise provided in the personal power of attorney, a person accepts appointment as an agent under a personal power of attorney by signing the agent’s certification (pursuant to § 3204 of this title) or by exercising authority or performing duties as an agent or by any other assertion or conduct indicating acceptance.83 Del.

Laws, c. 149,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n3214.
