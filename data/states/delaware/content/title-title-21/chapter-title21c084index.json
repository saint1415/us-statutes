Laws, c. 161, § 5].(a) A manufacturer or distributor, directly or through any authorized officer, agent or employee, may not terminate, cancel, or fail to renew a manufacturer-dealer agreement without good cause. If the manufacturer or distributor with good cause terminates, cancels, or fails to renew the manufacturer-dealer agreement, § 8405 of this title does not apply.(b) A manufacturer or distributor has the burden of showing good cause for terminating, canceling, or failing to renew a manufacturer-dealer agreement with a new recreational vehicle dealer. For purposes of determining whether there is good cause for the proposed action, any of the following factors may be considered:(1) The extent of the affected new recreational vehicle dealer’s penetration in the area of sales responsibility.(2) The nature and extent of the new recreational vehicle dealer’s investment in its business.(3) The adequacy of the new recreational vehicle dealer’s service facilities, equipment, parts, supplies, and personnel.(4) The effect of the proposed action on the community.(5) The extent and quality of the new recreational vehicle dealer’s service under new recreational vehicle or new recreational trailer warranties.(6) The new recreational vehicle dealer’s failure to follow agreed-upon procedures or standards related to the overall operation of the dealership.(7) The new recreational vehicle dealer’s performance under the terms of its manufacturer-dealer agreement.(c) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a manufacturer or distributor shall provide a new recreational vehicle dealer with at least 120 days prior written notice of termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal of the manufacturer-dealer agreement if the new recreational vehicle dealer is being terminated, cancelled, or nonrenewed for good cause.(1) The notice must state all reasons for the proposed termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal, and must further state that if, within 30 days following receipt of the notice, the new recreational vehicle dealer provides to the manufacturer or distributor a written notice of intent to cure all claimed deficiencies, the new recreational vehicle dealer will then be entitled to the full 120-day notice period, commencing from the new recreational vehicle dealer’s receipt of the manufacturer’s or distributor’s original notice to rectify the deficiencies. If the deficiencies are rectified within the 120-day notice period, the manufacturer’s or distributor’s notice is voided. If the new recreational vehicle dealer fails to provide the notice of intent to cure the deficiencies in the prescribed 30-day time period, the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal takes effect 30 days after the new recreational vehicle dealer’s receipt of the manufacturer’s or distributor’s original notice.(2) The notice period may be reduced to 30 days if the manufacturer’s or distributor’s grounds for termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal are due to any of the following good cause factors:a. A new recreational vehicle dealer being convicted of, or entering a plea of nolo contendere to, a felony;b. The abandonment or closing of the business operations of the new recreational vehicle dealer for 10 consecutive business days unless the closing is due to an act of God, strike, labor difficulty, or other cause over which the new recreational vehicle dealer has no control;c. A significant misrepresentation by a new recreational vehicle dealer that materially affects the business relationship between the new recreational vehicle dealer and the manufacturer or distributor;d. A suspension or revocation of a new recreational vehicle dealer’s license, or refusal to renew the new recreational vehicle dealer’s license, by the Division of Motor Vehicles;e. A material violation of this chapter which the new recreational vehicle dealer does not cure within 30 days after written notice by the manufacturer or distributor; orf. A declaration by a new recreational vehicle dealer of bankruptcy, insolvency, or the occurrence of an assignment for the benefit of creditors or bankruptcy;(d) A new recreational vehicle dealer may terminate, cancel, or not renew its manufacturer-dealer agreement with a manufacturer or distributor with or without good cause by giving 30-days written notice. In the case of a new recreational vehicle dealer terminating, cancelling, or failing to renew a manufacturer-dealer agreement for good cause, the notice must state all the reasons for the proposed termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal, and must further state that if, within 30 days following receipt of the notice, the manufacturer or distributor provides to the new recreational vehicle dealer a written notice of intent to cure all claimed deficiencies, the manufacturer or distributor will then be entitled to a 90-day notice period commencing from the manufacturer’s receipt of the new recreational vehicle dealer’s original notice. If the deficiencies are rectified within the 90-day notice period, the new recreational vehicle dealer’s notice is voided. If the manufacturer or distributor fails to provide the notice of intent to cure the deficiencies in the prescribed 30-day time period, the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal takes effect 30 days after the manufacturer’s or distributor’s receipt of the new recreational vehicle dealer’s original notice, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing.(e) If the new recreational vehicle dealer terminates, cancels or fails to renew a manufacturer-dealer agreement without good cause, the provisions of § 8405 of this title do not apply. If the new recreational vehicle dealer terminates, cancels, or fails to renew the manufacturer-dealer agreement with good cause, § 8405 of this title applies. The new recreational vehicle dealer has the burden of showing good cause.

Laws, c. 161,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n8405. Repurchase of inventory [For application of this section, see 79 Del. Laws, c. 161, § 5].(a) If a new recreational vehicle dealer terminates, cancels, or fails to renew a manufacturer-dealer agreement for good cause as defined in § 8404(e) of this title and the manufacturer fails to cure the claimed deficiencies as provided in § 8404(d) of this title, at the election of the new recreational vehicle dealer and within 45 days after termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal, the manufacturer shall, repurchase:(1) All new, untitled recreational vehicles and recreational trailers that were acquired from the manufacturer or distributor within 12 months before the effective date of the notice of termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal that have not been used, except for demonstration purposes, and that have not been altered or damaged, at 100% of the net invoice cost, including transportation, less applicable rebates and discounts to the new recreational vehicle dealer. If any of the vehicles repurchased pursuant to this paragraph are damaged, but do not trigger a consumer disclosure requirement, the amount due the new recreational vehicle dealer must be reduced by the cost to repair the vehicle. Damage prior to delivery to the new recreational vehicle dealer that is disclosed at the time of delivery will not disqualify repurchase under this provision.(2) All undamaged accessories and proprietary parts sold to a new recreational vehicle dealer for resale within the 12 months prior to termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal, if accompanied by the original invoice, at 105% of the original net price paid to the manufacturer or distributor to compensate the new recreational vehicle dealer for handling, packing, and shipping the parts; and(3) Any properly functioning diagnostic equipment, special tools, current signage, and other equipment and machinery at 100% of the new recreational vehicle dealer’s net cost plus freight, destination, delivery, and distribution charges and sales taxes, if any, if the items were purchased by the new recreational vehicle dealer within 5 years before termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal upon the manufacturer’s or distributor’s request, and can no longer be used in the normal course of the new recreational vehicle dealer’s ongoing business.(b) The manufacturer or distributor shall pay the new recreational vehicle dealer within 30 days after receipt of the items returned pursuant to this section.79 Del. Laws, c. 161,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n8406. Transfer of dealership; family succession [For application of this section, see 79 Del. Laws, c. 161, § 5].(a) If a new recreational vehicle dealer desires to make a change in ownership by the sale of the business assets, stock transfer, or otherwise, the new recreational vehicle dealer shall give the manufacturer or distributor written notice at least 15 business days before the closing, along with all supporting documentation that may be reasonably required by the manufacturer or distributor to determine if an objection to the sale may be made. In the absence of a breach by the selling new recreational vehicle dealer of its manufacturer-dealer agreement or a provision of this chapter, the manufacturer or distributor may not object to the proposed change in ownership unless the prospective transferee:(1) Has previously been terminated by the manufacturer for breach of its manufacturer-dealer agreement;(2) Has been convicted of a felony or any crime of fraud, deceit, or moral turpitude;(3) Lacks a license required by law;(4) Does not have an active line of credit sufficient to purchase a manufacturer’s or distributor’s product; or(5) Has undergone in the last 10 years bankruptcy, insolvency, a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, or conservator to take possession of the transferee’s business or property.(b) If the manufacturer or distributor objects to a proposed change of ownership pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the manufacturer or distributor shall give written notice of its reasons to the new recreational vehicle dealer within 10 business days after receipt of the new recreational vehicle dealer’s notification and all supporting documentation. The manufacturer or distributor has the burden of proof with regard to its objection. If the manufacturer or distributor does not give timely notice of its objection, the change of ownership is deemed approved.(c) It is unlawful for a manufacturer or distributor to fail to provide a new recreational vehicle dealer with an opportunity to designate, in writing, a family member as a successor to the dealership in the event of the death, incapacity, or retirement of the new recreational vehicle dealer. It is unlawful to prevent or refuse to honor the succession to a dealership by a family member of the deceased, incapacitated, or retired new recreational vehicle dealer, unless the manufacturer or distributor has provided to the new recreational vehicle dealer written notice of its objections within 10 days after receipt of the new recreational vehicle dealer’s modification of the new recreational vehicle dealer’s succession plan. In the absence of a breach of the manufacturer-dealer agreement, the manufacturer or distributor may object to the succession for the following reasons only:(1) Conviction of the successor of a felony or any crime of fraud, deceit, or moral turpitude;(2) Bankruptcy or insolvency of the successor during the past 10 years;(3) Prior termination by the manufacturer or distributor of the successor for breach of a manufacturer-dealer agreement;(4) The lack of an active line of credit for the successor sufficient to purchase the manufacturer’s or distributor’s product; or(5) The lack of a license for the successor required by law.(d) A manufacturer or distributor has the burden of proof regarding its objection under subsection (c) of this section. However, a family member may not succeed to a dealership if the succession involves, without the manufacturer’s or distributor’s consent, a relocation of the business or an alteration of the terms and conditions of the manufacturer-dealer agreement.79 Del.

The schedule of compensation must include reasonable compensation for diagnostic work as well as for warranty labor.(b) Time allowances for the diagnosis and performance of warranty labor must be reasonable for the work to be performed. In the determination of what constitutes reasonable compensation under this section, the principal factors to be given consideration are the actual wage rates being paid by the new recreational vehicle dealer, and the actual retail labor rate being charged by the new recreational vehicle dealers in the community in which the new recreational vehicle dealer is doing business. The compensation of a new recreational vehicle dealer for warranty labor may not be less than the lowest retail labor rates actually charged by the new recreational vehicle dealer for like nonwarranty labor, as long as such rates are reasonable.(c) A warrantor shall reimburse a new recreational vehicle dealer for warranty parts at actual wholesale cost plus a minimum 30% handling charge and the cost, if any, of freight to return warranty parts to the warrantor.(d) Warranty audits of new recreational vehicle dealer records may be conducted by the warrantor on a reasonable basis, and new recreational vehicle dealer claims for warranty compensation may not be denied except for cause, such as performance of nonwarranty repairs, material noncompliance with the warrantor’s published policies and procedures, lack of material documentation, fraud, or misrepresentation.(e) A new recreational vehicle dealer shall submit warranty claims within 30 days after completing work.(f) A new recreational vehicle dealer shall immediately notify a warrantor, verbally or in writing, if the new recreational vehicle dealer is unable to perform any warranty repairs within 10 days of receipt of verbal or written complaints from a consumer.(g) A warrantor shall disapprove warranty claims in writing within 30 days after the work is completed and submitted by the new recreational vehicle dealer in the manner and form prescribed by the warrantor. Claims not specifically disapproved in writing within 30 days are construed to be approved and must be paid within 45 days after the work is completed and the claim submitted.(h) It is a violation of this chapter for a warrantor to:(1) Fail to perform any of its warranty obligations with respect to its warranted products;(2) Fail to include, in written notices of factory campaigns to new recreational vehicle or new recreational trailer owners and new recreational vehicle dealers, the expected date by which necessary parts and equipment, including tires and chassis or chassis parts, will be available to new recreational vehicle dealers to perform the campaign work. A warrantor may ship parts to a new recreational vehicle dealer to effect the campaign work, and, if the parts are in excess of the new recreational vehicle dealer’s requirements, the new recreational vehicle dealer may return unused parts to the warrantor for credit after completion of the campaign;(3) Fail to compensate any of its new recreational vehicle dealers for authorized repairs effected by the new recreational vehicle dealer of merchandise damaged in manufacture or transit to the new recreational vehicle dealer, if the carrier is selected by the warrantor, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch;(4) Fail to compensate any of its new recreational vehicle dealers in accordance with the schedule of compensation provided to the new recreational vehicle dealer pursuant to this section, if performed in a timely and competent manner;(5) Intentionally misrepresent in any way to purchasers of new recreational vehicles or new recreational trailers that warranties with respect to the manufacture, performance, or design of the vehicle are made by the new recreational vehicle dealer as warrantor or co-warrantor; or(6) Require a new recreational vehicle dealer to make warranties to customers in any manner related to the manufacture of the new recreational vehicle or new recreational trailer.(i) It is a violation of this chapter for a new recreational vehicle dealer to:(1) Fail to perform predelivery inspection functions, as specified by the warrantor, in a competent and timely manner;(2) Fail to perform warranty service work authorized by the warrantor in a competent and timely manner on any transient customer’s vehicle of the same line-make;(3) Fail to accurately document the time spent completing each repair, the total number of repair attempts conducted on a single unit, and the number of repair attempts for the same repair conducted on a single vehicle;(4) Fail to notify the warrantor within 10 days of a second repair attempt which impairs the use, value or safety of the vehicle;(5) Fail to maintain written records, including a consumer’s signature, regarding the amount of time a unit is stored for the consumer’s convenience during a repair; or,(6) Make fraudulent warranty claims or misrepresent the terms of a warranty.79 Del. Laws, c. 161,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n8408. Indemnification [For application of this section, see 79 Del. Laws, c. 161, § 5].Notwithstanding the terms of any manufacturer-dealer agreement, it is a violation of this chapter for:(1) A warrantor to fail to indemnify and hold harmless its new recreational vehicle dealer against any losses or damages to the extent that the losses or damages are caused by the negligence or wilful misconduct of the warrantor. A new recreational vehicle dealer may not be denied indemnification for failing to discover, disclose, or remedy a defect in the design or manufacturing of a new recreational vehicle or new recreational trailer. A new recreational vehicle dealer may be denied indemnification if the new recreational vehicle dealer fails to remedy a known and announced defect in accordance with the written instructions of a warrantor for whom the new recreational vehicle dealer is obligated to perform warranty service. A new recreational vehicle dealer shall provide to a warrantor a copy of any pending law suit in which allegations are made that are covered by the provisions of this paragraph within 10 days after receiving such suit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this paragraph shall continue to apply even after the new recreational vehicle or new recreational trailer is titled.(2) A new recreational vehicle dealer to fail to indemnify and hold harmless its warrantor against any losses or damages to the extent that the losses or damages are caused by the negligence or wilful misconduct of the new recreational vehicle dealer.

Laws, c. 161,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n8409. Inspection and rejection by the dealer [For application of this section, see 79 Del. Laws, c. 161, § 5].(a) If a new recreational vehicle or new recreational trailer is damaged prior to transit to a new recreational vehicle dealer or is damaged in transit to the new recreational vehicle dealer when the carrier or means of transportation has been selected by the manufacturer or distributor, the new recreational vehicle dealer shall notify the manufacturer or distributor of the damage within the timeframe specified in the manufacturer-dealer agreement and:(1) Shall request from the manufacturer or distributor authorization to replace the components, parts, and accessories damaged or to otherwise correct the damage; or(2) Shall reject the vehicle within the timeframe set forth in subsection (d) of this section.(b) If a manufacturer or distributor refuses or fails to authorize repair of damage pursuant to subsection (a) of this section within 10 days after receipt of notification, or if the new recreational vehicle dealer rejects the new recreational vehicle or new recreational trailer because of damage, ownership of the new recreational vehicle or new recreational trailer reverts to the manufacturer or distributor.(c) A new recreational vehicle dealer shall exercise due care while the damaged new recreational vehicle or new recreational trailer is in the new recreational vehicle dealer’s custody, but the new recreational vehicle dealer has no other obligations, financial or otherwise, with respect to the vehicle.(d) The timeframe for inspection and rejection of a new recreational vehicle or new recreational trailer by a new recreational vehicle dealer must be part of the manufacturer-dealer agreement and may not be less than 2 business days after the physical delivery of the vehicle.(e) A new recreational vehicle or new recreational trailer that has, at the time of delivery to a new recreational vehicle dealer, an unreasonable amount of miles on its odometer as determined by the new recreational vehicle dealer, may be subject to rejection by the new recreational vehicle dealer and reversion of the vehicle to the manufacturer or distributor. In no instance may a new recreational vehicle dealer deem an amount less than the distance between the new recreational vehicle dealer and the manufacturer’s factory or a distributor’s point of distribution, plus 100 miles, as unreasonable.79 Del. Laws, c. 161,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n8410. Coercion of new recreational vehicle dealer prohibited [For application of this section, see 79 Del.

Laws, c. 161,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n8411. Mediation [For application of this section, see 79 Del. Laws, c. 161, § 5].(a) A new recreational vehicle dealer, manufacturer, distributor, or warrantor injured by another party’s violation of this chapter may bring a civil action to recover actual damages. The court may award reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs to the prevailing party in such an action. Venue for any civil action authorized by this section is in the county in which the new recreational vehicle dealer’s business is located. In an action involving more than 1 new recreational vehicle dealer, venue may be in any county in which any new recreational vehicle dealer that is a party to the action is located.(b) Prior to bringing suit under this chapter, the plaintiff shall serve upon the offending party a written demand for mediation. Mediation must take place in accordance with this section; Chapter 77 of Title 6 does not apply.(1) In the case of a manufacturer, distributor, or new recreational vehicle dealer, a demand for mediation must be served upon the other party via certified mail at the address stated within the manufacturer-dealer agreement between the parties. In the case of a different warrantor, the notice must be sent via certified mail to the address identified in the warrantor’s warranty, with a copy to the manufacturer or distributor.(2) A demand for mediation must contain a brief statement of the dispute and the relief sought by the party filing the demand.(3) Within 20 days after the date on which a demand for mediation is served, the parties shall mutually select an independent certified mediator and meet with that mediator for the purpose of attempting to resolve the dispute. The meeting place must be in this State in a location selected by the mediator. The mediator may extend the date of the meeting for good cause shown by either party or upon stipulation by both parties.(4) The service of a demand for mediation under this section tolls the time for the filing of a complaint, petition, protest, or other action under this chapter until representatives of both parties have met with a mutually selected mediator for the purpose of attempting to resolve the dispute. If a complaint, petition, protest, or other action is filed before meeting with the mediator, the court shall enter an order suspending the proceeding or action until mediation has occurred, and, upon written stipulation by all parties to the proceeding or action that they wish to continue to mediate under this section, the court shall enter an order suspending the proceeding or action for as long a period as the court considers appropriate.(5) The parties to the mediation shall bear their own costs for attorneys’ fees and divide equally the cost of the mediator.(c) In addition to the remedies provided in this section and notwithstanding the existence of any additional remedy at law, a manufacturer, distributor, warrantor, or new recreational vehicle dealer may make application to a court of competent jurisdiction for the grant, upon a hearing and for cause shown, of a temporary or permanent injunction, or both, restraining any person from acting as a new recreational vehicle dealer without being properly licensed, from violating or continuing to violate any of the provisions of this chapter, or from failing or refusing to comply with the requirements of this chapter or § 6311(b) of this title. An injunction must be issued without bond. A single act in violation of the provisions of this chapter is sufficient for a court to authorize the issuance of an injunction.79 Del.
