If a local school board has authorized the tax credit, then the credit must be allowed for a surviving spouse of a deceased qualified person who satisfies the eligibility requirements in § 1917(d) of Title 14. The credit shall be for the full amount of tax remaining after taking into account any exemption pursuant to Title 9 and Title 22. The receiver of taxes and county treasurer shall apply such credit after any change to the current expense tax rate pursuant to this subsection. In the event that local school boards choose not to authorize the aforementioned credit against taxation, the sums appropriated herein will revert to the General Fund.

Such expenditures shall be made only upon the satisfaction of the specific requirements established by law to govern expenditures for these purposes.

Where joint funds are used, the county and the Foundation must mutually agree as to the easements purchased. Any county funds not fully utilized in such purchases shall be returned to the county and such funds of the State as are not fully utilized in such purchases shall revert to the Foundation’s pool of funds available for preservation easements statewide.(e)Parks endowment. —A special fund appropriation account is hereby created in the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, Division of Parks and Recreation, to be known as the “Parks Endowment Account.” It is the intent of the General Assembly that the sum appropriated from the Twenty-First Century Fund for the Parks Endowment Account shall be known as the “principal” and shall remain intact.
