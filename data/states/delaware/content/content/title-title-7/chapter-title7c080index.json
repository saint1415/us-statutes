The budget shall include the Commission’s estimated expenses for administration. Such expenses shall be allocated to the party states according to the following formula:Each designated initial host state will be allocated costs equal to twice the costs of the other party states, but such costs will not exceed $200,000. Each remaining party state will be allocated a cost of1/2the cost of the initial host state, but such costs will not exceed $100,000. The party states will include the amounts allocated above in their respective budgets, subject to such review and approval as may be required by their respective budgetary processes. Such amounts shall be due and payable to the Commission in quarterly installments during the fiscal year.(3) Annual Budget Request — For continued funding of its activities, the Commission shall submit an annual budget request to each party state for funding, based upon the percentage of the region’s waste generated in each state in the region, as reported in the latest available annual inventory required under Article 2(B)(k). The percentage of waste shall be based on volume of waste or total curie content as determined by the Commission.(4) Annual Report to Include Budget — The Commission shall prepare and include in the annual report a budget showing anticipated receipts and disbursements for the ensuing year.(5) Annual Independent Audit —(a) As soon as practicable after the closing of the fiscal year, an audit shall be made of the financial accounts of the Commission.

The report of audit shall be prepared in accordance with accepted accounting practices and shall be filed with the chairman and such other officers as the Commission shall direct. Copies of the report shall be distributed to each Commission member and shall be made available for public distribution.(b) Each signatory party by its duly authorized officers shall be entitled to examine and audit at any time all of the books, documents, records, files, and accounts and all other papers, things, or property of the Commission. The representatives of the signatory parties shall have access to all books, documents, records, accounts, reports, files and all other papers, things, or property belonging to or in use by the Commission and necessary to facilitate the audit; and, they shall be afforded full facilities for verifying transactions with the balances or securities held by depositaries, fiscal agents and custodians.ARTICLE 3\n\nRIGHTS, RESPONSIBILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF PARTY STATES(A) Regional Facilities.There shall be regional facilities sufficient to dispose of the low-level waste generated within the region. Each regional facility shall be capable of disposing of such low-level waste but in the form(s) required by regulations or license conditions. Specialized facilities for particular types of low-level waste management, reduction or treatment may not be developed in any party state unless they are in accordance with the laws and regulations of such state and applicable federal laws and regulations.(B) Equal Access to Regional Facilities.Each party state shall have equal access as other party states to regional facilities located within the region and accepting low-level waste, provided, however, that the host state may close the regional facility located within its borders when necessary for public health and safety. However, a host state shall send notification to the Commission in writing within three 3 days of its action, and shall, within thirty 30 working days, provide in writing the reasons for the closing.(C) Initial Host State.Pennsylvania and party states which generated 25 percent or more of the volume or curies of low-level waste generated by Pennsylvania based on a comparison of averages over the three years 1982 through 1984 are designated as “initial host states” and are required to develop and host low-level waste sites as regional facilities. The percentage of waste from each state shall be determined by cubic foot volume or total curie content, whichever is greater.(D) Exemption From Being Initial Host State.Party states which generated less than 25 percent of the volume or curies of low-level waste generated by Pennsylvania based on a comparison of averages over the years 1982 through 1984 shall be exempt from initial host state responsibilities. These states shall continue to be exempt as long as they generate less than the 25 percent threshold over successive 3-year periods. Once a state generates an average of 25 percent or more of the volume or curies generated by Pennsylvania over a successive 3-year period, it shall be designated as a “host state” for a 30-year period by the Commission and shall immediately initiate development of a regional facility to be operational within five years. Such host state shall be prepared to accept at its regional facility low-level waste at least equal to that generated in the state. With Commission approval, any party state may volunteer to host a regional facility. The percentage of waste from each state shall be determined by either a cubic foot volume or total curie content, whichever is greater.(E) Useful Life of Regional Facilities.Pennsylvania and other host states are obligated to develop regional facilities for the duration of this compact. All regional facilities shall be designed for at least a 30-year useful life. At the end of the facility’s life, normal closure and maintenance procedures shall be initiated in accordance with the applicable requirements of the host state and the Federal government. Each host state’s obligation for operating regional facilities shall remain as long as the state continues to produce over a 3-year period 25 percent or more of the volume or curies of low-level waste generated by Pennsylvania.(F) Duties of Host State.Each host state shall:(a) Cause a regional facility to be sited and developed on a timely basis.(b) Ensure by law, consistent with applicable state and Federal law, the protection and preservation of public health, safety and environmental quality in the siting, design, development, licensure, or other regulation, operation, closure, decommissioning, long-term care and the institutional control period of the regional facility within the state. To the extent authorized by federal law, a host state may adopt more stringent laws, rules or regulations than required by federal law.(c) Ensure and maintain a manifest system which documents all waste-related activities of generators, brokers, carriers and related activities of generators, brokers, carriers and operators, and establish the chain of custody of waste from its initial generation to the end of its hazardous life. Copies of all such manifests shall be submitted to the Commission on a timely basis.(d) Ensure that charges for disposal of low-level waste at the regional facility are sufficient to fully fund the safe disposal and perpetual care of the regional facility and that charges are assessed without discrimination as to the party state of origin.(e)  Submit an annual report to the Commission on the status of the regional facility which contains projections of the anticipated future capacity.(f) Notify the Commission immediately if any exigency arises requiring the possible temporary or permanent closure of a regional facility within the state at a time earlier than was projected in the state’s most recent annual report to the Commission.(g) Require that the institutional control period of any disposal facility be at least as long as the hazardous life, as defined in Article 1(h), of the radioactive materials that are disposed at that facility.(h) Prohibit the use of any shallow land burial, as defined in Article 1(r), and develop alternative means for treatment, storage and disposal of low-level waste.(i) Establish by law, to the extent not prohibited by federal law, requirements for financial responsibility, including, but not limited to:(i) Requirements for the purchase and maintenance of adequate insurance by generators, brokers, carriers and operators of the regional facility;(ii) Requirements for the establishment of a long-term care fund to be funded by a fee placed on generators to pay for preventative or corrective measures of low-level waste to the regional facility; and(iii) Any further financial responsibility requirements that shall be submitted by generators, brokers, carriers, and operators as deemed necessary by the host state.(G) Duties of Party State.Each party state:(a) Shall appropriate its portion of the Commission’s initial and annual budgets as set out in Article 2(C)(2) and (3).(b) To the extent authorized by federal law shall develop and enforce procedures requiring low-level waste shipments originating within its borders and destined for a regional facility to conform to volume reduction, packaging, and transportation requirements and regulations as well as any other requirements specified by the regional facility. Such procedures shall include but are not limited to:(i) Periodic inspections of packaging and shipping practices;(ii) Periodic inspections of low-level waste containers while in custody of carriers; and(iii) Appropriate enforcement actions with respect to violations.(c) To the extent authorized by federal law, shall after receiving notification from a host state or other person that a person in a party state has violated volume reduction, packaging, shipping or transportation requirements or regulations, take appropriate action to ensure that violations do not recur. Appropriate action shall include, but is not limited to, the requirement that a bond be posted by the violator to pay the cost of repackaging at the regional facility and the requirement that future shipments be inspected. Appropriate action may also include suspension of the violator’s use of the regional facility. Should such suspension be imposed, the suspension shall remain in effect until such time as the violator has, to the satisfaction of the party state imposing such suspension, complied with the appropriate requirements or regulations upon which the suspension was based and has taken appropriate action to ensure that such violation or violations do not recur.(d) Shall maintain a registry of all generators and quantities generated within the state.(H) Liability.In the event of liability arising from the operation of any regional facility and during and after closure of that facility, each party state shall share in that liability in an amount equal to that state’s share of the region’s low-level waste disposed of at the facility. If such liability arises from negligence, malfeasance or neglect on the part of a host state or any party state, then any other host or party state(s) may make any claim allowable under law for that negligence, malfeasance or neglect. If such liability arises from a particular waste shipment or shipments to, or quantity of waste or condition at, the regional facility, then any host or party state may make any claim allowable under law for such liability. The percentage of waste shall be based on volume of waste or total curie content.(I) Failure of Party State to Fulfill Obligations.A party state which fails to fulfill its obligations, including timely funding of the Commission may have its privileges under the Compact suspended or its membership in the Compact revoked by the Commission and be subject to any other legal and equitable remedies available to the party states.ARTICLE 4\n\nPROHIBITIVE ACTS AND PENALTIES(A) Prohibition.It shall be unlawful for any person to dispose of low-level waste within the region except at a regional facility unless authorized by the Commission.(B) Waste Disposed of Within Region.After establishment of the regional facility(s), it shall be unlawful for any person to dispose of any low-level waste within the region unless the waste was generated within the region or unless authorized to do so both by the Commission and by law of the host state in which said disposal takes place. For the purposes of this compact, waste generated within the region excludes radioactive material shipped from outside the party states to a waste management facility within the region. In determining whether to grant such authorization, the factors to be considered by the Commission shall include, but not be limited to, the following:(a) The impact on the health, safety and environmental quality of the citizens of the party states;(b) The impact of importing waste on the available capacity and projected life of the regional facility;(c)  The availability of a regional facility appropriate for the safe disposal of the type of low-level waste involved.(C) Waste Generated Within Region.Any and all low-level waste generated within the region shall be disposed of at a regional facility, except for specific cases agreed upon by the Commission, with the affirmative votes by a majority of the Commission members of the host state(s) affected by the decision.(D) Liability.Generators, brokers and carriers of wastes, and owners and operators of sites shall be liable for their acts, omissions, conduct, or relationships in accordance with all laws relating thereto. The party states shall impose a fine for any violation in an amount equal to the present and future costs associated with correcting any harm caused by the violation and shall assess punitive fines or penalties if it is deemed necessary. In addition, the host state shall bar any person who violates host state or federal regulations from using the regional facility until that person demonstrates to the satisfaction of the host state the ability and willingness to comply with the law.(E) Conflict of Interest.(1) Prohibitions —No commissioner, officer or employee shall:(a) Be financially interested, either directly or indirectly, in a contract, sale, purchase, lease or transfer of real or personal property to which the Commission is a party.(b) Solicit or accept money or any other thing of value in addition to the expenses paid to him or her by the Commission for services performed within the scope of his or her official duties.(c) Offer money or anything of value for or in consideration of obtaining an appointment, promotion or privilege in his or her employment with the Commission.(2) Forfeiture of Office or Employment —Any officer or employee who shall wilfully violate any of the provisions of this section shall forfeit his or her office or employment.(3) Agreement Void —Any contract or agreement knowingly made in contravention of this section is void.(4) Criminal and Civil Sanctions —Officers and employees of the Commission shall be subject, in addition to the provisions of this section, to such criminal and civil sanctions for misconduct in office as may be imposed by federal law and the law of the signatory state in which such misconduct occurs.ARTICLE 5\n\nELIGIBILITY, ENTRY INTO EFFECT, CONGRESSIONAL CONSENT, WITHDRAWAL(A) Eligibility.Only the States of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Delaware and Maryland are eligible to become parties to this compact.(B) Entry into Effect.An eligible state may become a party state by legislative enactment of this Compact or by executive order of the governor adopting this Compact; provided, however, a state becoming a party state by executive order shall cease to be a party state upon adjournment of the first general session of its legislature convened thereafter, unless the legislature shall have enacted this Compact before such adjournment.(C) Congressional Consent.This Compact shall take effect when it has been enacted by the legislatures of Pennsylvania and one or more eligible states. However, Article 4(B) and (C) shall not take effect until Congress has consented to this Compact. Every fifth year after such consent has been given, Congress may withdraw consent.(D) Withdrawal.A party state may withdraw from the Compact by repealing the enactment of this compact, but no such withdrawal shall become effective until 2 years after enactment of the repealing legislation. If the withdrawing state is a host state, any regional facility in that state shall remain available to receive low-level waste generated within the region until 5 years after the effective date of the withdrawal.ARTICLE 6\n\nCONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY(A) Construction.The provisions of this compact shall be broadly construed to carry out the purpose of the compact, but the sovereign powers of a party state shall not unnecessarily be infringed.(B) Severability.If any part or application of this compact is held invalid, the remainder, or its application to other situations or persons, shall not be affected.65 Del.
