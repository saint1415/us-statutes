Dedication process.(a) The Department is authorized and empowered, for and on behalf of the State, to acquire nature preserves by gift, devise, purchase, exchange or any other method of acquiring real property or any estate, interest or right therein, provided that such acquisition shall not be made through the exercise of the power of eminent domain, and further provided that any interest owned by the State or by any subdivision thereof may be dedicated only by voluntary act of the agency having jurisdiction thereof. The Department may acquire the fee simple interest in an area or any 1 or more lesser estates, interests and rights therein, including (without limitation upon the generality of the foregoing by reason of specification) a leasehold estate, an easement either appurtenant or in gross and either granting the State specified rights of use or denying to the grantor specified rights of use or both, a license, a covenant, and other contractual rights. A nature preserve may be acquired voluntarily for such consideration as the Department deems advisable or without consideration.(b) The Secretary of the Department, upon the advice and concurrence of the Council, shall accept natural areas by articles of dedication or gift. A nature preserve is established when articles of dedication have been filed by or at the direction of the owner of land, or a governmental agency having ownership or control thereof, in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the land is located.(c) Articles of dedication shall be executed by the owner of the land in the same manner and with the same effect as a conveyance of an interest in land and shall be irrevocable except as provided in this section. The county recorder may not accept articles of dedication for recording unless they contain terms restricting the use of the land which adequately provide for its preservation and protection against modification or encroachment resulting from occupation, development or other use which would destroy its natural or esthetic conditions for 1 or more of the uses and purposes set forth in this section.(d) Articles of dedication may contain provisions for the management, custody and transfer of land, provisions defining the rights of the owner or operating agency and the Department, and such other provisions as may be necessary or advisable to carry out the uses and purposes for which the land is dedicated. They may contain conditions under which the owner and the Department may agree to rescind the articles.(e) The Department may make or accept amendments of any articles of dedication upon terms and conditions that will not destroy the natural or esthetic condition of a preserve. If the fee simple interest in the area is not held by the State, no amendment shall be made without the written consent of the owner. Each amendment shall be recorded in the same manner as the articles of dedication.61 Del. Laws, c. 212,\n\n§\n\n 2;§\n\n7307.

Change in status from that of dedicated nature preserve.Nature preserves dedicated under § 7306 of this title are to be held in trust, for the uses and purposes set forth for the benefit of the people of the State of present and future generations. They shall be managed and protected in the manner approved by, and subject to, the rules and regulations established by the Department. They shall not be taken for any other use except another public use after a finding by the Department of the existence of an imperative and unavoidable public necessity for such other public use and with the approval of the Governor after consultation with the Advisory Council, and by act of the General Assembly not less than 6 months from the date of the Governor’s approval. Except as may otherwise be provided by the articles of dedication, the Department may grant, upon such terms and conditions as it may determine, an estate, interest or right in, or dispose of, a nature preserve, but only after a finding by the Department of the existence of an imperative and unavoidable public necessity for such grant of disposition, and with the approval of the Governor after consultation with the Advisory Council, and by act of the General Assembly not less than 6 months from the date of the Governor’s approval.61 Del. Laws, c. 212,\n\n§\n\n 2;§\n\n7309. Public participation.Before the Department makes any finding of the existence of an imperative and unavoidable public necessity, or grants any estate, interest or right in a nature preserve or disposes of a nature preserve or of any estate, interest or right therein, as provided in § 7308 of this title, it shall give notice of such proposed action and an opportunity for any person to be heard at a public hearing in the county in which the preserve is located. The public hearing shall be published at least once in newspapers with a statewide circulation and general circulation in the county in which the nature preserve is located. The notice shall set forth the substance of the proposed action and describe, with or without legal description, the nature preserve affected, and shall specify a place and time not less than 30 days after such publication for a public hearing before the Department on such proposed action. All persons desiring to be heard shall have a reasonable opportunity to be heard prior to action by the Department on such proposal.61 Del. Laws, c. 212,\n\n§\n\n 2;§\n\n7310.

Laws, c. 212,\n\n§\n\n 2;§\n\n7312. Additional protection unimpaired.Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as interfering with the purposes stated in the establishment of or pertaining to any state or local park, preserve, wildlife refuge or other area or the proper management and development thereof, except that any agency administering an area dedicated as a nature preserve under this chapter shall be responsible for preserving the character of the area in accordance with the articles of dedication and the applicable rules and regulations with respect thereto established by the Department from time to time. Neither the dedication of an area as a nature preserve nor any action taken by the Department under any of the provisions of this chapter shall void or replace any protective status under law which the area would have were it not a nature preserve, and the protective provisions of this chapter shall be supplemental thereto.61 Del. Laws, c. 212,\n\n§\n\n 2;",
