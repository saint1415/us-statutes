Laws, c. 405,\n\n§\n\n 1;68 Del. Laws, c. 290,\n\n§\n\n 184;§\n\n5203. Rate of tax.Every motor carrier shall pay a road tax equivalent to the rate per gallon of the Delaware liquid fuels tax which is currently in effect, calculated on the amount of motor fuel used in its operations on highways within this State.30 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5203;57 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5204. Credit for motor fuel tax payment.(a) Every motor carrier subject to the tax imposed by this chapter shall be entitled to a credit on such tax equivalent to the rate per gallon of the Delaware tax which is currently in effect on all gasoline or other motor fuel purchased by such carrier within this State for use in its operation either within or without this State and upon which gasoline or other motor fuel the tax imposed by the laws of this State has been paid by such carrier. Evidence of the payment of such tax in such form as may be required by, or is satisfactory to, the Department of Transportation shall be furnished by each such carrier claiming the credit allowed under this section. When the amount of the credit to which a motor carrier is entitled for any reporting period exceeds the amount of the tax for which such carrier is liable for that same period, such excess shall, upon application within 1 year from the end of said period and supported by such evidence as the Department may require, be allowed as a credit against the tax for which such carrier would be otherwise liable or at the carrier’s request be refunded.(b) The Department of Transportation shall allow such refund only upon receipt of a bona fide claim subject to criteria established under promulgated regulations. If the Department of Transportation shall refuse to allow a refund in the amount claimed by the applicant, the applicant may request a formal hearing on the application for a refund. Such hearing shall be held by the Department of Transportation after written notice to the applicant of not less than 10 days. Whenever any refund is ordered, it shall be paid out of the General Fund. So much of the moneys received as payment of the tax, interest and penalties under this chapter as shall be necessary for the payment of the refunds provided for in this section is appropriated by this subsection for payment of such refunds. No tax, interest, penalty or fee received or derived from any other tax imposed by the laws of this State shall be used to pay any refund or credit due and payable under the provisions of this section. Prior to any such refund or credit is paid out of the General Fund, the Delaware Transportation Authority shall reimburse the General Fund from the Transportation Trust Fund, on receipt of a notice from the Treasurer reflecting the pending payment of the refund or credit and the amount by which the General Fund must be reimbursed.(c) If such refund granted under the provisions of this section shall, within 3 years of the date of payment, be determined by the Department to have been erroneously or illegally refunded in whole or in part, the Department of Transportation shall demand restitution from the motor carrier for deposit to the account of the General Fund. Such a demand by the Department shall constitute an assessment pursuant to the terms of § 5218 of this title. Any deposits received into the General Fund pursuant to this subsection shall be credited and deposited in the same fashion as all other taxes, fees, penalties and interest received by the State under this chapter.30 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5204;57 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;58 Del. Laws, c. 467,\n\n§\n\n 2;59 Del. Laws, c. 216,\n\n§\n\n 4;65 Del. Laws, c. 427,\n\n§§\n\n 1-3;66 Del. Laws, c. 205,\n\n§§\n\n 1, 2;67 Del. Laws, c. 285,\n\n§§\n\n 56(b), 56(c);68 Del. Laws, c. 290,\n\n§\n\n 184;70 Del. Laws, c. 210,\n\n§\n\n 70;§\n\n5205. Tax due date.The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by each motor carrier quarterly to the Department of Transportation on or before April 30, July 31, October 31 and January 31 of each year and calculated upon the amount of motor fuel used in its operations on highways within this State by each such carrier during the quarter ending with the last day of the preceding month.30 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5205;57 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;58 Del. Laws, c. 467,\n\n§\n\n 2;59 Del. Laws, c. 216,\n\n§\n\n 4;68 Del. Laws, c. 290,\n\n§\n\n 184;§\n\n5206. Deposits of revenue.All taxes, fees, penalties and interest received by the State under this chapter, as amended, shall be deposited, not later than the close of the business day next following such receipt, to the credit of the Delaware Transportation Authority pursuant to Chapters 13 and 14 of Title 2, as amended, and any resolution or indenture of the Delaware Transportation Authority, authorizing the issuance of bonds to finance the costs of transportation facilities described in said title, to be used to finance the costs of roads, highways and other transportation facilities and not to defray the expenses and obligations of the general government of the State.30 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5206;57 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;63 Del. Laws, c. 387,\n\n§\n\n 42(a);67 Del. Laws, c. 285,\n\n§§\n\n 56(d)-56(f);§\n\n5207. Calculation of amount of fuel used in State.The amount of gasoline or other motor fuel used in the operation of any motor carrier on highways within this State shall be such proportion of the total amount of such gasoline or other motor fuel used in its entire operations within and without this State, as the total number of miles traveled on highways within this State bears to the total number of miles traveled within and without this State.30 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5207;57 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5208. Report requirements; exemptions.Every motor carrier subject to the tax imposed by this chapter shall on or before April 30, July 31, October 31 and January 31 of every year make to the Department of Transportation such reports of its operations during the quarter ending the last day of the preceding month as the Department of Transportation may require and such other reports from time to time as the Department of Transportation may deem necessary. The Department of Transportation, by regulation, may exempt from the quarterly reporting requirements of this section those motor carriers operating solely within this State and require in such instance an annual affirmation, if in its discretion the enforcement of this chapter would not be adversely affected by such a regulation. The Department of Transportation is further authorized by regulation to exempt from the quarterly reporting requirements of this section and to require in such instances an annual affirmation of motor carriers licensed in this State who perform substantially all of their travel in this State; provided the Department of Transportation is assured that a sufficient amount of fuel is purchased in this State which is commensurate with the motor carrier’s operations on highways within this State.The Department of Transportation may, by regulation, exempt certain other motor carriers from the quarterly reporting requirements of this section. The Secretary of the Department of Transportation shall promulgate regulations which will set forth and determine the minimum amount of annual net fuel use taxes due the State which, if not exceeded by the estimate of any motor carrier, will exempt that motor carrier from quarterly reporting requirements of this section. The motor carrier who desires to be exempt from the quarterly reporting requirements must, on the motor carrier’s first application for registration in a given registration year, attest that the motor carrier’s estimated net fuel use tax in said year will be less than the threshold amount established by the Secretary of Transportation’s regulation. The Secretary of Transportation is further authorized to allow by regulation in such instances, the filing of an annual report due with remittance on or before January 31 following completion of said registration year.30 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5208;57 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;58 Del. Laws, c. 467,\n\n§\n\n 2;59 Del. Laws, c. 216,\n\n§\n\n 4;65 Del. Laws, c. 328,\n\n§§\n\n 1, 2;68 Del. Laws, c. 156,\n\n§\n\n 51(a);68 Del. Laws, c. 290,\n\n§\n\n 184;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5209. Average consumption.In the absence of adequate records or other evidence satisfactory to the Department of Transportation showing the number of miles operated by a motor carrier’s motor vehicles per gallon of motor fuel, any such motor vehicle shall be deemed to have consumed 1 gallon of motor fuel for each 5 miles operated.30 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5209;57 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;58 Del. Laws, c. 467,\n\n§\n\n 2;59 Del. Laws, c. 216,\n\n§\n\n 4;68 Del. Laws, c. 290,\n\n§\n\n 184;§\n\n5210. Records.Every motor carrier shall keep such records, in such form as the Department of Transportation reasonably may prescribe, as will enable the carrier to report and enable the Department of Transportation to determine the total number of over-the-road miles traveled by its entire fleet of motor vehicles, the total number of over-the-road miles traveled in Delaware by the entire fleet, the total number of gallons of motor fuel used by the entire fleet and the total number of gallons of motor fuel purchased in Delaware for the entire fleet. All such records shall be safely preserved for a period of 3 years in such manner as to insure their security and availability for inspection by the Department of Transportation or any authorized employee engaged in the administration of this chapter. Upon application in writing stating the reasons therefor, the Department of Transportation may, at its discretion, consent to the destruction of any such records at any time within the period if such records pertain to a period which has been audited by the Department of Transportation.30 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5210;57 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;58 Del. Laws, c. 467,\n\n§\n\n 2;59 Del. Laws, c. 216,\n\n§\n\n 4;66 Del. Laws, c. 244,\n\n§\n\n 1;68 Del. Laws, c. 290,\n\n§\n\n 184;§\n\n5211. Vehicle marker; fee; penalty assessments payable by mail; victims’ compensation tax.(a) The Department of Transportation shall provide an identification marker and registration card to every motor vehicle operated within this State by the motor carrier. The identification marker must be affixed to the vehicle in an easily visible position and the registration card carried in the cab of the vehicle. The identification marker and registration card shall remain the property of this State and may be recalled for any violation of this chapter or of the regulations promulgated under this chapter. The Department of Transportation shall provide by regulation for the registration of every such vehicle for a fee of $5.00 each. Registration cards and identification markers shall be issued on a 12-month basis effective January 1 of each year and shall be valid through the next succeeding December 31 except that any identification marker and registration card issued during a registration year for the subsequent registration year shall constitute valid registration immediately upon proper display of the marker and possession of the registration card in the subject vehicle. The enforcement of this subsection shall not become effective until January 15 of each year; provided the motor carrier has the previous year’s identification card in the cab of the vehicle before entry into this State. It shall be illegal to operate or to cause to be operated in this State any motor vehicle defined in § 5202 of this title unless the vehicle bears the identification marker required by this section; provided, however, that the Department of Transportation, by regulation, may exempt from the requirement of displaying the identification marker such vehicles as urban and public transit vehicles or others if in its discretion they are clearly identifiable and the effective enforcement of this chapter will not suffer thereby. In addition and for a period not exceeding 72 hours as to any 1 motor carrier the Department of Transportation, by letter or telegram, may authorize the operation of a vehicle or vehicles without the identification marker required when the enforcement of this section for that period would cause undue delay and hardship in the operation of the vehicle or vehicles. The fee for this authorization shall be $15 for each motor vehicle and conditions for the issuance of such authorization shall be set by regulations promulgated by the Department of Transportation.(b) (1) Whoever violates this section shall, for the first offense, be fined not less than $115 nor more than $345, and for each subsequent offense, not less than $345 nor more than $575.(2) Justice of the Peace Courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over this section.(c) Any duly authorized police officer of this State or of any political subdivision of this State, who charges any person with any of the specified offenses as set out in this section, may, in addition to issuing a summons for said offenses, provide the offending operator with a form which, when properly executed by the officer and the offender, will allow the offender to dispose of the charge without the necessity of personally appearing in the Court to which the summons is returnable. Such penalty assessments must be paid within 10 days from the date of arrest and shall be paid only by check or money order. This subsection shall be applicable to Delaware residents and to residents of those jurisdictions which reciprocate with Delaware.(d) In addition to, and at the same time as, any fine is assessed under this chapter, there shall also be levied an additional victims’ compensation tax surcharge in the amount of 18% of the fine imposed. This surcharge shall be payable in the same manner as set forth in subsection (c) of this section.30 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5211;57 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;58 Del. Laws, c. 43;58 Del. Laws, c. 467,\n\n§\n\n 2;59 Del. Laws, c. 216,\n\n§\n\n 4;59 Del. Laws, c. 508,\n\n§\n\n 1;60 Del. Laws, c. 216,\n\n§\n\n 1;60 Del. Laws, c. 610,\n\n§\n\n 1;63 Del. Laws, c. 387,\n\n§§\n\n 28, 29(a), (b), 30(a)-(c);64 Del. Laws, c. 395,\n\n§\n\n 1;65 Del. Laws, c. 36,\n\n§\n\n 1;65 Del. Laws, c. 427,\n\n§\n\n 4;67 Del. Laws, c. 260,\n\n§\n\n 1;68 Del.

Imposition of tax.The taxes imposed on motor carriers by this chapter are in addition to any taxes of whatever character imposed on such carriers by any other provision of law.30 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5212;57 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5213. Enforcement.The Delaware State Police is authorized and directed to assist in the enforcement of this chapter, and the police officers of any political subdivision of this State are hereby authorized to assist in the enforcement of this chapter.30 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5213;57 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;64 Del. Laws, c. 395,\n\n§\n\n 2;§\n\n5214. Filing of bond; refund provisions.The Department of Transportation may require a motor carrier to provide a surety company bond, which at no time shall exceed the amount of $20,000, payable to this State and conditioned that the carrier will pay all taxes due and to become due under this chapter from the date of the bond to the date when either the carrier or the bonding company notifies the Department of Transportation that the bond has been cancelled. The surety shall be a corporation authorized to write surety bonds in Delaware. So long as the bond remains in force the Department of Transportation may order refunds to the motor carrier in the amounts appearing to be due on applications duly filed by the motor carrier under § 5204 of this title without first auditing the records of the carrier including the penalties and interest provided in § 5218 of this title, even though the assessment is made after cancellation of the bond, but only for taxes due and payable while the bond was in force and penalties and interest on these taxes.30 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5214;57 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;58 Del. Laws, c. 467,\n\n§\n\n 2;59 Del. Laws, c. 216,\n\n§\n\n 4;64 Del. Laws, c. 365,\n\n§\n\n 3;68 Del. Laws, c. 290,\n\n§\n\n 184;§\n\n5215. False statements; penalties.Any person who wilfully and knowingly makes, publishes, delivers or utters a false statement orally, or in writing, or in the form of a receipt for the sale of motor fuel, for the purpose of obtaining or attempting to obtain, or to assist any other person to obtain or attempt to obtain a credit or refund or reduction of liability for taxes under this chapter, upon conviction, shall be sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding $575, undergo imprisonment for a term not exceeding 1 year, or both.30 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5215;57 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;68 Del. Laws, c. 9,\n\n§\n\n 13;§\n\n5216. Departure or removal of property from State or discontinuing business; arbitrary assessment.If the Department of Transportation ascertains that a person decides quickly to depart from this State, or to remove therefrom the person’s property, or any property used by the person in operations subject to this chapter, or to discontinue business, or to do any other act tending to prejudice or render wholly or partially ineffectual proceedings to assess or collect such tax, whereby it becomes important that such proceedings be brought without delay, the Department of Transportation may immediately make an arbitrary assessment of the amount of tax due, whether or not any report is then due by law and may proceed under such arbitrary assessment to collect the tax, or compel security for the same, and thereafter shall cause notice of such finding to be given to such motor carrier, together with a demand for an immediate report and immediate payment of such tax.30 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5216;57 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;58 Del. Laws, c. 467,\n\n§\n\n 2;59 Del. Laws, c. 216,\n\n§\n\n 4;68 Del. Laws, c. 290,\n\n§\n\n 184;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5217. Failure to report or pay tax; penalty; interest.When any motor carrier fails to file a report within the time prescribed by this chapter for the filing thereof, the motor carrier shall pay as a penalty for each day thereafter, Saturdays, Sundays and other legal holidays excluded, until the report is filed, the sum of $5.75, up to a maximum penalty of $28.75 for each such report. For each report filed more than 5 business days late, the penalty shall be $28.75 or 12 percent of the tax due, whichever is greater, for each such report. In addition to the penalty imposed by this section, any unpaid tax shall bear interest at the rate of 1% per month, or fraction thereof, until the same is paid. The penalties and interest charges imposed by this section shall be paid to the Department of Transportation in addition to the tax due. The Department of Transportation, if satisfied that the failure to file the report or pay the tax was excusable, may remit or waive the payment of the whole or part of the penalty or interest charge assessed.30 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5217;57 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;58 Del. Laws, c. 467,\n\n§\n\n 2; \n\n59 Del Laws, c. 216,,\n\n§\n\n 4;64 Del. Laws, c. 368,\n\n§\n\n 7;65 Del.

Time for payment of taxes, penalties and interest; additional penalty.All taxes, penalties and interest assessed pursuant to this chapter, unless earlier payment is provided in this chapter, shall be paid within 30 days after notice and demand shall have been mailed to the carrier by the Department of Transportation. If such taxes, penalties, and interest so assessed pursuant to §§ 5216, 5217 and 5218 of this title, shall not be paid within 30 days, there may be added to the amount of assessment in addition to interest as already provided and any other penalties provided by law, a sum equivalent to 5% of the tax.30 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5218;57 Del. Laws, c. 496,\n\n§\n\n 1;58 Del. Laws, c. 467,\n\n§\n\n 2;65 Del. Laws, c. 427,\n\n§\n\n 6;68 Del. Laws, c. 290,\n\n§\n\n 184;§\n\n5219. Manner of payment and recovery of penalties and interest; debt of motor carrier; lien; preference.(a) All penalties and interest when imposed under this chapter shall be payable to and recoverable by the Secretary of Transportation in the same manner as if they were part of the tax imposed.(b) The taxes, fees, interest and penalties imposed under this chapter from the time the same shall be due shall be a debt of a motor carrier which does not maintain premises for the transaction of business within Delaware, recoverable in the Superior Court of this State in an action in the name of the State. Such debt, whether sued upon or not, shall be a lien on all the property of the debtor, except as against an innocent purchaser for value without notice thereof, and shall have priority both in lien and distribution of the assets of the motor carrier, whether in bankruptcy, insolvency or otherwise. The proceeds of any judgment or order obtained under this section shall be paid to the Secretary of Transportation. The service of all papers in the action shall be upon the Secretary of Transportation of the State, with a copy mailed by certified mail, to the last known address of the defendant.(c) Any tax determined to be due from any person who maintains premises for the conduct of business in Delaware and remaining unpaid after demand for the same, and all penalties and interest thereon, shall be a lien in favor of the State upon the property, both real and personal, of such person but only after the lien has been entered and docketed of record by the Prothonotary of the county where such property is situated. The Secretary of Transportation may at any time transmit to the Prothonotaries of the respective counties certified copies of all liens for such taxes, penalties and interest and it shall be the duty of each Prothonotary receiving the lien to enter and docket the same of record in the Prothonotary’s office, which lien shall be indexed as judgments are now indexed. A writ of execution may directly issue upon such lien, without the issuance and prosecution to judgment of a writ of scire facias; provided, that no less than 10 days before issuance of any execution on the lien, notice of the filing and the effect of the lien shall be sent by registered mail to the taxpayer at the last known post-office address. No Prothonotary shall require as a condition precedent to the entry of such liens, the payment of any costs incident thereto.(d) The lien imposed hereunder, shall have priority from the date of its recording as aforesaid, and shall be fully paid and satisfied out of the proceeds of any judicial sale of property subject thereto, before any other obligation, judgment, claim, lien or estate to which said property may subsequently become subject, except costs of the sale and of the writ upon which the sale was made, and real estate taxes and municipal claims against such property, but shall be subordinate to mortgages and other liens existing and duly recorded or entered of record prior to the recording of the tax lien. In the case of a judicial sale of property subject to a lien imposed hereunder upon a lien or claim over which the lien imposed hereunder has priority, as aforesaid, such sale shall discharge the lien imposed hereunder to the extent only that the proceeds are applied to its payment, and such lien shall continue in full force and effect as to the balance remaining unpaid.(e) The lien imposed hereunder shall continue for 5 years from the date of its entry of record, and may be renewed and continued in the manner now or hereafter provided for the renewal of judgments.30 Del.

Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5220. Failure to pay tax; determination; redetermination; review.(a) If any person shall fail to pay any tax imposed by this chapter for which the person is liable, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized and empowered to make a determination of additional tax and interest due by such person based upon any information within the Secretary’s possession or that shall come into the Secretary’s possession. All of such determinations shall be made so that notice thereof shall reach the parties against whom made within 3 years after the due date of the tax.(b) Promptly after the date of such determination, the Secretary of Transportation shall send, by certified mail, a copy thereof to the person against whom it was made. Within 60 days after the date upon which the copy of any such determination was mailed, such person may file with the Secretary of Transportation a petition for redetermination of such taxes. Every petition for redetermination shall state specifically the reasons which the petitioner believes entitle the petitioner to such redetermination and it shall be supported by affidavit that it is not made for the purpose of delay and that the facts set forth are true and correct.
