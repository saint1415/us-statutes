Affiliations involving health service corporations.(a) (1) With respect to any proposed change of control affiliation or transaction between:a. A health service corporation licensed under this chapter; andb. Any insurer that administers a Children’s Health Insurance Program buy-in program (“the insurer”),the Commissioner shall not approve the transaction or affiliation unless the affiliation will result in the Delaware-licensed health service corporation offering an insurance plan with the same benefits and eligibility criteria as the Delaware program created under § 9909(j) of Title 16.(2) The specific premiums to be initially charged under this section shall be approved by the Commissioner as part of the approval for the transaction or affiliation required by this section, with the analysis required by Chapter 25 of this title and the premiums charged in other regions whose CHIP buy-in programs are administered by the insurer being factors in the Commissioner’s decision.(3) The plan offered pursuant to this section shall offer to subscribers the same network of health-care providers that is offered to subscribers of the Delaware-licensed entity’s standard health insurance plan.(b) For purposes of this section, a “change of control affiliation or transaction” is any affiliation or transaction that will ultimately result in any change in effective control of a health service corporation, either as described by the applicant or as determined by the Commissioner.(c) The obligation imposed under subsection (a) of this section shall exist until such time that the Commissioner finds that a subsequent change in ownership or governance of the affected Delaware health service corporation has negated the change of control affiliation or transaction that triggered the insurer’s obligation under subsection (a) of this section, or until such time that the Commissioner determines that the program has been effectively replaced by federal law, or until such time as the Commissioner determines that the program has become unviable due to insufficient enrollment or unsustainable financial losses. For purposes of this subsection, “unsustainable financial losses” shall require a demonstration of an actual medical loss ratio greater than 90% for each of 2 completed program years in a 3-program-year period.(d) For purposes of this section, a “children’s health insurance buy-in program” is a state program that allows children who would otherwise be ineligible to participate in the State’s CHIP program by virtue of income to nevertheless participate in the program by paying a monthly premium.(e) For purposes of this section, “CHIP program” means the federal Children’s Health Insurance Program.(f) Future adjustments to premiums for any Delaware CHIP buy-in program created pursuant to this section shall be subject to Chapter 25 of this title, with premiums charged in other regions whose CHIP buy-in programs are administered by the insurer being a factor considered under § 2503(a)(3) of this title.(g) Any program created pursuant to this section shall be actuarially separated from a health service corporation’s other insurance plans, and shall not affect the premiums approved by the Commissioner pursuant to Chapter 25 of this title for those other plans.(h) The Insurance Commissioner shall provide a report to the Controller General regarding any rate-setting proceeding relating to any CHIP buy-in program created by this section. Such report shall include any request with respect to rates made by the relevant carrier, any analysis performed by the Insurance Commissioner, and the Insurance Commissioner’s ultimate decision with an explanation for that decision. This requirement shall also apply to the initial premium setting required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The report shall be furnished within 30 days of a final decision by the Commissioner with respect to any rate.78 Del. Laws, c. 58,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n6311. Reserves and surplus; holding company standards.(a) Any approval by the Commissioner of a change of control of a health service corporation shall be governed under the provisions of Chapter 50 of this title and shall be subject to conditions that ensure compliance with this section. Chapter 50 of this title shall also govern the ongoing affiliation of a health service corporation following a change of control, but only to the extent that the provisions thereof are not inconsistent with any more stringent provision of this title or conditions imposed by the Commissioner in connection with approval of such change of control.(b) If a health service corporation regulated under this chapter proposes to enter into a transaction in which it will become controlled by another entity, the Insurance Commissioner shall place conditions upon any approval of the change of control intended to preserve that amount, determined in accordance with Delaware law, that constitutes the surplus or reserves of the health service corporation. Such conditions shall include, without limitation, requiring:(1) Review and approval by the Department of Insurance of any change in the certificate of incorporation of the health service corporation;(2) Review and approval by the Department of Insurance of any individual expenditure or transfer of funds or coordinated series of expenditures or transfers of funds by the health service corporation in excess of $500,000 to the controlling entity or any affiliate of such controlling entity, which review and approval shall assess the commercial reasonableness of the proposed expenditure or transfer;(3) A majority of the board of directors of the health service corporation to consist of persons not employed by the health service corporation or any of its affiliates who are residents of Delaware and have been so for at least 5 years prior to appointment; and(4) Recognition of, and consent to, the ability of Insurance Commissioner to seek appropriate relief from the Court of Chancery or other court of appropriate jurisdiction to prevent the entity controlling the health service corporation from improperly using the assets of the health service corporation for the benefit of the controlling entity rather than the benefit of the health service corporation and its subscribers, or otherwise violating the terms of this section, Chapter 50 of this title, or any agreement between the health service corporation and the controlling entity or affiliate thereof.(c) Any conditions placed on approval will be enforced by the Insurance Commissioner in accordance with applicable provisions of this title. Whenever approval must be obtained from the Commissioner for any activity described in this section, simultaneous notice thereof shall be provided to the Department of Justice.(d) A health service corporation in dissolution shall, after the discharge of all obligations, distribute all remaining assets to the foundation created under § 2533 of Title 29.(e) Terms used in this section shall have the same meaning as defined in Chapter 50 of this title.78 Del. Laws, c. 109,\n\n§\n\n 2;",
