With respect to family members under age 21, the premiums for no more than the 3 oldest covered children must be taken into account in determining the total family premium.(2) If the State does not permit any rating variation for the factors described in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section, as determined by the Insurance Commissioner by regulation, the State may require that premiums for family coverage be determined by using uniform family tiers and the corresponding multipliers established by the State. If the State does not establish uniform family tiers and the corresponding multipliers, the per-member-rating methodology under paragraph (f)(1) of this section applies in this State.(g) The Commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act (Chapter 101 of Title 29), that are consistent with Chapter 25 of this title and set forth more specifically the rating standards and requirements for health insurers operating within this State.79 Del.
