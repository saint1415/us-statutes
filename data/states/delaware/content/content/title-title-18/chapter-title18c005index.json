Emergency requirements.Whenever in the Commissioner’s opinion a public emergency exists by reason of an abnormal disruption of economic and financial processes which affects the conduct of the business of insurance in a normal and ordinary manner, the Commissioner, with the concurrence of the Governor and the General Assembly, may declare the existence of a public emergency. During such emergency the Commissioner may make, alter, amend, revise and rescind rules and regulations, imposing any condition upon the conduct of the business of any insurer which may be necessary or desirable to maintain sound methods of insurance and to safeguard the interests of policyholders, beneficiaries and the public generally during the period of such emergency, which rules and regulations shall become inoperative when such emergency ceases, and an order to that effect shall be made by the Commissioner.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 530;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n531. Emergency powers to regulate liability insurance cancellations and nonrenewals.(a) (1) Whenever the Insurance Commissioner in his or her discretion finds that an abnormal disruption has occurred or is occurring in the liability insurance market, which has created or will create a situation where the availability of commercial, municipal or professional liability insurance is affected and such disruption will affect the normal transaction of business in this State, as to mid-term cancellations, or affect the health, safety and welfare of Delaware citizens as to nonrenewals, the Commissioner may promulgate regulations regarding cancellations and nonrenewals to safeguard the interests of policyholders and the public generally.(2) When the Commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that a specific line of commercial, municipal or professional liability insurance is unavailable and that such unavailability is a threat to the public health, safety and welfare, he or she may declare such line to be “critical” and immediately suspend and enjoin any proposed nonrenewal of coverage of policies of insurance relating to such line and extend policy renewal dates pending a hearing. Within 30 days thereafter, the Commissioner shall hold a public hearing in accordance with procedures mandated by the Administrative Procedures Act [Chapter 101 of Title 29]. The Commissioner shall serve upon known affected insurers and any other persons involved a copy of such notice, including an order to extend the date of policy terminations pending the public hearing.(3) Within 15 days after the public hearing the Commissioner shall find whether or not the specific line is in fact “critical.” The Commissioner may find that the specific line is “critical” if he or she finds both that:a. The type of coverage is generally unavailable in Delaware at any price reasonably related to the risk assumed; andb. The unavailability of this type of coverage constitutes a threat to the public health, safety and welfare.(4) If the Commissioner finds that paragraphs (a)(3)a. and b. of this section are present, he or she may declare the line of coverage is “critical.” Such declaration shall be effective for 90 days from the date when first declared critical under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.(b) Such regulation shall apply to commercial liability insurance policies, other than automobile, but including commercial multi-peril insurance policies and municipal or professional liability coverages. It does not apply to reinsurance, excess and surplus lines insurance, residual market risks, workers’ compensation insurance, multi-state location risks, policies subject to retrospective rating plans, excess or umbrella policies and such other policies that are exempted by the Commissioner.(c) Such regulation shall provide that no cancellation or nonrenewal of a policy under this section shall be effective in this State unless such cancellation or nonrenewal is based upon any 1 of the following reasons:(1) Nonpayment of premium;(2) Material misrepresentation or nondisclosure to the company of a material fact at the time of acceptance of the risk;(3) Increased hazard or material change in the risk assumed which could not have been reasonably contemplated by the parties at the time of assumption of the risk;(4) Substantial breaches of contractual duties, conditions or warranties that materially affect the nature and/or insurability of the risk;(5) Fraudulent acts against the company by the insured or its representatives that materially affect the nature of the risk insured;(6) Lack of cooperation from the insured on loss control matters affecting insurability of the risk;(7) Bona fide loss of or substantial changes in applicable reinsurance. The insurer shall give 60 days’ notice to the Insurance Commissioner and the insured under this section and shall supply such information at that time as the Insurance Commissioner shall require;(8) Material increase in exposure arising out of changes in statutory or case law subsequent to the issuance of the insurance contract;(9) Bona fide loss of or reduction in available insurance capacity. The insurer shall give 60 days’ notice to the Insurance Commissioner and the insured under this section and shall supply such information at that time as the Insurance Commissioner shall require;(10) Any other reasons approved by the Commissioner.(d) This section shall not apply to an insurer issuing a notice of cancellation with respect to any policy which has been in effect for less than 60 days at the time the notice is mailed or delivered.(e) A notice of cancellation or nonrenewal of insurance coverage by insurer shall be in writing, shall be mailed or delivered to the first named insured at the mailing address as shown on the policy. Notices of cancellation or nonrenewal shall be mailed or delivered at least 60 days but no more than 120 days prior to the effective date of the cancellation or nonrenewal. Notices of cancellation based upon nonpayment of premium shall be mailed or delivered at least 10 days prior to the effective date of cancellation. The notice shall state the effective date of the cancellation.(f) The insurer shall provide the first named insured with a written statement setting forth the reasons for cancellation or nonrenewal where the named insured agrees in writing to hold the insurer harmless from liability for any communication giving notice of or specifying a reason for a cancellation or nonrenewal, or for any statement made in connection with an attempt to discover or verify the existence of conditions which would be a reason for a cancellation or nonrenewal under this section.(g) For purposes of this section, the transfer of a policyholder between companies within the same insurance group is not a refusal to renew. In addition, changing deductibles, changes in premium, changes in the amount of insurance or reductions in policy limits or coverage are not refusals to renew, if such changes are reasonably related to the risk involved.(h) Notice of nonrenewal is not required if:(1) The insurer has offered to issue a renewal policy; or(2) A named insured has obtained replacement coverage or has agreed in writing to obtain replacement coverage.(i) Any cancellation or nonrenewal not in compliance with the notice provision of this section is not effective until proper notice is given.(j) No policy of commercial, municipal or professional liability insurance subject to this section shall be extended beyond its termination date for a period of more than 90 days. The premium on such policies may reflect any change in rates approved by the Insurance Commissioner.(k) Rate filings for any line or class affected by this section shall be approved or disapproved within 30 days of their filing.(l)In addition to these provisions, the Commissioner may implement a market assistance plan providing for a voluntary group of insurers in order to aid insureds in obtaining commercial insurance coverages specified therein.65 Del.

Any tax, license or other fee or other obligation imposed by any city, county or other political subdivision or agency of such other state, country or province on Delaware insurers or their agents or representatives shall be deemed to be imposed by such state, country or province within the meaning of this section.(b) This section shall not apply as to personal income taxes, or as to ad valorem taxes on real or personal property, or as to special purpose obligations or assessments imposed by another state in connection with particular kinds of insurance other than property insurance, or as to guaranty association assessments or tax credits for such assessments, except that deductions, from premium taxes or other taxes otherwise payable, allowed on account of real estate or personal property taxes paid shall be taken into consideration by the Commissioner in determining the propriety and extent of retaliatory action under this section.(c) For the purposes of this section the domicile of an alien insurer, other than insurers formed under the laws of Canada or a province thereof, shall be that state designated by the insurer in writing filed with the Commissioner at time of admission to this State or within 6 months after November 1, 1968, whichever date is the later, and may be any 1 of the following states:(1) That in which the insurer was first authorized to transact insurance;(2) That in which is located the insurer’s principal place of business in the United States;(3) That in which is held the largest deposit of trusteed assets of the insurer for the protection of its policyholders in the United States.If the insurer makes no such designation, its domicile shall be deemed to be that state in which is located its principal place of business in the United States.(d) The domicile of an insurer formed under the laws of Canada or a province thereof shall be as provided in § 102 of this title.18 Del.
