If the licensee requests a continuance, the order of suspension remains in effect until the hearing is convened and the Board renders a decision. A licensee whose license has been suspended under this section may request an expedited hearing. The Board must schedule the hearing on an expedited basis, provided that the Board receives the request within 5 calendar days from the date on which the licensee received notification of the decision to suspend the license.(d) If a license has been suspended due to a disability of the licensee, the Board, at a Board meeting, may reinstate the license if the Board is satisfied that the licensee is able to practice with reasonable skill and safety.(e) As a condition of reinstatement of a suspended license or removal from probationary status, the Board may impose such disciplinary or corrective measures as are authorized under this chapter.(f) The Board shall permanently revoke the license of any licensee who is convicted of a felony sexual offense.63 Del.
