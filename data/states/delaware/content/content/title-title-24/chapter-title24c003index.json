If all the requirements of this section are met, the Board shall issue a certification of authorization to such business entity, and that business entity shall be authorized to contract for and to collect fees for architectural services.(d) An applicant for initial issuance or renewal of a certificate of authorization shall be required to register each office of the business entity within this State with the Board and show that each office is under the charge and supervision of an individual holding a valid certificate of registration under this chapter.(e) No such business entity shall be relieved of responsibility for the conduct or acts of its agents, employees, officers, partners, members or principals by reason of its compliance with this section, nor shall any individual be relieved of responsibility for architectural services performed by reason of employment or relationship with such business entity. All business entities and architects practicing through such entities shall be bound by professional responsibility standards no less stringent than those stated in § 608 of Title 8.(f) The Board may revoke, suspend or cancel a certification of authorization, if after a hearing, the Board determines that any officer, partner, member, manager, principal or employee has violated any lawful provision of this chapter, or any lawful regulation established thereunder.77 Del. Laws, c. 225,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n313. Seal.Every registered architect shall have a seal of a design authorized by the Board by regulation. All technical submissions prepared by such architect, or under the architect’s direct supervision, shall be stamped with the impression of the architect’s seal. No registered architect shall impress the seal on any technical submissions unless they were prepared under the architect’s direct supervision.68 Del. Laws, c. 144,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n314. Violations; grounds for professional discipline.(a) An architect or holder of a certificate of authorization shall be subject to those disciplinary actions set forth in § 315 of this title, if, after a hearing, the Board finds that the architect or holder of a certificate of authorization has:(1) Employed or knowingly cooperated in fraud or material deception in order to acquire a certificate of registration, or be otherwise authorized to practice architecture;(2) Engaged in illegal, incompetent or negligent conduct in the practice of architecture;(3) As an architect or otherwise in the practice of the profession, knowingly engaged in an act of consumer fraud or deception, engaged in the restraint of competition or participated in price-fixing activities; or(4) Violated a lawful provision of this chapter, or any lawful regulation established thereunder.(b) An architect shall be subject to nondisciplinary remedial action if, after a hearing, the Board finds that there is a danger to the health, safety and welfare of the public due to:(1) Physical illness or loss of motor skill, including but not limited to deterioration through the aging process;(2) Temporary emotional disorder or mental illness; or(3) Permanent emotional disorder or mental illness.(c) If an architect’s physical or mental capacity to practice safely is at issue in a non-disciplinary remedial proceeding, the Board may order the architect to submit to a reasonable physical or mental examination. Failure to comply with such an order shall render a registered architect liable to temporary suspension or revocation of the architect’s certificate of registration in accordance with § 315 of this title, notwithstanding the Board’s power to compel such attendance under subsection (d) of this section.(d) Where an architect fails to comply with the Board’s request that the architect submit to an examination or attend a hearing, the Board may petition the Superior Court to order such examination or attendance, and the said court or any judge assigned thereto shall have jurisdiction to issue such order.(e) No certificate of registration or certificate of authorization shall be restricted, suspended or revoked by the Board, and no registered architect’s right to practice shall be limited by the Board, until such registered architect or holder of a certificate of authorization has been given notice and an opportunity to be heard in accordance with § 316 of this title.38 Del. Laws, c. 60,\n\n§\n\n 19; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 909; \n\n24 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 317;62 Del. Laws, c. 344,\n\n§\n\n 1;64 Del. Laws, c. 1,\n\n§\n\n 1;68 Del. Laws, c. 144,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;77 Del. Laws, c. 225,\n\n§§\n\n 2-5;§\n\n315. Remedial actions and disciplinary sanctions.(a) The Board may impose any of the following sanctions or take any of the following actions, singly or in combination, when it finds that 1 of the conditions or violations set forth in § 314 of this title applies to an architect or holder of a certificate of authorization:(1) Issue a letter of reprimand;(2) Censure the architect or holder of a certificate of authorization;(3) Place the architect or holder of a certificate of authorization on probationary status, and require the architect or holder of a certificate of authorization to:a. Report regularly to the Board upon the matters which are the basis of the probation;b. Limit all practice and professional activities to those areas prescribed by the Board; and/orc. Continue or renew the architect’s professional education until the required degree of skill has been attained in those areas which are the basis of the probation;(4) Suspend a registered architect’s certificate of registration or suspend a certificate of authorization;(5) Revoke a registered architect’s certificate of registration or revoke a certificate of authorization;(6) Issue cease and desist orders;(7) Seek injunctions; and/or(8) Seek judicial enforcement of civil fines imposed by the Board.(b) The Board may withdraw or reduce conditions of probation when it finds that the deficiencies which required such actions have been remedied.(c) In the event of a formal or informal complaint concerning the activity of a licensee that presents a clear and immediate danger to the public health, safety or welfare, the Board may temporarily suspend the person’s license, pending a hearing, upon the written order of the Secretary of State or the Secretary’s designee, with the concurrence of the Board chair or the Board chair’s designee. An order temporarily suspending a license may not be issued unless the person or the person’s attorney received at least 24 hours’ written or oral notice before the temporary suspension so that the person or the person’s attorney may file a written response to the proposed suspension. The decision as to whether to issue the temporary order of suspension will be decided on the written submissions. An order of temporary suspension pending a hearing may remain in effect for no longer than 60 days from the date of the issuance of the order unless the temporarily suspended person requests a continuance of the hearing date. If the temporarily suspended person requests a continuance, the order of temporary suspension remains in effect until the hearing is convened and a decision is rendered by the Board. A person whose license has been temporarily suspended pursuant to this section may request an expedited hearing. The Board shall schedule the hearing on an expedited basis, provided that the Board receives the request within 5 calendar days from the date on which the person received notification of the decision to temporarily suspend the person’s license.(d) Where a certificate of registration has been suspended due to a disability of the registered architect, the Board may reinstate such certification of registration if, after a hearing, the Board is satisfied that the registered architect is able to practice with reasonable skill and safety.(e) As a condition to reinstatement of a suspended certificate of registration, or removal from probationary status, the Board may impose such disciplinary or corrective measures as are authorized under this chapter.38 Del. Laws, c. 60,\n\n§\n\n 20; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 910; \n\n24 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 318;62 Del. Laws, c. 344,\n\n§\n\n 1;64 Del. Laws, c. 1,\n\n§\n\n 1;68 Del. Laws, c. 144,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del.

Board hearings; procedure.(a) Upon the receipt of a formal complaint from the Attorney General’s office, the Board shall fix the time and place of a full hearing of the matter, and it shall be scheduled to be heard as soon as practicable. The Board shall cause a copy of the complaint, together with a notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing, to be personally delivered or served upon the architect at least 20 days before the date fixed for the hearing. In cases where the architect cannot be located or where personal services cannot be effected, substitute service shall be effected in the same manner as with civil litigation.(b) All hearings shall be informal without use of the rules of evidence. If the Board finds, by a majority vote of all members, that the complaint has merit, the Board shall take such action permitted under this chapter as it deems necessary. The Board’s decision shall be in writing and shall include its reason for such decision. A copy of the decision shall be mailed by registered mail immediately to the complainant, and to the architect. The Board’s decision shall become effective on the thirtieth day after the day it is received by the architect, unless there is an appeal to the Superior Court within that time.(c) Where either the complainant or the architect is in disagreement with the action of the Board, either person may appeal the Board’s decision to the Superior Court within 30 days of the receipt of the Board’s decision. Upon such appeal, the Court shall hear the evidence “de novo.” The filing of an appeal shall act as a stay of the Board’s decision, pending final determination of the appeal.64 Del. Laws, c. 1,\n\n§\n\n 1;68 Del. Laws, c. 144,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n317. Penalties.(a) Where the Board has determined, upon notice and hearing pursuant to Chapter 101 of Title 29 that a person is engaged in the practice of architecture regulated by this chapter without having lawfully obtained a license or that a person previously licensed under this chapter is engaged in a practice regulated by this chapter notwithstanding that the person’s license has been suspended or revoked, the Board may issue a cease and desist order. In addition to the power to issue a cease and desist order, the Board may seek an injunctive order prohibiting such unlawful practice and/or seek the imposition of other civil penalties defined by this chapter.(b) Upon notice and hearing pursuant to Chapter 101 of Title 29, the Board may fine any person who violates such cease and desist order not less than $100 or more than $1000. Each day a violation continues may be deemed a separate offense in the Board’s discretion.(c) Where the Board has placed a registered architect on probationary status under certain restrictions or conditions, and the Board has determined that such restrictions or conditions are being or have been violated by the registered architect, the Board may, after a hearing on the matter, suspend or revoke the registered architect’s certificate of registration.(d) Any person who violates any provisions of this chapter or any rules or regulations promulgated hereunder shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for the first offense; and not more than $10,000 for the second and each subsequent offense, which penalty may be sued for, and recovered by, the Board.
