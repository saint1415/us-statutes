Years of service in the armed forces shall also be counted as years of experience in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by the Department of Education in this respect. A graduate of a 5-year preservice program that includes an extensive clinical component in the fifth year, or a graduate of a 4-year preservice program who graduates with a grade point average (GPA) of 3.75 or higher on a 4.0 scale, or the equivalent, must be granted 1 year of experience in addition to any other experience granted in accordance with this section.(b) A graduate who has completed a year-long Delaware institute of higher education residency program, and has met all other requirements under § 1281 of this title, must be granted 1 year of experience credit in addition to any other experience granted under this section.(c) In the case of a person employed as a teacher of trades and industries, or as a coordinator of distributive education, work experience shall be allowed on a year for year basis for full-time work experience in the trade of the teaching subject for those years of work experience beyond years counted toward qualification for certification under rules and regulations of the Department of Education. One hundred and thirty-one working days in any school year shall constitute 1 year of work experience but not more than 1 year of experience may be credited for any 1 calendar year.(d) In the case of a Department of Education employee who is required to meet certification requirements as specified in the Manual for the Certification of Professional Public School Personnel but is employed in the non-instructional areas of transportation, finance/business management, human resources/personnel management, purchasing, community/public relations, administrative services, pupil services, audiology, occupational therapist, physical therapist, psychologist, speech language pathologist, human relations, nurse, social work/services, information technology or a specialized assignment comparable to these areas, work experience shall be allowed on a year for year basis for full-time work experience in a directly related position in public or private business in accordance with rules established by the Department of Education. Nothing in this section shall be construed as changing or modifying the certification requirements relating to these noninstructional positions.(e) In the case of personnel whose salaries are based wholly or in part upon § § 1306, 1307, 1308, 1309, 1310, 1311, 1321, 1322, 1324, and 1336 of this title, experience shall be evaluated by the Department of Education, taking into consideration the number of months and the nature of the services rendered.(f) Beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 1998, experience for all public education employees shall be credited according to the provisions of subsections (a) through (e) of this section. No employee shall be entitled to retroactive payment of salary as a result of any changes in experience resulting from the provisions of subsections (a) through (e) of this section.(g) In the case of a teacher or specialist with at least 4 years of full-time experience as a Title 1 or instructional paraprofessional in a public school who held a valid paraprofessional permit by the Department of Education or an equivalent agency in another state prior to becoming a teacher or specialist, the teacher or specialist is given 1 year of experience credit on the salary schedule under § 1305 of this title for every 2 years of full-time experience as such a paraprofessional in a public school. Credit for years of experience as a Title 1 or instructional paraprofessional for teachers or specialists on the salary schedule under § 1305 of this title must start upon the date of completion and approval of an application to the employer.46 Del.

Laws, c. 186, § 8].(a) A person may not be an employee or contractor within a public school in any position requiring licensure and certification, or a permit if the person does not meet licensure and certification, or permit requirements established under Chapter 12 of this title, except pursuant to a license or permit extension or emergency certificate issued pursuant to Chapter 12. A person’s salary may not be reduced because that person is employed under a license or permit extension or emergency certificate.(b) The Department of Education has the authority to require reimbursement of any funds disbursed to a district or charter school used to pay an employee without licensure, certification, or a permit, who holds a position requiring licensure, certification, or a permit, if the district or charter school intentionally retains the employee for more than 90 calendar days after the initial hire. The Department may only seek reimbursement for the period of time a school district or charter school retains the employee after the 90 calendar-day grace period after the initial hire and may only do so not less than 30 days after the Department has properly notified the employee and employer.(c) The Department of Education has the authority to require reimbursement of any funds disbursed to a district or charter school used to pay an employee that works in a school under an expired license, certification, or permit provided that the Department has notified the employee and employer prior to the expiration of the license, certification, or permit. The Department may not require reimbursement of funds if the Department is the cause of a delay in issuing a license, certification, or permit.(d) In the event reimbursement is requested by the Department, the district or charter school may not require reimbursement from the employee unless the employee has intentionally provided false information or has failed to provide the Department with documentation necessary for a license, certificate, or permit.(e) When school districts or charter schools utilize contractual options to provide services for which a license, certificate, or permit is required, the vendor or contractor making the person available to be assigned to a school is responsible for ensuring compliance with the provisions of this section. If a vendor or contractor knowingly assigns a person who does not meet the requirements of this section to a school, district, or charter school, the Department may report the vendor or contractor to the Department of Finance, Division of Revenue for revocation of the vendor’s or contractor’s business license. School districts and charter schools are encouraged to include provisions containing the requirements of this section in contracts for the provision of relevant school services.(f) Whenever the Department sends notification to an employee regarding the deficiency of an application or the issuance or expiration of a license, certificate, or a permit, the Department must also notify the employer. The employer may appeal a Department decision to require reimbursement of funds. The appeal will be heard by the State Board of Education whose decision will be final.46 Del.

However, this provision shall not preclude the employee from receiving grants such as scholarships, gifts, fellowships, part-time employment, or other grants of aid as frequently provided by colleges, universities, governmental agencies, corporations, trusts or other individuals to students or other persons engaged in study or travel for purposes of professional improvement;(5) The professional employee shall agree in writing to return to service to the leave-granting board for a period of at least 1 full school year following the completion of the employee’s leave;(6) Request for sabbatical leave shall be presented in writing to said leave-granting board at a regular meeting of such board before April 1 for leave to begin at the opening of the next term, and before November 1 for leave to begin at the opening of the second semester of the term;(7) At the end of any such period of leave of absence the employee shall present evidence of that employee’s own professional improvement in such terms as shall have been agreed upon between said employee and said leave-granting board at the time when such leave was granted. Such evidence may consist of college transcripts, degrees earned or written reports by the recipient of the leave of absence;(8) Said leave-granting board shall accept the employee into full-time employment upon that employee’s return from leave and assign the employee to the position from which that employee left or to a similar position.

Failure of an employee to return to service of said leave-granting board shall be cause for forfeiture of salary increments and pension credits for the period of the leave.(10) School boards may set a limit on the number of employees who may be granted leave each year, provided that, in any district having fewer than 20 professional employees, 1 eligible applicant may be granted leave each year;(11) The leave-granting district shall provide to the employee granted leave, under paragraphs (1)-(10) of this section, compensation equal to1/2the salary to which the employee would have been entitled under full-time employment; provided, however, that in no case shall the compensation paid exceed $10,000 for a full school year leave or $5,000 for a1/2school year. The State shall continue to pay the state share of other employment costs as specified in § 6340 of Title 29 for the employee on sabbatical leave.(12) Sabbatical leave authorized under this section, at state expense, shall be limited to 1 full year leave or 2 half-year leaves per local school district during a fiscal year.
