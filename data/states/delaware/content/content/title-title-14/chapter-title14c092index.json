The College may also provide such additional compensation to Plan B employees as authorized by the Board of Trustees. This compensation shall not be added to the employee's base rate, and shall not be paid out of state funds.

That amount shall be computed by multiplying the amount provided under this section, by the index volume specified in the schedule below that corresponds with the appropriate classification level and experience level. The experience level shall be determined by the employee’s actual years of experience in the assigned level while in the Administrative Pay Plan at Delaware Technical and Community College.(3) The new salary for any employee shall not be effective until the presentation by the employee of proof of credentials to support claimed degrees, additional credits, and relevant work experience.(4) Any changes in the allocation of jobs to grade level shall be approved by the Board of Trustees and filed with the Secretary of the Department of Human Resources, Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Controller General.(5) The Board of Trustees may provide additional compensation and benefits with non-state funds to employees in the Administrative Salary Plan.(h) For each fiscal year, the minimum increase for a Plan A or Plan D employee shall be one-half of the general increase for all eligible merit and merit comparable state employees of the employee's Fiscal Year 1995 salary.66 Del.
