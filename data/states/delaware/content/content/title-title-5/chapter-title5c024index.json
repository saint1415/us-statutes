Purpose.(a) The activities of mortgage loan originators and the origination or offering of financing for residential real property have a direct, valuable and immediate impact upon Delaware’s consumers, Delaware’s economy, the neighborhoods and communities of Delaware, and the housing and real estate industry. The General Assembly finds that accessibility to mortgage credit is vital to this State’s citizens. The General Assembly also finds that it is essential for the protection of the citizens of Delaware and the stability of Delaware’s economy that reasonable standards for licensing and regulation of the business practices of mortgage loan originators be imposed. The General Assembly further finds that the obligations of mortgage loan originators to consumers in connection with originating or making residential mortgage loans are such as to warrant the regulation of the mortgage lending process. The purpose of this chapter is to protect consumers seeking mortgage loans and to ensure that the mortgage lending industry is operating without unfair, deceptive, and fraudulent practices on the part of mortgage loan originators.(b) Therefore, the General Assembly establishes within this chapter an effective system of supervision and enforcement of the mortgage lending industry, including:(1) The authority to issue licenses to conduct business under this chapter, including the authority to write rules or regulations or adopt procedures necessary to the licensing of persons covered under this chapter;(2) The authority to deny, suspend, condition or revoke licenses issued under this chapter; and(3) The authority to examine, investigate and conduct enforcement actions as necessary to carry out the intended purposes of this chapter, including the authority to subpoena witnesses and documents, enter orders, including cease and desist orders, order restitution and monetary penalties and order the removal and ban of individuals from office or employment.77 Del.
