Such Court of Common Pleas shall have full and complete jurisdiction to hear and determine such issue of damages, if any. In order to invoke the jurisdiction of such Court of Common Pleas, the Department or its agents shall apply to it for a summons directed to the sheriff of the county commanding the sheriff to summon such owner to appear before the Court at a time and place specified in such summons, not less than 5 days nor more than 15 days from the date thereof, for the purpose of having the issue of damages, if any, determined.

During the same period the Department shall also have the right to abandon the proceedings and proceed with condemnation in the Superior Court. Upon timely demand or abandoning as herein provided, the Department shall proceed with condemnation under Chapter 61 of Title 10. If such demand or abandoning is done after the judgment is handed down but before the end of the 15-day period, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas shall be vacated.(e) In cases where the owner claims damages of more than $1,000, the Court of Common Pleas shall have no jurisdiction and all proceedings where there is a failure to agree on damages shall be under Chapter 61 of Title 10.(f) The amount of damages ultimately determined or agreed upon shall be paid out of funds appropriated to the Highway Department by the State Treasurer to such owner, when properly notified by the Department or its agents.(g) Whoever hinders or delays the Department or its agents in the construction, repair or maintenance of any such ditch, drain, culvert or sewer or whoever stops, fills up, injures or obstructs any such ditch, drain, culvert or sewer, or whoever obstructs, diverts or changes the course of any such stream or creek without authority from the Department or its agents shall be fined not more than $100 for every such offense.Code 1852,\n\n§\n\n 1126; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 1571;27 Del.

Coordinating new development with local transportation improvements.(a)Legislative findings. —(1) Under Chapters 1 and 5 of this title, the Department of Transportation reviews and approves entrance design and internal transportation network requirements for new and existing real property developments. This review process often identifies necessary additional improvements to the local transportation system to accommodate the predicted impact of the new development. Under normal conditions, the new development may not in and of itself cause the need for new local transportation improvements, but instead acts as a triggering event in combination with preexisting traffic growth patterns in the area.(2) On occasion, there is insufficient right-of-way for the construction of these off-site improvements, or the Department’s own schedule for making the improvements as part of its capital program is on a different schedule than the entity seeking development approval. Under appropriately defined conditions, it is proper that the entities seeking development approval contribute toward the cost of obtaining the necessary rights-of-way in lieu of altering the timing of the State’s own investments in such improvements.(3) Under appropriately defined conditions, the Department should also be able to use its full powers to obtain the necessary rights-of-way for such improvements, triggered by the combination of preexisting traffic conditions and the proposed new development, as well as to oversee the installation of the required improvements.(4) Even when there is sufficient right-of-way for the required improvements, there are other compliance issues that the local land use approval process may not fully take into account, such as the impact of the improvements on the State’s ability to comply with federal Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq.] regulations, or the linkage between the proposed development and the State’s own land use planning and development policies.(5) Therefore, the Department should enact appropriate rules and regulations to determine where and under what conditions it will use its powers to acquire real property interests for the construction of such improvements, to enforce the maintenance of safe operating conditions for the traveling public during the construction of these improvements, and to assure continued compliance with applicable environmental and other legal requirements implicated by these improvements.(b)Implementation. —The Department of Transportation is authorized and directed to enact rules and regulations to complement its existing authority under Chapters 1 and 5 of this title relating to new developments and their impacts on the local transportation network, as follows:(1) If the predicted impact of a new development creates a need for additional improvements within the local transportation network for which additional rights-of-way must be acquired, the regulations shall outline the procedures for the use of the Department’s powers under § 137 of this title for this purpose, using contributed funds from the entity triggering the need.(2) In using this authority, such additional improvements shall be limited to those that do not implicate the State’s ability to comply with the air quality conformity regulations of the federal Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq.].(3) Furthermore, the use of the authority granted pursuant to this section is limited to those geographic areas defined by the State’s land use policies as appropriate for the type and extent of the proposed development.(4) As part of the approval process for projects built pursuant to this authority, the Department shall consult with state and local governmental representatives in the area of the proposed improvements. The Department shall also establish procedures for public notice and comment on the potential impacts of the development and the proposed changes to the local transportation network.(5) The regulations shall also provide for 2 alternative methods of constructing the necessary improvements.a. The preferred alternative shall be an agreement with the entity seeking development approval to assume direct responsibility for planning, design, inspection, and construction of the improvements. At a minimum, the agreement shall also include terms giving the Department appropriate provisions for quality assurance and quality control of the construction of the additional local improvements.b. If the Department determines in its discretion that such an agreement is not feasible and practical under the circumstances, it may instead assume responsibility for the scheduling, planning, design, construction, and inspection of the off-site improvements as a regular Department project, to be wholly funded by the entity seeking development approval.74 Del. Laws, c. 404,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n508. Dedication of new roads and streets for state maintenance; approval required; security.(a) (1) As used in this section, “developer” means the owner of real property on which residential or commercial development is occurring, or the person actually engaged in the development or construction of residential or commercial property.(2) This section applies to a residential or commercial development which the Department determines affects or requires access to state-maintained highways, streets, or roads.(3) A person, firm, or corporation may not construct, or cause to be constructed, a new road or street outside the corporate limits of any municipality and intended to be dedicated by the owner of the road or street to this State for public use, including the initial installation of traffic and street name signs, unless the road or street is in conformity with this section and with plans and specifications approved by the Department.(4) At a minimum, the initial installation of road or street name signs must include the placement of the signs at each intersection of the new road or street with any other road or street, capable of being read from each direction on a road or street at each intersection.(5) The new road or street is a continuation of an existing or proposed public road designed to be part of the general highway system of the State.(6) The construction of a new road or street must be performed under a written agreement with the Department, signed by the developer, that includes all of the following:a. The plans and specifications approved by the Department.b. The posted security for completion required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.c. The location of any decorative subdivision entrance signs installed by the developer.d. Any other terms the Department determines may be necessary.(7) a. The Department shall accept a road or street constructed in compliance with this section and the rules, regulations, and standards adopted by the Department under this section into the state maintenance system.b. Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(7)a. of this section, the Department has the sole discretion as to whether a road or street constructed to serve a dwelling, building, facility, or other structure is accepted into the state maintenance system.(b) (1) Except as provided by paragraph (b)(3) of this section, before commencement of construction under this section, including the installation of utilities within the dedicated right-of-way, a developer shall first post with the Department a good and sufficient bond, certified check, letter of credit, or other form of security acceptable to the Department in a manner and form approved by the Department and in the amount of 150% of the estimated cost of top coat as approved by the Department. The bond, certified check, letter of credit, or other form of security acceptable to the Department must be conditioned on the faithful performance and satisfactory completion of the obligations imposed by subsection (a) of this section.(2) a. If top coat is not underway 7 years from the date the bond, certified check, letter of credit, or other form of security acceptable to the Department is posted with the Department under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section, the estimate to complete top coat must be revised to reflect current costs and the developer must post any security the Department deems necessary to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section.b. The process under paragraph (b)(2)a. of this section is to be repeated every 5 years until the developer complies with the written agreement entered into under paragraph (a)(6) of this section.(3) If a developer, regardless of corporate name, has been adjudged by the Department to be in violation of this section or has not maintained a satisfactory record of compliance on repair and construction completion as determined by the Department, the Department may require a bond, certified check, letter of credit, or other form of security acceptable to the Department, consistent with this subsection in an amount of at least 100%, but not more 125%, of the cost of the construction.(c) (1) The Department shall inspect a new road or street being constructed under this section and any construction, including utilities within the road or street right-of-way, to ensure the construction is in conformity with standards, plans, and specifications approved by the Department. On dedication of the right-of-way to the public use and satisfactory completion of the road or street construction, including connection to an existing state maintained highway, street, or road, the Department shall do all of the following:a. Notify the developer that the road or street has been accepted into the state maintenance system and that the dedicated right-of-way has been accepted according to the terms of the acceptance.b. Release to the developer the bond, certified check, letter of credit, or other security acceptable to the Department posted by the developer under subsection (b) of this section.(2) A signature from a Department inspector must be obtained before the Department can accept a road or street from a developer into the state maintenance system.(3) The Department shall inform by letter an officer of the maintenance association, if any, in the development in which the road or street will be dedicated, that the Department has accepted the road or street from the developer. The Department shall send copies of the letter to the state Senator and state Representative for the senatorial and representative district in which the road or street is located. The letter must indicate the acceptance date of the road or street and an explanation of the State’s 3-year good faith warranty.(4) The Department, on acceptance of a road or street, shall assume the sole and absolute care, management, and control of the new road or street as a public road or street. Until the Department accepts a new road or street, the developer or the developer’s legal successor in interest is solely responsible for maintenance of the road or street.(5) a. The Department’s standards for a new road or street include a requirement that a decorative sign that includes the name of the subdivision and a logo of the State’s famous patriot, Caesar Rodney be installed at each newly approved subdivision and be paid for by the developer of the subdivision.b. A subdivision in existence on July 1, 2005, may request the Department to install a decorative sign required under paragraph (c)(5)a. of this section in place of other signs previously used by the Department. The requested decorative sign must be paid for by the subdivision or from Community Transportation Funds allocated by a legislator who requests the decorative sign.c. The Department shall replace a standard sign damaged by vandalism, accident, or the ravages of time with another standard sign under the Department’s regular maintenance program, unless the decorative alternative has been requested under the provisions of this subsection.(d) The Department shall make and publish rules, regulations, standards, or specifications for planning, designing, constructing, and maintaining a new road or street.(e) The bond, certified check, letter of credit, or other form of security acceptable to the Department posted with the Department under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section is immediately due and owing on failure of the developer to meet the obligations set forth in the agreement executed under this section. On failure of the developer to comply with the standards, plans, and specifications or with the terms of the agreement executed under this section, the Department may do 1 or more of the following:(1) Withdraw any approval to construct a road or street which the Department has given under this section and may, after the withdrawal of the approval, notify the appropriate governmental agency to cease issuance of occupancy permits for dwellings in the construction area.(2) Proceed to forfeiture of the bond, certified check, letter of credit, or other form of security acceptable to the Department posted under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section.(3) Move to fine a violator under this section.(4) Seek specific performance of the developer’s agreement.(5) Conditionally accept and satisfactorily complete the road or street and recover damages in the amount of completion costs and incidental expenses from the developer.(6) Institute whatever other legal or equitable action is necessary to cause the road or street to be completed.(f) A developer that does not comply with this section within 100 days of written notification by the Department of a violation is to be punished by a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $1,000 for each offense and the further sum in an amount equal to the amount fined for the initial offense for each day the violation exists. The total fine imposed under this subsection may not exceed the total estimated cost of the construction and incidental expenses related to the construction of the road or street.(g) Any funds received as the result of action taken under this section must be utilized by the Department to carry out the general purposes of this title.(h) A developer found in violation of this section by the Department is prohibited from conducting business in the State until all conditions created by the developer constituting a violation of this section have been corrected to the satisfaction of the Department.(i) The Justice of the Peace Court has jurisdiction over a violation of this section. The Court may order forfeiture of the security required under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section and may impose a fine under subsection (f) of this section.Code 1935, c. 55;48 Del.

Removal of nonofficial signs from utility poles within state rights-of-way.(a)Legislative findings. —The General Assembly finds that persons and firms post nonofficial signs on utility poles without prior authorization from the pole owner. Placing such signs on these poles is unsafe, both for the person attaching the sign and those in the vicinity of such activity when it occurs, including passersby. Therefore, it is appropriate to authorize the Department of Transportation to treat such signs as subject to immediate removal and other enforcement action under §§ 525 through 527 of this title, without regard to the clear zone distance limitations of those sections.(b) The Department of Transportation may treat any nonofficial signs placed on utility poles at any location within the State’s rights-of-way as artificial obstructions within the clear zone, subject to immediate removal and other enforcement action under §§ 525 through 527 of this title, upon confirmation that the utility company had not previously authorized the placement of such signs.75 Del. Laws, c. 98,\n\n§\n\n 121;§\n\n525. Maintenance of clear zones within rights-of-way.(a) The Department is authorized to maintain clear zones within the rights-of-way under its jurisdiction in the unincorporated areas of the State. In maintaining these clear zones, the Department shall have the immediate authority to remove artificial obstructions placed therein, including, but not limited to, nonofficial signs, poles, mailboxes not placed in conformance with Departmental regulation, or other hazards to safe passage. In removing artificial obstructions, the Department shall attempt to determine the owner of the obstruction and provide written notice and an opportunity for the owner to recover the obstruction after its removal. The Department shall also have the immediate authority to remove or trim vegetation growing within these rights-of-way.(b) As used in this chapter, the term “clear zone” has the following meanings:(1) For all roads except those described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the term includes the total roadside border area within a right-of-way, starting at the edge of the pavement and continuing for a distance of 10 feet perpendicular to the pavement edge.(2) For all interior streets within residential subdivisions, the term includes the total roadside border area within a right-of-way, starting at the edge of the pavement and continuing for the shorter distance of either:a. Seven feet perpendicular to the pavement edge, orb. If there is a sidewalk adjacent to the street, the sidewalk edge further from the street.(3) The total area within the median strips between traveled ways or on any channelization islands or on any gore areas, except as permitted by § 1108(d) of this title. For purposes of this section, “gore area” means a longitudinal point where a physical barrier or the lack of a paved surface inhibits road users from crossing from a ramp or channelized turn lane or channelized entering lane to the adjacent through lane or lanes or vice versa.(c) The owner of any obstruction removed pursuant to this section shall be liable for a civil fine of $25 for each item so removed, payable to the Department. Justices of the Peace shall have original jurisdiction for any court proceedings relating to this fine. No owner of any such obstruction shall be entitled to the return of any removed obstruction without proof of payment of all outstanding fines.(d) Recovery by the owner of any artificial obstruction removed by the Department under this section shall be subject to the payment of a $15 recovery fee per obstruction. If the owner does not pay the fee and recover the obstruction within 30 days of its removal, the Department shall dispose of the obstruction in the exercise of its reasonable discretion. The Department may also take such legal steps as it deems necessary and proper to collect these recovery fees, including but not limited to a debt action in the courts of this State.71 Del. Laws, c. 318,\n\n§\n\n 7;75 Del. Laws, c. 98,\n\n§§\n\n 122, 123;79 Del. Laws, c. 310,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n526. Restrictions against commercial use of State rights-of-way; site-based enforcement mechanisms.(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, there shall be no commercial activity within any rights-of-way under the Department’s jurisdiction in the unincorporated areas of the State. As used herein, “commercial activity” includes, without limitation, such activities as the placement of news boxes in such rights-of-way for the sale of newspapers, the placement of vending machines in such rights-of-way for the sale of goods, the placement of commercial advertising signs in such rights-of-way or the sale of goods from vehicles parked within such rights-of-way. If a commercial activity occurs within the clear zone of any such rights-of-way, the Department shall treat the machines, fixtures, signs or other materials used in such activity as an artificial obstruction under § 525 of this title, and may undertake the immediate removal of said materials as authorized therein.(b) Any of the following commercial uses of the rights-of-way shall be subject to enforcement under Chapter 11 of this title:(1) Commercial activities occurring outside the clear zone; or(2) The placement of nonofficial signs outside the clear zone; or(3) The placement of vending machines at designated locations at safety roadside rest areas, as permitted by § 132(c)(14) of this title; or(4) The placement of news boxes outside the clear zone; or(5) Signs displayed on any school bus waiting shelter located with the approval of the Department of Education; or(6) Nonofficial signs displayed on transit shelters pursuant to Department-approved contracts.71 Del.

Restrictions against vehicle sales activities on State rights-of-way.(a) No vehicle shall be left unattended on a state right-of-way for the purpose of selling such vehicle.(b) If a duly authorized employee of the Department of Transportation or a police officer shall determine that an unattended vehicle is on state right-of-way in violation of subsection (a) of this section, the vehicle may be removed from that location without prior notice to the registered owner of the vehicle, and taken to a private storage area maintained for the safe storage of vehicles, as prescribed by the towing and storage procedures in current use by the Delaware State Police or the Department of Transportation. Any costs of the removal and storage shall be borne by the registered owner of said vehicle, who shall be held prima facie responsible for the violation of this section.(c) The registered owner of any vehicle towed from a state right-of-way pursuant to this section shall also be subject to the enforcement provisions of § 4181 of Title 21.(d) This section shall not apply to vehicles left unattended on a state right-of-way due to the presence of a disabling condition or otherwise legally parked on the right-of-way.74 Del.
