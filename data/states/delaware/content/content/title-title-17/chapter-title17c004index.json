Purpose.Substantial and accumulated annual increases experienced in highway traffic for the United States as a whole and particularly for Delaware plus the concentration of interstate traffic flow through Delaware caused by the construction of the Delaware Memorial Bridge and the New Jersey Turnpike have forced upon the State the need for new construction and reconstruction of highway facilities out of all proportion to funds available to the State Highway Department. Presently scheduled express highway construction in the adjoining states of Maryland and Pennsylvania will very shortly bring to the boundaries of Delaware increased interstate traffic. To provide supplemental funds for certain highway construction and reconstruction, to provide for payment of a proportionate share of such highway construction and reconstruction costs by the interstate traffic which is producing the need for such added expenditures and to enable the State to discharge the obligations which this traffic has imposed upon it, the Delaware Memorial Bridge Division of the State Highway Department (originally created as the Delaware Crossing Division under authority of 46 Del. Laws, c. 193, which as amended and revised appears as Chapter 3 of this title) is reorganized and reconstituted within the Department of Transportation with the powers and duties specified in this chapter.17 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 402;50 Del. Laws, c. 492,\n\n§\n\n 1;57 Del. Laws, c. 671,\n\n§\n\n 3C;60 Del. Laws, c. 503,\n\n§\n\n 18;§\n\n403. Control, operation and revenues of Delaware Memorial Bridge and approaches vested in Department.The control, operation, tolls and other revenues of the Delaware Memorial Bridge and its approaches, and all of the real and personal property appurtenant thereto or used in connection therewith, shall vest in the Department subject to the rights of the holders of outstanding Delaware Memorial Bridge Revenue Bonds of the State issued prior to July 27, 1955, under the authority of 45 Del. Laws, c. 275 as amended, and the State covenants that the control, operation, tolls and other revenues of said Delaware Memorial Bridge, its approaches and all real and personal property appurtenant thereto or used in connection therewith shall remain vested in the Department so long as said bonds or any bonds issued under the authority of this chapter shall remain outstanding and unpaid, or until all of the Delaware Memorial Bridge Revenue Bonds issued under authority of 45 Del. Laws, c. 275 as amended, have been paid in full or provision shall have been made for the payment thereof in the manner provided by the indenture between the Department and the Equitable Trust Company of Wilmington, Delaware, dated June 1, 1948, and the supplemental indentures between said Department and said Equitable Trust Company, dated June 1, 1951 and January 1, 1952, securing the payment of the Delaware Memorial Bridge Revenue Bonds now outstanding. The Delaware Memorial Bridge shall be operated and extensions and improvements made thereto and the tolls and revenue derived therefrom accounted for and applied in strict conformity with said indenture and supplemental indentures.17 Del.

The Department may construct on such property at locations it deems appropriate connecting service roads parallel to such express highways in such manner as to facilitate the establishment and operation of competitive commercial enterprises for serving motorists on private property abutting such service roads. The cost of such parallel service roads may be included in the cost of construction, reconstruction or improvement of expressways authorized in this chapter. In considering any construction, reconstruction or improvement of highways as herein authorized, the Department shall give first consideration to express highways for the use of traffic to and from the Delaware Memorial Bridge.17 Del.
