Purpose.The purpose of this Compact is to protect the public through verification of competency and ensure accountability for patient care related activities of all states’ licensed emergency medical services (EMS) personnel, such as emergency medical technicians (EMTs), advanced EMTs, and paramedics. This Compact is intended to facilitate the day-to-day movement of EMS personnel across state boundaries in the performance of their EMS duties as assigned by an appropriate authority and authorize state EMS offices to afford immediate legal recognition to EMS personnel licensed in a member state. This Compact recognizes that states have a vested interest in protecting the public’s health and safety through their licensing and regulation of EMS personnel and that such state regulation shared among the member states will best protect public health and safety. This Compact is designed to achieve the following purposes and objectives:1. Increase public access to EMS personnel.2. Enhance the states’ ability to protect the public’s health and safety, especially patient safety.3. Encourage the cooperation of member states in the areas of EMS personnel licensure and regulation.4. Support licensing of military members who are separating from an active duty tour and the spouses of military members.5. Facilitate the exchange of information between member states regarding EMS personnel licensure, adverse action, and significant investigatory information.6. Promote compliance with the laws governing EMS personnel practice in each member state.7. Invest all member states with the authority to hold EMS personnel accountable through the mutual recognition of member state licenses.81 Del. Laws, c. 178,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n98A-102.

Oversight, dispute resolution, and enforcement.A.Oversight. —1. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the Compact’s purposes and intent. The provisions of this Compact and the rules promulgated under the Compact shall have standing as statutory law.2. All courts shall take judicial notice of the Compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this Compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the Commission.3. The Commission is entitled to receive service of process in any judicial or administrative proceeding and has standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the Commission renders a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated rules.B.Default, technical assistance, and termination. —1. If the Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated rules, the Commission shall do all of the following:a.

If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.3. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. The Commission shall give notice of intent to suspend or terminate to the governor of the defaulting state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, and each of the member states.4. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.5. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting state.6. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices. The court shall award all costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees, to the prevailing party.C.Dispute resolution. —1. Upon request by a member state, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.2. The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.D.Enforcement. —1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this Compact.2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the Compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. If judicial enforcement is necessary, the court shall award all costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, to the prevailing party.3. The remedies contained in this section shall not be the exclusive remedies available to the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.81 Del. Laws, c. 178,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n98A-114. Date of implementation of the Interstate Commission for EMS Personnel Practice and associated rules, withdrawal, and amendment.A. The Compact takes effect on the date on which the Compact statute is enacted into law in the tenth member state. The provisions that become effective at that time are limited to the powers granted to the Commission relating to assembly and the promulgation of rules. Thereafter, the Commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to implement and administer the Compact.B. Any state that joins the Compact after the Commission’s initial adoption of the rules is subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission has the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that state.C. Any member state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the statute.1. A member state’s withdrawal shall not take effect until 6 months after enactment of the repealing statute.2. Withdrawal does not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state’s EMS authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.D. Nothing contained in this Compact invalidates or prevents any EMS personnel licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.E. The member states may amend the Compact. An amendment to this Compact is not effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.81 Del. Laws, c. 178,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n98A-115. Construction and severability.This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes of the Compact. If a court finds that this Compact is contrary to the constitution of any member state, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states. Nothing in this Compact supersedes state law or rules related to licensure of EMS agencies.81 Del. Laws, c. 178,\n\n§\n\n 1;",
