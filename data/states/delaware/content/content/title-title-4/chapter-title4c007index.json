Retaliatory beer tax and regulations; violations by out-of-state manufacturers of beer; hearing, penalties and appeal.(a) In addition to compliance with all other provisions of this title, the Commissioner shall require each person, not a licensee of this State, who desires to sell beer manufactured outside this State to licensees of this State, to pay to the Commissioner the same fee or fees as are required to be paid in the State, territory or country of origin of such beer by a person, not a licensee thereof, who desires to sell beer manufactured in this State to licensees of such state, territory or country of origin, and to observe and comply with the same regulations, prohibitions and restrictions as are required of or enforced against a person who desires to sell beer manufactured in this State to licensees in the said state, territory or country of origin. In all cases where the Commissioner has issued any reciprocal regulations or orders concerning beer manufactured in any state, territory or country other than this State no licensee of this State shall purchase any such beer if its importation has been prohibited or if not entirely prohibited, unless such regulations or orders have been observed and complied with by the licensee of this State and by the person from or through whom the licensee of this State desires to purchase. Any beer manufactured outside of this State which is sold, transported or possessed in this State contrary to any such regulations or orders of the Commissioner or without the payment of the fees required by this title shall be considered contraband and shall be confiscated by the Commissioner and disposed of in the same manner as any other illegal alcoholic liquors.(b) Upon learning of the Commissioner by a manufacturer of beer whose principal place of business is outside this State or by any servant, agent, employee or representative of such manufacturer within or partly within and partly outside this State of any violation of this title or any laws of this State relating to alcoholic liquors, or of any regulation of the Commissioner adopted pursuant thereto, or of any violation of any laws of this State or of the United States of America relating to the tax payment of alcoholic liquors, the Commissioner shall cite such manufacturer to appear before it not less than 10 nor more than 15 days from the date of mailing to such manufacturer at such manufacturer’s principal place of business wherever located by registered mail a notice to show cause why the further importation into this State of beer manufactured by such manufacturer should not be prohibited. Upon such hearing, whether or not an appearance was made by such outside manufacturer, if satisfied that any such violation has occurred, the Commissioner shall immediately issue an order prohibiting the importation of beer manufactured by such manufacturer into this State for a period of not less than 6 months nor more than 3 years. Notice of such action of the Commissioner shall be given immediately to such manufacturer and to all persons licensed to import beer within this State by mailing a copy of such order to such manufacturer at its principal place of business wherever located and to such licensees at their licensed premises. Thereafter no person licensed to import beer within this State shall purchase or sell any beer manufactured by such outside manufacturer during the term of the prohibition. Any violation of the prohibitory order is a misdemeanor and also constitutes grounds for revocation or suspension of a license to import beer. In all such cases the Commissioner shall file of record at least a brief statement in the form of an opinion of the reasons for the ruling or order. Any outside manufacturer aggrieved by the action of the Commissioner may appeal to the Superior Court in the same manner as provided in § 541 of this title for appeals from refusals to grant licenses.38 Del.

Preparations containing alcoholic liquors but not intended for use as a beverage.(a) No provision of this title shall, by reason only of the fact that the product contains alcoholic liquor, prevent any of the following:(1) The sale of any perfume, lotion, tincture, varnish, dressing, fluid extract or essence, vinegar, cream, ointment, salve, distillate, cooking wine, or decoction.(2) The sale of any preparation (official, medicinal, or pharmaceutical) or of any patent or proprietary medicine, intended solely for medicinal purposes, if the product does not contain alcohol in any greater quantity than the amount required as a solvent or preservative, or if the product be so compounded as to render it unsuitable for use as a beverage.(b) If the Division of Alcohol and Tobacco Enforcement (DATE) is of the opinion that one of the products enumerated in this section contains alcoholic liquor and is used for beverage purposes, it may notify the manufacturer or seller to that effect and from and after the date of such notice this title shall apply to such product unless the manufacturer or seller requests a hearing before the Commissioner within 20 days of receipt of the notice. If the manufacturer or seller does not request a hearing within 20 days of the notice, or the Commissioner determines after the hearing that the product is used for beverage purposes, the manufacturer or seller so notified commits an offense under this title if the manufacturer or seller sells the product after such notice or determination, and is liable to the penalties provided in § 902 of this title.(c) (1) In order to determine whether any particular preparation, proprietary or patented, contains alcohol in excess of the amount required as a solvent or preservative, or whether it is so compounded as to render it unsuitable for use as a beverage, DATE may purchase a sample of such preparation from any person and may have it analyzed by any individual DATE selects.(2) If it appears from the analysis of the sample that the preparation contains alcohol in excess of the amount required as a solvent or preservative, or that it is not so compounded as to render it unsuitable for use as a beverage, DATE may notify the manufacturer or the agent in this State of the manufacturer of the preparation or the person who has acquired the preparation for purpose of resale, that the preparation is not an exempt product within the meaning of this section, but is an alcoholic liquor to which this title applies. After the service of such notice, this title shall apply to such preparation and the manufacturer or the agent in this State of the manufacturer or the person who has acquired same to resell, who has been so notified, commits an offense under this title unless a hearing is requested before the Commissioner within 20 days of receipt of the notice. If a hearing is not requested within 20 days of the notice, or the Commissioner determines after the hearing that the preparation is used for beverage purposes, the manufacturer or the agent in this State of the manufacturer of the preparation or the person who has acquired the preparation for purpose of resale commits an offense under this title if that person sells the preparation after the date of the service upon that person of the notice or determination.(3) The notice required by this section shall consist of a letter from the Director of DATE stating that the preparation specified in the letter is not an exempt product in the sense of this section, but is an alcoholic liquor to which this title applies. The notice must be served by hand delivery or by sending a copy by certified mail to the manufacturer, or to the agent in this State of the manufacturer, or to the person who has acquired the preparation to resell.(d) This section applies to every product which is included within the definition of the word “preparation” set forth in § 101 of this title and to every product which is defined or described in subsection (a) of this section, other than one which is prepared by a druggist at the time of the prescription of a physician and in accordance with its tenor or which is prepared by a physician for the use only of a patient actually under the physician’s care.38 Del.
