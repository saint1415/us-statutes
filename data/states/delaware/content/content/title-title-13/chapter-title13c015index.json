Alimony in divorce and annulment actions; award; limitations.(a) The Court may award interim alimony to a dependent party during the pendency of an action for divorce or annulment.(b) A party may be awarded alimony only if such party is a dependent party after consideration of all relevant factors contained in subsection (c) of this section in that the party:(1) Is dependent upon the other party for support and the other party is not contractually or otherwise obligated to provide that support after the entry of a decree of divorce or annulment;(2) Lacks sufficient property, including any award of marital property made by the Court, to provide for such party’s own reasonable needs; and(3) Is unable to support the party’s own self through appropriate employment or is the custodian of a child whose condition or circumstances make it appropriate that the party not be required to seek employment.(c) The alimony order shall be in such amount and for such time as the Court deems just, without regard to marital misconduct, after consideration of all relevant factors, including, but not limited to:(1) The financial resources of the party seeking alimony, including the marital or separate property apportioned to such party, and such party’s ability to meet all or part of such party’s own reasonable needs independently;(2) The time necessary and expense required to acquire sufficient education or training to enable the party seeking alimony to find appropriate employment;(3) The standard of living established during the marriage;(4) The duration of the marriage;(5) The age, physical and emotional condition of both parties;(6) Any financial or other contribution made by either party to the education, training, vocational skills, career or earning capacity of the other party;(7) The ability of the other party to meet that other party’s own needs while paying alimony;(8) Tax consequences;(9) Whether either party has foregone or postponed economic, education or other employment opportunities during the course of the marriage; and(10) Any other factor which the Court expressly finds is just and appropriate to consider.(d) A person shall be eligible for alimony for a period not to exceed 50% of the term of the marriage with the exception that if a party is married for 20 years or longer, there shall be no time limit as to such party’s eligibility; however, the factors contained in subsection (c) of this section shall apply and shall be considered by the Court.(e) Any person awarded alimony has a continuing affirmative obligation to make good faith efforts to seek appropriate vocational training, if necessary, and employment unless the Court specifically finds, after a hearing, that it would be inequitable to require a person awarded alimony to do so:(1) At any time, due toa. A severe and incapacitating mental or physical illness or disability orb. Such person’s age, or(2) Immediately, after consideration of the needs of a minor child or children living with the person awarded alimony.(f) A party who has in writing before, during or after the marriage waived or released such party’s own right to alimony shall have no remedy under this section.(g) Unless the parties agree otherwise in writing, the obligation to pay future alimony is terminated upon the death of either party or the remarriage or cohabitation of the party receiving alimony. As used in this section, “cohabitation” means regularly residing with an adult of the same or opposite sex, if the parties hold themselves out as a couple, and regardless of whether the relationship confers a financial benefit on the party receiving alimony. Proof of sexual relations is admissible but not required to prove cohabitation. A party receiving alimony shall promptly notify the other party of remarriage or cohabitation.13 Del.

Disposition of marital property; imposition of lien; insurance policies.(a) In a proceeding for divorce or annulment, the Court shall, upon request of either party, equitably divide, distribute and assign the marital property between the parties without regard to marital misconduct, in such proportions as the Court deems just after considering all relevant factors including:(1) The length of the marriage;(2) Any prior marriage of the party;(3) The age, health, station, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties;(4) Whether the property award is in lieu of or in addition to alimony;(5) The opportunity of each for future acquisitions of capital assets and income;(6) The contribution or dissipation of each party in the acquisition, preservation, depreciation or appreciation of the marital property, including the contribution of a party as homemaker, husband, or wife;(7) The value of the property set apart to each party;(8) The economic circumstances of each party at the time the division of property is to become effective, including the desirability of awarding the family home or the right to live therein for reasonable periods to the party with whom any children of the marriage will live;(9) Whether the property was acquired by gift, except those gifts excluded by paragraph (b)(1) of this section;(10) The debts of the parties; and(11) Tax consequences.(b) For purposes of this chapter only, “marital property” means all of the following:(1) All property acquired by either party subsequent to the marriage, except any of the following:a. Property acquired by an individual spouse by bequest, devise, or descent or by gift, including a gift in trust (but excluding gifts between spouses that are made outright and free from trust), if any of the following apply:1. The gifted property is titled and maintained in the sole name of the donee spouse.2. The gifted property is held in a trust created by another person, of which trust the donee spouse is a beneficiary, regardless of whether other individuals are beneficiaries of the same trust.3. A gift tax return is filed reporting the transfer of the gifted property in the sole name of the donee spouse or in a trust of which the donee spouse is a beneficiary.4. A notarized or other validly-executed document, executed before or contemporaneously with the transfer, is offered demonstrating the nature of the transfer.5. Unless the trust instrument expressly provides otherwise, the gifted property is held in a trust created by a donor spouse, of which trust the donee spouse is a beneficiary, regardless of whether other individuals are beneficiaries of the same trust.b. Property acquired in exchange for property acquired prior to the marriage.c. Property excluded by valid agreement of the parties.d. The increase in value of property acquired prior to the marriage.(2) All jointly-titled real property acquired by the parties prior to their marriage, unless excluded by valid agreement of the parties. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), “jointly-titled real property” includes joint tenancy, tenancy in common, and any other form of co-ownership.(c) All property acquired by either party subsequent to the marriage is presumed to be marital property regardless of whether title is held individually or by the parties in some form of co-ownership such as joint tenancy, tenancy in common or tenancy by the entirety. The presumption of marital property is overcome by a showing that the property was acquired by a method listed in paragraphs (b)(1)a. through d. of this section. Property transferred by gift from 1 spouse to the other during the marriage is marital property.(d) The Court may also impose a lien or charge upon the marital property assigned to a party as security for the payment of alimony or other allowance or award for the other party.(e) The Court may also direct the continued maintenance and beneficiary designations of existing policies insuring the life of either party. The Court’s power under this subsection shall extend only to policies originally purchased during the marriage and owned by or within the effective control of either party.(f) The Court may order a party to execute and deliver any deed, document or other paper necessary to effectuate an order entered under this chapter, and if the party so ordered fails to do what such party has been ordered to do, the Court, in addition to any penalty or sanction it may decide to impose upon that party for such disobedience, may direct the Clerk of the Court to do what the party was ordered to do, and such performance by the Clerk shall be as effective as the performance of the party would have been.(g) (1) If the Court finds that a companion animal of the parties is marital property, it shall award ownership of and responsibility for the companion animal to 1 or both of the parties and may include responsibility for veterinary or other extraordinary expenses.(2) In issuing an order under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the Court shall take into consideration the well-being of the companion animal. In determining the well-being of the companion animal, the Court may consider factors such as:a. The ability of each party to own, support, and provide necessary care for the companion animal.b. The attachment between the companion animal and each of the parties.c. The time and effort each party spent with the companion animal during the marriage tending to the companion animal’s needs.(3) If the parties are awarded a shared interest in a companion animal, the Court shall limit the subsequent disposition of the companion animal to the following:a. The parties may jointly transfer their combined interests to a third party.b. One party may in writing irrevocably surrender their interest to the other party.c. Upon the death of 1 party, all interest shall transfer to the surviving party.d. Upon a substantial change of circumstances, either party may petition the Family Court to be awarded sole ownership based upon the welfare of the companion animal and the totality of the circumstances.(h) A spouse’s beneficial interest in property held in a trust created by another person, which property interest is described in § 3315(b) of Title 12, is not property acquired by the spouse.24 Del.

The Court may order that the amount be paid directly to the attorney, who may enforce the order in such attorney’s own name.Code 1915,\n\n§\n\n 3015; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 3508; \n\n13 Del.

Laws, c. 59,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1517. Contested and noncontested petitions; opportunity for counseling; review of record; disposition of prayers for relief.(a) Whenever the petition for divorce or annulment is not contested by respondent, the allegations thereof are presumed to be accurate and true, and the Court shall rule upon the petition either after a hearing at which only petitioner need testify, or without a hearing after the submission of a request for finalization and affidavit which reaffirms the petition and verifies service of process and military status of the respondent. If petitioner’s testimony or the affidavit fails to support the petition in any essential respect, the Court may deny the petition or require corroborating testimony or other evidence before ruling thereon.(b) In contested cases, after a hearing the Court shall:(1) Rule upon the petition; or(2) Continue the matter with the consent of both parties for further hearing not more than 60 days later so that the parties may seek counseling, either with a qualified private counselor or an accredited counseling agency, public or private. No party who objects shall be forced to submit to counseling, and all counseling or interviews shall be confidential and privileged and only the fact that further efforts at reconciliation are impractical or not in the interest of the parties shall be reported to the Court. At the adjourned hearing the Court shall finally determine whether the marriage is irretrievably broken.(c) Before entering a decree the Court shall review the record to determine that:(1) The averments of the petition satisfy § 1504(a), § 1505 or § 1506, and § 1507 of this title;(2) Jurisdiction has been acquired over respondent under § 1508 of this title;(3) In uncontested cases, whether the time for respondent to file a responsive pleading has expired;(4) The parties to a divorce proceeding have continued to be separated since the commencement of this action, except as § 1505(e) of this title may apply;(5) A certified copy of the parties’ marriage record has been filed; and(6) The affidavit of nonmilitary service, wherever required by federal statute, has been filed.(d) Where either party has requested property disposition, alimony or other relief provided for in this title, and a decree of divorce or annulment shall be entered, or if such a decree is refused and, nevertheless, the Court deems it appropriate to enter an order concerning some or all of the relief requested, the Court shall finally determine such requests for relief.59 Del.

Decree in divorce or annulment proceedings; costs; notice of entry; effect on mentally incompetent spouse; effect on subsequent petitions; temporary alimony.(a) A decree granting or denying a petition for divorce or annulment is final when entered, subject to the right of appeal. An appeal that does not challenge the decree of divorce or annulment, but challenges only rulings with respect to relief awarded under other sections of this chapter, or other matters incidental or collateral to such decree, shall not delay the finality of the decree of divorce or annulment, and the parties may remarry while the appeal is pending.(b) Whenever the Court enters a decree granting a petition for divorce or annulment, a certified copy of such decree shall be made available to the parties within 30 days after such ruling; but following a contested proceeding, such a copy of the decree shall only be made available to the parties 30 days after such ruling, and after the furnishing of such proof as the Court may require that no appeal challenging the decree of divorce or annulment is pending.(c) In the decree granting or denying a petition for divorce or annulment, or by separate order or orders preceding or following such decree, the Court shall dispose of all other prayers for relief, where appropriate under the facts and law; but an application for such relief and a hearing thereon must be presented in the petition or response, or by motion after notice to the other party prior to the entry or denial of such decree.(d) Court costs, including any fee for the services of an attorney allowed by the Court, shall be taxed by the Court at or about the time of the granting or denial of the decree of divorce or annulment, at the time of disposition of other prayers for relief in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, following the disposition of an appeal, or at such other time or times as the Court may deem appropriate.(e) The Clerk of the Family Court shall give notice of the entry of a decree of divorce or annulment:(1) If the marriage is registered in this State, to the clerk of the peace of the county where the marriage is registered and such clerk shall enter the fact of divorce or annulment in such clerk’s records; or(2) If the marriage is registered in another jurisdiction, to the appropriate official of that jurisdiction, with the request that such official enter the fact of divorce or annulment in the appropriate record.(f) No decree that may enter shall relieve a spouse from any obligation imposed by law as a result of the marriage for the support or maintenance of a spouse adjudicated to be mentally incompetent prior to the decree, unless such spouse has sufficient property or means of support.(g) A decree denying a petition for divorce or annulment shall not foreclose a subsequent petition for such relief if the subsequent petition involves factual or legal premises not directly or by necessary implication decided by the decree on the former petition.(h) [Repealed.]24 Del.
