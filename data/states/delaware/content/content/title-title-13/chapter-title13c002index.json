Civil unions shall be solemnized in the presence of at least 2 reputable witnesses who shall sign the certificate of civil union as prescribed by this chapter. Solemnization may be entirely secular or may be performed according to the forms and usages of any religious society. No civil union shall be solemnized without the production of a license issued pursuant to this chapter.(c) Other than as provided in this subsection, nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person authorized to perform solemnizations of marriages or civil unions to perform a solemnization of a civil union, and no such authorized person who fails or refuses for any reason to join persons in a civil union shall be subject to any fine or other penalty for such failure or refusal. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a clerk of the peace or deputy thereof who issues a civil union license shall be required to perform a solemnization of such civil union if requested by the applicants for such license, and such solemnization shall be afforded the same order of priority as solemnization of marriages pursuant to Chapter 1 of this title.

Laws, c. 22,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;79 Del. Laws, c. 19,\n\n§\n\n 5;84 Del. Laws, c. 42,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n206.

A civil union license, when issued by the clerk of the peace, is sufficient authority for any person authorized to perform a civil union solemnization in this State to join the parties in a civil union. A civil union license issued pursuant to this chapter shall entitle the parties thereto, subject to the other provisions of this chapter, to enter into a civil union within 30 days from the date of issuance. In the event the civil union is not solemnized within 30 days of the issuance of said license, said license shall be void and the parties must reapply to the appropriate issuing officer for another license to enter into a civil union. The procedure to secure another license shall be the same as that provided for the initial application.(d) The clerk of the peace in each county for good cause being shown may:(1) Shorten the time period specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section; or(2) Lengthen the time period specified in subsection (c) of this section not to exceed 180 days.(e) No civil union license shall be issued by a clerk of the peace when either of the parties applying for a civil union license, at the time of making the application, is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a narcotic drug or if papers that are required by this chapter are not delivered or if the issuing officer believes there is any legal impediment, as defined in this chapter, to the civil union of such parties.(f) The number on the civil union license shall be filled in by the issuing clerk of the peace, unless it has been previously affixed and shall be the same number as that appearing on the application for such license. All blanks provided on the civil union license shall be filled in by the issuing clerk of the peace. The issuing clerk of the peace shall immediately note the issuance of a civil union license in the appropriate books prescribed by the Department of Health and Social Services.(g) Any clerk of the peace or deputy of such who knowingly or wilfully acts in violation of this chapter shall be fined $100, and in default of payment of such fine, shall be imprisoned not more than 30 days. The Superior Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over all proceedings for violations of this section.78 Del. Laws, c. 22,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n207. Application for license for persons who wish to enter into a civil union.(a) Before any civil union license shall be issued by the issuing officer, the parties desiring to enter into a civil union shall together appear before such officer to be examined upon oath or affirmation in the presence and hearing of each other according to the form prescribed by subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section to which the parties applying for the license shall subscribe their names. The license shall be issued only after it has been made to appear that no legal impediment to the proposed civil union exists. In the case of critical illness of 1 of the parties desiring to enter into a civil union, the physician attending such party may appear for the ill party and make an application for a civil union license for such party, if such physician first makes an affidavit and delivers it to the issuing officer stating that in the opinion of said physician the party for whom said physician is acting is at the point of death and that this person may lawfully enter into a civil union. The application for the civil union license shall be altered in such case to show that said physician acted as proxy and the affidavit of the physician shall be filed with the application.(b) The civil union license application shall be in the form prescribed and provided by the Department of Health and Social Services and shall be permanently preserved by the issuing officer in the manner as prescribed by the Department of Health and Social Services. The civil union license application shall include the following information and such other information as prescribed by the Department of Health and Social Services; provided that such other information is also required for marriage license applications under Chapter 1 of this title: date of application; full name, sex, race, Social Security number, birth date and occupation of applicants; names and addresses of parents of applicants; date and place of previous civil unions, domestic partnerships or marriages and termination of previous civil unions, domestic partnerships or marriages; place and court where applicants are on probation or parole, if such they be; and time of application.(c) The application shall contain a certification by each applicant that each applicant is not of a prohibited degree of relationship.(d) The applicants and issuing officer shall sign the application and the issuing officer shall certify as follows:“I believe neither party is now under the influence of intoxicating liquor nor a narcotic drug. I have demanded and examined such papers as required by law and I am satisfied that they are properly executed. I know of no legal impediment to the proposed civil union of the above applicants.”The application shall also contain an appropriate affidavit form to be signed by persons certifying that an applicant is a resident of the State, if such a certification is required.(e) In the case of applicants for a civil union license who claim to be residents of this State, if neither of them is personally known to the civil union license issuing officer as a resident of this State, at least 1 of such applicants must be identified as a resident of this State to the satisfaction of the issuing officer by a reputable guarantor, who under oath shall fill in the proper portion on the page in the Civil Union Record Books and shall duly sign it.(f) Every person authorized by this chapter to issue civil union licenses may administer oaths or affirmations to the parties applying for the license.(g) Civil union licenses, and other forms and books used in connection with the issuance of civil union licenses shall be furnished by the Department of Health and Social Services on request of the clerks of the peace. Each page of the Civil Union Record Books for the use of the clerks of the peace shall be numbered serially before delivery to the clerks of the peace.(h) Clerks of the peace shall examine and satisfy themselves of the validity of papers submitted to them by divorced persons, past or present patients of insane asylums, persons on probation or parole and shall file such papers in the office of the recorder of the appropriate county. Such papers shall constitute a part of the application for civil union license, but shall be open to inspection of the public only upon order of the resident judge of the proper county or such person as the judge may appoint to give such orders.(i) Judges shall supply certificates in whatever form they see fit to such divorced persons as they believe should receive them under this chapter.(j) Superintendents of asylums for the insane shall supply certificates in whatever form they see fit to such persons as they believe should receive them under this chapter.(k) In the case of any adult person who is on probation or parole from any court or institution, the chief officer of such court or institution, or such person as such officer may appoint to give consent to enter into a civil union, shall supply such consent in whatever form such officer deems advisable to such applicants for civil union license as such officer believes may properly enter into a civil union.78 Del. Laws, c. 22,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n208. Forms for civil union license; certification of civil union.(a) The Department of Health and Social Services shall prescribe a civil union license form which shall be issued by the several clerks of the peace and such other forms, books, dockets and records as may be necessary to properly record civil unions and the issuance of civil union licenses. The civil union license shall contain language authorizing any clergy or other person authorized by the law of this State to solemnize a civil union and shall show: The earliest and latest time the solemnization of the civil union may be performed pursuant to the license, the place of issuance of the license, the names of the parties, the signature of the issuing authority and such other wording as the Department of Health and Social Services may prescribe, but not to exceed information collected for a marriage license under Chapter 1 of this title except as required to confirm eligibility under § 202 of this title. The license shall also contain a form of certification by the person performing the solemnization ceremony that the solemnization ceremony was performed and the date and time of such solemnization ceremony.(b) The Department of Health and Social Services shall furnish to all persons authorized by law to solemnize civil unions a suitable form for evidencing a civil union and the date and the place thereof, which form shall be completed and delivered without charge to one party to the civil union by the person performing the solemnization ceremony immediately after the solemnization ceremony. Such form may, but need not be, the original or a copy of the civil union license.78 Del. Laws, c. 22,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n209.

The clerk of the peace shall immediately enter in the books prescribed by the Department of Health and Social Services to record civil unions the date of the civil union solemnization and the name of the person performing the civil union solemnization.(b) If any person who has solemnized a civil union fails to return the certificate of civil union to the issuing clerk of the peace for recording as required under subsection (a) of this section within 15 days of the solemnization of the civil union, the parties joined in the civil union may provide the clerk of the peace with a notarized affidavit attesting to the fact that they were joined in a civil union and stating the date and place of the solemnization of the civil union and the name of the person performing such solemnization. Upon the recording of that affidavit by the clerk of the peace, the civil union of the parties shall be deemed to be valid as of the date of the solemnization of the civil union stated in the affidavit.(c) The certificate required by subsection (a) of this section or an affidavit recorded pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.(d) Any person solemnizing a civil union in this State who fails to return the certificate of civil union to the issuing clerk of the peace for recording within 15 days of the solemnization of the civil union shall be assessed a $50 late fee by the issuing clerk of the peace. Any person with an unpaid civil penalty assessed by a clerk of the peace shall have that person’s authorization to solemnize civil unions in the State suspended until such penalty is paid in full.(e) The person performing the civil union ceremony shall retain the original or a copy of the civil union license, as the Department of Health and Social Services shall direct, for not less than 1 year after the ceremony.(f) The books, forms and records as may be prescribed by the Department of Health and Social Services for civil unions shall be kept by the issuing clerk of the peace in the issuing clerk of the peace’s office.

The Superior Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over all proceedings for violations of this section.78 Del. Laws, c. 22,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n211. Performance of civil union solemnization in violation of chapter; false certificate of civil union; penalties.Any person or religious society having authority to solemnize civil unions who performs a civil union solemnization without the presentation of a license issued pursuant to this chapter, or who performs the same prior to the expiration of 24 hours from the time of the issuance of the license or more than 30 days after the time of the issuance of the license, shall be imprisoned not more than 6 months or fined not more than $500, or both.

Laws, c. 22,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n215.

All persons who enter into a civil union solemnized in this State consent to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Family Court for all proceedings for divorce and annulment of such civil union, even if 1 or both parties no longer reside in this State. If neither of the parties to a civil union solemnized in this State reside in this State, any petition for divorce or annulment of such civil union shall be filed in the county in which 1 or both of such parties last resided in this State.78 Del.

Upon application for a marriage license in accordance with such procedures, such parties shall be issued a certificate of marriage and the civil union of such parties shall be converted to a marriage by operation of law. For all purposes of the laws of this State, the effective date of such marriage shall be deemed to be the date of solemnization of such original civil union.Alternatively, on or after July 1, 2013, and prior to July 1, 2014, both parties to a civil union entered into pursuant to this chapter may apply to the clerk of the peace, in the county in which their civil union license was issued, for a marriage license pursuant to Chapter 1 of this title and such parties may have such marriage solemnized, prior to July 1, 2014, pursuant to Chapter 1 of this title, provided that such persons are otherwise eligible to marry under § 101 of this title, such civil union has not been previously dissolved or annulled, and such civil union is not subject to a pending proceeding for dissolution, annulment or legal separation.

Upon application by either party to the clerk of the peace of the county in which their civil union license was issued, in accordance with procedures established by such clerk of the peace, such party shall be issued a certificate of marriage, without any requirement for solemnization of such marriage. For all purposes of the laws of this State, the effective date of such marriage shall be deemed to be the date of solemnization of such original civil union.(d) Notwithstanding subsection (c) of this section, parties to a civil union with respect to which a proceeding for dissolution, annulment or legal separation is pending on July 1, 2014, shall not be deemed to be married on such date and their civil union shall not be converted to a marriage by operation of law pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, and such civil union shall continue to be governed by the provisions of Chapter 2 of this title and the laws relating to civil unions in effect prior to July 1, 2013; provided, however, that if any such proceeding is terminated without resulting in the dissolution or annulment of the civil union and the parties remain in a civil union, such civil union shall be automatically converted to a marriage by operation of law. Upon application by either party to the clerk of the peace of the county in which their civil union license was issued, in accordance with procedures established by such clerk of the peace, such party shall be issued a certificate of marriage, without requirement of solemnization of such marriage. For all purposes of the laws of this State, the effective date of such marriage shall be deemed to be the date of solemnization of such original civil union.(e) For purposes of determining the legal rights and responsibilities of parties to a civil union entered into in this State that has been converted to a marriage under this chapter, the date of the solemnization of the original civil union shall be the date by which the origination of legal rights and responsibilities are determined.79 Del.
