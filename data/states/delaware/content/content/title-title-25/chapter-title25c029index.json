Attachment of lien to proceeds of sale.In case any real estate upon which a tax lien exists is sold by an order of the Court of Chancery directing an executor or administrator to sell the real estate to pay the debts of a deceased person or is sold by virtue of an execution process, such tax lien shall be transferred to the fund arising from such sale in the hands of the officer making the sale, and the real estate so sold shall be discharged therefrom. If the fund is not sufficient to pay and discharge the tax lien, by reason of the real estate having been sold subject to another or other lien or liens created by the taxable, the unpaid balance of the tax shall remain a lien upon the land so sold.15 Del. Laws, c. 476;16 Del. Laws, c. 141;19 Del. Laws, c. 262; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 2870;40 Del. Laws, c. 238,\n\n§\n\n 3; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 3351; \n\n25 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2902;§\n\n2903. Duration of lien.(a) In New Castle County, all taxes assessed against real estate shall continue a lien against the real estate within the County for 10 years from July 1 of the year for which the taxes were levied, but if the real estate remains the property of the person who was the owner at the time it was assessed, the lien shall continue until the tax is collected.(b) In Kent and Sussex Counties, the lien for county taxes shall be as provided for under § 8705 of Title 9, and the lien for state taxes shall remain a lien as provided for under § 554 of Title 30, and the lien for school taxes shall remain a lien as provided for under § 8705 of Title 9, and, unless a period greater than 10 years is provided by a municipality’s charter, the lien for town or municipal taxes shall remain a lien for the period of 10 years from the date prescribed by the charter of the town or city for the delivery of the duplicate of the town or city to the collector thereof and no longer. The collectors, in collecting taxes out of real estate upon which they are a lien under the provisions of § 2901 of this title, shall proceed in the manner prescribed by law for the collection of taxes out of real estate.15 Del. Laws, c. 476;16 Del. Laws, c. 141;19 Del. Laws, c. 556; \n\n20 Del. Laws, Appendix, page 8,,\n\n§\n\n 11; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§§\n\n 1152, 2870;33 Del. Laws, c. 82,\n\n§\n\n 2;40 Del.

Payment of taxes by lienholder; action for collection.Any person having a lien upon any real estate located within the State may pay to the parties entitled thereto any taxes which are by law liens upon or against the real estate. Any person who has paid any such taxes shall be entitled to receive the full amount of such taxes so paid from the owner of the property or properties upon which the taxes were a lien and may proceed in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect the same in a civil action for money paid out and expended for the use of the defendant.15 Del. Laws, c. 476;16 Del. Laws, c. 141; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 2870; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 3351; \n\n25 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2904;§\n\n2905. Action by lienholder to collect tax lien; amount of recovery; affidavit of demand.In any action brought to collect any lien upon real estate located within this State, the lienholder shall obtain in the final judgment in the cause the amount of money paid on account of the taxes levied upon the real estate covered by such lien or liens, provided there is set forth in the affidavit of demand filed in the action an itemized list of the taxes paid, the total amount of the payments, that the taxes were justly and truly due at the time of payment and that attached to the affidavit of demand are original and duplicate tax receipts from the officer to whom such taxes were paid. The affidavit of demand shall be filed as any other affidavit of demand is or shall be required to be filed in such proceeding. If judgment has been obtained prior to the payment of the taxes, then, and in that event, such affidavit of demand shall be filed in the office where such judgment is recorded and the amount thereof shall be noted on all writs issued in execution of such judgment or judgments and shall be collected and paid by the officer to whom such writ of execution is issued before any other part of such judgment is paid except only the costs taxed on the proceedings as shown on the writ and any amount of taxes levied and unpaid which constitute a lien on the real estate.15 Del. Laws, c. 476;16 Del. Laws, c. 141; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 2870; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 3351; \n\n25 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2905;§\n\n2906. Priority of liens of the State and political subdivisions on real estate; extinction of such liens.(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, liens for taxes and other government charges levied and imposed by the State or its political subdivisions, which liens are assessed against real property, shall be equal in status, regardless of the time of assessment of said lien; no such lien shall have priority over any other such lien in the distribution of proceeds of the sale of real estate pursuant to a writ of venditioni exponis, levari facias or any other process or order of any court resulting in a sheriff’s sale. In the event that the proceeds of a sheriff’s sale are insufficient to satisfy all such liens encumbering the property sold, then the State and/or its political subdivisions holding such liens shall share that portion of the proceeds of the sheriff’s sale allotted to such liens on a prorata basis.(b) In the event that real property is sold to the State or any of its political subdivisions pursuant to a writ of venditioni exponas, levari facias or any other process or order of any court resulting in a sheriff’s sale and such writ or process was filed by the entity purchasing the real property, then the liens of the purchasing entity shall have priority over all other liens of the State or its political subdivisions and in the event that the proceeds of the sheriff’s sale are insufficient to satisfy all liens of the State or its political subdivisions encumbering the real estate, the liens of the purchasing entity will be paid to the extent funds are available for such purposes and the remaining funds, if any, shall then be distributed on a prorata basis to other governmental entities having such liens on the real estate sold, in full satisfaction of all such liens.(c) When real property is sold pursuant to a writ of venditioni exponas, levari facias or any other process resulting in a sheriff’s sale, said writ having been filed by the State or any of its political subdivisions, the purchasing party, other than the original owner, shall take the property free and clear of any and all liens on such real property, including liens of the State and/or its political subdivisions whether or not such liens have been fully satisfied from the proceeds of the sale.(d) Except as specifically provided herein, nothing in this section shall be construed as affecting the order or priority of payment of any other liens, charges, costs or other debts against real estate sold at a sheriff’s sale or the effect of such a sheriff’s sale on the quality of title of real estate sold as provided in any other statute or ordinance of this State or its political subdivisions.(e) All liens of the State or any of its political subdivisions encumbering real estate sold at a sheriff’s sale prior to July 10, 1980, and purchased by the State or any of its political subdivisions at such sale are hereby extinguished; provided, however, that such lien existed at the time of said sheriff’s sale.(f) Nothing in this section shall affect the priority of any liens not of the State or any of its political subdivisions which existed of record on or prior to July 10, 1980.62 Del. Laws, c. 374,\n\n§\n\n 2;",
