Application by creditor to compel sale of realty; procedure.A creditor of the decedent may apply to the Court of Chancery of the county wherein the letters were granted to issue a citation to an executor or administrator to appear before it, on a day to be therein mentioned, to show cause why the creditor shall not present a petition to the Court for the purpose mentioned in § 2701 of this title. The citation shall be served at least 10 days before its return. If upon a hearing it appears that there is a deficiency of assets for the payment of the decedent’s debts, and that the creditor will be remediless without the sale of the real estate, or part thereof, then the Court may order the executor or administrator to present such petition to it on or before such date to be fixed by the Court as will enable the notice required by § 2701 of this title to be given.Code 1852,\n\n§§\n\n 1812, 1879, 1880; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§§\n\n 3366, 3418; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§§\n\n 3831, 3878; \n\n12 Del.

Order of sale; realty to be sold.The Court of Chancery may, if it appears that there is a deficiency of personal estate for the payment of the decedent’s debts, order that the executor or administrator shall sell the real estate, or a part thereof to be specified in the order, for the purpose of supplying the deficiency. No more shall be sold than the Court deems sufficient for that purpose, unless the Court considers that the condition of any premises is such that a part thereof, merely sufficient, could not be laid off and sold without injury to the whole, in which case the Court may order the whole or any part of such premises to be sold, as may be deemed best for the parties interested.Code 1852,\n\n§§\n\n 1881, 1882; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 3419; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 3879; \n\n12 Del.

Effect of contribution in advance of sale to payment of debts; contribution to equalize burden after sale.If any devisee, or person holding any part of the real estate, contributes so much as the Court of Chancery adjudges to be devisee’s or other person’s proportionable part towards payment of the outstanding debts, no order shall be made for the sale of the premises owned or held by the devisee or other person. A devisee or other owner of premises which shall be sold pursuant to an order under this chapter may compel contribution to equalize the burden from any other owner if more than devisee’s or other person’s proportionate share towards payment of the debts is raised by the sale.Code 1852,\n\n§\n\n 1886; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 3424; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 3884; \n\n12 Del.

Title of purchaser.The grantee in any deed made in pursuance of this chapter shall take all the estate, title and claim which the decedent, at the time of the decedent’s death, had to the real estate thereby conveyed, either at law or in equity, with the benefit of all acts and matters done after the decedent’s death for perfecting or securing the title, and shall hold the same paramount to all encumbrances created or suffered by, and all right and title of the devisees or heirs of the decedent, and all persons claiming through them, and also discharged from the lien of all judgments against decedent, or the decedent’s executors or administrators, and also of all the mortgages and recognizances entered into or executed by the decedent for the payment of money or interest, absolutely and not dependent on a contingency. But neither the sale nor the deed shall impair or affect the lien of any recognizance or obligation entered into or executed by the decedent with condition for the performance of any official duties, or of any recognizance or mortgage entered into or executed by the decedent with any other condition than for the absolute payment of money, or interest.Code 1852,\n\n§\n\n 1892; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 3426; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 3886; \n\n12 Del.

Application of proceeds of sale; order of payment of debts.The purchase money of a sale, made by authority of this chapter (all just charges to be allowed by the Court of Chancery, being first deducted), shall be applied to outstanding debts against the decedent in the following order:(1)First Class. —To judgments against the decedent, which, before the sale, were liens on the premises sold, and to recognizances and mortgages entered into or executed by the decedent with condition for the payment of money or interest, absolutely, and not dependent on a contingency, and which, before the sale, were liens on the premises sold; such judgments, recognizances and mortgages shall be of equal grade, but shall be preferred in payment according to the legal priority of their lien respectively; and if in an action or proceeding upon a recognizance, obligation or mortgage entered into or executed by the decedent with other condition than for the absolute payment of money or interest (but which was by its own force or legal effect, without judgment thereon, a lien on the premises sold), a sum shall have been assessed or ascertained as payable or recoverable by virtue thereof, and judgment or decree, at the time of the sale, has been thereupon given or pronounced, the sum so assessed or ascertained with the costs shall stand in priority, according to the date of the obligation or recognizance, or of the depositing of the mortgage duly acknowledged or proved in the proper recorder’s office to be recorded, and shall be preferred in payment according to such priority; but in no other case shall the proceeds of such sale be applied or retained for the purpose of being applied to any recognizance, obligation or mortgage entered into or executed by the decedent with other condition than for the absolute payment of money or interest, in preference to, or to the postponement of, any debt outstanding against the decedent.But no debt shall be regarded as within this class unless it was before the sale a lien on the premises sold; a sum assessed or ascertained, as mentioned, under this class, being here understood to be demandable by virtue of the mortgage, recognizance or obligation upon which the action or proceeding was instituted.(2)Second Class. —To other debts outstanding against the decedent, observing the same rule of priority as prescribed by § 2105 of this title.Code 1852,\n\n§§\n\n 1893-1897; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 3427;35 Del.

Disposition of surplus after paying debts.If there is any surplus of the sale, after paying all the debts, it shall belong to the person to whom the premises sold belonged at the time of the sale, who shall have the same proportion, quantity and manner of interest in the surplus, as the person had in the premises sold; and an executor or administrator shall not detain the surplus, or any part of it, on account of any mortgage, obligation or recognizance entered into or executed by the decedent with other condition than for the absolute payment of money or interest and which was a lien on the premises sold.Code 1852,\n\n§\n\n 1898; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 3428; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 3888; \n\n12 Del.

Refund of purchase money when sale not returned or not approved.If the purchase money arising from any sale under this chapter shall be paid to the executor or administrator before the sale is approved, the executor or administrator shall refund the same without delay if such sale is not returned or shall not be approved. If the executor or administrator does not refund the money, it shall be a breach of the condition of the bond prescribed in § 2713 of this title, although the executor or administrator shall have died before the time for returning such sale, for such death shall not excuse the executor or administrator from the strict performance of the executor’s or administrator’s duty.Code 1852,\n\n§\n\n 1902; \n\nCode 1915,\n\n§\n\n 3431; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 3891; \n\n12 Del.
