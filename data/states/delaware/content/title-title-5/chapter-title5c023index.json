In the event the Commissioner determines that multiple consumers have been injured by a licensee, the Commissioner shall cause a notice to be published for the purpose of identifying all relevant claims.(4) The Commissioner may refuse release of an irrevocable letter of credit, following the surrender of a license, up to 2 years after the effective date of such termination of licensure.5 Del.

The licensee shall pay to the Commissioner with such list a license fee of $4.60 for each such location in excess of 1. The fee shall cover the remainder of the calendar year in which license is granted. Thereafter each licensee shall submit a current list together with a renewal application not less than 30 days prior to the expiration of such license and pay a license fee of $230 plus $4.60 for each location on the list submitted. The requirements of this section shall not apply to any agent of a licensee who is exempt from this chapter pursuant to § 2304(a) of this title.

In the event that the licensee shall have filed an irrevocable letter of credit in lieu of a surety bond under § 2309(b) of this title the amount of such letter of credit shall be increased accordingly.

Such activities and practices include, but are not limited to, the use of tactics which mislead the consumer, misrepresent the consumer transaction or any part thereof, or otherwise create false expectations on the part of the consumer.(b) The Commissioner may temporarily suspend any license pending the issuance of a final order as provided in Chapter 101 of Title 29.(c) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, no license shall be revoked or suspended except after notice and an opportunity for the licensee to request a hearing in accordance with Chapter 101 of Title 29.(d) Any licensee may surrender any license by delivering to the Commissioner such license together with written notice that it thereby surrenders such license, but such surrender shall not affect such licensee’s civil or criminal liability for acts committed prior to such surrender.(e) No revocation, suspension or surrender of any license shall impair or affect the obligation of any preexisting lawful contract between the licensee and any person.(f) Every license issued hereunder shall remain in force and effect until the same shall have expired or shall have been surrendered, revoked or suspended in accordance with this chapter, but the Commissioner shall have authority to reinstate a suspended license or to issue a new license to a licensee whose license shall have been revoked if no fact or condition then exists which would have warranted the Commissioner in refusing originally to issue such license under this chapter.(g) Whenever the Commissioner shall revoke or suspend a license issued pursuant to this chapter, the Commissioner shall forthwith execute a written order to that effect. The Commissioner shall forthwith serve the written order upon the licensee. Any such order may be reviewed in the manner provided by Chapter 101 of Title 29.5 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2315;58 Del.
