If the Commissioner determines on the basis of the Commissioner’s investigation that the applicant does not comply with the purposes of this chapter as set forth in the preceding sentence of this section, the Commissioner shall notify the applicant of the denial of the conditional approval of the license stating the reasons therefor in writing.5 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 3208;58 Del. Laws, c. 423;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n3209. License; bond; insurance.(a) Within 30 days after the applicant receives written notice of the conditional approval by the Commissioner of an application for original license as provided in § 3208 hereof, or within such longer period as the Commissioner may authorize, the applicant shall file with the Commissioner a corporate surety bond in the principal sum of $10,000. Such bond shall be in a form satisfactory to the Commissioner and shall be issued by a surety company authorized by the laws of this State to conduct business in this State. The bond shall run to the State and shall be conditioned that the licensee will pay any and all moneys that may become due and owing any claimant or creditor of or against the licensee arising out of the licensee’s business within the State as transporter. The aggregate liability of the surety bond shall, in no event, exceed the amount of the bond. The surety on the bond shall have the right to cancel such bond upon giving 30 days’ written notice to the Commissioner and thereafter shall be relieved of liability for any breach of condition occurring after the effective date of said cancellation. In any event, the bonds shall continue to be in effect as a condition for the continuance or renewal of the license issued hereunder.(b) In lieu of such corporate surety bond the applicant may keep on deposit with any federally insured banking institution or savings and loan association in this State as such applicant shall designate and the Commissioner shall approve, securities, interest-bearing stocks and bonds, notes, debentures, or other obligations of the United States or agency or instrumentality thereof, or guaranteed by the United States or of this State or any subdivision thereof, or dollar deposits, to an aggregate amount, based upon principal amount or market value, whichever is lower, of not less than the amount of the required corporate surety bond. The securities shall be deposited as aforesaid and held to secure the same obligations as would the corporate surety bond, but the depositor shall be entitled to receive all interest and dividends thereon and shall have the right, with the approval of the Commissioner, to substitute other securities for those deposited.(c) In addition to the bond required in subsection (a) of this section, within 30 days after the applicant receives written notice of the conditional approval by the Commissioner of an application for original license as provided in § 3208 hereof or within such longer period as the Commissioner may authorize, the applicant shall file with the State Bank Commissioner true copies of its insurance contracts, including all documents not attached physically to such contracts but which are incorporated into and made a part of such contracts by reference or otherwise, establishing that it has in full force and effect a contract of insurance with a good and reputable insurance company, licensed to do business in this State, an underlying all risk (except for customary war risk and nuclear exclusions) policy in an amount not less than $5,000,000 insuring licensee and/or any persons doing business with, or having a claim against, said licensee arising from any loss through any risk assumed by the licensee in any contract for the transportation, handling or storage of moneys, including lawful currency and coin, negotiable and nonnegotiable securities, stocks, bonds, coupons and things of unusual value. True copies of such insurance contracts and such nonattached documents shall be furnished annually, prior to renewal of the license. The Commissioner may, in the Commissioner’s discretion, upon a showing of good cause, issue a license to an applicant whose insurance contracts (including the nonattached documents incorporated into and made a part of such contracts) show that it has less than $5 million of such all risk coverage if it is established to the Commissioner’s satisfaction that the amount of such applicant’s all risk coverage is adequate, taking into consideration the aggregate value of such money and/or valuables as are being transported or as may be transported by the applicant for all of its customers pursuant to such contracts for transportation, handling or storage; provided, however, that under no circumstances shall a license be issued to any applicant where the amount of its all risk insurance coverage under this subsection is less than $2 million. Each such contract for such transportation, handling or storage shall contain in bold print a verbatim quotation of (i) all conditions precedent to any recovery under, and (ii) all warranties of the licensee relating to coverage under, the licensee’s all risk insurance policies. If the insurance contracts required by this subsection shall lapse or be cancelled, then the State Bank Commissioner, in the Commissioner’s discretion, may, upon 10 days’ notice to the licensee, cancel the license provided for in this chapter, until such time as the required insurance contracts have gone into effect. Insurance companies issuing contracts pursuant to this section shall, within 3 days after giving notice to the licensee that the effect of the contracts have been altered or are no longer in effect, give similar notice to the State Bank Commissioner of such notice to the licensee.(d) A license issued under this chapter shall remain in full force and effect until surrendered, suspended or revoked pursuant to this chapter. In case there is a change in name, but no change in identity or control of the licensee, the Commissioner shall issue without charge an amended license showing the new name. Such license shall not be otherwise transferable or assignable.(e) If the Commissioner shall at any time reasonably determine that the bond or securities of the aforesaid are insecure, deficient in amount, or exhausted in whole or in part, or if the surety on the bond shall have notified the Commissioner of its intention to cancel the bond, the Commissioner shall by written order require the filing of a new or supplemental bond or the depositing of a new or additional securities in order to secure compliance with this chapter, such order to be complied with within 20 days following service thereof upon the licensee.5 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 3209;58 Del. Laws, c. 423;67 Del. Laws, c. 126,\n\n§§\n\n 2-5;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;77 Del. Laws, c. 126,\n\n§\n\n 8;84 Del. Laws, c. 42,\n\n§\n\n76;§\n\n3210. Renewal of license; annual license fee.Every holder of a license or a renewal thereof, as provided for in this section, desiring to continue the transaction of business as provided for in this chapter, shall at least 30 days prior to the expiration of such license or renewal thereof make application to the Commissioner on forms to be provided by the Commissioner for a license renewal. Each licensee shall pay to the Commissioner annually, together with its application for license renewal, a license fee of $200 for the ensuing calendar year. The Commissioner may mandate that applications for renewal shall be treated as new applications if said renewal applications are not on file with the office of the State Bank Commissioner at least 30 days prior to the expiration of such license or renewal thereof. Licensees who have not complied with supervisory letters or who have not paid examination fees when due may be refused license renewal.5 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 3210;58 Del. Laws, c. 423;70 Del. Laws, c. 6,\n\n§\n\n 15;70 Del. Laws, c. 327,\n\n§\n\n 42;§\n\n3211. Agents.A licensee may conduct the licensee’s business at one or more locations within the State and through or by means of such agents as the licensee may from time to time designate or appoint. No license under this chapter shall be required of any agent of a licensee. In order for an agent to be authorized to act for the licensee in this State, the licensee shall have on file with the Commissioner the name and address of the agent and the licensee shall notify the Commissioner within 30 days of the change of name and/or address of an agent or of the termination of any such agent. The requirements of this section shall not apply to any agent of a licensee who is exempt from this chapter pursuant to § 3204(a) of this title.5 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 3211;58 Del. Laws, c. 423;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n3212. Liability of licensee.(a) Each licensee shall be absolutely liable for any loss, damage, destruction or impairment of the money or valuables placed in the licensee’s possession in addition to whatever additional liability shall be imposed upon the licensee by reason of contractual obligations or the laws of this State or any other applicable law.(b) In any action to recover money or valuables delivered to a transporter, the burden of proving the delivery to and the receipt of such money or valuables by the person to whom it was directed to be paid or delivered shall be upon the transporter.5 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 3212;58 Del. Laws, c. 423;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n3213. Suspension, revocation or surrender of license.(a) The Commissioner may revoke any license issued hereunder upon finding that:(1) The licensee has violated any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation made by the Commissioner under and within the authority of this chapter or of any other law, rule or regulation of this State or the United States;(2) Any fact or condition exists which, if it had existed at the time of the original application for such license, would have warranted the Commissioner in refusing originally to issue such license; or(3) The licensee has engaged in business activities or practices inconsistent with its responsibilities under this chapter.(b) The Commissioner may temporarily suspend any license pending the issuance of a final order as provided in Chapter 101 of Title 29.(c) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, no license shall be revoked or suspended except after notice and an opportunity for the licensee to request a hearing in accordance with Chapter 101 of Title 29.(d) Any licensee may surrender any license by delivering to the Commissioner such license together with written notice that it thereby surrenders such license, but such surrender shall not affect such licensee’s civil or criminal liability for acts committed prior to such surrender.(e) No revocation, suspension or surrender of any license shall impair or affect the obligation of any preexisting lawful contract between the licensee and any person.(f) Every license issued hereunder shall remain in full force and effect until the same shall have expired or shall have been surrendered, revoked or suspended in accordance with this chapter, but the Commissioner shall have authority to reinstate a suspended license or issue a new license to a licensee whose license shall have been revoked if no fact or condition then exists which would have warranted the Commissioner in refusing originally to issue such license under this chapter.(g) Whenever the Commissioner shall revoke or suspend a license issued pursuant to this chapter, the Commissioner shall forthwith execute a written order to that effect. The Commissioner shall forthwith serve the written order upon the licensee. Any such order may be reviewed in the manner provided by Chapter 101 of Title 29.5 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 3213;58 Del.
