The right of the exclusive representative shall not apply where the complaint involves matters of personal, embarrassing and confidential nature, and the complainant specifically requests, in writing, that the exclusive representative not be present.(c) Any employee organization which has been certified as an exclusive representative shall have the right to have its dues deducted and collected by the employer from the salaries of those employees, within the bargaining unit, who authorize, in writing, the deduction of said dues. Such authorization is revocable at the employee’s written request, provided that said revocation shall not be effective until the next ensuing August 31 after the employer’s receipt of the written notice. Said deductions shall commence upon the exclusive representative’s written request to the employer. Such right to deduction shall be in force for so long as the employee organization remains the exclusive bargaining representative for the employees in the unit. The public school employer is expressly prohibited from any involvement in the collection of fines, penalties or special assessments levied on members by the exclusive representative.14 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4006;57 Del. Laws, c. 298;63 Del. Laws, c. 333,\n\n§\n\n 1;69 Del. Laws, c. 200,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4005.

A vacancy in the Board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board. Two members of the Board shall, at all times, constitute a quorum, but official orders shall require concurrence of a majority of the Board. Board members shall be eligible for reappointment.(c) Members of the Board shall be knowledgeable in the area of labor relations and shall possess the reputation for integrity and impartiality necessary to protect the public interest.(d) Members shall hold no other public office or employment by the State or other public agency or public employer, or be an officer or employee of any public employee labor organization or any of its affiliates, or represent any public employer or public employee organization or its affiliates; however, this restriction shall not be interpreted to exclude persons who are knowledgeable in employment relations, public administration or labor law so long as they are not actively engaged, other than as a member, in any management or employee organization.(e) The Chair of the Board shall receive a per diem stipend of $110, and each of the other members shall receive a per diem stipend of $100. Each member of the Board shall be reimbursed for actual and necessary travel and subsistence expenses when performing Board business away from that member’s place of residence.(f) The Board shall appoint an Executive Director who shall be the chief administrative officer.

In addition to the performance of administrative duties, the Board may delegate to the Executive Director authority with respect to, but not limited to, bargaining unit determination and representation proceedings, unfair labor practice proceedings, mediation of labor disputes, and binding interest arbitration proceedings. Such delegation shall not limit a party’s right to appeal to the Board. The Executive Director, with such assistance as may be provided by the Attorney General and such additional legal assistance which, from time to time, may be necessary, shall have authority on behalf of the Board, when necessary, to carry out or enforce any action or decision of the Board, to petition any court of competent jurisdiction for any order requiring compliance with the action or decision.(g) The Board may employ such other persons as it may, from time to time, find necessary for the proper performance of its functions within the amounts made available through appropriations therefor, and may prescribe their duties and fix their compensation.(h) To accomplish the objectives and to carry out the duties prescribed in this chapter, the Board shall have the following powers:(1) To issue, amend and rescind such rules and regulations as it deems necessary to carry out this chapter and to prevent any person from engaging in conduct in violation of this chapter. Such rules and regulations shall be adopted in accordance with Chapter 101 of Title 29.(2) To hold hearings, subpoena witnesses, administer oaths and take the testimony or deposition of any person under oath, and in connection therewith, to issue subpoenas requiring the production and examination of any books or papers, including those of the State and/or a board of education relating to any matter pending before it, and to take such other action, including the granting of interim or other relief as may be necessary to discharge its powers and duties.

Laws, c. 333,\n\n§\n\n 1;76 Del. Laws, c. 196,\n\n§§\n\n 6, 7;§\n\n4010. Bargaining unit determination.(a) An employee organization desiring to be certified as the exclusive representative shall file a petition with the Board, accompanied by the uncoerced signatures of at least 30% of the public school employees in the unit claimed to be appropriate, indicating a desire to be represented for the purpose of bargaining collectively with the public employer.(b) If the Board or its duly authorized designee determines that a petition is properly filed and is accompanied by the requisite number of valid signatures, the Board or its designee shall proceed toward defining the appropriate bargaining unit by setting a date for hearing on the matter. If a petition is not properly filed or if it is not accompanied by the requisite number of valid signatures, the Board or its designee shall dismiss the petition.(c) After holding such hearings as it deems necessary the Board shall determine the appropriate bargaining unit. The Board may, by rule, delegate its unit definition authority to 1 or more of its members or to its Executive Director, provided that a unit definition order may be subject to review by the Board at the request of any party or upon the Board’s own motion in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Board.(d) In making its determination as to the appropriate bargaining unit, the Board or its designee shall consider such factors as the similarity of duties, skills and working conditions of the employees involved; the history and extent of the employee organization; the recommendations of the parties involved; the effect of overfragmentation of bargaining units on the efficient administration of government; and such other factors as the Board may deem appropriate. The Board or its designee shall separate supervisory and nonsupervisory employees into separate appropriate bargaining units for all units created subsequent to July 18, 1990. The Board shall include positions commonly referred to as positions for extra-pay-for-extra-responsibility in the professional bargaining unit for the sole purpose of bargaining the salary for these positions and any other provision mutually agreed to by the parties.(e) Procedures for redefining or modifying a unit shall be set forth in the rules and procedures established by the Board.(f) Any bargaining unit designated as appropriate prior to the effective date of this chapter, for which an exclusive representative has been certified, shall so continue without the requirement of a review and possible redesignation until such time as a question concerning appropriateness is properly raised under this chapter. The appropriateness of the unit may be challenged by the public school employer, 30% of the members of the unit, an employee organization, or the Board not more than 180 days nor less than 120 days prior to the expiration of any collective bargaining agreement in effect on the date of the passage of this chapter. The continued appropriateness of any bargaining unit designated as appropriate prior to the effective date of this chapter, for which an exclusive representative is not certified, may be challenged by the public school employer, 30% of the members of the unit, an employee organization, or the Board at any time up until 30 days prior to the holding of an election to determine representation.63 Del. Laws, c. 333,\n\n§\n\n 1;67 Del. Laws, c. 404,\n\n§\n\n 5;70 Del. Laws, c. 425,\n\n§\n\n 352;85 Del. Laws, c. 193,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n4011. Determination and certification of exclusive representative.(a) Any employee organization seeking certification as exclusive representative in a designated appropriate bargaining unit shall file a petition with the Board. The petition must contain the uncoerced signatures of at least 30% of the employees within the designated appropriate bargaining unit. If the designated appropriate bargaining unit is sufficiently similar to the bargaining unit claimed to be appropriate in the petition filed pursuant to § 4010(a) of this title, such that the signatures submitted at that time represent at least 30% of the employees within the designated appropriate bargaining unit, those signatures shall be deemed sufficient for the purpose of this subsection. If the designated bargaining unit is not sufficiently similar to the bargaining unit claimed to be appropriate, the employee organization may continue to rely on the previously submitted uncoerced signatures of the employees who are in the designated bargaining unit and must supplement these signatures with uncoerced signatures of other employees within the designated appropriate bargaining unit, such that the signatures submitted represent at least 30% of the employees within the designated appropriate bargaining unit. No signature shall be considered valid if it was signed more than 12 months prior to the date on which the petition is filed.(b) Where an employee organization has been certified as the exclusive representative, a group of employees within the bargaining unit may file a petition with the Board for decertification of the exclusive bargaining representative. The petition must contain the uncoerced signatures of at least 30% of the employees within the bargaining unit and allege that the employee organization presently certified is no longer the choice of the majority of the employees in the bargaining unit. If a lawful collective bargaining agreement of no more than 3 years’ duration is in effect, no petition shall be entertained unless filed not more than 180 days nor less than 120 days prior to the expiration of such agreement. A decertification petition also may be filed if more than 1 year has elapsed from the date of certification of an exclusive bargaining representative and no collective bargaining agreement has been executed.(c) If the Board determines that a petition is properly supported, timely filed and covers the designated appropriate bargaining unit, the Board shall cause an election of all eligible employees to be held within a reasonable time after the unit determination has been made, in accordance with procedures adopted by the Board, to determine if and by whom the employees wish to be represented. The election ballot shall contain, as choices to be made by the voter, the name of the petitioning or certified employee organization, the name or names of any other employee organization showing written proof of at least 10% representation of the public school employees within the designated appropriate bargaining unit, in accordance with rules and procedures adopted by the Board, and a choice that the public school employee does not desire to be represented by any of the named employee organization or organizations.(d) The employee organization, if any, which receives the majority of the votes cast in an election shall be certified by the Board as the exclusive representative. In any election where there are more than 2 choices on the ballot and none of the choices receives a majority of the votes cast, a run-off election shall be conducted. The ballot in the run-off election shall contain the 2 choices on the original ballot that received the largest number of votes.(e) No election shall be held pursuant to this section within 12 months from the date of a preceding valid election.14 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4004;57 Del. Laws, c. 298;63 Del. Laws, c. 333,\n\n§\n\n 1;85 Del. Laws, c. 193,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n4011A. Majority verification procedure.(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an employee organization may file a petition with the Board requesting certification as the exclusive representative of an appropriate bargaining unit based on a verification that over 50% of the employees in the proposed appropriate bargaining unit wish to be represented by the petitioner. The Board shall require dated representation authorization signatures of affected employees as verification of the employee organization’s claim of status.(b) Upon receipt of an employee organization’s petition, accompanied by employee authorization signatures under this section, the Board shall investigate the petition. If the Board determines that over 50% of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit have provided authorization signatures designating the employee organization specified in the petition as their exclusive representative, the Board may not order an election but shall certify the employee organization.85 Del. Laws, c. 193,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n4012. Employee organizations required to register and submit annual reports.Every employee organization which has or seeks recognition as a representative of public school employees under this chapter shall file with the Board a registration report, signed by its president or other appropriate officer. Such report shall be updated on an annual basis by any organization which continues to have or seeks recognition, shall be in a form prescribed by the Board and shall be accompanied by 2 copies of the employee organization’s constitution and bylaws. All changes or amendments to such constitutions and bylaws shall be promptly reported to the Board.63 Del. Laws, c. 333,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4013. Collective bargaining agreements.(a) Collective bargaining shall commence at least 90 days prior to the expiration date of any current collective bargaining agreement or, in the case of a newly certified exclusive representative, within a reasonable time after certification.(b) Negotiating sessions, including strategy meetings of public school employers, mediation and the deliberative process of binding interest arbitrators and arbitrators, shall be exempt from Chapter 100 of Title 29. Hearings conducted by binding interest arbitrators shall be open to the public.(c) For those terms and conditions that are negotiated pursuant to state law, the public school employer and the exclusive bargaining representative shall negotiate written grievance procedures ending in binding arbitration by means of which bargaining unit employees, through their collective bargaining representatives, may appeal the interpretation or application of any term or terms of an existing collective bargaining agreement. The written grievance procedures shall be included in any agreement entered into between the public school employer and the exclusive bargaining representative, and shall include:(1) A provision to limit binding arbitration to claims that the terms of the collective bargaining agreement have been violated, misinterpreted or misapplied;(2) A provision to prohibit claims relating to the following matters from being processed through binding arbitration:a. Dismissal or nonrenewal of employees covered by Chapter 14 of this title;b. Dismissal or nonrenewal of employees not covered by Chapter 14 of this title, unless the controlling collective bargaining agreement provides that such matters are subject to binding arbitration;c. Delaware law;d. Rules and regulations of the Delaware Department of Education or State Board of Education;e. The content of or conclusions reached in employee observations and evaluations unless the controlling collective bargaining agreement for employees not covered by Chapter 14 of this title provides that such matters are subject to binding arbitration;f. Federal law;g. Rules and regulations of the United States Department of Education;h. Policies of the local school board; andi. Matters beyond the scope of the public school employer’s authority;(3) A provision to select arbitrators by lottery from a panel of qualified arbitrators designated by the Public Employment Relations Board. In designating the panel, the Public Employment Relations Board shall prefer former judges who served on a Delaware constitutional court or on the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, and shall supplement the panel by adding qualified labor arbitrators;(4) A provision to empower the Public Employment Relations Board to administer arbitrations pursuant to regulations adopted by the Public Employment Relations Board;(5) A provision to require that disputes relating to whether a matter is arbitrable be ruled upon by the arbitrator prior to hearing the merits of the dispute, and, if the arbitrator determines that the dispute is arbitrable, a provision to require that the same arbitrator schedule a second hearing to hear the merits of the dispute;(6) A provision to assess against the losing party the arbitrator’s fees and expenses incurred in determining whether a dispute is arbitrable; and(7) A provision to require that the arbitrator’s fees and expenses incurred in deciding the merits of a dispute be evenly divided between the parties.(d) Any contract or agreement reached between a public school district and any exclusive representative organization shall be for a minimum period of 2 years from the effective date of such contract or agreement, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the public school employer and the exclusive representative.(e) No collective bargaining agreement shall be valid or enforceable if its implementation would be inconsistent with any statutory limitation on the public school employer’s funds, spending or budget, or would otherwise be contrary to law.(f) Public school employers shall file with the Board a copy of any agreements that have been negotiated with public school employee representatives following the consummation of negotiations. The Board shall maintain a current file of all such agreements.63 Del. Laws, c. 333,\n\n§\n\n 1;74 Del. Laws, c. 55,\n\n§\n\n 1;76 Del. Laws, c. 196,\n\n§\n\n 3;§\n\n4014. Mediation.(a) If, after a reasonable period of negotiations over the terms of an agreement or after a reasonable time following certification of an exclusive representative, no agreement has been signed, the parties may voluntarily submit to mediation. If, however, no agreement is reached between the parties by 60 days prior to the expiration date of an existing collective bargaining agreement, or, in the case of a newly certified exclusive representative, within 60 days after negotiations have commenced, both parties shall immediately notify the Board of the status of negotiations.(b) If the parties have not voluntarily agreed to enlist the services of a mediator and less than 30 days remain before the expiration date of the existing collective bargaining agreement, or, in the case of a newly certified exclusive representative, more than 90 days have elapsed since negotiations began, the Board must appoint a mediator if so requested by the public school employer or the exclusive bargaining representative. The mediator shall be chosen from a list of qualified persons maintained by the Board and shall be representative of the public.(c) If the labor dispute has not been settled after a reasonable period of mediation, during which both parties have made a good faith effort to settle their differences, the parties jointly or individually may petition the Board in writing to initiate binding interest arbitration. In lieu of a petition, the mediator may inform the Board that further negotiations between the parties, at that time, are unlikely to be productive and recommend that binding interest arbitration be initiated. The public school employer and the exclusive bargaining representative may initiate binding interest arbitration at any time, by mutual agreement.(d) Any costs involved in retaining a mediator to assist the parties in reaching a negotiated agreement shall be paid by the Board.14 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4010;57 Del. Laws, c. 298;63 Del. Laws, c. 333,\n\n§\n\n 1;76 Del. Laws, c. 196,\n\n§\n\n 4;§\n\n4015. Binding interest arbitration.(a) Within 7 working days of receipt of a petition or recommendation to initiate binding interest arbitration, the Board shall make a determination, with or without a formal hearing, as to whether a good faith effort has been made by both parties to resolve their labor dispute through negotiations and mediation and as to whether the initiation of binding interest arbitration would be appropriate and in the public interest.(b) Pursuant to § 4006(f) of this title, the Board shall appoint the Executive Director or the Executive Director’s designee to act as binding interest arbitrator. Such delegation shall not limit a party’s right to appeal to the Board.(c) The binding interest arbitrator shall hold hearings in order to define the area or areas of dispute, to determine facts relating to the dispute and to render a decision on unresolved contract issues. The hearings shall be held at times, dates and places to be established by the binding interest arbitrator in accordance with rules promulgated by the Board. The binding interest arbitrator shall be empowered to administer oaths and issue subpoenas on behalf of the parties to the dispute or on the binding interest arbitrators’ own behalf.(d) The binding interest arbitrator shall make written findings of facts a decision for the resolution of the dispute; provided however, that the decision shall be limited to a determination of which of the parties’ last, best, final offers shall be accepted in its entirety. In arriving at a determination, the binding interest arbitrator shall specify the basis for the binding interest arbitrator’s findings, taking into consideration, in addition to any other relevant factors, the following:(1) The interests and welfare of the public.(2) Comparison of the wages, salaries, benefits, hours and conditions of employment of the employees involved in the binding interest arbitration proceedings with the wages, salaries, benefits, hours and conditions of employment of other employees performing the same or similar services or requiring similar skills under similar working conditions in the same community and in comparable communities and with other employees generally in the same community and in comparable communities.(3) The overall compensation presently received by the employees inclusive of direct wages, salary, vacations, holidays, excused leaves, insurance and pensions, medical and hospitalization benefits, the continuity and stability of employment and all other benefits received.(4) Stipulations of the parties.(5) The lawful authority of the public school employer.(6) The financial ability of the public school employer based on existing revenues, to meet the costs of any proposed settlements; provided that, any enhancement to such financial ability derived from savings experienced by such public school employer as a result of a strike shall not be considered by the binding interest arbitrator.(7) Such other factors not confined to the foregoing which are normally or traditionally taken into consideration in the determination of wages, hours and conditions of employment through voluntary collective bargaining, mediation, binding interest arbitration or otherwise between parties, in public service or in private employment. In making determinations, the binding interest arbitrator shall give due weight to each relevant factor. All of the above factors shall be presumed relevant. If any factor is found not to be relevant, the binding interest arbitrator shall detail in the binding interest arbitrator’s findings the specific reason why that factor is not judged relevant in arriving at the binding interest arbitrator’s determination. With the exception of paragraph (d)(6) of this section, no single factor in subsection, shall be dispositive.(e) Within 30 days after the conclusion of the hearings but not later than 120 days from the day of appointment, the binding interest arbitrator shall serve the binding interest arbitrator’s written determination for resolution of the dispute on the public school employer, the certified exclusive representative and the Board. The decision of the binding interest arbitrator shall become an order of the Board within 5 business days after it has been served on the parties.(f) The cost of binding interest arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties involved in the dispute.(g) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit or otherwise impede a public school employer and certified exclusive representative from continuing to bargain in good faith over terms and conditions of employment or from using the services of a mediator at any time during the conduct of collective bargaining. If, at any point in the impasse proceedings invoked under this chapter, the parties are able to conclude their labor dispute with a voluntarily reached agreement, the Board shall be so notified, and all impasse resolution proceedings shall be forthwith terminated.63 Del. Laws, c. 333,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;76 Del. Laws, c. 196,\n\n§\n\n 5;§\n\n4016. Strikes prohibited.(a) No public school employee shall strike while in the performance of that public school employee’s official duties.(b) No public school employee shall be entitled to any daily pay, wages, reimbursement of expenses, benefits or any consideration in lieu thereof, for the days on which the employee engaged in a strike.(c) Where a public school employee has lost entitlement to any daily pay or other consideration pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, any agreement between such public school employee or employee organization bargaining on such employee’s behalf and a public school employer which provided for the direct or indirect restoration of such entitlement shall be void as against public policy.14 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4011;57 Del. Laws, c. 298;63 Del. Laws, c. 333,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4017. Injunctions.(a) Chancery Court is vested with the authority to hear and determine all actions alleging violation of § 4016 of this title. Suits to enjoin violations of § 4016 of this title will have priority over all matters on the Court’s docket except other emergency matters.(b) Where it appears that any public school employee, group of employees, employee organizations or any officer or agent thereof, threaten or are about to do, or are doing, any act in violation of § 4016 of this title, the public school employer may forthwith apply to the Court of Chancery for an injunction against such violation.(c) If an order of the Court enjoining or restraining a violation of § 4016 of this title does not receive immediate compliance, the public school employer shall apply to the Court for appropriate contempt sanctions against any party in violation of such order. Upon a proper showing that any person or organization has failed to comply with such an order, the Court shall, in addition to any other remedy it deems appropriate, fine such violating party an amount on a daily, weekly or monthly basis without limitation as determined by the Court.(d) In determining an appropriate amount for fines imposed pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the Court shall consider and receive evidence of:(1) The extent and value of services lost due to the violation of § 4016 of this title.(2) Any unfair labor practices committed by either party during the collective bargaining process.(3) The extent of the wilful defiance or resistance to the Court’s order.(4) The impact of the strike on the health, safety and welfare of the public.63 Del. Laws, c. 333,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4018. Status of existing exclusive representative.An employee organization that has been certified as the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit deemed to be appropriate prior to the effective date of this chapter shall so continue without the requirement of an election and certification until such time as a question concerning representation is appropriately raised under this chapter in accordance with § 4011(b) of this title, or until the Board would find the unit not to be appropriate in accordance with § 4010(f) of this title.63 Del. Laws, c. 333,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4019. Fair share fees.(a) If the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement so provide, each nonmember of a bargaining unit shall be required to pay the exclusive representative a fair share fee.(b) To implement fair share fee agreements in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, the exclusive representative shall provide the public school employer with the name of each nonmember who is obligated to pay a fair share fee, the amount of the fee that the nonmember is obligated to pay and a reasonable and lawful schedule for deducting said amount from the salary or wages of such nonmember. The public school employer shall deduct the fee in accordance with said schedule and promptly transmit the amount deducted to the exclusive representative.(c) As a precondition to the collection of fair share fees, the exclusive representative shall establish and maintain a procedure that:(1) Provides nonmembers with an adequate explanation of the basis for the fee;(2) Provides nonmembers with a reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee before an impartial decision maker; and(3) Provides an escrow for the amounts reasonably in dispute while such challenges are pending.A public school employer shall not refuse to carry out its obligations under subsection (b) of this section on the grounds that the exclusive representative has not satisfied its responsibilities under this subsection.(d) Since fair share fees are collected each school year, in order to avoid undue delays in the receipt of, and determination of the validity of, fair share fees, any suit challenging a fair share fee must be filed within 6 months after receipt of the notice described in subsection (c) of this section, or within 6 months after the nonmember exhausts the procedure described in subsection (c) of this section, whichever is later.69 Del. Laws, c. 199,\n\n§\n\n 3;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4020. Bargaining unit information and access.(a) Within 14 calendar days from the date of hire of a bargaining unit employee, a public employer must provide the following contact information of the bargaining unit employee to an exclusive representative in a secure format agreed to by the exclusive representative: name; position; worksite location; employee identification number; home address; home and personal cell phone numbers on file with the public employer; date of hire; and work email address and personal email address on file with the public employer.(b) In January and October of each year, beginning in January 2026, a public employer must provide to an exclusive representative in a secure format agreed to by the exclusive representative the following information for all bargaining unit employees: name; position; worksite location; employee identification number; home address; home and personal cell phone numbers on file with the public employer; date of hire; and work email address and personal email address on file with the public employer.(c) A public employer must allow an exclusive representative to communicate with bargaining unit members using the members’ employer-issued email addresses regarding collective bargaining, the administration of collective bargaining agreements, the investigation of grievances, other workplace-related complaints and issues, and internal matters involving the governance or business of the exclusive representative, consistent with the employer’s generally applicable technology use policies.(d) A public employer must allow an exclusive representative to meet with bargaining unit members in facilities owned or leased by the public employer regarding collective bargaining, the administration of collective bargaining agreements, grievances and other workplace-related complaints and issues, and internal matters involving the governance or business of the exclusive representative, provided the use does not interfere with governmental operations. Meetings conducted in government buildings pursuant to this subsection must not be for the purpose of supporting or opposing any candidate for partisan political office or for the purpose of distributing literature or information regarding partisan elections. An exclusive representative conducting a meeting in a government building or other government facility pursuant to this subsection may be charged for maintenance, security, and other costs related to the use of the government building or facility that would not otherwise be incurred by the government entity.85 Del. Laws, c. 163,\n\n§\n\n1;",
