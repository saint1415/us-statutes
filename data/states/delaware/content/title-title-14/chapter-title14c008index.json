Employees not organized under Chapter 40 of this title shall select their representatives from the membership of their employee groups. For student (where appropriate), parent and community groups, the local board of education shall coordinate the selection of representatives with organizations for each of these groups where they exist.(c) The structured conversations and activities of the District Advisory Committee shall result in a Report and Recommendation to the local board, through a decision-making process it developed to produce as much agreement as practicable, that:(1) They wish to pursue shared decision-making further by developing a district transition plan to implement shared decision-making as a means of pursuing school improvement in the district, identifying the process they recommend for establishing a district transition plan, and determining the composition and roles and responsibilities of the “District Transition Team” to develop the district transition plan; or(2) They recommend that the district not explore shared decision-making further.(d) Each representative of a stakeholder group who participates in the structured conversations and activities of the District Advisory Committee pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall sign the Report and Recommendation pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.

The School Transition Team representatives shall be selected through the same process established by subsection (b) of this section for their respective constituency groups.
