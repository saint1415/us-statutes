Election to invoke chapter.Where this State and 1 or more other states each claims that it was the domicile of a decedent at the time of death and where no judicial determination of domicile for death tax purposes has been made in any of such states, any executor or the taxing official of any such state may elect to invoke this chapter. Such election shall be evidenced by the sending of a notice by registered mail, receipt requested, to the taxing officials of each such state and to each executor, ancillary administrator and interested person. Any executor may reject such election by sending a notice by registered mail, receipt requested, to the taxing officials involved and to all other executors within 40 days after the receipt of such notice of election. If such election is rejected, no further proceedings shall be had under this chapter. If such election is not rejected, the dispute as to the death taxes shall be determined solely as provided in this chapter, and any proceedings that may have been theretofore taken in this State to determine or assess such death taxes in the courts or otherwise shall be annulled and of no effect.43 Del. Laws, c. 5,\n\n§\n\n 2; \n\n30 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1702;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1703. Compromise of death taxes due this State.In any case in which an election is made as provided in § 1702 of this title and not rejected, the Secretary of Finance may enter into a written agreement with the other taxing officials involved and with the executors to accept a certain sum in full payment of any death tax, together with interest and penalties, that may be due this State. Such agreement shall not be effective unless approved by the State Tax Appeal Board. If an agreement cannot be reached and the arbitration proceeding specified in § 1704 of this title is commenced and thereafter an agreement is arrived at, a written agreement may be entered into at any time before the arbitration proceeding is concluded. Upon the filing of such agreement or duplicate thereof with the authority which would have jurisdiction to assess the death tax of this State if the decedent died domiciled in this State, an assessment of the amount of tax agreed upon shall be made, and such assessment shall finally and conclusively fix and determine the amount of death tax due this State.43 Del. Laws, c. 5,\n\n§\n\n 3; \n\n30 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1703;57 Del. Laws, c. 741,\n\n§§\n\n 7A, 7B;§\n\n1704. Arbitration of domicile of decedent.If it shall appear that an agreement cannot be reached as provided in § 1703 of this title, or if 1 year shall have elapsed from the date of the election, the domicile of the decedent at the time of death solely for death tax purposes shall be determined as follows:(1) Where only this State and 1 other state are involved, the Secretary of Finance and the taxing official of such other state shall each appoint a member of a board of arbitration, and the members so appointed shall select the third member of the board. If this State and more than 1 other state are involved, the taxing officials thereof shall agree upon the authorities charged with the duty of administering death tax laws in 3 states not involved, each of which shall appoint a member of the board. The members of the board shall elect a chairperson.(2) Such board shall hold hearings at such places as are deemed necessary, upon reasonable notice to the executors, ancillary administrators, all interested persons and the taxing officials of the states involved, all of whom shall be entitled to be heard.(3) Such board shall have power to administer oaths, take testimony, subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers and documents and issue commissions to take testimony. Subpoenas may be issued by any member of the board. Failure to obey a subpoena may be punished by a judge or justice of any court of record in the same manner as if the subpoena had been issued by such judge or justice or by the court in which such judge or justice functions.(4) Such board shall apply, whenever practicable, the rules of evidence which prevail in federal courts under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure at the time of the hearing.(5) Such board shall, by majority vote, determine the domicile of the decedent at the time of death. Such determination shall be final and conclusive and shall bind this State and all of its judicial and administrative officials on all questions concerning the domicile of the decedent for death tax purposes.(6) The reasonable compensation and expenses of the members of the board and employees thereof shall be agreed upon among such members, the taxing officials of the states involved and the executors. In the event an agreement cannot be reached, such compensation and expenses shall be determined by such taxing officials and, if they cannot agree, by the appropriate probate court of the state determined to be the domicile. Such amount shall be borne by the estate and shall be deemed an administration expense.(7) The determination of such board and the record of its proceeding shall be filed with the authority having jurisdiction to assess the death tax in the state determined to be the domicile of the decedent and with the authorities which would have had jurisdiction to assess the death tax in each of the other states involved if the decedent had been found to be domiciled therein.43 Del.

Penalty and interest for nonpayment of tax.In any case where it is determined by the board of arbitration that the decedent died domiciled in this State, penalties and interest for nonpayment of the tax, between the date of the election and the final determination of the board, shall not exceed 1% per month, or fraction thereof.43 Del.
