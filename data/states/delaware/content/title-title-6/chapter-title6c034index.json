Private rights of action.This chapter does not afford any person or any energy service company a private right of action for damages or rescission of the agreement of sale for the residence, and no such right of action shall be implied from any of its provisions, except that an energy service company may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover removal costs from a homeowner pursuant to § 3403(d) and (b) of this title.
