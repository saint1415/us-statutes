The ordinance or resolution authorizing the bonds may provide that the bonds shall contain a recital that they are issued pursuant to this chapter, which recital shall be conclusive evidence of their validity and of the regularity of their issuance.9 Del.

C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 6707;55 Del. Laws, c. 263;57 Del. Laws, c. 762,\n\n§\n\n 10A;66 Del. Laws, c. 320,\n\n§§\n\n 9, 10;§\n\n6708. Service charges; amount and application; repayment for borrowed funds.(a) If the County issues bonds under this chapter, the county government shall prescribe and collect reasonable service charges for the services and facilities rendered or afforded by the sewerage or water systems, the revenues of which are pledged to the payment of such bonds, and shall revise such service charges from time to time whenever necessary.(b) The service charges prescribed shall be such as will procure revenue at least sufficient to:(1) Pay when due all bonds and interest thereon, for the payment of which such revenue is or shall have been pledged, charged or otherwise encumbered, including reserves therefor; and(2) Provide for all expenses of operation and maintenance of such sewerage or water systems, including reserves therefor.(c) The service charges when collected shall be applied to the payment of the bonds and interest and to the expenses of such operation and maintenance in accordance with the ordinance or resolution authorizing the bonds.(d) The County may borrow funds up to $1,000,000 to pay as due the necessary expenses of the operation and maintenance of any sewer or water system to be repaid from sums received for service charges of each respective sewer or water district.

Laws, c. 320,\n\n§\n\n 11;§\n\n6709. Power to make charges; liability of users; computation of rates.(a) The county government may charge and collect rents, rates, fees or other charges (in this chapter sometimes referred to as “service charges”) for direct or indirect connection with, or the use or services of, any sewerage or water system. Such service charges may be charged to and collected from any person contracting for such connection or use or service, or from the owner or occupant, or both of them, of any real property which directly or indirectly is or has been connected with a sewerage or water system, or from or on which originates or has originated sewerage which directly or indirectly has entered or may enter into a sewerage system, or into which water from a water system may enter directly or indirectly, and the owner or occupant, or both of them, of any such real property shall be liable for and shall pay such service charges to the County at the time when, and place where, the county government by ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation determines that such charges are due and payable.(b) Such service charges shall, as near as the county government deems practicable and equitable, be uniform throughout the area served by the sewerage or water system, and may be based or computed either on the consumption of water on or in connection with the real property, making due allowance for commercial use of water, or on the number and kind of water outlets on or in connection with the real property, or on the number and kind of plumbing or sewerage fixtures or facilities on or in connection with the real property, or on the number of persons residing or working on or otherwise connected or identified with the real property or on a front footage basis, or on other factors determining the type, class and amount of use or service of the sewerage or water system, or on any combination of any such factors.9 Del.

The Docket shall be prepared at the expense of the county government in substantially the same form as the judgment docket for Sussex County, and contain in the back thereof an index according to the name of the owner against which such lien has been assessed. No sewer lien shall be valid unless duly recorded as provided in this section. All sewer liens duly recorded in the Docket shall continue in full force and effect until the liens have been satisfied by payment, and when such liens are satisfied by payment the Prothonotary, acting under the supervision and direction of the county government, shall satisfy the record by entering thereon the date of final payment and the words “satisfied in full.” The Prothonotary, for the use of the county government, shall receive a fee of 50 cents for each satisfaction so entered.9 Del.

The statements shall be delivered to the county government or its designated agent within 10 days after request is made for them, and the county government or its designated agent shall pay the reasonable cost of preparation and delivery of such statements.(b) The occupant of every parcel of property, the sewage from which is disposed of or treated by any sewerage system of the County, of the water for which is supplied by any water system of the County, shall, upon request therefor by the county government or its designated agent, furnish to the county government or its designated agent information as to the amount of water consumed by such occupant or in connection with such parcel and the number and kind of water outlets, and plumbing or sewerage fixtures or facilities on or in connection with such parcel and the number of persons working or residing therein.9 Del.

Discontinuance of water supply for failure to pay service charge.Each city or town or other public corporation owning or operating any water distribution system serving 3 or more parcels of real property in the County, and every other person owning or operating any such system may enter into and perform a contract with the County that it will, upon request by the county government specifying a parcel of real property in the County charged with any unpaid service charge under § 6709 of this title, cause the supply of water from its system to such parcel of real property to be stopped or restricted, as the county government may request, until the service charge and any subsequent service charge charged to such parcel and the interest accrued thereon is fully paid or until the county government directs otherwise. No such city or town or other public corporation or other person shall be liable for any loss, damage or other claim based on or arising out of the stopping or restricting of such supply, and the county government shall pay the reasonable cost of so stopping or restricting such supply and of restoring the same and may agree to indemnify such city or town or public corporation or other person from loss or damage by reason of such stopping or restriction, including loss of profits.9 Del.

Any such contract may be authorized by resolution duly adopted by the county government and may be made with or without consideration and may contain provisions obligating the County or municipality to dispose of and treat all or any part of the sewage originating in such city or town or elsewhere and obligating such city or town to permit the County to dispose of or treat such sewage, either for a specific period of time or for an unlimited time.
