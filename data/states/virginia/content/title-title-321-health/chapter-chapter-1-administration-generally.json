A civil penalty for a Class I violation shall not exceed the lesser of $25 per licensed or certified bed or $1,000 for each day the facility is in violation, beginning on the date the facility was first notified of the violation.\n\n2. A civil penalty for a Class II violation shall not exceed the lesser of $5 per licensed or certified bed or $250 per day for each day the facility is in violation, beginning on the date the facility was first notified of the violation.\n\nIn the event federal law or regulations require a civil penalty in excess of the amounts set forth above for Class I or Class II violations, then the lowest amounts required by such federal law or regulations shall become the maximum civil penalties under this section. The date of notification under this section shall be deemed to be the date of receipt by the facility of written notice of the alleged Class I or Class II violation, which notice shall include specifics of the violation charged and which notice shall be hand delivered or sent by overnight express mail or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.\n\nAll civil penalties received pursuant to this subsection shall be paid into a special fund of the Department for the cost of implementation of this section, to be applied to the protection of the health or property of residents or patients of facilities that the Commissioner or the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services finds in violation, including payment for the costs for relocation of patients, maintenance of temporary management or receivership to operate a facility pending correction of a violation, and for reimbursement to residents or patients of lost personal funds.\n\nB. In addition to the remedies provided in §§ 32.1-27 and 32.1-27.2 and the civil penalties set forth in subsection A, the Commissioner may petition the circuit court for the jurisdiction in which any nursing home or certified nursing facility as defined in § 32.1-123 is located for the appointment of a receiver in accordance with the provisions of this subsection whenever such nursing home or certified nursing facility shall (i) receive official notice from the Commissioner that its license has been or will be revoked or suspended, or that its Medicare or Medicaid certification has been or will be cancelled or revoked; or (ii) receive official notice from the United States Department of Health and Human Services or the Department of Medical Assistance Services that its provider agreement has been or will be revoked, cancelled, terminated or not renewed; or (iii) advise the Department of its intention to close or not to renew its license or Medicare or Medicaid provider agreement less than ninety days in advance; or (iv) operate at any time under conditions which present a major and continuing threat to the health, safety, security, rights or welfare of the patients, including the threat of imminent abandonment by the owner or operator, or a pattern of failure to meet ongoing financial obligations such as the inability to pay for essential food, pharmaceuticals, personnel, or required insurance; and (v) the Department is unable to make adequate and timely arrangements for relocating all patients who are receiving medical assistance under this chapter and Title XIX of the Social Security Act in order to ensure their continued safety and health care.\n\nUpon the filing of a petition for appointment of a receiver, the court shall hold a hearing within ten days, at which time the Department and the owner or operator of the facility may participate and present evidence.

The Commissioner shall not impose any administrative sanctions authorized under this section until regulations are promulgated pursuant to subsection G.\n\nB. The Commissioner shall have authority to annually determine whether or not to impose any sanctions under subsection C for noncompliance with the provisions of regulations promulgated pursuant to subdivision B 32 of § 32.1-127, if the certified nursing facility:\n\n1. Was affected by a declared emergency, or an act of God, that had an impact on the ability to hire or retain staff at levels required under subdivision B 32 of § 32.1-127. To the extent necessary, the Commissioner may review trended employment data for direct care staff, as provided by the certified nursing facility, to determine the effect of such emergencies or acts of God in assessing this criterion. Failure to provide adequate data may remove this criterion from the Commissioner's consideration;\n\n2. Has made a concerted effort to recruit and retain direct care staff as evidenced through position advertisements, interviews, offers, financial incentives, and nonfinancial incentives. The certified nursing facility shall provide such evidence upon request of the Commissioner for consideration. Failure to provide adequate evidence may remove this criterion from the Commissioner's consideration; or\n\n3. Was located in a medically underserved area and such location severely limited the ability of the certified nursing facility to recruit and retain direct care staff despite a concerted effort to recruit and retain direct care staff. The certified nursing facility shall provide evidence upon request of the Commissioner for consideration. Failure to provide adequate evidence may remove this criterion from the Commissioner's consideration.\n\nC. Prior to restricting or prohibiting new admissions to a certified nursing facility, suspending or refusing to renew or reinstate any nursing home license, or revoking any nursing home license issued pursuant to Article 1 (§ 32.1-123 et seq.) of Chapter 5, the Commissioner shall first impose the following iterative administrative sanctions:\n\n1. When a certified nursing facility is not in compliance with subdivision B 32 of § 32.1-127 and the conditions under subsection B do not exist, the Commissioner shall require the submission of an annual corrective action plan by a certified nursing facility and, upon approval of such plan by the Commissioner, compliance with such plan. A corrective action plan shall only articulate strategies to be utilized to increase direct care staffing with the goal of compliance with subdivision B 32 of § 32.1-127 or improvement on the total nurse staffing hours metric, as defined by the Virginia Medicaid Nursing Facility Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) program. The Commissioner shall consider evidence of direct care staff hours provided in addition to the payroll based journal report, if requested by a certified nursing facility, and may or may not impose a corrective action plan under this section. The Commissioner shall consider the following:\n\na. If the annual measurement immediately subsequent to issuance of the corrective action plan shows compliance with subdivision B 32 of § 32.1-127, no additional administrative sanctions are warranted, and the corrective action plan is deemed inactive but shall be retained by the Commissioner pursuant to the Virginia Public Records Act (§ 42.1-76 et seq.); or\n\nb. If the annual measurement immediately subsequent to issuance of the corrective action plan still shows noncompliance with subdivision B 32 of § 32.1-127, but the VBP program, as administered by the Department of Medical Assistance Services, indicates defined improvement on the total nurse staffing hours metric, the Commissioner shall repeat the provisions of subdivision 1; or\n\nc. If the annual measurement immediately subsequent to issuance of the corrective action plan still shows noncompliance with subdivision B 32 of § 32.1-127, and the VBP program, as administered by the Department of Medical Assistance Services, does not indicate defined improvement on the total nurse staffing hours metric, the Commissioner shall repeat the provisions of subdivision 1 and may, under circumstances described, provide additional sanctions under subdivisions 2 and 3;\n\n2. To the extent that any consecutive annual corrective action plan is required and results articulated in subdivision 1 c are obtained a second consecutive time, the Commissioner may impose a monetary penalty of up to $50,000 for each subsequent consecutive annual period in which compliance with subdivision B 32 of § 32.1-127 or defined improvement on the total nurse staffing hours metric under the VBP program is not attained; and\n\n3. To the extent that a certified nursing facility is out of compliance with subdivision B 32 of § 32.1-127 or fails to show defined improvement on the total nurse staffing hours metric under the VBP program after three consecutive corrective action plans, the Commissioner may place the nursing home or certified nursing facility on probation.\n\nD. A certified nursing facility sanctioned by the Commissioner shall retain responsibility for the health, safety, and welfare of any person under its care, including the timely transfer or relocation of such persons as may be deemed necessary by the Commissioner in compliance with state and federal discharge rights and protections for nursing home residents.\n\nE. After deduction of the administrative costs of the Commissioner and the Department in furtherance of this section, any penalties collected under this section shall be paid to the special fund as set forth in § 32.1-27.1.\n\nF. Prior to imposing administrative sanctions, the Commissioner shall provide the facility with reasonable notice. To the extent that sanctions are imposed, the facility shall be entitled to all rights under the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.) and to a de novo appeal to circuit court.\n\nG.

Imposing a civil penalty not to exceed $500 per violation per day, capped at $10,000 for a series of related incidents of noncompliance.

A nursing home sanctioned by the Commissioner pursuant to subsection C shall retain responsibility for the health, safety, and welfare of any person under such nursing home's care, including the timely transfer or relocation of any persons under such nursing home's care as may be deemed necessary by the Commissioner.\n\n1. Prior to imposing sanctions pursuant to subsection C, the Commissioner shall first require the submission of and compliance with a plan of correction. Such plan of correction shall include mandated training for the nursing home's employees, with all costs borne by the facility, when the Commissioner concludes that the lack of training has led directly to noncompliance.\n\n2. Upon expiration of the initial plan of correction, the Commissioner may extend the time period for the plan of correction or may impose sanctions pursuant to subsection C.\n\nE. The Commissioner shall impose a sanction pursuant to subsection C only after the person subject to such disciplinary action is provided reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard within no fewer than 30 days from the day of such notice by the Commissioner's presiding officer in accordance with § 2.2-4019. Such sanction may be in addition to any penalty imposed by law for the violation for which such sanction is imposed.\n\n1. All requests for an opportunity to be heard following a notice of the imposition of such sanction shall be received in writing within 15 days of the date of receipt of such notice.\n\n2. All administrative proceedings under this section shall be separate from the regulatory office of the Department that conducted the inspection, investigation, examination, or review.\n\n3. The adjudication officer shall provide a recommendation to the Commissioner, including findings of fact, conclusions, and appropriate disciplinary action.\n\n4. The Commissioner may affirm, modify, or reverse such recommendation and shall issue a final case decision.\n\n5. Any person aggrieved by the final case decision of the Commissioner to impose disciplinary action is entitled to judicial review in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.).\n\nF. If a nursing home has been sanctioned by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for conduct that also subjects the nursing home to sanctions pursuant to subsection A, the Commissioner shall not issue a sanction under this section. If the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services fail to issue a sanction to a nursing home in the Commonwealth for conduct described in subsection A within 60 days, the Commissioner may issue a sanction under this section if he determines that issuing such sanction is necessary to protect the public health and welfare or the health and safety of the nursing home's clients. In the event the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issue a sanction on a violation for which the Commissioner has issued a sanction pursuant to this section, the sanction issued by the Commissioner shall be nullified with any civil penalty imposed refunded to the nursing home within 60 days.\n\nG. If a license of any nursing home issued pursuant to Chapter 5 (§ 32.1-123 et seq.) is revoked, a new license may be issued by the Commissioner after:\n\n1. Satisfactory evidence is submitted to him that the conditions upon which revocation was based have been corrected; and\n\n2. Proper inspection has been made and compliance with all provisions of Chapter 5 (§ 32.1-123 et seq.) and applicable state and federal laws and regulations hereunder has been obtained.\n\nH.

As used in this section:\n\n\"Cooperative local health budget\" means the total amount of state funds, local matching funds, and estimated self-generated local service revenues allocated to support a local department of health.\n\n\"Estimated self-generated local service revenues\" means the amount of funds projected to be received by a local department of health from fees charged to individuals or third-party payment sources for services and permits.\n\n\"Local matching funds\" means the amount of funds that a county or city shall be required to contribute to the cooperative local health budget for the local health department that serves that county or city.\n\n\"Revenue generation capacity factor\" means the result of a formula that (i) determines a county's or city's revenue capacity relative to the state revenue capacity, (ii) determines a county's or city's median household income relative to the statewide median household income, and (iii) adjusts the amount determined in clause (i) by the amount determined in clause (ii).\n\nB. Funding for local health departments shall consist of such state funds as may be allocated for the operation of the local health department together with local matching funds and estimated self-generated local service revenues, the total amount of which shall constitute the collective local health budget available to a local department of health.\n\nC. The amount of local matching funds a county or city shall be required to contribute to the cooperative local health budget shall be determined by the Department on the basis of the county's or city's revenue generation capacity factor. However, in no case shall the amount of local matching funds required be greater than 45 percent or less than 18 percent of the total amount of the cooperative local health budget for the local health department that serves the county or city, after deducting estimated self-generated local service revenues.\n\nD. The Department shall biennially review the local matching fund amount for each county and city in the Commonwealth and determine whether such amount should be revised as a result of changes to the county's or city's revenue generation capacity factor. The Department shall report the results of such review and any recommendations for changes to a county's or city's local matching fund amount to the Governor and the General Assembly.\n\n2021, Sp. Sess. I, c. 203.",
