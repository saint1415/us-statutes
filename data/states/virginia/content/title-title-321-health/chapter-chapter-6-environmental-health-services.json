Civil penalties collected pursuant to this chapter shall be credited to the Environmental Health Education and Training Fund established pursuant to § 32.1-248.3.\n\nThis schedule of civil penalties shall be uniform for each type of specified violation, and the penalty for any one violation shall be not more than $100 for the initial violation and not more than $150 for each additional violation. Each day during which the violation is found to have existed shall constitute a separate offense. However, specified violations arising from the same operative set of facts shall not be charged more than once in any 10-day period, and a series of specified violations arising from the same operative set of facts shall not result in civil penalties exceeding a total of $3,000. Penalties shall not apply to unoccupied structures which do not contribute to the pollution of public or private water supplies or the contraction or spread of infectious, contagious, or dangerous diseases. The Department may pursue other remedies as provided by law; however, designation of a particular violation for a civil penalty pursuant to this section shall be in lieu of criminal penalties, except for any violation that contributes to or is likely to contribute to the pollution of public or private water supplies or the contraction or spread of infectious, contagious, or dangerous diseases.\n\nThe Department may issue a civil summons ticket as provided by law for a scheduled violation. Any person summoned or issued a ticket for a scheduled violation may make an appearance in person or in writing by mail to the Department prior to the date fixed for trial in court. Any person so appearing may enter a waiver of trial, admit liability, and pay the civil penalty established for the offense charged.\n\nIf a person charged with a scheduled violation does not elect to enter a waiver of trial and admit liability, the violation shall be tried in the general district court with jurisdiction in the same manner and with the same right of appeal as provided for by law. In any trial for a scheduled violation, the Department shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the liability of the alleged violator. An admission of liability or finding of liability under this section shall not be deemed an admission at a criminal proceeding.\n\nThis section shall not be interpreted to allow the imposition of civil penalties for activities related to land development.\n\nK. The Department shall establish procedures for requiring a survey plat as part of an application for a permit or letter for any onsite sewage or alternative discharging sewage system, and for granting waivers for such requirements. In all cases, it shall be the landowner's responsibility to ensure that the system is properly located as permitted.\n\nL.

The Fund may also be used, in the discretion of the Board, to support the program for training and recognition of licensed onsite soil evaluators and to provide grants and loans to property owners with income at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty guidelines to repair failing onsite sewage systems or install onsite sewage systems on properties that lack adequate sewage disposal. No expenses shall be paid from the Fund to support the program for training and recognition of onsite soil evaluators, or to provide any grant or loan to repair a failing onsite sewage system or install an onsite sewage system on any property that lacks adequate sewage disposal, in lieu of payment to any owner or owners qualified to receive payment from the Fund pursuant to this chapter.\n\nB. Ten dollars of each fee collected by the Department of Health pursuant to subsections C and E of § 32.1-164 shall be deposited by the Comptroller in the Fund to be appropriated for the purposes of this section to the Department of Health by the General Assembly as it deems necessary.\n\nC. The owner of an onsite sewage system that has been permitted by the Department of Health may cause, by filing a request for payment from the Fund within one year from the date the system or components thereof failed, the Commissioner to review the circumstances of the onsite sewage system failure, if the onsite sewage system has failed within three years of construction. Upon the Commissioner's finding that the onsite sewage system was permitted by the Department and (i) the system or components thereof failed within three years of construction; (ii) that specific actions of the Department were negligent and that those actions caused the failure; and (iii) that the owner filed a request for payment from the Fund within one year from the date the system or components thereof failed, the Commissioner shall, subject to the limitations stated herein, reimburse the owner for the reasonable cost of following the Board's regulations to repair or replace the failed onsite sewage system or components thereof.\n\nD. Prior to receiving payment from the Fund, the owner shall follow the requirements in the Board's regulations to repair or replace the failed onsite sewage system or components thereof.\n\nE. The total amount an owner may receive in payment from the Fund shall not exceed $30,000. Only the costs of the system that failed or the costs of labor and equipment required to repair or replace the failed onsite sewage system or components thereof are reimbursable by the Fund.\n\nF. If the Commissioner finds that the system was permitted by the Department and has failed within three years of construction and that the failure resulted from faulty construction or other private party error, the Commissioner may assist the owner of the failed system in seeking redress from the system's builder or other private party.\n\nG. Every request for payment from the Fund shall be forever barred unless the owner has filed a complete application as required by the Department. The request shall be filed with the Commissioner within one year from the date that the onsite sewage system or components thereof first failed. However, if the owner was under a disability at the time the cause of action accrued, the tolling provisions of § 8.01-229 shall apply. The owner shall mail the request for payment from the Fund via the United States Postal Service by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the Commissioner.\n\nIn any action contesting the filing of the request for payment from the Fund, the burden of proof shall be on the owner to establish mailing and receipt of the notice in conformity with this section. The signed receipt indicating delivery to the Commissioner, when admitted into evidence, shall be prima facie evidence of filing of the request for payment from the Fund under this section. The request for payment from the Fund shall be deemed to be timely filed if it is sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, and if the official receipt shows that the mailing was within the prescribed time limits.\n\nNotwithstanding any provision of this article, the liability for any payment from the Fund shall be conditioned upon the execution by the owner of a release approved by the Attorney General of all claims against the Commonwealth, its political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities and against any officer or employee of the Commonwealth in connection with or arising out of the occurrence complained of.\n\nH. The Commissioner and the Attorney General shall cooperatively develop an actuarially sound program and policy for identifying, evaluating, and processing requests for payment from the Fund.\n\nI. If the Commissioner refuses the request for payment from the Fund, the owner may appeal the refusal to the State Health Department Sewage Handling and Disposal Appeal Review Board.\n\nThe Board may promulgate regulations pursuant to the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.) for the administration of the Fund consistent with this chapter.\n\nIn the event the Fund is insufficient to meet requests for payment from the Fund, this section and the creation of the Fund shall not be construed to provide liability on the part of the Department or any of its personnel where no such liability existed prior to July 1, 1994.\n\n1994, c. 747; 2007, cc. 448, 515; 2016, c. 90; 2021, Sp.

In determining whether to approve a remote monitoring plan for multiple waterworks or treatment facilities, the Department may consider the number of waterworks or treatment facilities the remote operator is monitoring simultaneously, whether the multiple facilities being monitored remotely are under common ownership, whether the remote operator is employed by the owner of multiple facilities, and whether occasional in-person attendance is provided, among other factors. The Department may cease crediting remote monitoring if the Department finds that continued operation pursuant to the remote monitoring plan presents a public health threat due to statutory, regulatory, or permit violations. The Department shall not credit remote monitoring by an operator without the appropriate license class who is operating the waterworks or treatment facility pursuant to a temporary waiver issued under subsection A.\n\nC.

The regulations shall (i) describe the conditions under which gray water and rainwater may appropriately be used and for what purposes; (ii) include categories of gray water, such as types of used household water and used water from businesses, that are appropriate for reuse; and (iii) include a definition of gray water that excludes used toilet water. The regulations shall also provide standards for the use of rainwater harvesting systems, including systems that collect rainwater for use by commercial enterprises but do not provide water for human consumption, as defined in § 32.1-167.\n\nSuch regulations shall not apply to water not for human consumption, as defined in § 32.1-167, including gray water and rainwater, that is produced and utilized by any facility that is permitted through a Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit or General Virginia Pollution Abatement permit.\n\nB. The Department, in conjunction with the Department of Environmental Quality, shall promote the use of rainwater and reuse of gray water as means to reduce fresh water consumption, ease demands on public treatment works and water supply systems, and promote conservation.\n\nC. The Department, in conjunction with the Department of Environmental Quality, shall consider recognizing rainwater as an independent source of fresh water available for use by the residents of the Commonwealth.\n\nD. Existing local ordinances adopted prior to July 1, 2025, governing rainwater harvesting systems shall continue in force; however, in the event of a conflict between a Board regulation and a local ordinance adopted prior to July 1, 2025, the Board regulation shall govern, except when the conflicting local ordinance is more stringent. No locality shall adopt any local ordinance requiring owners of Tier 4 rainwater harvesting systems, as that term is described in the Rainwater Harvesting System Regulations (12VAC5-635), to connect to any municipal water supply or impose any penalty, including condemnation proceedings, on such owner for failing to connect to a municipal water supply. For purposes of this subsection \"rainwater harvesting system\" means a water system for collecting, storing, potentially treating, and distributing rainwater for the use of water from such system.\n\n1998, c. 155; 2018, c. 817; 2025, c. 358.",

In taking such steps, the Department shall:\n\n1. Accept private evaluations and designs for private wells, in compliance with the State Board of Health regulations for construction of private wells, designed and certified by a certified master water well system provider pursuant to § 54.1-1129.1;\n\n2. Cease providing onsite sewage system evaluations and design services that are not associated with a building permit or the repair of a failing sewage system. Hardship exceptions shall not apply to these services;\n\n3. Cease providing new construction evaluation and design services for an application that is not for a principal place of residence. Hardship exceptions shall not apply to these services;\n\n4. By July 1, 2019, establish guidelines to maintain the Department as a provider of last resort for a property owner who demonstrates a specific hardship in obtaining private sector evaluation and design services associated with a building permit or the repair of a failing sewage system that is for a principal place of residence. In developing such guidelines, the Department shall solicit and consider input from stakeholders. The Department's guidelines shall include considerations for hardships based on (i) the availability of properly licensed service providers working within a locality or region, (ii) the disciplinary history of private sector providers, and (iii) the cost of private sector services. The Department shall post its proposed guidelines on a website maintained by the Department by November 1, 2018; and\n\n5. Beginning July 1, 2019, require an applicant for an onsite sewage system or private well construction permit who desires the Department to provide evaluation and design services associated with a building permit or the repair of a failing sewage system that is for a principal place of residence to petition the Department to provide such evaluation and design services.\n\nB. The Department shall coordinate with the Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation to establish any necessary agreements or procedures to ensure that potential violations of laws or regulations regarding onsite sewage system and private well evaluation and design are referred to the appropriate agency or board for review.\n\n2018, c. 831.",
