      "text": "A. The Department of Medical Assistance Services shall amend the Virginia Children's Medical Security Insurance Plan to be renamed the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security (FAMIS) Plan. The Department of Medical Assistance Services shall provide coverage under the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan for individuals under the age of 19 when such individuals (i) have family incomes at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level or were enrolled on the date of federal approval of Virginia's FAMIS Plan in the Children's Medical Security Insurance Plan (CMSIP); such individuals shall continue to be enrolled in FAMIS for so long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements of CMSIP; (ii) are not eligible for medical assistance services pursuant to Title XIX of the Social Security Act, as amended; (iii) are not covered under a group health plan or under health insurance coverage, as defined in § 2791 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. § 300gg-91 (a) and (b)(1)); and (iv) meet both the requirements of Title XXI of the Social Security Act, as amended, and the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan. Eligible children, residing in Virginia, whose family income does not exceed 200 percent of the federal poverty level during the enrollment period shall receive 12 continuous months of coverage as permitted by Title XXI of the Social Security Act.\n\nB. The Department of Medical Assistance Services shall also provide coverage for children and pregnant women who meet the criteria set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) of subsection A during the first five years of lawful residence in the United States, pursuant to § 214 of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-3).\n\nC. Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan participants shall participate in cost-sharing to the extent allowed under Title XXI of the Social Security Act, as amended, and as set forth in the Virginia Plan for Title XXI of the Social Security Act. The annual aggregate cost-sharing for all eligible children in a family above 150 percent of the federal poverty level shall not exceed five percent of the family's gross income or as allowed by federal law and regulations. The annual aggregate cost-sharing for all eligible children in a family at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty level shall not exceed 2.5 percent of the family's gross income. The nominal copayments for all eligible children in a family shall not be less than those in effect on January 1, 2003. Cost-sharing shall not be required for well-child and preventive services including age-appropriate child immunizations.\n\nD. The Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan shall provide comprehensive health care benefits to program participants, including well-child and preventive services, to the extent required to comply with federal requirements of Title XXI of the Social Security Act. These benefits shall include comprehensive medical, dental, vision, mental health, and substance abuse services, and physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, and skilled nursing services for special education students. The medical services required to be provided herein shall include dispensing or furnishing of up to a 12-month supply of hormonal contraceptives at one time, in accordance with subdivision A 27 of § 32.1-325. The mental health services required herein shall include intensive in-home services, case management services, day treatment, and 24-hour emergency response. The services shall be provided in the same manner and with the same coverage and service limitations as they are provided to children under the State Plan for Medical Assistance Services.\n\nE. The Virginia Plan for Title XXI of the Social Security Act shall include a provision that participants in the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan who have access to employer-sponsored health insurance coverage, as defined in § 32.1-351.1, may, but shall not be required to, enroll in an employer's health plan, and the Department of Medical Assistance Services or its designee shall make premium payments to such employer's plan on behalf of eligible participants if the Department of Medical Assistance Services or its designee determines that such enrollment is cost-effective, as defined in § 32.1-351.1.\n\nF. The Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan shall ensure that coverage under this program does not substitute for private health insurance coverage.\n\nG. The health care benefits provided under the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan shall be through existing Department of Medical Assistance Services' contracts with health maintenance organizations and other providers, or through new contracts with health maintenance organizations, health insurance plans, other similarly licensed entities, or other entities as deemed appropriate by the Department of Medical Assistance Services, or through employer-sponsored health insurance. All eligible individuals, insofar as feasible, shall be enrolled in health maintenance organizations.\n\nH. The Department of Medical Assistance Services may establish a centralized processing site for the administration of the program to include responding to inquiries, distributing applications and program information, and receiving and processing applications. The Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan shall include a provision allowing a child's application to be filed by a parent, legal guardian, authorized representative or any other adult caretaker relative with whom the child lives. The Department of Medical Assistance Services may contract with third-party administrators to provide any additional administrative services. Duties of the third-party administrators may include, but shall not be limited to, enrollment, outreach, eligibility determination, data collection, premium payment and collection, financial oversight and reporting, and such other services necessary for the administration of the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan. Any centralized processing site shall determine a child's eligibility for either Title XIX or Title XXI and shall enroll eligible children in Title XIX or Title XXI. A single application form shall be used to determine eligibility for Title XIX or Title XXI of the Social Security Act, as amended, and outreach, enrollment, re-enrollment and services delivery shall be coordinated with the FAMIS Plus program pursuant to § 32.1-325. In the event that an application is denied, the applicant shall be notified of any services available in his locality that can be accessed by contacting the local department of social services.\n\nI. The Virginia Plan for Title XXI of the Social Security Act, as amended, shall include a provision that, in addition to any centralized processing site, local social services agencies shall provide and accept applications for the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan and shall assist families in the completion of applications. Contracting health plans, providers, and others may also provide applications for the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan and may assist families in completion of the applications.\n\nJ. The Department of Medical Assistance Services shall develop and submit to the federal Secretary of Health and Human Services an amended Title XXI plan for the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan and may revise such plan as may be necessary. Such plan and any subsequent revisions shall comply with the requirements of federal law, this chapter, and any conditions set forth in the appropriation act. In addition, the plan shall provide for coordinated implementation of publicity, enrollment, and service delivery with existing local programs throughout the Commonwealth that provide health care services, educational services, and case management services to children. In developing and revising the plan, the Department of Medical Assistance Services shall advise and consult with the Joint Commission on Health Care.\n\nK. Funding for the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan shall be provided through state and federal appropriations and shall include appropriations of any funds that may be generated through the Virginia Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan Trust Fund.\n\nL. The Board of Medical Assistance Services, or the Director, as the case may be, shall adopt, promulgate, and enforce such regulations pursuant to the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.) as may be necessary for the implementation and administration of the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan.\n\nM. Children enrolled in the Virginia Plan for Title XXI of the Social Security Act prior to implementation of these amendments shall continue their eligibility under the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan and shall be given reasonable notice of any changes in their benefit packages. Continuing eligibility in the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan for children enrolled in the Virginia Plan for Title XXI of the Social Security Act prior to implementation of these amendments shall be determined in accordance with their regularly scheduled review dates or pursuant to changes in income status. Families may select among the options available pursuant to subsections D and F of this section.\n\nN. The provisions of Chapter 9 (§ 32.1-310 et seq.) of this title relating to the regulation of medical assistance shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan.\n\nO. In addition, in any case in which any provision set forth in Title 38.2 excludes, exempts or does not apply to the Virginia plan for medical assistance services established pursuant to Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq. (Medicaid), such exclusion, exemption or carve out of application to Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid) shall be deemed to subsume and thus to include the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security (FAMIS) Plan, established pursuant to Title XXI of the Social Security Act, upon approval of FAMIS by the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services as Virginia's State Children's Health Insurance Program.\n\n1997, c. 679; 1999, c. 1034; 2000, cc. 824, 848; 2001, cc. 238, 735, 756; 2002, c. 640; 2003, cc. 66, 71, 521; 2005, c. 584; 2006, c. 428; 2007, c. 407; 2012, cc. 646, 689; 2014, cc. 9, 183; 2021, Sp.

For purposes of this chapter, \"employer-sponsored health insurance\" or \"ESHI\" means comprehensive health insurance offered by the employer when the employer contributes to the cost of dependent or family coverage as defined in the Virginia Plan for Title XXI of the Social Security Act, or as otherwise approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nB. For purposes of this chapter, ESHI shall be deemed cost-effective when the payment by the Department of Medical Assistance Services for health insurance coverage of the enrollee or enrollees under the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan shall be no greater than what would have otherwise been paid by the Department or its designee for the enrollee or enrollees.\n\nC. If a family chooses to participate in ESHI and ESHI is deemed cost-effective, the Department of Medical Assistance Services shall contribute to the cost of ESHI for eligible dependent children for those program participants that have access to ESHI. Participants receiving ESHI under the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan shall apply for the full premium contribution available from the employer. Those eligible for Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan with access to ESHI may enroll in their designated ESHI at the first available opportunity and shall be covered under the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security Plan until coverage under ESHI becomes available.\n\n2000, cc. 824, 848; 2003, c. 513; 2009, c. 578.",
